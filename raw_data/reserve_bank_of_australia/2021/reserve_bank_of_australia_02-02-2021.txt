Members commenced their discussion of international economic developments by noting that the outlook
					for the global economy had improved following the successful development and early stage rollout of
					COVID-19 vaccines. Fiscal and monetary policy settings remained highly
					expansionary and in some economies additional fiscal stimulus was in prospect. Growth forecasts for the
					global economy and Australia's major trading partners had been revised a little higher as a
					result. However, the brighter outlook did not change members' assessment that the global recovery
					was still likely to be bumpy and uneven, with most economies expected to be well short of their
					pre-pandemic trajectories at the end of the forecast period. Labour markets were therefore likely to
					have considerable spare capacity for some time, resulting in subdued inflationary pressures. The spread
					of the virus and the speed of vaccine distribution remained key determinants of the outlook.
Members noted that the global recovery had lost some momentum around the turn of the year as
					restrictions on mobility in some economies were tightened following a resurgence of COVID-19 infections. This continued a pattern observed in the preceding year of
					highly variable growth outcomes across economies. China and some other economies in east Asia had
					experienced relatively strong recoveries, with GDP in the current year likely to be tracking at levels
					expected before the pandemic. Favourable health outcomes and a surge in manufactured goods exports had
					contributed to this. Many economies were expected to have recovered their pre-pandemic levels of GDP by
					the end of the year, but still be short of levels expected prior to the onset of the pandemic. In a
					smaller number of economies, including some in Europe that had experienced severe health outcomes, GDP
					was expected to still be below pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2021.
Members noted that the strength of the global demand for goods, the faster-than-expected recovery in
					global economic activity and the improved outlook had contributed to a strong rebound in commodity and
					other key input prices. Oil prices had recovered much of their decline early in the pandemic, while
					base metals prices were above pre-pandemic levels. Iron ore prices had also risen further in recent
					months, to trade at their highest levels in many years. High iron ore prices had been supported by
					ongoing supply disruptions in Brazil and strong demand from Chinese steel producers. The higher
					commodity prices had supported a marked rise in Australia's terms of trade, which was expected to
					reach its highest level in nearly a decade in the March quarter. Members also noted that other
					important global input prices, such as those for semiconductors, had risen above levels prevailing
					before the pandemic, reflecting strong global demand for electronics and other goods that use
					semiconductors as inputs.
Members noted that several vaccines had already been approved for use internationally, and that more
					were likely to be available in the near future. Some countries, including those with well-functioning
					public health systems and ample initial vaccine supplies, had been able to meet or exceed their early
					targets for the rollout of their vaccine programs, while other countries had fallen short of their
					targets. Distributing and administering vaccines on such a large scale and under intense time pressure
					was presenting significant logistical and administrative challenges for many countries.
In concluding their discussion of the international economy, members discussed the significant fiscal
				responses to the pandemic. Additional fiscal support had been announced in a number of economies that
				were affected by second or third waves of infections. The wide variation in public debt levels prior to
				the pandemic, and in health outcomes over the preceding year, helped to explain some of the
				cross-country differences in fiscal responses.
Turning to the domestic economy, members noted that the recovery in the second half of 2020 had been
					faster than initially expected, in line with the pattern observed internationally. Favourable health
					outcomes in Australia had enabled the lifting of restrictions and boosted activity. Consumption had
					rebounded quickly as health-related restrictions on activity had been eased, suggesting that
					supply-side constraints were key to driving the spending patterns observed during the pandemic;
					households had also adapted their consumption habits. Business investment had fallen, but by less than
					expected. More broadly, the rapid bounce-back in domestic activity had also been supported by
					additional fiscal measures announced by the Australian and state governments in the latter part of
					2020. This had enabled a faster recovery in labour market conditions than expected a few months
					earlier, with the unemployment rate in the December quarter declining more quickly than even the upside
					scenario presented in the November 2020 Statement on Monetary Policy.
In discussing the outlook for activity and the labour market, members noted that the forecasts under
				the baseline scenario had been upgraded relative to 3 months earlier. This upward revision
				incorporated the stronger starting point for the forecasts and improved outlook. GDP and employment were
				now expected to reach their pre-pandemic levels over the course of 2021, around 6–12 months
				earlier than previously expected.
Members noted that the lowest rate of population growth since the First World War would continue to
				have a significant bearing on the outlook. The level of GDP was not expected to return to its previous
				trajectory over the forecast period, largely because population growth would be so much lower than
				assumed prior to the pandemic. Lower population growth would continue to weigh on both aggregate demand
				and labour supply in the period ahead, although the effects on labour supply and wages would be partly
				limited by foreign students tending to have a lower participation rate than the domestic working-age
				population. Low population growth, reflecting reduced net overseas migration in particular, was also
				expected to affect high-density residential investment for some time to come. Members noted that overall
				dwelling investment would have been lower had the HomeBuilder program and other state government
				incentives been less effective in stimulating activity in the detached housing sector.
In their discussion of the labour market, members observed that, in contrast to expectations
				3 months earlier, the peak in the unemployment rate had probably already occurred. Notwithstanding
				a swift rebound in the participation rate, the firmer outlook for employment had resulted in a lower
				expected unemployment rate profile across the forecast period. Despite the end of the JobKeeper program
				in March creating some uncertainty for near-term labour market outcomes, the unemployment rate was
				expected to resume trending lower in the second half of the year. In the baseline scenario, the
				unemployment rate was expected to decline to around 6 per cent by the end of 2021, before
				reaching around 5¼ per cent by mid 2023. While the strong recovery and improved
				outlook for employment had reduced the prospects for substantial scarring effects in the labour market,
				the forecasts implied that there would still be spare capacity in the labour market at the end of the
				forecast period.
Members commenced their discussion of the household sector by noting that the rebound in consumption in
				the second half of 2020 had been supported by very strong growth in disposable income over the year. As
				temporary income support measures tapered or ceased, household income was expected to decline through to
				the middle of 2021, before resuming steady growth in line with recovery in the labour market. In the
				baseline scenario, consumption growth was expected to remain positive but moderate in the period ahead;
				in per capita terms, the level of consumption had rebounded strongly and, by 2022, was forecast to have
				returned to levels expected prior to the pandemic. The outlook for consumption was supported by many
				households strengthening their balance sheet and liquidity positions during the pandemic. Restrictions
				on consumption, precautionary behaviour and strong growth in incomes had contributed to households
				adding considerably to savings during the June and September quarters of 2020. Members noted the
				significant uncertainty around whether and how quickly the savings ratio would return to more typical
				levels, and how households would use the additional savings accumulated during 2020.
Members observed that conditions in the housing market had been more resilient than expected, which had
				assisted the economic recovery. Housing prices had recently been rising across most of Australia
				following an earlier period where conditions had been quite variable. This had returned the national
				housing price index to levels reached around 4 years earlier. Housing price increases had been
				larger in regional Australia than in the capital cities; price levels in some smaller capital cities had
				increased to new highs. Members noted that there were few signs of a deterioration in lending standards;
				however, lending standards would be monitored closely in the period ahead.
In their discussion of the outlook for wages growth and inflation, members noted that the forecasts
				under the baseline scenario had increased a little relative to 3 months earlier, in line with the
				lower expected unemployment rate. However, both wages growth and underlying inflation were expected to
				remain below 2 per cent over the forecast period, reflecting ongoing spare capacity in the
				economy.
Members observed that wages growth had been subdued for a number of years and had recently declined
				further, to the lowest levels in at least 2 decades. Firms had responded quickly in the early
				stages of the pandemic by delaying wage increases, imposing wage freezes and, in some cases, applying
				temporary wage cuts. Liaison contacts had suggested it could be some time before wage freezes were
				lifted. The improved outlook for activity and employment was expected to lift private sector wages
				growth a little over the forecast period. However, this was partly offset by the downward revision to
				the outlook for public sector wages growth, as some state governments had announced measures to cap
				wages growth at rates below those seen in recent years.
Turning to the outlook for inflation, members noted that underlying inflation pressures were subdued
				and expected to remain so in the period ahead. Although the outlook for underlying inflation had been
				revised up a little relative to 3 months earlier, ongoing spare capacity and low wages growth were
				expected to keep underlying inflation below 2 per cent over the forecast period. Members
				recalled the domestic and international experience prior to the pandemic, which suggested that a
				sustained period of labour market tightness would be needed to generate the faster wages growth required
				to see inflation return to the 2 to 3 per cent target range. Headline year-ended
				inflation was expected to increase temporarily to around 3 per cent in the June quarter 2021,
				largely reflecting swings in the prices of child care, automotive fuel and some other administered
				prices. It was then forecast to fall back below 2 per cent by the end of the year and stay
				below 2 per cent over the remainder of the forecast period.
Given the high degree of uncertainty around the outlook, members considered 2 plausible
				alternative scenarios around the baseline forecast. In the baseline forecast, no further significant
				outbreaks of the virus were assumed to occur in Australia, although there could be some smaller
				outbreaks on the scale seen in recent months. Restrictions on domestic activity were assumed to be eased
				over the course of the year. Australia's international borders were assumed to remain closed until
				at least the end of the year.
A downside scenario was considered by members, where further large outbreaks of the virus required the
				reimposition of restrictions on activity, although not the extended lockdowns contemplated in previous
				downside scenarios. Weaker activity would see the unemployment rate remain around
				6¾ per cent for most of 2021 and then decline only gradually thereafter. The larger
				degree of spare capacity in the labour market would be expected to place further downward pressure on
				wages growth and keep inflation trending lower until mid 2022.
A plausible upside scenario was also discussed by members, which assumed that a run of positive health
				outcomes domestically and abroad enabled a faster easing of restrictions on activity. This would boost
				household and business confidence and, with it, private spending and investment. The stronger profile
				for activity in this scenario would lead to a faster decline in the unemployment rate, which would fall
				to below 5 per cent by the end of 2022. Inflation would also rise a little faster in this
				scenario, but even still it would approach 2 per cent only by the end of the forecast
				period.
Members noted that global financial market conditions had remained very accommodative and monetary
				stimulus was expected to remain in place for some time. In the advanced economies, several central
				banks, including the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and Sweden's
				Riksbank, had recently indicated that they would increase the size and/or extend the timeframe of their
				asset purchase programs. A number of central banks had also introduced lending facilities or enhanced
				existing facilities to support the flow of credit to the real economy. Members observed that the size of
				the Bank's balance sheet relative to GDP remained lower than that of most other advanced economy
				central banks.
Long-term government bond yields had increased over the preceding couple of months in most advanced
				economies, reflecting the upgraded growth outlook related to the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines and expected fiscal stimulus measures, notably in the United
				States. Much of the increase in bond yields had reflected an increase in the compensation for inflation
				sought by investors. Members observed that government borrowing costs had remained low across advanced
				economies and issuance had continued to be met by strong demand.
Corporate funding conditions had also remained highly accommodative and borrowing costs had remained
				around record lows. Investor confidence had been buoyed by the rollout of vaccines, new fiscal stimulus
				measures and sustained monetary stimulus, despite the challenges of rising COVID-19 cases in some countries. Credit spreads had narrowed further and equity
				prices had increased. US equity prices had increased by more than in many other countries, partly
				reflecting the higher share of technology-related stocks in US equity indices.
The US dollar had depreciated further in response to the improvement in the medium-term global
				growth outlook. Commodity prices had also increased against this backdrop and the Australian dollar had
				appreciated back to around 2018 levels in trade-weighted terms. Members observed that, nonetheless, the
				additional monetary policy stimulus as a result of the Bank's package of policy measures announced
				in November 2020 had contributed to the Australian dollar being noticeably lower than it would have been
				otherwise.
In Australia, the Bank's package of policy measures announced in November 2020 had led to a
					further easing of financial conditions. The cash rate had declined to 3 basis points and other
					short-term money market rates had also declined to be close to zero.
The 3-year Australian Government bond yield had been at the target of around 10 basis points,
					supported by bond purchases on several occasions in mid November and early December. The Bank was
					halfway through the $100 billion bond purchase program. While longer-dated Australian Government
					bond yields had increased since early December, this largely reflected international developments and
					the yield differential to US Treasuries had been broadly stable over that period. Staff estimates
					suggested that longer-term Australian Government bond yields were around 30 basis points lower
					than otherwise as a result of the bond purchase program. Members noted that government bond markets in
					Australia continued to function smoothly for both Australian Government bonds and semis.
After drawing down the bulk of initial Term Funding Facility (TFF) allowances by the end-September
					deadline, banks had since drawn down only a small share of their additional and supplementary TFF
					allowances. Similar to the initial allowance period, further TFF drawings were expected to pick up
					towards the end of the remaining drawdown period, which would finish in June 2021.
Reductions in money market rates and retail deposit rates had further reduced banks' funding
					costs. Borrowing rates for households and businesses had also declined to new lows. Reductions in
					borrowing rates since November had mostly been for fixed-rate home loans and for business loans under
					the government's small and medium-sized enterprises loan guarantee scheme. The average rate paid
					on outstanding variable-rate housing loans had continued to drift gradually lower, reflecting ongoing
					competition for new high-quality borrowers and the effect of borrowers refinancing their loans.
Funding conditions for Australian non-financial firms had remained highly accommodative. Credit
					spreads had narrowed further and Australian firms had been able to increase the tenor of their bond
					issuance in 2020. Equity prices had increased a little further since early December. While the ASX
					200 had risen noticeably since March 2020 – with a significant contribution from resource
					companies reflecting higher commodity prices – it had remained around 5 per cent below
					its peak early in 2020.
Demand for housing finance had continued to pick up over preceding months, especially from
					owner-occupiers. New housing loan commitments for owner-occupiers had increased to be well above the
					previous high in 2017. Investor housing loan commitments had also increased somewhat, but remained well
					below earlier peaks. Members noted that demand for new business loans had remained subdued, including
					for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Considerations for monetary policy
In considering the policy decision, members observed that the outlook for the global economy had
				improved over prior months owing to the development of vaccines. At the same time, the global recovery
				had lost some momentum around the turn of the year, as COVID-19 cases had
				surged again in many countries. The global outlook remained dependent on the path of the pandemic and on
				significant fiscal and monetary support. The recovery was likely to remain bumpy and uneven, and most
				economies were expected to be well below their pre-pandemic trajectories for the level of output for
				some time. Inflation remained low and below central bank targets in many economies.
In Australia, the economic recovery was well under way and had been stronger than expected previously.
				There had been strong growth in employment and a welcome decline in the unemployment rate. These
				outcomes had been underpinned by Australia's success on the health front and the very significant
				fiscal and monetary support. An important near-term issue was how households and businesses would adjust
				to the tapering of some fiscal support measures and to what extent they would use their stronger balance
				sheets to support spending. Members agreed that, while the recovery was expected to continue, the level
				of output remained noticeably below its pre-pandemic trajectory. The high unemployment rate and
				considerable spare capacity were expected to result in subdued wages growth and inflation over coming
				years.
The Bank's policy actions to date had been working broadly as expected. Together, the bond
				purchases, the TFF and the targets for the 3-year bond yield and the cash rate were helping the economy
				by lowering financing costs for borrowers, contributing to a lower exchange rate than otherwise,
				supporting the supply of credit and supporting housing and business balance sheets. Since the start of
				2020, the Bank's balance sheet had increased by around $160 billion and a further substantial
				increase was in prospect. The Bank had bought a cumulative $52 billion of government bonds issued
				by the Australian Government and the states and territories under the bond purchase program. The Bank
				had not purchased bonds in support of the 3-year yield target since early December 2020. Authorised
				deposit-taking institutions had drawn down $86 billion of low-cost funding through the TFF and had
				access to a further $99 billion under the facility. Members noted that the Australian banking
				system, with its strong capital and liquidity buffers, had remained resilient and was helping to support
				the economic recovery.
The Board remained committed to doing what it reasonably could to support the Australian economy, and
				decided to maintain the existing policy settings. Members concluded that very significant monetary
				support would be required for some time, as it would be some years before the Bank's goals for
				inflation and unemployment were achieved. Given this, it would be premature to consider withdrawing
				monetary stimulus.
Members discussed the bond purchase program, which was scheduled to be completed in mid April 2021.
				They considered 3 factors: the effectiveness of the bond purchases; the decisions of other central
				banks; and, most importantly, the outlook for inflation and employment. The Board assessed that the bond
				purchase program had helped to lower interest rates and had contributed to a lower exchange rate than
				otherwise. Australia's government bond markets continued to function well and further purchases
				were not expected to be a source of market dysfunction.
A number of central banks in other advanced economies had announced extensions of their bond purchase
				programs to at least the end of 2021, and there was a widespread expectation among market participants
				that the Bank's program would be extended in some way. Given this, if the Bank were to cease bond
				purchases in April, it was likely that there would be unwelcome significant upward pressure on the
				exchange rate. Members discussed the outlook for the economy and concluded that it would be some years
				before the goals for inflation and unemployment were achieved. In view of these considerations, and the
				fact that the cash rate was at its effective lower bound, the Board resolved to purchase an additional
				$100 billion of bonds issued by the Australian Government and states and territories following the
				completion of the existing bond purchase program in mid April. These additional purchases would be at
				the same rate of $5 billion per week, allocated on the same basis, namely around
				80 per cent Australian Government Securities and around 20 per cent bonds issued by
				the states and territories. The decision to extend the bond purchase program would ensure a continuation
				of the Bank's monetary support for the Australian economy.
Members reviewed the operation of the TFF and agreed that it had worked as intended by reducing
				borrowing costs and supporting the flow of credit, including for small and medium-sized enterprises. The
				Board decided to maintain the existing terms of the facility. Banks will be able to draw on the facility
				until the end of June 2021, and continue to benefit from this low-cost funding through to mid 2024.
				The Board would consider extending the facility if there were a marked deterioration in funding and
				credit conditions in the Australian financial system. However, there had not been signs of such a
				deterioration recently.
Members also discussed the operation of the target for the 3-year Australian Government bond yield.
				This target had been effective in lowering short-term interest rates, which matter most for private
				borrowing and lending decisions. The target had also helped to anchor the Australian yield curve, and
				reinforced the Bank's forward guidance regarding the cash rate. The Board determined that the
				3-year yield target would be maintained. Later in the year, the Board would need to consider whether to
				shift the focus of the yield target from the April 2024 bond to the November 2024 bond. In considering
				this issue, members would give close attention to the flow of economic data and the outlook for
				inflation and employment.
Members also discussed the effect that low interest rates have on financial and macroeconomic
				stability. They acknowledged the risks inherent in investors searching for yield in a low interest rate
				environment, including risks linked to higher leverage and asset prices, particularly in the housing
				market. The Board concluded that there were greater benefits for financial stability from a stronger
				economy, while acknowledging the importance of closely monitoring risks in asset markets.
Members affirmed that the cash rate would be maintained at 10 basis points for as long as
				necessary. They continued to view a negative policy rate as extraordinarily unlikely. The Board will not
				increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent
				target range. For this to occur, wages growth will have to be materially higher than it is currently.
				This will require significant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market. The Board does
				not expect these conditions to be met until 2024 at the earliest.
The decision
The Board reaffirmed the existing policy settings, namely:

a target for the cash rate of 0.1 per cent
an interest rate of zero on Exchange Settlement balances held by financial institutions at the
					Bank
a target of around 0.1 per cent for the yield on the 3-year Australian Government
					bond
the expanded Term Funding Facility to support credit to businesses, particularly small and
					medium-sized businesses, with an interest rate on new drawings of 0.1 per cent
the purchase of $100 billion of government bonds of maturities of around 5 to 10 years
					at a rate of $5 billion per week following the Board meeting on 3 November 2020.

The Board agreed to purchase an additional $100 billion of government bonds when the existing bond
				purchase program is completed in mid April 2021. These additional purchases will be at the same rate of
				$5 billion per week.

The 3-year Australian Government bond yield had been at the target of around 10 basis points,
					supported by bond purchases on several occasions in mid November and early December. The Bank was
					halfway through the $100 billion bond purchase program. While longer-dated Australian Government
					bond yields had increased since early December, this largely reflected international developments and
					the yield differential to US Treasuries had been broadly stable over that period. Staff estimates
					suggested that longer-term Australian Government bond yields were around 30 basis points lower
					than otherwise as a result of the bond purchase program. Members noted that government bond markets in
					Australia continued to function smoothly for both Australian Government bonds and semis.
After drawing down the bulk of initial Term Funding Facility (TFF) allowances by the end-September
					deadline, banks had since drawn down only a small share of their additional and supplementary TFF
					allowances. Similar to the initial allowance period, further TFF drawings were expected to pick up
					towards the end of the remaining drawdown period, which would finish in June 2021.
Reductions in money market rates and retail deposit rates had further reduced banks' funding
					costs. Borrowing rates for households and businesses had also declined to new lows. Reductions in
					borrowing rates since November had mostly been for fixed-rate home loans and for business loans under
					the government's small and medium-sized enterprises loan guarantee scheme. The average rate paid
					on outstanding variable-rate housing loans had continued to drift gradually lower, reflecting ongoing
					competition for new high-quality borrowers and the effect of borrowers refinancing their loans.
Funding conditions for Australian non-financial firms had remained highly accommodative. Credit
					spreads had narrowed further and Australian firms had been able to increase the tenor of their bond
					issuance in 2020. Equity prices had increased a little further since early December. While the ASX
					200 had risen noticeably since March 2020 – with a significant contribution from resource
					companies reflecting higher commodity prices – it had remained around 5 per cent below
					its peak early in 2020.
Demand for housing finance had continued to pick up over preceding months, especially from
					owner-occupiers. New housing loan commitments for owner-occupiers had increased to be well above the
					previous high in 2017. Investor housing loan commitments had also increased somewhat, but remained well
					below earlier peaks. Members noted that demand for new business loans had remained subdued, including
					for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Considerations for monetary policy
In considering the policy decision, members observed that the outlook for the global economy had
				improved over prior months owing to the development of vaccines. At the same time, the global recovery
				had lost some momentum around the turn of the year, as COVID-19 cases had
				surged again in many countries. The global outlook remained dependent on the path of the pandemic and on
				significant fiscal and monetary support. The recovery was likely to remain bumpy and uneven, and most

The Bank's policy actions to date had been working broadly as expected. Together, the bond

The decision
The Board reaffirmed the existing policy settings, namely:

a target for the cash rate of 0.1 per cent
an interest rate of zero on Exchange Settlement balances held by financial institutions at the
					Bank
a target of around 0.1 per cent for the yield on the 3-year Australian Government
					bond
the expanded Term Funding Facility to support credit to businesses, particularly small and
					medium-sized businesses, with an interest rate on new drawings of 0.1 per cent
the purchase of $100 billion of government bonds of maturities of around 5 to 10 years
					at a rate of $5 billion per week following the Board meeting on 3 November 2020.

The Board agreed to purchase an additional $100 billion of government bonds when the existing bond
				purchase program is completed in mid April 2021. These additional purchases will be at the same rate of
				$5 billion per week.

After drawing down the bulk of initial Term Funding Facility (TFF) allowances by the end-September
					deadline, banks had since drawn down only a small share of their additional and supplementary TFF
					allowances. Similar to the initial allowance period, further TFF drawings were expected to pick up
					towards the end of the remaining drawdown period, which would finish in June 2021.
Reductions in money market rates and retail deposit rates had further reduced banks' funding
					costs. Borrowing rates for households and businesses had also declined to new lows. Reductions in
					borrowing rates since November had mostly been for fixed-rate home loans and for business loans under
					the government's small and medium-sized enterprises loan guarantee scheme. The average rate paid
					on outstanding variable-rate housing loans had continued to drift gradually lower, reflecting ongoing
					competition for new high-quality borrowers and the effect of borrowers refinancing their loans.
Funding conditions for Australian non-financial firms had remained highly accommodative. Credit
					spreads had narrowed further and Australian firms had been able to increase the tenor of their bond
					issuance in 2020. Equity prices had increased a little further since early December. While the ASX
					200 had risen noticeably since March 2020 – with a significant contribution from resource
					companies reflecting higher commodity prices – it had remained around 5 per cent below
					its peak early in 2020.
Demand for housing finance had continued to pick up over preceding months, especially from
					owner-occupiers. New housing loan commitments for owner-occupiers had increased to be well above the
					previous high in 2017. Investor housing loan commitments had also increased somewhat, but remained well
					below earlier peaks. Members noted that demand for new business loans had remained subdued, including
					for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Considerations for monetary policy
In considering the policy decision, members observed that the outlook for the global economy had
				improved over prior months owing to the development of vaccines. At the same time, the global recovery
				had lost some momentum around the turn of the year, as COVID-19 cases had
				surged again in many countries. The global outlook remained dependent on the path of the pandemic and on
				significant fiscal and monetary support. The recovery was likely to remain bumpy and uneven, and most
				economies were expected to be well below their pre-pandemic trajectories for the level of output for
				some time. Inflation remained low and below central bank targets in many economies.
In Australia, the economic recovery was well under way and had been stronger than expected previously.
				There had been strong growth in employment and a welcome decline in the unemployment rate. These
				outcomes had been underpinned by Australia's success on the health front and the very significant
				fiscal and monetary support. An important near-term issue was how households and businesses would adjust
				to the tapering of some fiscal support measures and to what extent they would use their stronger balance
				sheets to support spending. Members agreed that, while the recovery was expected to continue, the level
				of output remained noticeably below its pre-pandemic trajectory. The high unemployment rate and
				considerable spare capacity were expected to result in subdued wages growth and inflation over coming
				years.
The Bank's policy actions to date had been working broadly as expected. Together, the bond
				purchases, the TFF and the targets for the 3-year bond yield and the cash rate were helping the economy
				by lowering financing costs for borrowers, contributing to a lower exchange rate than otherwise,
				supporting the supply of credit and supporting housing and business balance sheets. Since the start of
				2020, the Bank's balance sheet had increased by around $160 billion and a further substantial
				increase was in prospect. The Bank had bought a cumulative $52 billion of government bonds issued
				by the Australian Government and the states and territories under the bond purchase program. The Bank
				had not purchased bonds in support of the 3-year yield target since early December 2020. Authorised
				deposit-taking institutions had drawn down $86 billion of low-cost funding through the TFF and had
				access to a further $99 billion under the facility. Members noted that the Australian banking
				system, with its strong capital and liquidity buffers, had remained resilient and was helping to support
				the economic recovery.
The Board remained committed to doing what it reasonably could to support the Australian economy, and
				decided to maintain the existing policy settings. Members concluded that very significant monetary
				support would be required for some time, as it would be some years before the Bank's goals for
				inflation and unemployment were achieved. Given this, it would be premature to consider withdrawing
				monetary stimulus.
Members discussed the bond purchase program, which was scheduled to be completed in mid April 2021.
				They considered 3 factors: the effectiveness of the bond purchases; the decisions of other central
				banks; and, most importantly, the outlook for inflation and employment. The Board assessed that the bond
				purchase program had helped to lower interest rates and had contributed to a lower exchange rate than
				otherwise. Australia's government bond markets continued to function well and further purchases
				were not expected to be a source of market dysfunction.
A number of central banks in other advanced economies had announced extensions of their bond purchase
				programs to at least the end of 2021, and there was a widespread expectation among market participants
				that the Bank's program would be extended in some way. Given this, if the Bank were to cease bond
				purchases in April, it was likely that there would be unwelcome significant upward pressure on the
				exchange rate. Members discussed the outlook for the economy and concluded that it would be some years
				before the goals for inflation and unemployment were achieved. In view of these considerations, and the
				fact that the cash rate was at its effective lower bound, the Board resolved to purchase an additional
				$100 billion of bonds issued by the Australian Government and states and territories following the
				completion of the existing bond purchase program in mid April. These additional purchases would be at
				the same rate of $5 billion per week, allocated on the same basis, namely around
				80 per cent Australian Government Securities and around 20 per cent bonds issued by
				the states and territories. The decision to extend the bond purchase program would ensure a continuation
				of the Bank's monetary support for the Australian economy.
Members reviewed the operation of the TFF and agreed that it had worked as intended by reducing
				borrowing costs and supporting the flow of credit, including for small and medium-sized enterprises. The
				Board decided to maintain the existing terms of the facility. Banks will be able to draw on the facility
				until the end of June 2021, and continue to benefit from this low-cost funding through to mid 2024.
				The Board would consider extending the facility if there were a marked deterioration in funding and
				credit conditions in the Australian financial system. However, there had not been signs of such a
				deterioration recently.
Members also discussed the operation of the target for the 3-year Australian Government bond yield.
				This target had been effective in lowering short-term interest rates, which matter most for private
				borrowing and lending decisions. The target had also helped to anchor the Australian yield curve, and
				reinforced the Bank's forward guidance regarding the cash rate. The Board determined that the
				3-year yield target would be maintained. Later in the year, the Board would need to consider whether to
				shift the focus of the yield target from the April 2024 bond to the November 2024 bond. In considering
				this issue, members would give close attention to the flow of economic data and the outlook for
				inflation and employment.
Members also discussed the effect that low interest rates have on financial and macroeconomic
				stability. They acknowledged the risks inherent in investors searching for yield in a low interest rate
				environment, including risks linked to higher leverage and asset prices, particularly in the housing
				market. The Board concluded that there were greater benefits for financial stability from a stronger
				economy, while acknowledging the importance of closely monitoring risks in asset markets.
Members affirmed that the cash rate would be maintained at 10 basis points for as long as
				necessary. They continued to view a negative policy rate as extraordinarily unlikely. The Board will not
				increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent
				target range. For this to occur, wages growth will have to be materially higher than it is currently.
				This will require significant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market. The Board does
				not expect these conditions to be met until 2024 at the earliest.
The decision
The Board reaffirmed the existing policy settings, namely:

a target for the cash rate of 0.1 per cent
an interest rate of zero on Exchange Settlement balances held by financial institutions at the
					Bank
a target of around 0.1 per cent for the yield on the 3-year Australian Government
					bond
the expanded Term Funding Facility to support credit to businesses, particularly small and
					medium-sized businesses, with an interest rate on new drawings of 0.1 per cent
the purchase of $100 billion of government bonds of maturities of around 5 to 10 years
					at a rate of $5 billion per week following the Board meeting on 3 November 2020.

The Board agreed to purchase an additional $100 billion of government bonds when the existing bond
				purchase program is completed in mid April 2021. These additional purchases will be at the same rate of

				environment, including risks linked to higher leverage and asset prices, particularly in the housing
				market. The Board concluded that there were greater benefits for financial stability from a stronger
				economy, while acknowledging the importance of closely monitoring risks in asset markets.
Members affirmed that the cash rate would be maintained at 10 basis points for as long as
				necessary. They continued to view a negative policy rate as extraordinarily unlikely. The Board will not
				increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent
				target range. For this to occur, wages growth will have to be materially higher than it is currently.
				This will require significant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market. The Board does
				not expect these conditions to be met until 2024 at the earliest.
The decision
The Board reaffirmed the existing policy settings, namely:

a target for the cash rate of 0.1 per cent
an interest rate of zero on Exchange Settlement balances held by financial institutions at the
					Bank
a target of around 0.1 per cent for the yield on the 3-year Australian Government
					bond
the expanded Term Funding Facility to support credit to businesses, particularly small and
					medium-sized businesses, with an interest rate on new drawings of 0.1 per cent
the purchase of $100 billion of government bonds of maturities of around 5 to 10 years
					at a rate of $5 billion per week following the Board meeting on 3 November 2020.

The Board agreed to purchase an additional $100 billion of government bonds when the existing bond
				purchase program is completed in mid April 2021. These additional purchases will be at the same rate of
				$5 billion per week.

In considering the policy decision, members observed that the outlook for the global economy had
				improved over prior months owing to the development of vaccines. At the same time, the global recovery
				had lost some momentum around the turn of the year, as COVID-19 cases had
				surged again in many countries. The global outlook remained dependent on the path of the pandemic and on
				significant fiscal and monetary support. The recovery was likely to remain bumpy and uneven, and most
				economies were expected to be well below their pre-pandemic trajectories for the level of output for
				some time. Inflation remained low and below central bank targets in many economies.
In Australia, the economic recovery was well under way and had been stronger than expected previously.
				There had been strong growth in employment and a welcome decline in the unemployment rate. These
				outcomes had been underpinned by Australia's success on the health front and the very significant
				fiscal and monetary support. An important near-term issue was how households and businesses would adjust
				to the tapering of some fiscal support measures and to what extent they would use their stronger balance
				sheets to support spending. Members agreed that, while the recovery was expected to continue, the level
				of output remained noticeably below its pre-pandemic trajectory. The high unemployment rate and
				considerable spare capacity were expected to result in subdued wages growth and inflation over coming
				years.
The Bank's policy actions to date had been working broadly as expected. Together, the bond
				purchases, the TFF and the targets for the 3-year bond yield and the cash rate were helping the economy
				by lowering financing costs for borrowers, contributing to a lower exchange rate than otherwise,
				supporting the supply of credit and supporting housing and business balance sheets. Since the start of
				2020, the Bank's balance sheet had increased by around $160 billion and a further substantial
				increase was in prospect. The Bank had bought a cumulative $52 billion of government bonds issued
				by the Australian Government and the states and territories under the bond purchase program. The Bank
				had not purchased bonds in support of the 3-year yield target since early December 2020. Authorised
				deposit-taking institutions had drawn down $86 billion of low-cost funding through the TFF and had
				access to a further $99 billion under the facility. Members noted that the Australian banking
				system, with its strong capital and liquidity buffers, had remained resilient and was helping to support
				the economic recovery.
The Board remained committed to doing what it reasonably could to support the Australian economy, and
				decided to maintain the existing policy settings. Members concluded that very significant monetary
				support would be required for some time, as it would be some years before the Bank's goals for
				inflation and unemployment were achieved. Given this, it would be premature to consider withdrawing
				monetary stimulus.
Members discussed the bond purchase program, which was scheduled to be completed in mid April 2021.
				They considered 3 factors: the effectiveness of the bond purchases; the decisions of other central
				banks; and, most importantly, the outlook for inflation and employment. The Board assessed that the bond
				purchase program had helped to lower interest rates and had contributed to a lower exchange rate than
				otherwise. Australia's government bond markets continued to function well and further purchases
				were not expected to be a source of market dysfunction.
A number of central banks in other advanced economies had announced extensions of their bond purchase
				programs to at least the end of 2021, and there was a widespread expectation among market participants
				that the Bank's program would be extended in some way. Given this, if the Bank were to cease bond
				purchases in April, it was likely that there would be unwelcome significant upward pressure on the
				exchange rate. Members discussed the outlook for the economy and concluded that it would be some years
				before the goals for inflation and unemployment were achieved. In view of these considerations, and the
				fact that the cash rate was at its effective lower bound, the Board resolved to purchase an additional
				$100 billion of bonds issued by the Australian Government and states and territories following the
				completion of the existing bond purchase program in mid April. These additional purchases would be at
				the same rate of $5 billion per week, allocated on the same basis, namely around
				80 per cent Australian Government Securities and around 20 per cent bonds issued by
				the states and territories. The decision to extend the bond purchase program would ensure a continuation
				of the Bank's monetary support for the Australian economy.
Members reviewed the operation of the TFF and agreed that it had worked as intended by reducing
				borrowing costs and supporting the flow of credit, including for small and medium-sized enterprises. The
				Board decided to maintain the existing terms of the facility. Banks will be able to draw on the facility
				until the end of June 2021, and continue to benefit from this low-cost funding through to mid 2024.
				The Board would consider extending the facility if there were a marked deterioration in funding and
				credit conditions in the Australian financial system. However, there had not been signs of such a
				deterioration recently.
Members also discussed the operation of the target for the 3-year Australian Government bond yield.
				This target had been effective in lowering short-term interest rates, which matter most for private
				borrowing and lending decisions. The target had also helped to anchor the Australian yield curve, and
				reinforced the Bank's forward guidance regarding the cash rate. The Board determined that the
				3-year yield target would be maintained. Later in the year, the Board would need to consider whether to
				shift the focus of the yield target from the April 2024 bond to the November 2024 bond. In considering
				this issue, members would give close attention to the flow of economic data and the outlook for
				inflation and employment.
Members also discussed the effect that low interest rates have on financial and macroeconomic
				stability. They acknowledged the risks inherent in investors searching for yield in a low interest rate
				environment, including risks linked to higher leverage and asset prices, particularly in the housing
				market. The Board concluded that there were greater benefits for financial stability from a stronger
				economy, while acknowledging the importance of closely monitoring risks in asset markets.
Members affirmed that the cash rate would be maintained at 10 basis points for as long as
				necessary. They continued to view a negative policy rate as extraordinarily unlikely. The Board will not
				increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent
				target range. For this to occur, wages growth will have to be materially higher than it is currently.
				This will require significant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market. The Board does
				not expect these conditions to be met until 2024 at the earliest.
