##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on ‘Economic Outlook for the Second Half of

 2017’, ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the

 discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the

 following areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that,
 along with improvements in world trade, the recovery of the global economy had been sustained, centering around advanced economies. Members also evaluated that international financial markets had been stable overall, despite changes in expectations of major countries’ monetary policy stances and geopolitical risks.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that the
 Korean economy had been showing a recovery, with exports and investment remaining buoyant and consumer expectations indicators
 improving, while private consumption had not yet exhibited substantial improvement. With regard to prices, meanwhile, members noted that consumer price inflation had been nearing its target of 2 percent, while core inflation had fallen below the target.

 As to the domestic financial markets, members mentioned that
 household debt had maintained strong growth and attention should be paid to the possibility of consequent financial instability and constraints on monetary policy. Members also stressed the need to closely monitor the trend of household debt in line with related government measures in the coming months.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 changes in the domestic and international financial and economic

 environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current

 level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.

 One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep

 the Base Rate at the current 1.25 percent this month.

 The member noted that the global economy had been showing recovery

 along with improvements in international trade, and that with consumer

 price inflation gradually nearing its target, major advanced countries were

 hinting that they could shift away from monetary easing policies as the

 US had. The member expressed the view that the prolonged monetary

 policy easing stances had been a result of the delayed achievement of

 inflation targets due to the weakening linkage between real economies and

 inflation since the global financial crisis, and that this had in turn been

 attributable to global structural factors. Furthermore, considering these

 structural changes, the member mentioned that the increasing side effects

 of monetary easing, as well as the inflation gap, should be taken into

 consideration in assessing the future monetary policy stance. In this regard,

 the member pointed to surging debt undermining the consumption

 expansion and the overheating of the stock and housing markets due to

 low costs of capital relative to medium-term natural interest rates.

 As to the Korean economy, the member noted that, although exports

 had been improving along with global economic recovery, they were not

 yet having clear trickle-down effects on consumption, and that this seemed

 to have been attributable to the high rate of savings resulting from the

 population structure, a reduced consumption base due to income


-----

###### imbalances, and decreased capacity for consumption in line with growing

 household debt. The member went on to argue that the recent buoyancy

 of construction and IT-related facilities investment had not led to a

 fundamental turnaround in household consumption. The member also

 mentioned that, despite the sustained accommodative monetary policy

 stance, core inflation had remained below 2 percent in Korea, similar to

 that of other OECD countries, suggesting that domestic consumer price

 inflation had been largely driven by global structural effects, and that

 consumer price inflation had been also nearing 2 percent, owing to

 external one-off factors such as oil prices. Meanwhile, the member’s

 evaluation was that capital allocation had been concentrated in

 profit-seeking through leverage, raising concerns about financial instability,

 and that household consumption had been affected more by debt-servicing

 burdens than by the easing of liquidity restrictions, adding to the negative

 side effects of the accommodative monetary policy stance.

 In overall consideration of the above-mentioned matters, the member

 argued that it seemed to be time to review the current monetary easing

 policies, but due to uncertainties about the recovery of the domestic

 economy, about whether core inflation had been approaching its

 medium-term target, and about the effects of the government’s recent real

 estate policy, any decision to change the monetary policy stance should be

 made in consideration of trade-offs between the pace of growth in

 household debt and the consumption-led recovery.

 Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold

 the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period,

 and pointed out a number of major considerations for the appropriate conduct

 of monetary policy.

  First, the domestic real economy had continued to improve, with growth

 led by exports and investment in the second quarter as well. However, with

 the recovery in private consumption remaining sluggish, facilities and

 construction investment, having recently exhibited strong growth, seemed to


-----

###### have entered a correction phase, and manufacturing and services production

 had weakened somewhat. Boosted by favorable performances during the first

 quarter, the growth path had moved upward, raising the annual growth

 forecast, but growth momentum was likely to weaken somewhat in the second

 half, affected chiefly by weakening export growth and corrections in

 construction and facilities investment. However, the growth rate was likely to

 remain similar to its potential level in the second half as well. Second,

 looking at inflation, consumer price inflation was expected to rise at a

 somewhat slower pace in the second half, owing chiefly to the stabilization

 of agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices and the weakening

 base-period effects of oil prices, but would likely approach near its target

 level later on. Core inflation, on the other hand, had continued to fall short

 of the 2-percent level, due mainly to the lack of demand-side pressures, and

 these pressures were unlikely to increase substantially for the time being,

 considering that the narrowing of the negative output gap was attributable to

 the declining potential growth rate rather than to sufficiently strong aggregate

 demand. Third, the improving trends in production sector slack had shown

 signs of faltering, with the sales to inventory ratio rising and the average

 capacity utilization ratio declining in the manufacturing sector. The slack in

 the labor force, meanwhile, had increased for the third consecutive month in

 June, with growth in the unemployment and time gaps more than offsetting

 the lack of substantial changes in the participation gap. Fourth, looking at

 financial stability conditions, with upward pressures on long-term market

 rates growing due to risk aversion in reaction to the changing global

 monetary policy stances, the spread between long- and short-term yields

 had widened, while credit spreads had narrowed slightly, led by a recovery

 in investor sentiment following improvements in corporate performances. In

 the credit market, meanwhile, household lending had maintained strong

 growth owing mainly to increased housing transaction volume and demand

 prior to the implementation of real estate measures, while lending to

 SMEs had exhibited slow growth despite the economic recovery. In overall


-----

###### consideration of the above-mentioned real economic and inflation trends

 and financial stability conditions, the member assessed that it was

 advisable to keep the Base Rate at the current level for the intermeeting

 period.

 One other member presented the opinion that, while keeping the Base

 Rate unchanged at its current level for the intermeeting period, the Bank

 of Korea should see if the recent export-driven economic recovery spreads

 to the domestic demand sector.

 The member noted that exports and manufacturing facilities investment

 in the Korean economy had expanded in line with continued economic

 recovery in advanced economies. The member commented, however, that

 the real sector had shown no marked change with core inflation indicators

 remaining at the mid-1% range, running below consumer price inflation.

 The member also observed that household debt was still continuing to

 grow at a worrisome level.

 The member stated that the most notable aspect of the past two to

 three months was the surge in consumer expectations, which existing

 analysis results implied would lead to higher private consumption for the

 corresponding and following quarters. However, the member assessed that

 the relevant indices had not been showing any marked trend of recovery

 in actual private consumption. In addition, the member pointed out that the

 sharp increase in consumer sentiment had appeared with the launch of the

 new government, which has been placing emphasis on household income,

 and thus consumer expectations may be significantly influenced by the

 actual implementation of the government policy. Meanwhile, the member

 stated that manufactoring and service production-related indicators in the

 second quarter seemed to have been somewhat insufficient to be confident

 that the trend of economic recovery in the previous quarter was

 continuing. The member particularly noted that typical domestic demand

 areas, such as the wholesale & retail trade and food & accommodation

 industries, were continuing to show sluggishness since the second half of


-----

###### last year.

 Taking these factors into overall consideration, the member judged it

 difficult to say that the expansion in exports seen since the second half of

 last year was having spillover effects on domestic demand, and also

 expressed a lack of confidence that the Korean economy was continuing to

 show the rapid pace of recovery needed for underlying inflation to

 accelerate to the 2% target level. The member, thus, presented the view

 that, while maintaining the current accommodative monetary policy stance,

 it was desirable to assess if the economy would see a sustained recovery

 at a pace sufficient to boost inflation. In addition, concerning the trend of

 sharply increasing household debt, the member added that it was necessary

 to actively cooperate with the relevant policy authorities by strengthening

 public policy regulations and macroprudential policies to prevent markets

 from underestimating the household debt risk.

 One member, meanwhile, expressed the opinion that it would be

 appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting

 period, while keeping a close watch on whether improvements in consumer

 sentiment would lead to a recovery in private consumption, whether

 household debt would stabilize, and the trend of the price path.

 The member noted that the rate of quarter-on-quarter GDP growth

 stood at 1.1% in the first quarter of this year due to large increases in

 exports and facilities investment, and that a possibility of a recovery in

 household consumption had emerged thanks to improvements in consumer

 sentiment. The member noted that, as a result, expectations had emerged

 that this year’s economic growth rate could be adjusted upward from the

 previous forecast. The member stated that, with strong exports and

 facilities investment driving growth in the second quarter, exports had

 increased on the back of a boom in the semiconductor market, and global

 trade volume had been showing improvement, but consumption had

 continued to mark time, despite improvements in sentiment indices.

 The member noted that the 2.8% growth forecast released by the Bank


-----

###### of Korea Research Department in July seemed to be neutral with similar

 upside and downside risks, given that the recovery from stagnation in

 consumption was still insufficient. The member went on to assess that this

 improvement in the economic outlook showed that the Korean economy

 was returning to a balanced growth path. The member, however, pointed

 out that the price path had not been showing a commensurate change. The

 member noted that, while consumer prices had not differed greatly from

 their original projection, core inflation had actually slowed to the mid-1%

 range in the second quarter. The member then offered three hypotheses

 why the price path had been insensitive to the real economic trend. First,

 the formation of inflation expectations of economic agents may be

 adaptive, relying upon past inflation figures and failing to reflect the

 future economic outlook. Second, the mid- to long-term economic outlook

 of economic agents, which reflects their inflation expectations, may still

 not be bright. Third, the global low inflation environment may be

 influencing the price path in Korea as well. The member then noted that

 the second hypothesis seemed to better fit the recent Korean economy, and

 in this case, the appropriate monetary policy operation would be to check

 if the recent recovery in consumer sentiment leads to an actual recovery

 in consumption and take actions in response accordingly.

 The member, meanwhile, cited household debt as the biggest risk

 factor when keeping the Base Rate unchanged at the current level. The

 member noted that, although there was little likelihood of a household

 debt overhang escalating into a crisis in the financial sector, the

 consequent macro risk was not small. The member also raised concerns

 about a growing possibility that spillover effects from negative shocks,

 such as an economic recession or housing price declines, could expand

 due to heightened vulnerabilities to household income and housing price

 risks. The member also commented that the current interest rate decision

 was based on the premise that household debt growth will gradually show

 downward stability throughout this year and next year, owing for example


-----

###### to policy measures to stabilize the housing market and ensure financial

 soundness.

 Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to

 keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level for the intermeeting

 period.

 The member assessed that, with trends of recovery in the world

 economy and trade volume continuing, on the domestic economic front,

 private consumption had improved moderately from its sluggishness, and

 exports and investment had also remained buoyant. The member then

 noted that, considering these domestic and overseas factors, the Bank of

 Korea had adjusted the economic growth outlook for this year upward,

 and went on to state that, if policy effects from the government’s

 execution of the supplementary budget are considered, additional upward

 adjustments might be made. The member, however, pointed out that since

 there were several downside risks as well, such as China’s trade

 restrictions related to Korea’s THAAD deployment, stronger trade

 protectionism, and geopolitical risk related to North Korea, it was

 necessary to constantly examine the relevant developments. The member

 noted that GDP for this year and next year was expected to grow at the

 level of the potential growth rate, and consumer price inflation was

 forecast to increase to near the inflation target. The member, however,

 expressed the opinion that, considering the downside risks to inflation,

 such as the weakening of the global reflation trend, it was necessary to

 wait and see further whether economic growth would show trends

 consistent with its forecast, while maintaining the current accommodative

 monetary policy stance at this point in time.

 The member, meanwhile, pointed out the need to keep a close watch

 on the possibility that financial stability issues could constrain monetary

 policy, through close analyses of domestic and overseas financial markets

 going forward. The member stressed that, although overall financial market

 conditions remained stable, factors making for instability, such as policy


-----

###### rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, changes in its reinvestment policy,

 and geopolitical risks related to North Korea, persisted. The member also

 emphasized the need to continuously monitor trends of foreign portfolio

 investment as well. The member noted that, concerning household debt, its

 growth was expected to slow in the second half, due for instance to the

 implementation of the related government measures and increases in market

 interest rates, but it was necessary to keep a close watch on the relevant

 developments. The member also emphasized that, while higher market rates

 may rein in the increase in household debt, they could also work to

 increase the household debt burdens of vulnerable groups.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

######  Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

###### leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.

- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the

###### global economic recovery has continued to expand. The global financial

 markets have shown generally stable movements, although their

 volatility has risen somewhat due to fluctuations in international oil

 prices and to changes in expectations related to the monetary policies

 of major countries. Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic

 recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the directions of

 the US government's economic policies, the pace of monetary policy

 normalization by the US Federal Reserve, the movements toward

 spreading trade protectionism, and the direction of international oil

 prices.

- The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has

###### continued, as exports and investment have improved although the pace

 of increase in consumption has remained weak. On the employment

 front, the trend of year-on-year increase in the number of persons

 employed has slowed, and the employment-to-population ratio and the

 unemployment rate have risen. The Board sees the domestic economy

 as likely to continue its trend of recovery going forward, and forecasts

 a rate of GDP growth for this year higher than the April projection


-----

###### (2.6%). Exports will sustain their trend of improvement, thanks chiefly

 to the global economic recovery, and domestic demand activities will

 also recover moderately, owing to improved economic agents’

 sentiments.

- Consumer price inflation has continued at the 2% target level, in line

###### mainly with increases in the prices of agricultural, livestock and

 fisheries products. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices

 excluded from the CPI) has stayed in the mid-1% range, and the rate

 of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2%

 level. Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation

 will for the time being fluctuate at around the 2% level, and for the

 year as a whole show the level (1.9%) projected in April. Core

 inflation appears likely to be in the mid- to upper-1% range.

- In the domestic financial markets, price variable volatility has expanded

###### somewhat, with the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate having risen

 considerably, in line with changes in expectations related to the

 monetary policies of major countries and with increases in geopolitical

 risks, and long-term market interest rates having increased in concert

 with government bond rates in major countries. Stock prices have

 continued to climb, on the effects for example of the trend of solid

 domestic economic growth and expectations of improved performances

 at major companies. Household lending has sustained its high rate of

 increase exceeding past years’ levels, although the amount of

 year-on-year increase has lessened somewhat. In the housing market,

 the trends of rising sales and leasehold deposit prices have expanded,

 centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas.

- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure

###### that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price

 inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term


-----

###### horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the inflationary

 pressures on the demand side are not expected to be high although the

 domestic economy is expected to show solid growth, the Board will

 maintain its stance of monetary policy accommodation. In this process

 it will closely monitor any changes in the monetary policies of major

 countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the directions

 of the government's economic policies, the trend of increase in

 household debt, and geopolitical risks.
