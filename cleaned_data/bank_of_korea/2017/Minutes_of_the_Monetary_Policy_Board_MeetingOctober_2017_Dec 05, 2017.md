##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[4)]

###### After briefings by staff on ‘Economic Outlook for 2017 and 2018’,

 ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the

 discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the

 following areas:

 Members’ assessment was that the global economy had been continuing

 to recover steadily and global trade had been increasing. Members also

 evaluated that the favorable conditions in international financial markets

 would continue for the time being, but FX and asset market volatility was

 likely to increase in line largely with changes in major countries’ monetary

 policies.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that

 exports and facilities investment had been showing growth, boosted chiefly

 by the favorable performances of the semiconductor and IT sectors, and

 consumption had maintained a modest recovery. The outlook for economic

 growth had been upgraded in reflection of the global trade recovery and

 the buoyancy of the semiconductor sector.

 Members noted that prices were forecast to approach the inflation

 target, but a little more observation was needed since there had been no

 clear inflationary pressures. 

 As to the domestic financial markets, members mentioned that the

 markets had been stable overall despite geopolitical risks. Members also

 noted that, although household debt growth was likely to slow down, there

 were concerns about the accumulation of financial imbalances.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall

 consideration of the changes in the domestic and international financial and

 economic environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its

 current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.

 One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to raise

 the Base Rate from the current 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent this month.

 The member noted that global trade and major countries’ investment

 and industrial production had been expanding as the cyclical recovery of

 the global economy took root. The member mentioned that, led by the

 buoyancy of the IT sector, exports and facilities investment would likely

 contribute significantly to Korea’s economic growth, and this trend was

 expected to continue next year. The member also forecast solid

 quantitative growth in non-IT exports and a gradual increase in related

 trickle-down effects on domestic demand. With regard to construction

 investment, the member’s assessment was that its growth rate had peaked

 but that it would increase slowly until next year. The member also noted

 that, although private sector consumption had exhibited a downward trend,

 the supplementary budget for this year and fiscal expansion during next

 year would likely boost economic activities in macroeconomic terms.

 The member then projected that the aforementioned external

 environment, trickle-down effects and expansionary fiscal and monetary

 policies would help GDP growth reach 3 percent this year and close to 3

 percent next year as well. The member also noted that, with the Korean

 economy’s potential growth rate continuing to decline, the output gap was

 estimated to have already turned positive, and core inflation was therefore

 expected to near its target in the medium term.


-----

###### In terms of financial stability, the member mentioned that household

 debt had increased to exceed household disposable income, reducing

 household consumption capacity and dragging down the potential growth

 rate. The member added that a large part of the negative side effects of

 the accommodative monetary policy stance on the real economy had been

 the inefficient allocation of resources, as seen in flows of capital being

 excessively concentrated in the real estate market.

 The member assessed that Korea’s economic growth was already

 exceeding its potential level and thus the medium-term direction of the

 economy appeared to be set. The member went on to state that, in order

 to maximize policy effectiveness, it would be appropriate to weaken the

 accommodative monetary policy stance somewhat, in alignment with other

 macroprudential policies, thereby eliminating the aforementioned side

 effects and achieving a balance between monetary policy and expansionary

 fiscal policy in the future. The member took the view that, considering the

 need to preemptively adjust monetary policy in a situation where

 heightened North Korea risk had not produced any noticeable shocks on

 the real economy, this seemed the right time to adjust the degree of

 monetary easing. The member added, however, that steady and

 fundamental structural reform was needed in order for the Korean

 economy to shift from a cyclical to a broader recovery.

 Another member presented the view that, in overall consideration of

 real economic and inflation trends and financial stability conditions, it

 would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25

 percent for the intermeeting period. The member then made a number of

 points in connection with this opinion.

 First, looking at the domestic real economy, goods exports and

 facilities investment had grown faster than expected, as the buoyancy of

 the semiconductor sector more than offset the North Korea risk,

 construction investment experienced a relatively modest adjustment, and the


-----

###### growth path for the second half of this year moved slightly upward,

 affected by the execution of the supplementary budget. As a result, the

 output gap was estimated to have become less negative. External demand

 was expected to remain favorable next year as well, led by economic

 recoveries in both advanced and emerging market countries. However,

 since construction and facilities investment was likely to go through larger

 adjustments and, despite increased fiscal expenditures, private consumption

 was forecast to show modest recovery, medium-term growth was expected

 to be generally consistent with the pace of potential growth.

 Second, with regard to inflation, consumer price inflation and core

 inflation had shown opposing trends; consumer price inflation had recently

 exceeded its target level, boosted chiefly by the base-period effect of

 electricity tariffs and a rise in agricultural product prices, while core

 inflation had been showing a modest decline since the second half of last

 year. Consumer price inflation was expected to fall back below its target,

 with the effects of regulations and one-off supply-side factors fading away

 toward the end of the year, and core inflation was forecast to narrow the

 gap with consumer price inflation, with downward pressures eased

 somewhat in line with the modest economic recovery.

 Third, the overall slack in the manufacturing sector had not shown

 significant improvement, as the average capacity utilization ratio fell again,

 with an increase in manufacturing production seen mostly in some export

 items such as IT products. The slack had continued to increase in the

 labor market as well, with the participation gap showing a sharp increase

 year-on-year as in the previous month, more than offsetting a slight

 decline in the unemployment gap.

 Fourth, in terms of financial stability, the Korean financial markets had

 shown favorable resilience despite the North Korea risk, led chiefly by

 improved corporate performances. In the credit market, growth in

 household lending by both banks and non-banks had slowed slightly,

 owing largely to a drop in the housing transaction volume since the


-----

###### implementation of housing market stabilization measures. However, this

 slowdown in household debt growth seemed unlikely to continue, as group

 loans to purchasers of new pre-sale apartments, loans for leasehold

 deposits, and credit loans were likely to grow steadily, and housing prices

 in the Seoul metropolitan area were rising again.

 One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to

 hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting

 period, while raising it at an appropriate time in the not-distant future and

 reducing the degree of monetary easing gradually.

 First, looking at recent economic conditions, the member noted that the

 GDP growth forecast for this year, as projected by the Bank of Korea

 Research Department, was revised upward to 3.0 percent from 2.8 percent,

 while the forecast for next year remained unchanged at 2.9 percent. These

 figures showed that the domestic economy was maintaining sound growth

 despite heightened domestic and overseas uncertainties, and that the output

 gap, which had remained slightly negative, would turn positive soon. The

 member commented that, by sector, with exports remaining buoyant, the

 consumption recovery was expected to expand. The member also stated

 that, although facilities and construction investment would likely show

 slower growth, the growth level would be still high.

 Looking at price conditions, the member mentioned that, since the

 flattening of the Phillips curve, which implied a weaker linkage between

 growth and prices, had been witnessed across the world of late, Korea

 also was unlikely to see a large increase in underlying demand-side

 inflationary pressures. Core inflation, however, was likely to shift to a

 modest upward trend soon, and annual consumer price inflation for this

 year and the next was also forecast to show steady movements at the

 2-percent target level. In addition, since the relation between growth and

 prices could be nonlinear depending upon the output gap, the possibility of

 stronger-than-expected demand-side inflationary pressures could not be ruled


-----

###### out.

 The member noted that the financial and foreign exchange markets in

 Korea remained stable overall, despite factors such as North Korea-related

 risk and changes in expectations related to domestic and overseas monetary

 policies. The member also commented that there was a possibility of a

 further slowdown of household debt growth as the government’s household

 debt-related policy measures were implemented going forward, but

 significant concerns remained about the build-up of financial imbalances. 

 In terms of the monetary policy response to these issues, the member

 saw that, given the economic outlooks for this year and the next, and the

 risk of household debt overhang in line for instance with persistent low

 interest rates, the conditions were in place to reduce the degree of

 monetary easing gradually. The member then expressed the view, however,

 that, since North Korea-related risk was still having negative impacts on

 economic sentiment, it would be better to determine the time for a Base

 Rate hike after further monitoring of the development of this risk.

 One member, meanwhile, expressed the view that it would be desirable

 to maintain the Base Rate at the current level for the intermeeting period,

 while examining whether the recent trend of economic recovery would

 lead to a gradual expansion in underlying inflationary pressures. 

 The member noted that, as the world economy continued its steady

 recovery, led by advanced economies, demand for Korean exports had

 been showing strong growth. The member went on to argue that, although

 the effect of the Chuseok holiday should be taken into account, both

 export prices and volume had grown more rapidly than expected in the

 third quarter, thus easing the remaining concerns about the persistence of

 the export recovery. The member added that facilities investment was

 showing faster-than-expected growth, while the correction in construction

 investment was proceeding at a modest pace and therefore was unlikely to

 constrain macroeconomic recovery. The member also stated that the


-----

###### negative spillovers of heightened geopolitical risk related to North Korea

 had not yet reached a serious level.

 The member, however, commented that no clear sign of recovery had

 been detected in the labor market as labor-intensive domestic demand

 services industries still remained lackluster, although the recent economic

 recovery was heavily dependent upon the sharp increases in exports and

 facilities investment of some capital-intensive manufacturing industries,

 including semiconductors. The member judged that such labor market

 conditions had been constraining the recovery of private consumption, and

 noted that, as a result, inflationary pressures were still running below the

 target at the mid-1 percent range. The member, meanwhile, noted that

 household debt had soared for the past two to three years but was

 beginning to show slower growth since the August 2 measures, and the

 housing market was also showing overall stability, except for some

 apartment complexes being reconstructed.

 The member judged it advisable to maintain the current level of

 accommodative monetary policy for the time being in consideration of

 domestic economic conditions, which were lagging somewhat behind the

 global economic cycle. The member also found it desirable to keep a

 close watch on whether the foundation for economic recovery would

 spread to domestic demand, leading to further inflationary pressures, while

 examining whether risk related to household debt, which had increased

 sharply in line with the boom in the real estate market, would gradually

 diminish.

 Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep

 the Base Rate at its current 1.25 percent level for the intermeeting period.

 The member saw that the world economy and trade had continued

 their overall trends of improvement, which had led the strong growth of

 the Korean economy. The member noted that, although facilities investment

 was showing robustness in line with the sharp increase in exports, there


-----

###### were concerns about the deterioration in service exports, which was partly

 due to the drop in the number of Chinese tourists visiting Korea. The

 member commented that private consumption was continuing its modest

 recovery trend, thanks for example to execution of the supplementary

 budget. The member also stated that, although the extent of deceleration in

 construction investment was not as large as expected considering the

 implementation of the August 2 measures to stabilize the housing market,

 there was a possibility that the deceleration would continue next year due

 to a reduction in the government’s SOC budget.

 The member noted that the Bank of Korea Research Department had

 revised the growth forecast for this year upward to 3.0 percent, while

 maintaining next year’s forecast at 2.9 percent. It also expected consumer

 price inflation to rise to around 2 percent for this year and 1.8 percent

 for next year. If these economic outlooks materialized, the output gap

 would likely turn positive from the second half of next year. The member

 asserted that there still was a need for additional examination of the

 impacts of various uncertainties, such as North Korea-related risk, a

 deterioration in trade conditions stemming for instance from Korea’s

 deployment of THAAD, and the household debt problem. On the domestic

 demand front, the member noted that it was also necessary to further

 monitor the trend of recovery in private consumption, the degree of

 sluggishness in construction investment and their impacts on economic

 activity and employment. Particularly, considering the recent low level of

 core inflation, there was a need to check if the price path would approach

 the 2-percent target next year as expected.

 Based on the economic outlook over a one- to two-year horizon, the

 member judged that the time to address the buildup of financial

 imbalances stemming from accommodative monetary policy was

 approaching. The member, however, stated that a premature change in the

 monetary policy stance would be just as economically burdensome as a

 belated resolution of financial imbalances. The member thus found it


-----

###### necessary to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy stance

 for the time being, while waiting to see whether economic activity would

 show solid improvement.

 With respect to financial stability, the member expected household debt

 growth to continue to slow, helped by the government’s real estate

 measures. The member, however, expressed concern about the sustained

 upward trend in apartment prices in some areas. The member argued that,

 although the financial and foreign exchange markets remained stable

 overall, if North Korea-related risk continues, attention should be paid to

 its possible effects on capital outflows. The member went on to call for

 close monitoring of the impacts of the possibility of a year-end policy rate

 hike by the US Fed on emerging market economies.

 One other member expressed the opinion that the Base Rate should be

 kept unchanged for the intermeeting period, but it could be necessary to

 raise the Base Rate soon in overall consideration of the following factors.

 On the real economic front, the member noted that, with the growth

 trend in advanced economies such as the US and the EU improving, the

 global trade recovery was spreading to advanced economies from emerging

 market economies. The member stated that this had led to double-digit

 growth in exports in Korea, led by semiconductors, thus causing an

 expansion in the growth of related facilities investment. The member

 commented that there was an increased possibility that the shift to an

 increase in world trade volume represented a trend, and thus the upswings

 in exports and facilities investment in Korea, which were currently limited

 to semiconductors, would likely expand to other major export items. This

 was assessed as an important determinant for the growth path of the

 Korean economy in the second half of this year and next year.

  On the domestic side, the member asserted that, although

 construction investment was slowing, consumption was estimated to

 continue modest growth, even despite remaining uncertainties. The member


-----

###### judged that the Bank of Korea Research Department’s upward revision to

 the economic growth outlook for this year from 2.8 to 3.0 percent had

 been made in consideration of these factors.

 With respect to inflation, the member stated that, in contrast with real

 economic activity, there had not been any particular change in inflation,

 and thus the Bank of Korea Research Department’s consumer price

 inflation projections for this year and the next were 2.0 and 1.8 percent,

 respectively, neither of which deviated greatly from the previous forecasts.

 The member noted that there had been no clear materialization of

 inflationary pressures, although the output gap was expected to turn

 positive. The member went on to argue that this point had the following

 implications.

 The member noted that the factors that had caused a decline in the

 real neutral interest rate, including the world economic slump and a

 decline in households’ propensity to consume, were gradually disappearing,

 and so if the Base Rate were held at the current level, the degree of

 monetary easing was highly likely to be automatically increased. The

 member thus found it necessary to raise the Base Rate to prevent any

 negative side effects from this. The member, however, commented that the

 lack of clarity with respect to inflationary pressures, and the likelihood of

 the real neutral interest rate increasing at a modest pace, implied that the

 monetary policy stance should also be shifted at a gradual pace going

 forward.

 On the financial stability front, the member judged that the

 government’s August policy measures to stabilize household debt had taken

 effect, as household lending was stabilizing, with banks’ household lending

 growth slowing significantly in September. The member, however, asserted

 that there still was concern in the international financial markets, with the

 CDS premium rising steadily, albeit slightly, largely owing to geopolitical

 risks from North Korea’s nuclear tests.

 Taking these points into overall consideration, the member judged that


-----

###### there was a growing need for a hike in the Base Rate, due mainly to the

 stronger global trade recovery and the sustained moderate recovery in

 private consumption. The member, however, did not find it desirable to

 shift monetary policy without providing sufficient notice, as inflationary

 pressures had not materialized and there still remained geopolitical risks

 stemming for instance from the nuclear tests. The member thus noted that

 it was necessary to keep the Base Rate unchanged for the intermeeting

 period, while confirming the materialization of the most recent economic

 outlook and raising the Base Rate soon.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled reflecting the views of the majority.

 However, Mr. Lee, Il Houng expressed clear opposition to the idea of

 holding the Base Rate at its current level, and argued for a 0.25

 percentage point raise.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

###### leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.

- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the

###### global economic recovery has continued to expand. The global financial

 markets have shown generally stable movements, with the trend of

 rising stock prices continuing for example, although government bond

 rates have risen in line mainly with changes in expectations related to

 the monetary policy normalizations of major countries. Looking ahead

 the Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected

 by factors such as the paces of monetary policy normalization in major

 countries, the directions of the US government's economic policies, and

 the movements toward spreading trade protectionism.

- The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has

###### continued, as exports and facilities investment have sustained their high

 rates of increase and private consumption has also picked up

 moderately. Employment conditions appear to be sustaining their trend

 of moderate improvement, although the pace of increase in the number


-----

###### of persons employed has slowed somewhat owing to temporary factors.

 Going forward it is forecast that the domestic economy will maintain

 its solid trend of growth. The GDP growth rate for this year is

 expected to be higher than the July projection (2.8%), and that for next

 year also to show its potential level. Exports seem likely to sustain

 their buoyancy, thanks largely to the global economic recovery, and

 domestic demand activities will also recover moderately due to the

 expansion in fiscal spending for instance.

- Consumer price inflation has continued at the 2% level, in line mainly

###### with increases in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries

 products. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded

 from the CPI) has stayed in the mid-1% range, and the rate of

 inflation expected by the general public at the mid-2% level. Looking

 ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation will be in the

 upper-1% range for some time, in line chiefly with the disappearance

 of the base effect from the reduction of electricity fees last year, and

 then gradually approach the target level. Core inflation will meanwhile

 remain in the mid-1% range for the time being, before gradually rising

 from next year.

- In the domestic financial markets price variable volatility has expanded.

###### Long-term market interest rates have risen and the Korean won-US

 dollar exchange rate fluctuated, due mainly to changes in expectations

 concerning monetary policies at home and abroad and to geopolitical

 risks. Stock prices have risen, on expectations of improvements in

 corporate performances for example. Household lending has sustained

 its higher rate of increase than in past years, but the amount of

 increase has lessened somewhat. Although housing sales prices have

 shown signs of rebounding slightly in some parts of Seoul and its

 surrounding areas, their uptrend has in general slowed since the

 government's announcement of housing market stabilization measures.


-----

- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure

###### that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price

 inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term

 horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the inflationary

 pressures on the demand side are forecast to not be high for the time

 being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid

 growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative policy stance while

 closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends. In this

 process it will also carefully monitor any changes in the monetary

 policies of major countries, conditions related to trade with major

 countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical

 risks.
