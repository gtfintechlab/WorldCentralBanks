##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and

 International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the

 Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the
 recovery of the global economy had generally been sustained, and world trade had also been showing improvement. Members also evaluated that in the international financial markets, volatility in price variables had increased, influenced for instance by geopolitical risks and changes in expectations related to the monetary policies of major countries.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that,
 although exports had remained buoyant and consumption had maintained its trend of modest increase, it was necessary to be mindful of uncertainties, including geopolitical risks. The trend of economic growth was generally not expected to deviate far from the path forecast last July.

 With regard to prices, meanwhile, members noted that consumer price
 inflation had risen to the 2-percent level, boosted mainly by increases in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and by the base effect from the reduction of electricity fees last year, while core inflation had remained in the 1-percent range.

 As to the domestic financial markets, members mentioned that price
 variable volatility had expanded, mostly due to increases in geopolitical risks. Members noted that attention should be paid to the accumulation of financial imbalances, as household lending had continued to sustain its high rate of increase. Further observation was also needed with respect to the effects of the government’s policy measures related to real estate and household debt.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 changes in the domestic and international financial and economic

 environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current

 level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.

 One member expressed the opinion that it would be necessary to keep

 the Base Rate at its current level this month, while analyzing uncertainties

 related to economic activities and prices, and evaluating the possibility of

 increased burdens from financial stability issues.

 The member noted that international trade had continued to show a

 clear trend of recovery with the global economy continuing to improve.

 However, in contrast to such favorable global economic conditions,

 uncertainties surrounding the domestic economy had expanded since the

 release of the July outlook, due mainly to a deterioration in trade

 conditions with China stemming from a conflict with China related to

 Korea’s decision to deploy THAAD, and risks related to North Korea. The

 member commented that, although exports had been continuing to show a

 solid recovery, factors such as the deterioration in trade conditions with

 China had been working to increase the negative impacts on both goods

 and services exports, thus requiring ongoing monitoring of trade with

 China on an item-by-item basis. The member then expressed the view that,

 in the job market as well, factors such as the decline in the number of

 Chinese tourists were likely to limit the employment expansion in the

 services sector, and a relatively large-scale correction in the construction

 market would inevitably have negative impacts on employment in the

 construction sector. 

 The member noted that, in general, economic growth and prices in the

3


-----

###### second half of this year would likely be consistent with their July

 forecasts, but various upside and downside risks had been growing of late.

 The member thus expressed the need to keep a close watch on whether

 the output gap could be closed earlier or later than originally forecast, and

 stated that consideration should be given to economic conditions not only

 of next year, but also of the following years.

 Meanwhile, the member’s assessment was that, in terms of financial

 stability, concerns about recent household debt growth and possible capital

 outflows in line with mounting geopolitical risks had grown since the July

 meeting. The member pointed out that, although the government’s policy

 measures were likely to slow the increase in household debt, their effects

 might appear slowly, due mainly to an expected increase in housing

 availability. The member then stressed that the sharp increase in

 geopolitical risks related to North Korea called for stepped-up monitoring

 of foreign capital flows and foreign exchange market trends. The member

 also emphasized the need to continuously examine the impacts of expected

 changes in major country monetary policies on EME markets.

 Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold

 the Base Rate at its current level in August, in overall consideration of a

 number of points.

 First, the member noted that although the real economy was showing

 export-oriented and facilities investment-led growth, the buoyancy of

 exports had been confined to the IT industry, mainly in semiconductors,

 and since such strength was attributable to increases in unit export prices

 rather than growth in export volume, it was not likely to stimulate much

 additional production in related industries. The member stated that with the

 expected slowdown in construction having been offset by the contribution

 of facilities investment to growth, household consumption had been

 continuing its modest trend of growth at the lower-2 percent range. The

 member noted that, although there still remained uncertainties about

4


-----

###### improvements in exports and consumption, the Bank of Korea’s economic

 growth rate forecast of 2.8 percent was neutral, and considering the

 secular decline in the potential growth rate, the output gap seemed to be

 close to zero.

 With respect to prices, the member expressed the view that the

 increase in consumer price inflation to the lower-2 percent range had been

 led by temporary increases in prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries

 products, but core inflation was still running at the mid-1 percent range,

 and it was expected to run somewhat below the 2-percent target this year.

 The member then addressed the pattern of inflation running below the

 target despite an accommodative monetary policy in which the Base Rate

 was set lower than the neutral interest rate, pointing to two possible

 causes of this phenomenon. The first was a structural factor where the

 neutral interest rate suggested by the potential growth rate on the demand

 side was much lower than that on the supply side. The second factor was

 a possibility that the actual inflation expectations of economic agents had

 fallen substantially. The member stated that both reasons seemed to be

 affected not only by domestic factors, but also by global factors.

 The member noted that the output gap was close to zero and

 consumer price inflation was nearing 2 percent, which suggested a

 heightened need for narrowing the degree of monetary easing. The

 member, however, commented that the causes of low inflation had not yet

 been resolved. The member thus found it necessary to exercise caution in

 choosing the timing for adjusting the Base Rate, in order to carry out

 monetary policy in a manner consistent with the management of inflation

 expectations.

 With respect to financial stability, the member observed that household

 debt accumulation had increased the exposure of households to real estate

 price fluctuation risks, and thus there was an increased possibility that a

 drop in real estate prices could trigger macro risks, such as a decline in

 household consumption and contraction in the real economy, through the

5


-----

###### medium of debt. To stabilize household debt, the member judged it

 desirable to respond with micro-policy instruments first, considering that

 the overheating of real estate markets differed depending upon the region

 and its characteristics. With respect to the August 2 measures focused on

 preventing overheating in the new housing market and curbing the related

 buildup of mortgage lending, the member judged them as appropriate

 considering the rapid increase in household debt, particularly in the new

 housing market and smaller-sized apartment transaction market in the Seoul

 Metropolitan region over the past two years. The member’s assessment

 was that, in this regard, the signs of a slowdown in construction

 investment were positive from a financial stability perspective.

 One other member presented the view that it would be appropriate to

 hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting

 period.

 The member noted that the global economy had maintained its trend of

 recovery and the global trade volume had been improving slightly. The

 member also mentioned that the US Fed would likely normalize its

 monetary policy despite uncertainties regarding whether inflation could

 draw close to its target, and suggested that this was because the US labor

 market was strengthening and there were concerns about negative side

 effects from prolonged low interest rates.

 The member pointed out that Korea’s export volume had rebounded

 along with the global trade volume and had then started to show slower

 growth again. Korea’s financial markets had been generally stabilizing,

 while the FX market and foreign investment had been responding

 sensitively to geopolitical risks. The recovery of the domestic economy

 had not yet solidified, despite the sustained construction investment and

 the recently favorable facilities investment. Considering the effects of the

 supplementary budget, however, the member did not expect the economy

 to deviate far from the path forecast last July, and core inflation had

6


-----

###### remained within the mid-1 percent range while consumer price inflation

 had slightly exceeded its target. 

 Core inflation was low despite monetary easing, a fact that the

 member attributed to a number of factors, including the structural

 weakening of Korea’s exports and domestic demand due to changing

 global demand for trade goods, geopolitical factors, population aging, the

 slowdown in household income growth and increased savings in line with

 the surging household debt and income imbalances. With all of this taken

 into consideration, the member assessed that the current real economic

 growth rate was not falling short of its potential.

 The member stated that in this situation, accommodative monetary

 policy had not led to a change in the medium-term trend of growth and

 inflation, and financial imbalances had been swelling excessively. In

 addition, a substantial portion of household debt had flowed into the

 housing market, suggesting that there was a strong likelihood of

 oversupply in the housing market from the end of this year to the year

 after next, a period when the number of newly completed apartments

 would rise sharply. In light of this, leverage did not seem to have been

 used effectively.

 Considering this situation, the member judged that the Bank of Korea

 would have to adjust its monetary policy stance in line with monetary

 policy normalization by advanced countries, but the situation was not

 sufficiently urgent to justify a change in course amid steadily escalating

 geopolitical risks. More time was needed to observe developments of the

 global economy and financial markets, movements of household debt, and

 the effects of the recent government measures to stabilize the housing

 market.

 One member, meanwhile, expressed the opinion that it would be

 appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for

 the intermeeting period.

###### The member stated that the domestic economy seemed to have

 sustained a strong recovery and was expected to continue to improve as

 forecast in July this year ─ although geopolitical risks related to North

 Korea and the changing relationship with China could act as negative

 factors, the global economic recovery and the government’s supplementary

 budget implementation were expected to serve as positive factors.

 Turning to inflation, the member noted that consumer price inflation

 had risen to slightly exceed its target of 2 percent, but this was expected

 to be short-lived owing to a lack of demand-side pressures driven by

 economic recovery.

 The member pointed out that the volatility of price variables in the

 financial and foreign exchange markets had increased, affected mainly by

 the North Korea risk and changes in expectations of major country

 monetary policies. The North Korea risk, in particular, had caused foreign

 portfolio investment to shift to a net outflow recently, despite Korea’s

 favorable external soundness. Although these changes were expected to

 have only limited impacts, the member urged that a close watch should be

 kept on how the high uncertainties of the North Korea risk would affect

 the financial and foreign exchange markets as well as the real economy.

 With regard to household lending, its growth was expected to slow,

 affected by the government measures to stabilize the real estate market

 and to curb household debt growth, but there remained deep concerns

 about the buildup of financial imbalances, including the sharp rise in

 household lending and the already high household debt ratio.

 Next, regarding how monetary policy should respond to this situation,

 the member pointed out that reducing the degree of monetary easing could

 be considered in economic and financial stability terms. Given the recently

 heightened uncertainty surrounding the growth path, the fact that further

 easing was not urgently needed in terms of inflation, and the effects of

 the government measures to curb household debt, however, the member

 stated that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level

8


-----

###### this time. Meanwhile, while closely examining developments of domestic

 and overseas economic conditions, attention should be paid to the degree

 and pace of monetary easing so as to maintain price and financial stability

 over a medium-term horizon.

 One member assessed that, in overall consideration of financial stability

 conditions and the real economic and inflation trends, it was advisable to

 keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25 percent for

 the intermeeting period.

 First, with regard to the real economy, the member stated that,

 although construction and facilities investment had gone through a gradual

 correction, the economy was estimated to have sustained growth generally

 consistent with the pace of potential growth, with exports maintaining a

 favorable recovery and private consumption continuing to recover

 gradually. The growth path for the second half of the year was not

 expected to deviate far from the path forecast last July, but upside and

 downside risks surrounding it were seen to have increased somewhat from

 a month earlier.

 Second, looking at inflation, the member mentioned that consumer

 price inflation had risen slightly above its target, affected chiefly by a rise

 in prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and by the effects

 of temporary electricity tariff cuts last year. Toward the fourth quarter of

 this year, however, inflation was expected to decline slightly to around the

 target level, with the base-period effects from temporary supply shocks and

 regulations fading away. Core inflation, meanwhile, had remained flat

 below 2 percent, and despite the recent economic recovery, demand-side

 inflation pressures were not seen to be significantly increasing in terms of

 various indicators such as core PCEPI and core inflation with regulated

 prices excluded.

 Third, with respect to the manufacturing sector, the member stated that

 the average capacity utilization ratio had rebounded and the sales to

9


-----

###### inventory ratio had remained low, but since export volumes and production

 had not exhibited solidly based growth, more time was needed to observe

 developments of the slack in the production sector. In the labor market,

 the slack in the labor force had continued to increase, with growth in the

 time gap more than offsetting the lack of substantial changes in the

 unemployment and participation gaps.

 Fourth, looking at financial stability conditions, the member noted that

 stock prices had fallen and market interest rate volatility had increased,

 due to the emergence of the North Korea risk and also to the net

 outflows of foreign portfolio investment, particularly of short-term funds

 such as those held by banks and global funds. In the credit market,

 meanwhile, corporate lending had not exhibited substantial growth despite

 the economic recovery, while household lending had maintained strong

 growth exceeding the nominal growth rate, led mainly by a rise in

 housing transactions and demand for lending prior to the implementation

 of stronger regulations.

 Another member expressed the opinion that, taking into consideration

 the recent overall macroeconomic conditions, it would be desirable to keep

 the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25 percent for the

 intermeeting period.

 First, the member stated that the relatively fast pace of economic

 recovery during the first quarter of the year seemed to have slowed

 somewhat since the second quarter. Although global trade growth had been

 accelerating, Korea’s export volume growth had been faltering since the

 second quarter. The worsening conflicts with China, in particular, had been

 having increasing negative impacts on Korea’s exports to China, and

 China’s continued travel regulations were weighing heavily on Korea’s

 services production growth. Meanwhile, despite a hike in the Consumer

 Expectation Index, indicators related to real-sector consumption had

 continued to exhibit only modest improvements, while construction

10


-----

###### investment was entering a correction phase after having surged over the

 last couple of years.

 Going forward, the member found it difficult to expect faster economic

 recovery for the time being, considering the negative effects of conflicts

 with China and the slowing trend of construction investment. The

 government’s supplementary budget was likely to expand aggregate

 demand, but its effects were difficult to predict, and geopolitical risks

 related to North Korea were recently increasing.

 The member noted that consumer price inflation was exceeding 2

 percent, influenced by hikes in prices of some agricultural, livestock and

 fisheries products and the electricity tariff cuts last year, but with one-off

 factors excluded, there were no signs of an increase in demand-side

 inflation pressures. Housing prices had also surged in Seoul and some

 other regions, but on a nationwide average basis, their growth remained at

 a level similar to consumer price inflation.

 The member also noted that household debt had continued to grow at

 a worrying pace, but considering the effects of the real estate measures

 announced on August 2 this year and the announcements of additional

 household debt measures, it seemed necessary to keep an eye on

 developments of related indicators. In this regard, the member found it

 advisable to maintain the current monetary easing stance so as to support

 the uptrend in prices and help achieve the inflation target, while keeping a

 close watch on whether household debt growth would make a soft-landing.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

 leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Board considers that the

 global economic recovery has continued to expand. Global financial

 market volatility has meanwhile increased somewhat, due mainly to

 changes in expectations related to the monetary policies of major

 countries and to geopolitical risks. Looking ahead the Board sees the

 global economic recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as

 the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, the

 directions of the US government's economic policies, the movements

 toward spreading trade protectionism, and geopolitical risks.

 □ The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth

 has continued, as exports have sustained their high rate of increase

 and consumption has recovered moderately although investment has

 temporarily slowed. Employment conditions have improved moderately,

 with the employment-to-population ratio having risen as the trend of

 year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed has

 expanded, centering around the manufacturing sector. Going forward

 domestic economic growth is expected to be generally in accord with

 the path projected in July. The Board judges that consumption will

12


-----

###### likely continue its moderate trend of recovery, due to the improvement

 in employment condition and to the execution of a supplementary

 budget. Facilities investment will likely be above the levels forecast in

 July, due to expanded IT industry investment. Exports are expected to

 fall below the July projection, however, as service exports have slowed

 owing to a decline in the number of foreign tourists, while

 construction investment will probably also be less than forecast, in

 consequence of real estate market stability.

 □ Consumer price inflation has risen to the lower-2% level, in line

 mainly with increases in the prices of agricultural, livestock and

 fisheries products and with the base effect from the reduction of

 electricity fees last year. Core inflation (with food and energy product

 prices excluded from the CPI) has stayed in the mid-1% range, and

 the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at

 the mid-2% level. Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer

 price inflation will for the time being fluctuate at around the 2%

 level, and for the year as a whole show the level (1.9%) projected in

 July. Core inflation appears likely to be in the mid- to upper-1%

 range.

 □ In the domestic financial markets price variable volatility has expanded,

 with stock prices, the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate and

 long-term market interest rates having fluctuated to considerable extents,

 in line with increases in geopolitical risks. Household lending has

 sustained its high rate of increase exceeding past years’ levels,

 although the amount of year-on-year increase has lessened somewhat.

 In the housing market, the trend of rising sales prices has slowed since

 the government’s announcement of housing market stabilization

 measures.

13


-----

###### □ Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to

 ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer

 price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term

 horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the

 inflationary pressures on the demand side are not expected to be high

 although the domestic economy is expected to show solid growth, the

 Board will maintain its stance of monetary policy accommodation. In

 this process it will closely monitor any changes in the monetary

 policies of major countries, conditions related to trade with major

 countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical

 risks.
