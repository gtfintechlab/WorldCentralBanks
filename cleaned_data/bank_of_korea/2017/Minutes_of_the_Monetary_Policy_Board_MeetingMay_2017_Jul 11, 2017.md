##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and

 International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the

 Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the
 global economic recovery had gained strength, with the growth momentum of the US economy recovering, and the trends of growth in the euro area, Japan and major emerging market economies all improving, boosted by global trade growth. Members also evaluated that international financial markets had remained stable, with the trend of rising stock prices continuing.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that, while
 private consumption still marked time, the pace of growth had expanded, led by exports and investment.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members
 mentioned that, despite North Korea-related geopolitical risks, inflows of foreign portfolio investment had continued, stock prices had risen and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate had declined.

 As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had reached
 its 2-percent target level in April and core inflation had fallen slightly to the mid-1-percent range.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 changes in the domestic and international financial and economic

 environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current

 level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.

 One member expressed the opinion that the Bank of Korea should keep

 a close watch on changes in financial and economic conditions at home

 and abroad, and developments of domestic and overseas risk factors and

 their impacts, while maintaining the Base Rate at its current 1.25-percent

 level for the intermeeting period. First, the member anticipated that the

 economic growth rate would continue to be slightly above the April

 outlook. The member then presented the view that, although there were

 potential downside risks to growth, such as increased protectionism,

 monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, and geopolitical

 risks, growth would likely be supported by continuing global economic

 recovery, improvement in economic sentiment, and the new administration’s

 expansionary fiscal policy. Second, the member noted that consumer price

 inflation had remained at the 2-percent target in April as well, and this

 trend would likely continue for the time being. The member commented

 that, although core inflation had fallen slightly in April, it was unlikely to

 deviate greatly from 1.7-percent April projection for the year as a whole.

 Third, concerning financial conditions, the member noted that, although

 household lending in April had grown faster than most years, the pace of

 growth had decelerated compared to 2016. The member then expressed the

 opinion that it was necessary to wait and see whether household lending

 growth would continue to slow, considering that the extent of the

 deceleration in household lending growth was not yet large, and that the

###### stock of new apartments available for sale was expected to show solid

 growth. The member noted that, although the financial markets were

 showing stable movements overall, some had raised the concern that

 market participants’ perceptions of risks were excessively optimistic, and

 against this backdrop, a small shock could greatly heighten price variable

 volatility. Accordingly, the member pointed out the need to keep a careful

 watch on developments such as political uncertainties in the US, and risks

 related to North Korea’s nuclear tests. The member, meanwhile, noted the

 need for close examination of the impacts of the new administration’s

 economic policy on the conditions for the conduct of monetary policy,

 such as macroeconomic and financial stability conditions. For instance, the

 member noted that an expansionary fiscal policy could work to reduce the

 need for the prolonged accommodative monetary policy stance to support

 economic recovery, and the government’s household debt measures could

 reduce financial stability risk, thus providing more room for the Bank of

 Korea to flexibly conduct its monetary policy in line with changes in

 macroeconomic conditions. 

 Another member maintained the opinion presented at the previous

 meeting that, while keeping the Base Rate unchanged at its current

 1.25-percent level for the intermeeting period, the Bank of Korea should

 keep a close eye on the extent to which the recent export recovery

 spreads to the Korean economy as a whole. The member noted that the

 trend of world economic recovery had been spreading since the second

 half of last year, and the gradual monetary policy normalization in the US

 was proceeding smoothly. Accordingly, the member saw that foreign

 demand and the relevant manufacturing production in the Korean economy

 were gradually increasing, led by semiconductors and petrochemical

 products. The member also noted that facilities investment was maintaining

 a faster-than-expected pace of recovery. In addition, the member judged

 that construction investment, which had increased rapidly for the past two

 years together with household debt, remained buoyant. The member then

4


-----

###### expressed the view that, if these recent economic movements continued,

 economic growth in Korea could exceed 2.6 percent, the forecast made in

 April by the Research Department of the Bank of Korea. However, the

 member noted that, since the recent positive changes in conditions had

 been led by some export industries, it was hard to say that spillover

 effects were spreading to the economy as a whole. The member pointed

 out that, while there had been a significant rebound in the consumer

 sentiment index, which had previously plunged from the fourth quarter of

 last year, consumption-related real indicators still remained weak, and such

 lackluster consumption demand had been acting as a constraint in reversing

 the trend of decline in underlying inflation, which had fallen to the

 mid-1% range for the past two years. Therefore, the member judged it

 desirable to maintain the current level of monetary policy accommodation

 to ensure that underlying inflation approaches the target level, as a

 recovery in foreign demand would be linked to consumption demand. The

 member noted that, in this process, it was necessary to keep a close

 watch on how the Korean macroeconomy would be affected in the future

 by the policy direction of the new administration, by any adjustment in

 the housing market, which is linked with household debt, and by changes

 in the intensity of China’s tourism restrictions on Korea.

 One other member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to

 keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25 percent for

 the intermeeting period. The member noted that uncertainties regarding

 estimates of the GDP and inflation gaps had increased since the global

 financial crisis, and added that, in the case of the GDP gap, it seemed

 difficult to estimate it via the same method used in the past, due to

 fast-changing global demand, the long-term downward trend of exports and

 resulting slowdown in domestic demand, and the degree of preparation for

 population aging. The member also assessed that the link between inflation

 and the GDP gap seemed to have weakened, with economic rent to

 certain industries and businesses firmly entrenched due to the concentration

5


-----

###### of consumption expenditures on them and due to their consequent

 monopolies. The member argued that, as mentioned above, when these

 criteria are unclear, it is necessary to examine the results of recent policies

 before assessing their appropriateness. The member mentioned that the

 accommodative policy stance had been maintained to achieve the inflation

 target, in order to narrow the GDP gap and provide time for restructuring.

 The member noted that such monetary accommodation had propelled

 economic activities in the short term but had not led to a rise in core

 inflation, and financial imbalances had increased steadily. With regard to

 financial instability, the member noted that a substantial part of household

 debt had been held by those with higher credit ratings and higher

 incomes, and on average all income quintile groups had maintained

 positive net financial assets, and therefore this seemed unlikely to spread

 to systemic risk. However, the member went on to point out that housing

 market conditions should be taken into consideration since a substantial

 part of household debt was from housing construction, and the gap

 between the increased demand in the housing market through liabilities and

 the actual final demand would determine the degree of financial instability.

 Meanwhile, the member expressed the view that, if the US Federal

 Reserve normalizes its interest rates with global demand picking up, this

 would boost exports, leading to upward adjustments of neutral interest

 rates, and if the spillover effects of exports are sufficient to increase

 consumption, responding with an interest rate hike could contain the

 buildup of financial instability without causing substantial changes to the

 current accommodative monetary policy stance. However, the member went

 on to state that more careful considerations of exports’ spillover effects on

 domestic demand and of developments of financial instability were needed

 before adjusting the monetary policy stance, and expressed the view that it

 would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25

 percent for the intermeeting period.

 Meanwhile, one member expressed the opinion that it would be

6


-----

###### appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged in May. The member’s

 assessment was that, in the real sector, exports had been stronger than

 expected with a boom in the global semiconductor industry, leading the

 strong growth in Korea’s facilities investment, particularly in the

 semiconductor industry. Meanwhile, the member noted that private

 consumption had remained stagnant despite strong exports and facilities

 investment and improvements in the consumer sentiment index, and added

 that whether consumption would recover would be the key to forecasting

 how far this year’s growth rate would exceed its April forecast of 2.6

 percent. Next, with regard to inflation, the member noted that, although

 the real economy had been exceeding its forecast path, inflation had

 remained close to its original projection. The member went on to evaluate

 the price path for this year as thus far unlikely to greatly exceed its

 originally forecast path. However, the member mentioned that the need for

 a reexamination of the future path of consumer price inflation had grown

 significantly due to the sustained improvements in the real economy. In

 line with this, the member said that attention should be paid to whether

 and how much consumption, which had been stagnant, would recover, and

 to the global economic recovery and consequent developments of global

 price trends. Finally, in terms of financial stability, the member stated that,

 although having grown at a somewhat slower pace than in 2016,

 household debt maintained stronger growth than usual, and pointed out that

 there were concerns about the recent rapid growth of housing prices,

 particularly in Seoul and the surrounding area, and the substantial amount

 of stock of new apartments planned for sale. Going forward, the member

 noted that it would be necessary to pay attention to the possibility that

 expectations regarding the new government and improvements in economic

 sentiment could lead to instability in the housing market, while monitoring

 the future trends of household debt. Concerning FX swap and FX market

 stability, meanwhile, the member’s assessment was that overall market

 conditions had remained normal and stable, with capital flows and prices

7

###### reflecting real economic conditions, while the sustained geopolitical risk

 and the US Federal Reserve’s rate hike stance had only limited effects on

 the flows of global investment funds into Korea and related price

 variables. Taking these points into overall consideration, the member

 expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at

 its current level for the intermeeting period, while keeping a close watch on

 whether the real economy would grow further and the trends of the price

 path and household debt.

  Another member pointed out a number of major considerations for the

 appropriate conduct of monetary policy. First, the domestic real economy

 had continued to show gradual improvement, boosted by sustained strong

 exports and facilities investment and better-than-expected housing market

 activities and construction investment, which together offset the sluggish

 recovery of private consumption. As corporate performances were

 improving and economic sentiment was picking up, the effects of strong

 exports on domestic demand, including private consumption and

 employment, were expected to take shape gradually, albeit in a limited

 manner. Second, with regard to prices, while personal service inflation had

 been on a gradual rise, growth in overall core inflation-related indexes had

 decelerated. This implied that, despite improvements in economic activities,

 demand-side inflationary pressures remained weak due to the limited

 spillover effects on inflation due to overall domestic demands, and

 accordingly a careful watch would be needed on future spillovers of prices

 and core inflation trends. Third, the slack in manufacturing production

 seemed to have improved, albeit gradually, with the average capacity

 utilization rate rebounding in line with the rate of growth in manufacturing

 production continuing to exceed the growth in its capacity. Meanwhile, the

 overall slack in the labor market worsened somewhat, as the

 unemployment and time gaps widened, which more than offset the

 narrowing of the participation gap in accordance with a year-on-year

 decrease in the number of potential job seekers. Fourth, with regard to

8


-----

###### financial stability conditions, short-term and long-term market rates and

 corporate bond spreads showed stable movements, while foreign portfolio

 investment inflows continued with the sustained risk appetite in the

 international financial markets. However, the member pointed out that it

 would be necessary to prepare for the risk of a shift from the low

 volatility regime of major asset prices to a higher volatility regime, as risk

 aversion sentiment against emerging market assets could strengthen again if

 market expectations of the Trump administration’s policies weaken and the

 US Fed begins to discuss in earnest plans to reduce its asset holdings. In

 addition, despite the government measures to strengthen supervision,

 household debt remained on a steep rise. Since construction activities were

 likely to remain favorable for the time being and the stock of new

 apartments available for sale was rising, it would be difficult to rule out

 the possibility of a continued increase in the household debt-to-income

 ratio. In overall consideration of the above-mentioned real economic and

 inflation trends and financial stability conditions, the member assessed that

 it was advisable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level

 of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.

 One other member expressed the opinion that it would be advisable to

 hold the Base Rate at its current level at this time. The member’s

 assessment was that the growth rate for this year was likely to exceed the

 April forecast of 2.6 percent, as the global economy and trade had

 continued to show recovery and, looking at the domestic economy,

 facilities and construction investment and exports had shown favorable

 movements. The member also mentioned that there existed upside risks,

 including expectations of the new government’s economic policy and a

 possibility that China would ease its trade restrictions. In addition, the

 member pointed out that consumer price inflation had risen by 1.9 percent

 year-on-year in April as well, remaining near its 2-percent target.

 However, the member argued that the current accommodative monetary

 policy stance should be maintained, as more time seemed to be needed for

9

###### private consumption to recover, the output gap remained negative, and

 consumer price inflation was unlikely to exceed its target for the time

 being. Furthermore, the member pointed out the need to bear in mind that

 downside risks could arise due to destabilizing factors, such as moves to

 strengthen trade protectionism and geopolitical risks, and the member also

 stated that there was a need to closely monitor and analyze the global

 economy. The member expressed the view that, although the domestic

 financial markets had remained stable overall and foreign bond and

 portfolio investment had continued to flow in, it would be necessary to

 constantly examine the effects of the US Fed’s rate hikes and geopolitical

 risks. Meanwhile, the member stressed that, while household debt growth

 seemed to have slowed gradually due chiefly to the government’s risk

 management efforts, the trends of housing markets, including the market

 for new apartments, should be closely monitored.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

 leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Board considers that the

 global economic recovery has continued to expand. The global

 financial markets have shown generally stable movements, with for

 example the trend of rising stock prices continuing. Looking ahead the

 Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by

 factors such as the directions of the US government's economic

 policies, the pace of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal

 Reserve, the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, and

 political uncertainties in major countries.

 □ The Board judges that the trend of domestic economic growth has

 expanded, as exports and investment have improved although the pace

 of increase in consumption has remained weak. On the employment

 front, the number of persons employed has continued to rise

 significantly year-on-year, although the unemployment rate has also

 risen as job search activities have increased. Going forward, domestic

 economic growth is expected to be slightly above the path projected in

 April. The Board judges that consumption will likely continue its

 modest trend of growth, but that the trends of improvement in exports

 and investment should expand compared to the April forecasts.

 □ Consumer price inflation has continued at the 2% target level, in line

 mainly with increases in the prices of petroleum and agricultural,

 livestock and fisheries products. Core inflation (with food and energy

 product prices excluded from the CPI) has fallen slightly to the

 mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public

11


-----

###### has remained at the mid-2% level. Looking ahead the Board expects

 that consumer price inflation will for the time being fluctuate at

 around the 2% level, and for the year as a whole not diverge greatly

 from the April projection (1.9%). Core inflation appears likely to show

 a level in the mid- to upper-1% range.

 □ In the domestic financial markets the trend of stability has continued,

 with stock prices rising and the volatility of long-term market interest

 rates showing a low level, in reflection of global financial market

 movements. After having risen, owing in part to the emergence of

 geopolitical risks, the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen

 as political uncertainties domestically and abroad have eased.

 Household lending has sustained its high rate of increase exceeding

 past years’ levels, although the amount of increase has shown signs of

 lessening, centering around banks. Housing sales prices have exhibited

 slight upward movements, centering around Seoul and its surrounding

 areas.

 □ Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to

 ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer

 price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term

 horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the

 inflationary pressures on the demand side are not expected to be high

 although the trend of domestic economic growth is likely to expand

 somewhat, the Board will maintain its stance of monetary policy

 accommodation. In this process it will closely monitor the progress of

 monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, conditions

 related to trade with major countries, the directions of the new

 government's economic policies, the trend of increase in household

 debt, and geopolitical risks.
