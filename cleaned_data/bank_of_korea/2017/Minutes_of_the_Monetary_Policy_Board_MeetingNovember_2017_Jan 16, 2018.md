##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and

 International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the

 Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

 Members’ assessment was that the global economy had been continuing

 to recover and the global trade recovery had been expanding. Members

 also evaluated that the global financial markets had been showing stable

 movements overall.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that

 private consumption was continuing to recovery moderately, with exports

 sustaining their trend of solid recovery and facilities investment

 maintaining favorable movements. Members also assessed that the trend of

 real economic growth had been sustained, with the North Korea risk and

 the possibility of deterioration in trade conditions with China easing

 somewhat and sentiment indices improving.

 Members noted that inflation had fallen slightly short of the 2-percent

 target, but it was forecast to gradually approach the target level and

 fluctuate at around 2 percent. 

 As to the domestic financial markets, members stated that the markets

 had been stable overall. Members also noted that, although the household

 lending growth was slowing somewhat, it was still high compared to past

 years, and thus a close watch should be kept on the accumulation of

 financial imbalances.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall

 consideration of the changes in the domestic and international financial and

 economic environments, it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate by

 25 basis points from its current level for the intermeeting period.

 One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to raise

 the Base Rate to 1.5 percent this month.

 The member noted that, in the real sector, the pace of economic

 growth was accelerating, boosted for instance by strong exports, favorable

 facilities investment, and the sustained moderate recovery in private

 consumption, and the real economy had been sustaining its trend of solid

 growth even after October. The member saw that the expanded recovery

 in global trade, in particular, amid strengthened improvements in world

 economic activity had been driving the positive movements of the Korean

 economy. The member went on to comment that there was a possibility of

 further improvements in the external real economic environment, thanks for

 instance to improved conditions related to trade with China. The member

 evaluated that, since private consumption had been continuing to improve

 modestly, a faster recovery in private consumption could be expected, but

 strong exports were still having limited spillover effects on domestic

 demand. The member then projected that GDP growth for 2017 was very

 likely to exceed the Bank of Korea Research Department’s October

 outlook of 3.0 percent.

 With respect to inflation, meanwhile, the member stated that

 inflationary pressures had still not yet clearly materialized, and with the

 price path showing little reactivity to real economic trends, low inflation

 had recently been a common problem for not only Korea, but also major

3


-----

###### advanced economies, and had been the focus of discussion and concern

 for monetary authorities. With respect to the causes of this phenomenon,

 the member explained that inflationary pressures might be small, despite

 faster growth, since the output gap was still close to zero; inflationary

 adjustments might be restrained due to intensified global competition and

 e-commerce growth; and persistently low inflation might have caused a fall

 in inflation expectations. The member then expressed the opinion that,

 since all these factors seemed to be at work to some extent in Korea, the

 rise in inflation was very likely to be gradual going forward.

 The member noted that there were two implications related to the

 policy rate decision in light of macroeconomic trends. First, real economic

 trends implied that the factors that had caused a decline in the real neutral

 interest rate since the global financial crisis were gradually disappearing,

 and thus if the Base Rate were held at the current level, the degree of

 monetary easing would likely increase automatically. Therefore, it would

 be appropriate to raise the Base Rate in reflection of this point. Second,

 given no clear materialization of inflationary pressures, the monetary policy

 stance should also be shifted at a gradual pace while checking the

 movements of the price path, and it should be constantly reviewed

 whether price inflation was approaching the target level in a stable

 manner.

 The member expressed the view that, taking these points into overall

 consideration, the factors favoring a hike in the Base Rate as discussed at

 the last Monetary Policy Board meeting had been confirmed by economic

 trends, and so it was appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.50 percent.

 The member added that the Board should also consider an additional Base

 Rate hike in the future, but in choosing the timing for the additional hike,

 the focus should be placed on the price path rather than real economic

 trends.

 Another member agreed to some extent with the recognition that, with

 respect to the recent macroeconomic trends, the time was approaching to

4


-----

###### reflect on the accommodative monetary policy which had been continuing

 for the past years, and to give careful thought to the future monetary

 policy direction. The member expressed the view that, while the

 accommodative monetary policy thus far had been working as a factor

 causing faster growth in household debt, it was assessed to have

 contributed greatly to easing deflation concerns by limiting the possibility

 of further deterioration in domestic economic activity amid difficult

 economic environments at home and abroad.

 The member noted that Korea’s export recovery was gradually

 solidifying due to the consolidation of the world economic recovery, and

 there were positive factors for domestic demand, such as the government’s

 plans for expansionary fiscal policy and the easing of concerns about the

 North Korea risk. The member thus assessed downside risks to the

 macroeconomy to be diminishing somewhat overall.

 The member, however, noted that there was significant spare capacity

 in the labor market, that aggregate demand was still not sufficient as

 underlying price inflation was running well below the 2-percent target

 level, and that the spillover effects of the export recovery on domestic

 demand, employment and prices were relatively unlikely to be great, since

 the recovery was concentrated in some capital-intensive industries, such as

 semiconductors. The member stated the opinion that, given these factors, it

 still seemed uncertain as to whether the Korean economy had reached a

 state of soundness that necessitated an immediate reduction of the degree

 of monetary accommodation. The member pointed out that a rapid

 tightening under these conditions could cause a risk of difficulties in

 converging underlying price inflation to the target level, and could also

 work to reduce maneuvering room for a flexible interest rate policy going

 forward.

 The member noted that the continuation of accommodative monetary

 policy could impose a burden by allowing financial imbalances to

 accumulate, represented by household debt growth, but assessed that the

5


-----

###### current composition of household debt was unlikely to undermine the

 soundness of major financial institutions and thereby threaten the overall

 financial markets. The member then commented that a close watch should

 be kept on changes in the housing market, which had contracted since the

 August 2 measures, and changes in household debt should also be closely

 monitored. The member went on to emphasize that, from a more

 fundamental point of view, financial stability should be pursued first

 through macroprudential policy, and financial stability would be furthered

 by reducing as much as possible the chance of undermining price stability,

 which is the primary objective of monetary policy.

 The member expressed the view that, taking these points into overall

 consideration, it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current

 level for the month, while monitoring the degree of positive effects of

 recent changes in conditions on the Korean economy, given the need for a

 cautious approach to changing the monetary policy stance at this juncture.

 The member went on to express the opinion that an adjustment to the

 degree of the monetary policy accommodation should be decided prudently

 such that the convergence of underlying price inflation to the target level

 is not undermined.

 One other member presented the view that it would be appropriate to

 raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 1.50 percent this month.

 The member noted that the global economy had maintained its trend of

 recovery, and investment and exports had induced improvement in

 consumption, although such improvement had been relatively limited. The

 member also stated that, due to several structural problems, it was unclear

 how long this trend of recovery would last.

 The member mentioned that the Korean economy had continued to

 exhibit growth in line with its forecast path, exports and investment

 seemed to have led consumption gradually, and it was the right time to

 reexamine the appropriateness of the current accommodative monetary

 policy stance. In particular, the member presented the view that there was

6


-----

###### a need to examine the trade-off between the pace at which financial

 imbalances widened and the speed at which the inflation gap narrowed.

 First, concerning the output gap, the member noted that, according to the

 estimation of the potential growth rate in terms of both consumption and

 incomes, the output gap was seen to have already turned positive. Second,

 with regard to financial imbalances, the member argued that financial

 liabilities had been growing rapidly under the accommodative monetary

 policy, and that if the degree of policy accommodation exceeds the level

 that the economic structure can utilize optimally, this could lead to

 inefficiency of resource allocation. Third, regarding the inflation gap, the

 rate of growth in prices of items influenced by domestic demand pressures

 had already remained in the range of 2 to 2.5 percent, but that of items

 whose prices were determined by items such as industrial and agricultural,

 livestock & fisheries products had been fluctuating around the target of 2

 percent. The member also pointed out that, as domestic demand pressures

 were expected to grow steadily next year while the average OECD

 inflation rate was forecast to somewhat exceed 2 percent due largely to a

 rise in global commodity prices, inflation was likely to fluctuate at around

 its target of 2 percent, and added that the survey on inflation expectations

 had also shown that economic agents seemed to be well aware of the

 2-percent inflation target.

 The member expressed the view that, in conclusion, it would be

 appropriate to reduce monetary easing somewhat while price stability was

 being secured to some extent, in order to prevent financial imbalances

 from expanding further and harmonize monetary policy with the

 government’s fiscal policy to be implemented going forward. The member

 went on to argue that, with such policy harmonization, it would be

 desirable to anchor the Korean economy at its potential growth rate, which

 had decreased, so as to promote medium-term price stability.

 One member, meanwhile, expressed the opinion that it would be

 appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.50 percent from the current 1.25

7


-----

###### percent this month.

 The member stated that, looking at the recent economic situation, the

 domestic economy seemed to have sustained a strong recovery, boosted by

 the global economic recovery. The member mentioned that, compared with

 the October forecast, the GDP growth rate for the third quarter had been

 higher than projected, major downside risks such as North Korea-related

 geopolitical risks and the possibility of a continued worsening of trade

 relations with China had eased, and sentiment indexes for economic agents

 in the private sector seemed to have been improving. The member also

 expressed the view that, despite this economic situation, inflationary

 pressures had not yet appeared, considering the global low inflation due to

 structural factors, the time lag in the transmission of business activities to

 prices, and the current output gap remaining at near zero, as Fed Chair

 Yellen had acknowledged when she referred to low inflation as a

 ‘mystery’. However, the member stated that consumer price inflation and

 core inflation were forecast to remain close to their target of 2 percent on

 average this year and the next.

 The member noted that, looking at financial markets, market interest

 rates and stock prices had risen, the won had been strengthening, and

 household debt had continued to exhibit a slowdown in growth. The

 member stated, however, that household debt still remained high and, as

 showed by the results of the systemic risk survey conducted in the second

 half of 2017, continued to be considered the largest risk factor facing the

 Korean economy.

 Next, regarding how monetary policy should respond to this situation,

 the member noted that the Korean economy had maintained strong growth

 at or slightly exceeding its potential growth level, and inflation was

 overall unlikely to deviate far from its target. The member went on to

 state that an excessive degree of monetary easing could trigger credit

 growth and push up asset prices, imposing burdens on promoting financial

 stability, and in this regard it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate

8


-----

###### slightly by 25 basis points. 

 One member assessed that it would be necessary to adjust the degree

 of monetary easing and raise the Base Rate to 1.50 percent from the

 current 1.25 percent. With regard to the timing of the rate hike, the

 member expressed the view that it would be more desirable to monitor

 financial and FX market conditions at the end of the year and raise the

 rate early in 2018 when the economic forecasts start to take shape, but

 the member also agreed with the idea of moving the rate hike forward a

 month or two by raising the rate this month. The member went on to

 stress that, after raising the rate, it would be necessary to take time to

 closely examine financial stability conditions, including trends of business

 activities, inflation and household debt.

 The member assessed that, with the global economy continuing to

 improve, the Korean economy had maintained its trend of recovery led by

 exports, and private consumption had been recovering at a modest pace.

 The member added that the Korean economy was expected to sustain GDP

 growth at its potential level in 2018 and 2019, with the recovery of

 private consumption solidifying, household income conditions picking up,

 and employment conditions showing gradual improvement, particularly in

 the services sector. With regard to inflation, the member mentioned that

 consumer price inflation had been fluctuating around its target of 2.0

 percent for this year and core inflation had remained below 2 percent, but

 if the economic recovery continued next year, underlying inflation was

 expected to rise gradually. The member also took the view that the

 economy seemed to have reached the point where the degree of monetary

 accommodation could be reduced, as the output gap had been originally

 forecast to turn positive in the second half of 2018 but was likely to do

 so earlier, boosted by the recent faster-than-expected GDP growth, and the

 inflation gap was expected to narrow with consumer price inflation and

 core inflation having nearly reached their targets.

 In terms of financial stability, the member noted that it was now

9


-----

###### necessary to cope with the accumulation of financial imbalances caused by

 the recent accommodative monetary policy, and stressed that if the need to

 maintain the accommodative policy in terms of business activities and

 inflation had decreased somewhat, more attention should be paid to dealing

 with the buildup of financial imbalances, such as household debt. The

 member took the view that reducing the degree of monetary easing could

 raise concerns about the household debt burdens of vulnerable borrowers,

 but the member expressed the hope that the aggressive measures

 announced by the government to address the problems facing vulnerable

 groups would take effect.

 With regard to financial and FX markets, the member mentioned that,

 while stock prices and market interest rates had risen, the exchange rate

 had fallen significantly, affected chiefly by the current account surplus

 caused by strong exports, and added that some had raised concerns that

 the rapid appreciation of the Korean won would negatively affect exports

 and other real economic sectors. The member went on to stress the need

 to closely monitor FX market trends going forward.

 One member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to

 raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 1.5 percent from the current

 1.25 percent this month and presented the following grounds for the hike.

 With regard to the real economy, the member noted that the growth

 momentum had been strengthening gradually; strong external demand had

 led exports and facilities investment, and private consumption had

 exhibited modest recovery, boosted chiefly by the effects of the

 supplementary budget and improved economic sentiment. The member also

 assessed that consumer price inflation had slowed and fallen below its

 target, due mainly to temporary supply-side factors, while core inflation

 had rebounded from the previous downward trend and overall remained

 close to the path forecast in October. In terms of slack in the production

 sector, the member mentioned that the average capacity utilization ratio

 had continued to decline, with production growth resulting from strong

10


-----

###### exports seen in some industries only, and as a result there had not been

 significant improvements in overall production slack, despite the economic

 recovery. The member went on to state that, in the labor market, with

 growth in the participation and time gaps more than offsetting a decrease

 in the unemployment gap, the slack in the labor force had increased but

 the pace of its growth had slowed for the second consecutive month.

 Looking at financial stability conditions, the member noted that, despite

 government measures, group loans to apartment purchasers, leasehold

 deposit loans and credit loans had steadily grown and maintained stronger

 growth than in normal years, and that corporate loans had also increased

 ─ individual entrepreneur loans and loans to real estate-related sectors in

 particular ─ and the real-estate exposures of private sector credit had

 continued to increase accordingly.

 The member expressed the view that, in overall consideration of real

 economic and inflation trends and financial stability conditions, the fact

 that the upward movement of the growth path had helped eliminate the

 negative output gap earlier than expected and brought about a rebound of

 core inflation indicated that it was appropriate to slightly adjust the degree

 of monetary easing in comparison to the neutral interest rate. The member

 went on to state that, despite this adjustment, the real interest rate

 remained below the neutral interest rate and the finance-neutral natural

 interest rate, leading to the conclusion that accommodative financial

 conditions could be maintained. The member also argued that, as

 comprehensive household debt measures would take effect gradually with a

 time lag, the household debt-to-income ratio that had already restricted

 consumption would continue to rise for the time being, and mentioned that

 the risk of total private sector credit, including corporate loans, being

 concentrated in real estate-related areas was likely to remain high. With

 regard to monetary policy operation, the member argued that there was a

 growing need to preemptively consider the possibility that the buildup of

 financial imbalances could restrict appropriate consumption channels,

11


-----

###### leading to inefficient resource allocation and undermining the bank

 intermediary function in the medium and long term, having negative

 impacts on future economic welfare.

 Concerning the future monetary policy direction, the member took the

 view that it would be necessary to maintain the current monetary easing

 stance until inflation became firmly entrenched and the forecast that inflation

 would converge to its target became stronger. The member went on to point

 out that whether, and how fast, additional Base Rate adjustments should be

 made needed to be carefully determined in consideration of changes in core

 inflation, the degree of private consumption recovery and the effects of

 changes in the global financial cycle on the real neutral interest rate.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, members

 compiled a statement reflecting the views of the majority.

 However, Dr. Dongchul Cho expressed clear opposition to the idea of

 raising the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point, and argued for

 holding it at its current level.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

###### raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.25% to 1.50%, for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Board considers that the

 global economic recovery has continued to expand. The global

 financial markets have shown stable movements, with stock prices

 displaying moderate upward trends for example. Looking ahead the

 Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by

 factors such as the paces of monetary policy normalization in major

 countries, the directions of the US government's economic policies, and

 the movements toward spreading trade protectionism.

 □ The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth

 has continued, as private consumption has improved moderately and

 investment has shown favorable movements, while exports have

 sustained their high rate of increase. The trend of improvement in

 employment conditions has shown signs of weakening somewhat, with

13


-----

###### the pace of increase in the number of persons employed in the service

 sector having slowed for example. Going forward, the Board expects

 that domestic economic growth will be slightly above the rate

 projected in October, as domestic demand activities including

 consumption and facilities investment continue their trends of moderate

 improvement, and exports also sustain their buoyancy thanks largely to

 the pickup in the global economic recovery and the improved

 conditions related to trade with China.

 □ Consumer price inflation has slowed to the upper-1% level, in

 consequence mainly of declines in the extents of increase in the

 prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and the

 disappearance of the base effect from the reduction of electricity fees

 last year. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices

 excluded from the CPI) has been rising slightly in the mid-1% range,

 and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has stayed at

 the mid-2% level. Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer

 price inflation will be in the mid-1% range for some time and then

 gradually approach the target level. Core inflation will also rise

 gradually.

 □ Although long-term market interest rates have risen, due to changes in

 expectations related to monetary policy, the domestic financial markets

 have shown generally stable movements, with stock prices continuing

 to rise in line for example with improvements in corporate

 performances. The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has meanwhile

 fallen, owing chiefly to the strengthening recovery of the domestic

 economy. The rate of increase in household lending is slowing

 somewhat, but is still sustaining a high level compared to past years.

 Housing sales prices have risen faster in some parts of Seoul and its

 surrounding areas, although their uptrend has in general slowed since

14


-----

###### the government's announcement of housing market stabilization

 measures.

 □ Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to

 ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer

 price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term

 horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast

 that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the

 time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its

 solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary

 policy stance. In this process it will judge carefully whether it is

 necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further,

 while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends. It

 will also carefully monitor any changes in the monetary policies of

 major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the

 trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.
