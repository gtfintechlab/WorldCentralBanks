##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and

 International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the

 Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the
 US economy had shown strong growth, the euro area had maintained its gradual improvement, and the Chinese economy had sustained its stable growth. Members also evaluated that international financial markets had been stable overall, with Treasury bond yields exhibiting slower growth and stock prices rising, particularly in advanced countries, as the anxiety that had followed the US presidential election and US Fed’s rate hike eased. However, members assessed that the Chinese yuan and some EME currencies had weakened significantly and remained highly volatile.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that
 domestic demand had shown weaker improvement due to the sluggishness of facilities investment and manufacturing production, which had more than offset the recovery in exports.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members
 mentioned that long-term market interest rates had fallen and stock prices had risen with the stabilization of the international financial markets, but the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate had remained highly volatile and bank household lending had declined.

 As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had risen to
 a level of around 1½ percent in the fourth quarter with international oil and agricultural product prices increasing, and that core inflation had stood at a little above the 1½ percent level.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 changes in the domestic and international financial and economic

 environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current

 level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.

 One member pointed out a number of major considerations for the

 appropriate conduct of monetary policy. First, with regard to the domestic

 real economy, the member stated that, although economic sentiment had

 withered due to the heightened uncertainties at home and abroad, domestic

 demand had sustained gradual growth and exports had shown improvement,

 but uncertainties surrounding the future growth path had increased even

 further. Second, the member stated that consumer price inflation had

 accelerated in the fourth quarter of last year, boosted largely by hikes in

 oil and agricultural product prices, while core inflation had slowed due

 mainly to a slower pace of growth in industrial product prices. The

 member also noted that consumer price inflation was expected to

 accelerate, and inflation pressures were forecast to weaken somewhat

 toward the end of the year with the lapse of supply-side factors. Third,

 the member argued that substantial slack in the manufacturing sector had

 improved somewhat, as demand-side pressures from facilities investment

 had rebounded and the average capacity utilization ratio had risen with the

 sluggishness in the manufacturing sector easing somewhat, but that

 improvement in the slack in the labor force had continued to slow with

 the time gap, including the time-related underemployed, increasing slightly.

 In terms of financial conditions, the member stated that, as surges in

 market interest rates after the US presidential election had eased, the

 spread between long- and short-term yields and corporate bond credit


-----

###### spreads had narrowed somewhat, foreign equity investment had shifted to a

 net inflow and outflows of bond investment had stabilized, but the

 potential instability of securities fund flows had heightened due to the

 narrowing of the gap between domestic and overseas interest rates. With

 regard to household credit, the member noted that non-bank lending had

 maintained strong growth and therefore a careful watch should be kept on

 the effects of stronger prudential regulations on the non-banking sector.

 Concerning corporate credit, meanwhile, the downturn phase of the

 corporate credit cycle had continued owing to the sharp decreases at both

 large corporations and SMEs and to sustained net corporate bond

 redemptions.

 Based on these considerations, the member stated that it should be borne

 in mind that, although there seemed to be a need for additional monetary

 easing in macroeconomic terms, domestic and external uncertainties and

 financial stability risks had also increased further, and at this point in time

 keeping the Base Rate at its current level was considered to have larger

 benefits than adjusting it, in consideration of the following points. First, a

 substantial part of the negative output gap had been attributable to a shortage

 of external demand and was therefore difficult to address through Base Rate

 adjustments, and the global manufacturing sector and the terms of trade were

 showing signs of recovery and their future trends needed to be monitored. In

 addition, the member emphasized that global reflationary pressures had been

 transmitted to the domestic economy and also that consumer price inflation

 was very likely to near its target this year. In addition, the member noted

 that, with the Base Rate below the neutral interest rate, the tightening of

 financial conditions following a rise in long-term interest rates was not yet at

 a concerning level, and that long-term interest rates, having been lowered

 excessively due chiefly to the effects of advanced countries’ quantitative

 easing, had been normalized to some extent, which would have the positive

 effects of curbing the exposure of the financial system to real estate risks and


-----

###### the risk of further debt leveraging.

 In this regard, the member argued that it would be desirable to keep the

 Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period and

 retain policy space, while closely examining how developments of domestic

 and external risk factors would affect the future growth and price paths.

 Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to

 keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting

 period. The member mentioned that, in the current circumstances, the growth

 rate was forecast to reach a level of around 2½ percent and consumer price

 inflation to near its target of 2 percent this year, but continued attention

 needed to be paid to how the Korean economy would be affected by changes

 in the real and financial markets following US rate hikes. The member

 assessed the US rate hikes begun two years ago as having strengthened the

 synchronization of medium-term interest rates between Korea and the US and

 caused the intersection of the yield curves to move toward the short-term

 one, and as a result, foreign investment funds had been redeemed, adding to

 capital outflows. With these points taken into consideration, the member

 expected that, in the case of US rate hikes led by US economic

 improvement, the US yield curve would move upward and the Korean yield

 curve would steepen up to the point of medium-term rates, contributing to

 some easing of the inefficient distribution of funds that had threatened

 financial stability. The member also pointed out that if a recovery of exports

 works to improve the real economy, this would cause the neutral interest rate

 to rise, which would not bring about significant changes under the current

 monetary easing policy. The member also took the view that, while exports

 were picking up in accordance with the global economic recovery, it would

 be necessary to promote structural reform rapidly and rearrange medium- and

 long-term strategies to create an environment in which households can shift

 from leveraged spending to income-based spending, and also to continue to

 prepare for population ageing through overseas investment. The member

 assessed current global downside risks as somewhat large and mentioned that


-----

###### if these risks materialize, policies should be determined in consideration of

 the channels through which the risks would be transmitted to the Korean

 economy and also of what shape they would take. The member went on to

 stress that, amid global economic uncertainties and the need to pay attention

 to stability in the Korean financial markets, Korea’s monetary policy should

 focus on achieving the inflation target, the nominal anchor for the Korean

 economy.

 One other member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base

 Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, the Bank of Korea

 should keep a close watch on downside risks to the macroeconomy. The

 member noted that the world economy was sustaining its moderate recovery,

 and there had recently been signs of reflation. The member went on to

 comment that, accordingly, exports were shifting to an increase with export

 prices in Korea increasing, and consumer price inflation was gradually

 accelerating. The member also noted that the steep rises in market interest

 rates had eased, and foreign exchange supply and demand conditions remained

 stable. Against this backdrop, the member assessed that some positive

 movements had been observed. For instance, with the capacity utilization ratio

 recovering, particularly in the automobile industry, manufacturing production

 showed a relatively substantial rebound in November, and demand for

 semiconductors increased. The member, however, stated the need for paying

 further attention to downside risks to the macroeconomy overall. The member

 commented that, in contrast to the rebound in the manufacturing industry, the

 pace of growth in services production had slowed. The member also expected

 growth in the construction sector to slow, as the real estate market was

 stabilizing and the rapid increases in the housing supply would end this year.

 The member anticipated that a tangible recovery of the overall growth of the

 Korean economy was unlikely, despite a partial rebound in exports. The

 member then noted that, with such conditions making it difficult to be

 optimistic about the overall economy, underlying inflation was unlikely to

 converge toward the 2% target. Concerning household debt, the member


-----

###### expected it to continue to increase substantially in 2017 as well, given the

 already signed collective loans and the low interest rate environment. The

 member, however, expressed the opinion that, if the real estate market

 remained stable, the pace of increase in household debt was likely to slow

 gradually. Taking these factors into overall consideration, the member judged

 it desirable to maintain the Base Rate at its current level for the month, and

 to keep a close watch on economic developments and overall Korean

 macroeconomic trends, such as changes in household debt growth and the

 pace of the housing market slowdown. The member also presented the view

 that it was also desirable to maintain channels of communication with the

 fiscal authorities to prevent fiscal policy from tightening, while continuing

 cooperation with the financial authorities to ease the rapid increase in

 household debt.

 One member, meanwhile, took the view that it would be appropriate to

 keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period. With

 respect to the real economy, the member noted that, as for production

 indicators, the index of all industry production had risen after declining for

 two consecutive months, and the drastic decline in the average capacity

 utilization ratio in the manufacturing sector had stopped, while as for demand

 indicators, construction work value had shifted to an increase. The member

 noted that exports, in particular, had continued to grow in December after

 beginning to increase in November, and this was mainly attributable to

 industrial factors, such as a recovery of world semiconductor market demand.

 The member positively evaluated this point, saying that exports had become

 more likely to maintain their upward trend going forward. In terms of prices,

 the member forecast that consumer price inflation would converge closely to

 the 2% target level around the third quarter, influenced by a rebound in oil

 prices. The member, however, stressed the need to pay attention to whether

 inflation would remain at the target level after the second half of this year,

 when the base-period effect from oil price declines would disappear.

 Concerning financial stability, the member noted that household debt had


-----

###### showed signs of stabilization for the first time, with bank household lending

 growth decreasing considerably in December. The member viewed household

 debt as likely to stabilize this year, considering that household debt growth

 was largely linked with the growth of housing prices. The member,

 meanwhile, stated that, although concerns had been raised about capital

 outflows and the worsening of Korea’s external soundness due to an inversion

 of Treasury bond yields in Korea and the US since the second half of 2016,

 the possibility that the inversion would trigger financial instability was low,

 given that there were no signs of abnormal capital flows going beyond

 normal market mechanisms. The member commented that, in overall

 consideration of the aforementioned assessments, the negative inflation and

 GDP gaps had both widened somewhat, which suggested that circumstances

 might call for a more accommodative monetary policy. The member, however,

 expressed the view that it was desirable to make the Base Rate decision in a

 more cautious manner, for three reasons. First, if the US economic recovery

 leads to sustained increases in the US policy rate and market interest rates,

 monetary policy easing in Korea could expand automatically. Second,

 uncertainties surrounding the estimation of the GDP gap in Korea have been

 higher than ever. Third, although household debt is expected to stabilize, it is

 necessary to check actual household debt developments.

 Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep

 the Base Rate unchanged from the current level for the intermeeting

 period. The member forecast that, although growth in private consumption

 and construction investment would slow, the Korean economy would maintain

 its modest growth thanks to improvements in exports and facilities investment.

 The member, however, presented the opinion that the Bank of Korea should

 closely monitor and respond to the possible materialization of downside risk

 factors, such as growing household debt burdens, a contraction in economic

 sentiment stemming from political uncertainties, and a weakening of global

 trade growth following strengthened trade protectionism. The member also

 assessed that the Korean economy should speed up its restructuring efforts,


-----

###### support economic recovery with accommodative fiscal and monetary policies,

 and cope with several risk factors at the same time. The member went on to

 stress that, in order for these efforts to succeed, it was very important to

 support job creation through economic stimulus. Meanwhile, with respect to

 household debt, the member noted that effects were expected from several

 government measures. The member then went on to express the opinion that

 the Bank of Korea, together with the government, should continuously and

 closely monitor household debt and real estate market conditions. The member

 also took the opinion that, although the international financial markets had

 been relatively stable, vigilance needed to be maintained concerning market

 developments in emerging market economies and capital flow conditions in

 Korea going forward. The member noted that it was necessary to make active

 efforts to maintain Korea’s international credit standing, which set Korea apart

 from other emerging market economies.

 One other member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base

 Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, the Bank of Korea

 should keep a close watch on changes in financial and economic conditions

 at home and abroad, and developments of domestic and overseas risk factors

 and their impacts in particular.

  In making such judgment, the member gave important consideration to

 macroeconomic and financial conditions, as follows. First, with respect to

 economic conditions, although economic growth seemed to have slowed

 somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2016, the pace of growth was still

 consistent with the Bank of Korea’s October 2016 outlook. Concerning the

 growth outlook for 2017, there was great uncertainty as to how the actual

 trend of growth would play out due to various potential domestic and

 overseas upside and downside risks, and stated that a gradually higher trend

 of growth was expected in the second half of 2017 thanks primarily to

 improved exports, led by the global economic recovery. Next, looking at price

 conditions, consumer price inflation had increased to the mid- to upper-1%

 level in the fourth quarter of 2016 and was expected to converge closely to


-----

###### the 2% inflation target going forward. Consumer price inflation as presented

 in the January economic outlook stood at 1.8%, and upside and downside

 risks to the future inflation path were assessed to be neutral in view of

 conditions at home and abroad. In the financial markets, price volatility had

 fallen and the volume of foreign bond investment outflows had decreased

 with international financial markets becoming stable. The USD/KRW rate,

 however, had showed wide fluctuation in January, influenced for instance by

 changes in expectations related to US monetary policy. 5-year Treasury bond

 yields in Korea and the US had been inverted since mid-December 2016,

 following 10-year Treasury bond yields. Since there were several potential

 risk factors in the domestic and overseas financial markets related to the

 direction of the new US administration’s economic policy, the pace of the

 Fed’s monetary policy normalization, the movements of the Chinese yuan’s

 exchange rate, and domestic and overseas economic conditions, the member

 thought that the volatilities of price variables and capital flows could increase

 again going forward. Meanwhile, although bank household lending had grown

 at a slower pace of late, the member found it difficult at this juncture to

 judge whether this represented a trend, since it was also affected by one-off

 factors.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

###### leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.

- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the

###### trend of global economic recovery has expanded somewhat, led by the

 US and some emerging market economies. Global financial market

 volatility has diminished, as the trends of rising government bond rates

 in major countries have subsided and stock prices have risen. Looking

 ahead the Board judges that the global economic recovery will be

 affected by factors such as the directions of the new US government's

 economic policies, the pace of monetary policy normalization by the

 US Federal Reserve, and the movements toward spreading trade

 protectionism.

- In Korea, the slump in exports has eased but the Board judges the

###### pace of domestic economic growth to have slowed somewhat, as the

 recovery in domestic demand activities has weakened. Employment

 conditions have been somewhat sluggish, with the number of persons

 employed having continued to decline in the manufacturing sector

 while its trend of increase in the service sector has slowed as well.

 The Board sees the domestic economy as likely to continue its trend

 of moderate growth going forward, and forecasts a rate of GDP


-----

###### growth for this year in the mid-2% range. The trend of recovery in

 domestic demand activities is expected to be limited, due to

 deteriorations in economic sentiment for example, but exports will

 likely improve thanks chiefly to the global economic recovery.

- Consumer price inflation has risen to the mid-1% level, in line with

###### the easing of downward price pressures on the supply side. Core

 inflation (excluding food & energy product prices from the CPI) has

 been in the mid- to upper-1% range, while the rate of inflation

 expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level.

 Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will

 gradually rise to near the 2% target level by around the middle of

 2017, on the effects mainly of the increases in international oil prices,

 and that core inflation will maintain a level in the mid- to upper-1%

 range.

- In the domestic financial markets, the volatilities of both stock prices

###### and long-term market interest rates have subsided somewhat as the

 global financial market has stabilized. The Korean won-US dollar

 exchange rate has continued its uptrend seen since October of last

 year, in line with the strengthening of the US dollar globally. The

 upward trends of housing sales prices have slowed, centering around

 Seoul and its surrounding areas. Household lending has continued its

 substantial increase, but the amount of increase in that by banks has

 shown signs of lessening recently.

- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure

###### that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price

 inflation approaches the target level over a medium-term horizon, while

 paying attention to financial stability. As the inflationary pressures on

 the demand side are not expected to be high, given the moderate pace

 of domestic economic growth, the Board will maintain its stance of


-----

###### monetary policy accommodation. In this process it will closely monitor

 the uncertainties in domestic and external conditions and their effects,

 the progress of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal

 Reserve, and the trend of increase in household debt.
