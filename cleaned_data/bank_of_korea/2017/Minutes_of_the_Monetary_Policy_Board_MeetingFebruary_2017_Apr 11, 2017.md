##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and

 International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the

 Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that it
 had sustained its modest recovery, led by the US, and the growth momentum of emerging market economies had been improving, due for instance to rising commodity prices and trade growth amid stable financial conditions. Members also evaluated that international financial markets had been stable overall, with interest rates exhibiting slower growth and stock prices rising as anxiety eased. Members, however, assessed that the Trump administration’s economic policy directions and the potential policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve had been causing global financial market volatility to increase.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that, while
 manufacturing production and facilities investment had continued to improve thanks to the recovery in exports, private consumption had remained weak, due for instance to a contraction in consumer sentiment.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members
 judged that market interest rates and stock prices had held steady with the stabilization of the international financial markets, but the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate had remained highly volatile.

 As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had risen to
 the 2% target level in January, in line mainly with oil price base effects and sharp increases in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 changes in the domestic and international financial and economic

 environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current

 level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.

 One member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base Rate

 at its current 1.25 percent level for the intermeeting period, the Bank of

 Korea should keep a close watch on changes in financial and economic

 conditions at home and abroad, and in particular on developments of domestic

 and overseas risk factors and their impacts. The member assessed that, while

 the trend of recovery in the world economy had been strengthening and the

 international financial markets had remained stable overall, the domestic

 economy had showed a modest growth trend, boosted by continued

 improvements in exports, which had more than offset sluggish consumption.

 Going into more detail, the member first stated that although there were high

 uncertainties in domestic and overseas economic conditions, the domestic

 economy was expected to continually hold to the January forecast path. The

 member then went on to present the opinion that concerns about the

 possibility of an economic crisis, raised by some, were premised on various

 risk factors materializing simultaneously, and thus such concerns did not seem

 reasonable. Next, the member anticipated that, although consumer price

 inflation in January had risen to the 2% target level, inflation for the year as

 a whole was unlikely to diverge greatly from the January projection (1.8%),

 as prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products stabilized. Meanwhile,

 looking at financial conditions, although a movement toward a slower increase

 in bank lending to households had continued in January 2017 from December

 last year, this was attributable in part to seasonal factors, and thus, it was

3

###### difficult to say at this stage that household lending growth would

 fundamentally slow. The member also noted that the won-dollar exchange rate

 had fluctuated of late, but this reflected the high openness of the Korean FX

 market, and thus the negative perceptions of economic agents with respect to

 high exchange rate volatility should shift toward acceptance of this reality as

 normal. Last, the member noted that, although the decoupling of the monetary

 polices of major countries had continued, other major country central banks

 were showing signs of narrowing the degrees of their monetary easing, and

 the member called attention to the point that if there are changes in major

 countries’ monetary policy stances, additional Fed rate hikes may have

 greater-than-expected impacts on the domestic and international financial

 markets. Taking these points in overall consideration, the member expressed

 the opinion that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current

 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period, and keep a close watch on changes

 in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and in particular

 on developments of domestic and overseas risk factors and their impacts.

 Another member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to

 keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level for the intermeeting

 period. The member assessed that, in terms of the real economy, the trend of

 ‘sluggish domestic demand and improved exports’ had become more evident.

 In particular, construction investment had shown a gentle correction instead of

 plunging as initially anticipated, but the consumption slump was fairly

 significant, with consumption remaining on the decline month-on-month since

 November last year. The member went on to point out that consumption

 could pose downside risks to economic growth going forward. Meanwhile, the

 member noted that, as exports had grown at a faster pace for the fourth

 consecutive month since November last year, due mainly to increased demand

 in the global semiconductor market and recoveries in petroleum product

 exports in line with rising oil prices, there was a heightened possibility that

 this could represent a trend going forward. The member, however, commented

 that the Trump government’s protectionist trade stance was lurking as a risk

4


-----

###### factor. Taking these points into overall consideration, the member assessed

 that the path for the real economy for this year would not diverge greatly

 from the Bank of Korea Research Department’s January outlook. In terms of

 prices, the member noted that consumer price inflation in January stood

 higher than expected at 2%, but this was attributable to one-off supply shocks

 such as rising prices of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products in line

 with the outbreaks of avian influenza and foot-and-mouth disease, as well as

 to rising oil prices. The member accordingly judged that there was little risk

 of the price inflation path far exceeding the path forecast in January. Given

 an empirical analysis showing that inflation expectations in small open

 economies are affected by global price movements, the member anticipated

 that the recent trend in the world economy of moving away from low

 inflation was likely to serve as a positive factor in lessening the burden on

 domestic monetary policy related to achieving the inflation target. Last, in

 terms of financial stability, the member assessed that household debt growth

 was stabilizing, with household lending growth having decreased significantly

 in January 2017 as in December last year. The member, however, noted that,

 considering that housing transactions are usually in full swing from March

 and act as a demand-side factor for lending to households, it was appropriate

 to keep a close eye on actual developments in household debt to determine

 whether it has been stabilized.

  One other member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to

 keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level for the intermeeting

 period. The member mentioned that, in implementing monetary policy going

 forward, attention should be paid to the recent inflation trend while taking

 into consideration predictable causes of economic uncertainty. The member

 assessed that, although consumer price inflation had risen significantly in

 January, inflation in 2017 was unlikely to deviate far from the January

 forecast of 1.8 percent, and went on to argue that, based on the forecast that

 supply-side inflation pressures would not be large, it would be possible to

 maintain accommodative monetary policy in consideration of downside

5

###### pressures to the economy. Meanwhile, the member noted the growing need to

 maintain monetary accomodation due to the worsening employment situation

 following corporate restructuring, and mentioned that preventing employment

 quality from declining would be important to prevent household debt

 problems from worsening. In terms of financial stability, the member

 expressed the view that, although the increase in household debt had

 continued to slow in January as in December last year, it was a little too

 early to assess that its growth had slowed, considering that January was

 typically a slow month for the real estate market and thus did not usually

 register large increases in household debt. The member added that a close

 watch should be kept on whether the slowdown in household debt growth

 would continue from March onwards. The member went on to stress that the

 international financial markets had been stable overall and attention should be

 paid to potentially destabilizing external factors.

 Meanwhile, one member took the view that, while maintaining the Base

 Rate at its current level, it would be appropriate to estimate the effects on

 Korea’s macroeconomy from domestic demand and exports, which had shown

 conflicting directions since the fourth quarter last year. The member assessed

 that the global economy had continued to exhibit a moderate recovery, crude

 oil and other commodity prices had rebounded, and asset prices had shown

 an upward trend in advanced countries, which had helped Korea’s exports

 shift to an increase and acted as a factor supporting a rebound in

 manufacturing production and facilities investment in related industries.

 However, the member expressed concerns about a number of factors that

 could weigh on domestic demand: growth in construction investment had

 slowed as the real estate market had begun to stabilize in line with stronger

 government regulations and the rebound of market interest rates; the consumer

 sentiment index had plunged; retail sales and services production had slowed

 down; and employment had declined following structural reform in vulnerable

 industries. Concerning prices, the member assessed that consumer price

 inflation had reached the 2-percent target in January in line with the

6


-----

###### relatively fast growth in import prices, but core inflation had remained at the

 mid-1-percent level, and therefore it seemed unlikely that demand-side

 inflation was increasing. In this regard, the member expressed the opinion that

 future monetary policy should be implemented based on a thorough analysis

 of how the conflicting trends of export demand and domestic demand since

 the fourth quarter of last year would affect Korea’s macroeconomy. The

 member went on to argue that the analysis should focus on whether the

 recovery in demand from exports, boosted by reflation in the global economy,

 would sufficiently offset the sluggishness of domestic demand caused by

 domestic economic problems so that the negative output gap could be

 resolved and underlying inflation could rise gradually to its target of 2

 percent.

  One member took the view that it would be appropriate to leave the

 Base Rate unchanged from its current level of 1.25 percent this month. The

 member stated that the US-led global economic recovery was gradually

 gaining momentum and global prices seemed to have shifted to an increase,

 centering around commodity prices. The member added that there remained,

 however, substantial uncertainties regarding normalization of the global

 economy and expressed concerns that US rate hikes could lead to sudden

 financial market unrest and to US dollar liquidity crunches in some EMEs.

 With this global situation spreading to Korea, the member mentioned that the

 following three points should be considered: First, the member pointed out

 that the fact that improvement in the global economy had boosted the

 recovery in Korea’s exports was a positive development, but it was unclear

 whether this recovery would continue, and its spillover effects on overall

 domestic demand could be limited. Second, the member mentioned that

 increasing volatility in line with the market-determined exchange rate was a

 great asset to Korea as it faced uncertainties. The member particularly

 assessed that, as overseas investment was expanding in accordance with

 investment diversification, increased savings in preparation for the lengthening

 of life expectancy and reduced domestic-overseas interest rate differentials,

7


-----

###### upward and downward exchange rate pressures decreased in the regional spot

 markets, despite the current account surplus, while the domestic market

 responded more sensitively to the global dollar value and global investors.

 Third, the member expressed the view that maintaining the current

 accommodative monetary policy would share the same goal with resolving

 macroeconomic imbalances, since boosting domestic demand could help reduce

 an excessive current account surplus. In conclusion, the member’s assessment

 was that Korea’s monetary policy stance should be adjusted in line with

 changes in economic conditions, such as the global economic recovery,

 growth in Korea’s exports, increased domestic demand, domestic and overseas

 inflation, and developments in the global financial markets, and also according

 to the consequent channel of the natural rate of interest, and went on to

 assess that as several uncertainties remained there was currently no great need

 for an interest rate adjustment within the foreseeable future.

  One other member pointed out a number of major considerations for

 the appropriate conduct of monetary policy. First, the member stated that

 concerning the domestic real economy, with export volumes as well as

 export unit prices showing recovery, manufacturing production and facilities

 investment had continued to improve and construction investment had also

 shown favorable movements, while growth in domestic demand, including

 that in the services sector, had been slowing due to the sustained

 sluggishness in private consumption. The member went on to note that

 short-term upside and downside risks had seemed to be overall in balance,

 and uncertainties surrounding the medium-term growth path had remained

 very high. Second, the member mentioned that inflation had accelerated to

 reach its target, led mostly by supply-side factors including a surge in

 agricultural and livestock product prices and the base-period effect of oil

 prices. Concerning future inflation, the member forecast that upside risks

 would somewhat predominate in the short term, but with the effects of

 supply-side factors gradually diminishing, inflation would not deviate far

 from the January forecast path in the medium term. Third, the member

###### noted that although production slack had grown recently, production had

 then exhibited signs of picking up somewhat, with exports showing

 recovery and manufacturing’s production growth exceeding its production

 capacity growth for the second consecutive month, more than offsetting a

 slight decline in the average capacity utilization rate of the manufacturing

 sector in December. As for the labor market in January, the member

 pointed out that the overall slack in the labor force had not shown any

 significant change, with the unemployment gap increasing and the

 participation gap decreasing month on month, but the recent trend of

 improvement had clearly slowed. Fourth, with regard to financial stability

 conditions, the member stated that foreign bond investment had shifted to

 a net inflow and the term premiums for long-term bonds and corporate

 bond credit spreads had remained stable. Meanwhile, the member

 mentioned that growth in household debt appeared to be slowing

 somewhat, particularly in the banking sector, due mainly to a drop in

 housing transaction volume and strengthened risk management, but lending

 by non-bank financial institutions had shown faster growth than in

 previous years owing chiefly to the base-period effect of bank lending. In

 overall consideration of the above-mentioned real economic and inflation

 trends and financial stability conditions, the member assessed that it was

 advisable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25

 percent for the intermeeting period while securing policy space.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

 leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Board considers that the

 global economic recovery has continued to expand. The global

 financial markets have shown generally stable movements, as the trend

 of rising stock prices has continued and stock price volatility has

 diminished as well. Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic

 recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the directions of

 the new US government's economic policies, the pace of monetary

 policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, the movements

 toward spreading trade protectionism, and the political uncertainties in

 the euro area.

 □ The Board judges that the domestic economy has continued its trend of

 moderate growth, as exports have improved although the recovery in

 domestic demand activities has been weak due to a slump in

 consumption. Employment conditions have been sluggish, with the

 extent of decline in the number of persons employed having widened

 in the manufacturing sector and the trend of increase in persons

 employed in the service sector having slowed as well. The Board sees

 the domestic economy as likely to continue its trend of moderate

10


-----

###### growth going forward, and expects growth to be generally in accord

 with the path projected in January. Compared to the January forecasts

 the Board judges that consumption will likely fall somewhat below the

 level projected, due to a continuing deterioration in economic sentiment

 for example, but that exports and facilities investment will improve

 more than forecast thanks chiefly to the global economic recovery.

 □ Consumer price inflation has risen to the 2% target level, in line

 mainly with increases in the prices of petroleum and agricultural,

 livestock and fisheries products. Core inflation (with food and energy

 product prices excluded from the CPI) has remained in the mid- to

 upper-1% range, while the rate of inflation expected by the general

 public has risen to the upper-2% level. Looking ahead the Board

 expects that consumer price inflation will for the time being fluctuate

 at a level close to 2%, but for the year as a whole not diverge

 greatly from the January projection (1.8%) as the prices of agricultural,

 livestock and fisheries products recover their trends of stability. Core

 inflation will maintain a level in the mid- to upper-1% range.

 □ In the domestic financial markets, the volatilities of both stock prices

 and long-term market interest rates have subsided as the stability in

 the global financial markets has continued. The Korean won-US dollar

 exchange rate has fallen to a large extent, owing mainly to a shift to

 US dollar weakening in line with the new US government’s policies

 related to the exchange rate. The extent of growth in bank household

 lending has continued to lessen, but the substantial increase in

 household lending by non-banks has been sustained. Housing sales

 prices in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the

 country have remained generally steady.

 □ Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to

11


-----

###### ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer

 price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term

 horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the

 inflationary pressures on the demand side are not expected to be high

 given the moderate pace of domestic economic growth, the Board will

 maintain its stance of monetary policy accommodation. In this process

 it will closely monitor the uncertainties in domestic and external

 conditions and their effects, the progress of monetary policy

 normalization by the US Federal Reserve, and the trend of increase in

 household debt.
