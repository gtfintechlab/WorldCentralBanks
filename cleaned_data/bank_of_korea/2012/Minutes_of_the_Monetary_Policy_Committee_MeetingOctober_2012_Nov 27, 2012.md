###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

 After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy

 Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas:

 Members’ assessment regarding the global economy was that, although

 the international financial market unrest had eased somewhat owing to the

 active policy measures taken by major countries, the real economy was

 still sluggish. Furthermore, many members mentioned that the world

 economy was forecast to exhibit a very moderate recovery going forward,

 but that the downside risks to growth were still large.

 Most members noted that the domestic economy was continuing its

 weak growth, as exports remained on a trend of decline and domestic

 demand appeared lackluster.

 As to the outlook, most members commented that it would take some

 time for the economy to return to its long-term trend level, since on top

 of it seeming to be difficult for exports to recover any time soon, due

 mainly to the economic slumps of Korea’s major trading partners, private

 consumption similarly remained constrained by the worsening of consumer

 sentiment in response to the mounting external uncertainties.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, many members assessed

 the stock, bond and foreign exchange markets to have all exhibited stable

 movements, with the soothing of market sentiment and inflows of

 foreigners’ portfolio investment funds driven chiefly by the additional

 quantitative easing policies of major advanced countries and Korea’s

 sovereign rating upgrade.

###### A majority of members forecast that the inflation rate would remain at

 a stable level below the midpoint of its target for the time being, with the

 easing of inflationary pressures owing primarily to the economic slowdown

 and to international oil price stability. Some members, however, put

 forward an opinion that attention must be paid to the possibility of risk

 factors to prices coming into play, such as the expected inflation that still

 remained at around the mid-3% level, the unstable international grain

 prices, and public utility rate hikes.

 Meanwhile, one member noted that real estate prices had continued to

 decline, centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas.

 After the members’ discussions, the 1[st] Vice Minister of Strategy and

 Finance, the government representative, commented on recent economic

 developments as follows, and then left the room before the Base Rate was

 decided:

 Amid ongoing concerns about the slowdown of the world economy, real

 economic indicators were subdued with the recovery in domestic consumer

 and investor sentiments being delayed. However, prices and employment

 continued their stable trends. September exports had declined by a smaller

 margin than in July and August, with those of some items including

 petroleum products and mobile phones posting favorable performances. The

 underlying surplus in the current account was forecast to have been

 sustained in September as well.

 Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Most members expressed the opinion that it would be best to cut the

 Base Rate by 25 basis points from its current level that month, to

###### underpin the recoveries of economic activity and growth engines, as the

 situation was one in which growth was forecast to fall significantly on

 lackluster domestic demand and declining exports, while upward price

 pressures remained low.

 Some of these members noted that if, together with the Base Rate cut,

 the low interest rate conditions were to become prevalent, the tendencies

 toward excessive preference for risk assets such as commercial paper and

 toward a concentration of funds at the short-term end of the market were

 likely to intensify, and that there was thus a need going forward to

 redouble the efforts to curb moral hazard and excessive risk-taking on the

 parts of the economic agents concerned.

 Another member pointed out the need to prepare against the

 possibilities of capital inflows led by hot money, and appreciation of the

 Korean won, in consequence of the additional quantitative easing policies

 of major advanced countries.

 One other member, meanwhile, expressed the opinion that it would be

 desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level even though the pace

 of growth in the Korean economy was observed to have decelerated

 considerably, since its growth potential was not deemed to have been

 impaired yet and there was a need as well to preserve space for interest

 rate policy in preparation for a time when even more difficult conditions

 might unfold in the future.

 With regard to the recent slowdown in growth, he also noted that there

 was a need to respond first with tailored credit policies, by way for

 instance of improvements in the Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loan system, and

 together with this to press ahead with progressive structural reforms aimed

 at boosting the economy’s growth potential.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today
 to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 3.00% to 2.75%.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the
 economic recovery in the US to have continued, albeit at a moderate

 pace, but the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to

 have deepened. Growth has continued to slow in emerging market countries as well, due mostly to the impact of the economic slumps

 in advanced countries. The Committee expects the pace of global

 economic recovery to be very modest going forward and judges the downside risks to growth to be large, owing chiefly to the spillover

 of the euro area fiscal crisis to the real economy and to the

 possibility of the so-called fiscal cliff materializing in the US.

 □ In Korea, the Committee appraises economic growth to have been

 weak, as exports and domestic demand have both been lackluster. On the employment front, amid its continued uptrend led by the higher

 age groups and the service industry, the number of persons employed

 has increased by a greater margin in the manufacturing sector as well. Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the negative

 output gap in the domestic economy will persist for a considerable

 time, due mostly to the prolongation of the euro area fiscal crisis and to the enduring sluggishness of the global economy.

 □ Consumer price inflation and core inflation excluding the prices of
 agricultural and petroleum products continued to run at low levels at

 2.0% and 1.4% respectively in September. The Committee forecasts

 that inflation will remain below the 3.0% midpoint of its target for the time being, owing primarily to the easing of demand-side

 pressures and despite the influence for example of international grain

 price instability. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its

###### surrounding areas declined at a somewhat faster pace, and those in

 the rest of the country generally stabilized at their levels of the previous month.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices have risen and the Korean won
 has appreciated against the US dollar, due mostly to the improvement

 in international financial market conditions and to inflows of

 foreigners’ securities investment funds in consequence of the
 additional quantitative easing policies of major advanced countries.

 Long-term market interest rates have declined slightly, primarily on

 concerns about the economic slowdown.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee will closely monitor external risk

 factors and the consequent changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and conduct monetary policy so as to

 stabilize consumer price inflation at the inflation target over a

 medium-term horizon while continuing its efforts to lower inflation expectations and ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded.
