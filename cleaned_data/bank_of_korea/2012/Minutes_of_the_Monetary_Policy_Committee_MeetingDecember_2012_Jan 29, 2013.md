###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

 After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy

 Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas:

 Members’ assessment regarding the global economy was that it was

 sustaining a recovery, albeit a weak one, with some economic indicators in

 the US and emerging market countries having improved, but that the

 downside risks to growth were still large. Many members pointed out that,

 although the international financial markets remained stable overall, largely

 on the agreement to resume the financial rescue package for Greece, the

 possibility of market instability recurring remained.

 Most members assessed the domestic economy as continuing on a

 weak pace of growth, with the sluggishness of domestic demand persisting

 despite the ongoing trend of improvement in the exports sector.

 Concerning the outlook, members anticipated that the economy would

 show a modest recovery led by exports. Some members, however, foresaw

 the negative output gap lingering on for a considerable time, owing to the

 slow pace of economic recovery.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out

 that the Korean won had appreciated against the US dollar, due mostly to

 the sustained current account surplus and to inflows of liquidity from

 overseas, and that market interest rates and stock prices had shown

 upward movements on the easing of international financial market unrest

 and weakening expectations of additional Base Rate cuts.

###### Many members noted that, helped by the stability of international

 commodity and agricultural product prices, consumer price inflation was

 running at the mid-1% range, and they forecast that it would remain low

 for some time to come.

 After the members’ discussions, the 1[st] Vice Minister of Strategy and

 Finance, the government representative, commented on recent economic

 developments as follows, and then left the room before the Base Rate was

 discussed:

 While domestic inflation and employment appeared stable, production

 and exports had improved, but consumption, investment and other domestic

 demand-related indicators were sluggish. As for the world economy, with

 concerns persisting about its slowdown, uncertainties lingered due largely

 to the delays in recovery of consumer and investor sentiment. The

 government will respond to factors making for price instability

 preemptively and strengthen its drive for structural improvement, and

 continue its policy efforts to boost the economy and create jobs.

 Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that it would be best to keep the Base

 Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period and closely watch

 changes in the financial and economic environments at home and abroad,

 given that the sluggishness of domestic economic growth was not

 intensifying any further, and that the economic conditions at home and

 abroad continued to remain in an unsteady state while inflation was

 expected to show stability for some time, although the pace of growth in

 domestic economic activity was still weak.

###### Some of these members expressed the opinion that policy efforts

 should be directed toward curbing sudden in- and outflows of speculative

 capital, since, in view of various features of the Korean financial markets

 including their high degree of openness and asymmetrical structure, the

 recent excessive inflows of global liquidity were highly likely to impose a

 greater economic burden on Korea than on any other country.

 Another member asserted that, since there were some indications of a

 differentiation in terms of credit quality between firms among those issuing

 the higher-grade corporate bonds that had been preferred for some time as

 prime paper, it was necessary to monitor this closely to prevent the spread

 of credit risk aversion from acting as a factor making for financial

 instability, while fine-tuning its policy instruments to stage a preemptive

 response.

 One other member pointed out that, given the concerns about the

 growth potential being eroded by the continuation of low growth, there

 was a necessity of preparing against such a hysteresis effect becoming

 entrenched by reviewing the macro and micro cycles in a timely manner.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 the moderate economic recovery in the US to have continued, but

 the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have

 persisted. Economic indicators in emerging market countries have

 shown signs of gradual improvement. The Committee expects the

 global economy to exhibit a modest recovery going forward but

 judges the downside risks to growth to be large, owing chiefly to

 the euro area fiscal crisis and to the fiscal consolidation issue in

 the US.

 □ In Korea, the Committee appraises economic growth to have

 remained at a weak level, with exports improving but the

 sluggishness in domestic demand continuing. On the employment

 front, the number of persons employed has shown a trend of

 increase above its average pre-global financial crisis level, led by

 the higher age groups. Going forward, the Committee anticipates

 that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will persist

 for a considerable time, due mostly to the prolongation of the euro

 area fiscal crisis and to the delay in recovery of world economic

 growth.

 □ Consumer price inflation fell to 1.6% in November, from 2.1% the

 previous month, a result mainly of declines in agricultural and

 petroleum product prices, and core inflation excluding the prices of

 agricultural and petroleum products continued to run at a low level

###### at 1.3%. The Committee forecasts that inflation will remain low for

 the time being, owing primarily to the easing of demand-side

 pressures. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding

 areas continued their downtrend and those in the rest of the

 country their uptrend.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices and long-term market interest

 rates rose, due mostly to international financial market stability and

 improvements in economic indicators in major countries, and the

 Korean won appreciated against the US dollar owing chiefly to the

 continued surplus in the current account.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee will closely monitor external risk

 factors and the consequent changes in financial and economic

 conditions at home and abroad, and conduct monetary policy so as

 to stabilize consumer price inflation at the inflation target over a

 medium-term horizon while continuing its efforts to lower inflation

 expectations and ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded.
