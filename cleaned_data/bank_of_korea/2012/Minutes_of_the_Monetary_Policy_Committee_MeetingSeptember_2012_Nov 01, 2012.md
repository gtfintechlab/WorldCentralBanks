###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

 After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy

 Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas:

  In regard to the global economy, members’ appraisal was that,

 although market anxieties had eased somewhat owing to the policy

 responses of major central banks, the global economy’s sluggishness had

 continued and its downside risks had increased further—due to the

 persistent economic downturns in major advanced countries and consequent

 slowdowns of growth in emerging market countries.

 Concerning the domestic economy, most members assessed that the

 downside risks to growth had increased and the growth momentum was

 continuing to weaken, with private sector dynamism ebbing on the

 worsening of consumer and investor sentiments.

 As to the outlook, most members anticipated that growth would run

 below initial forecasts, since it seemed difficult for exports to rebound any

 time soon with the pace of domestic demand recovery being feeble. One

 of these members remarked that it might take some time for the economy

 to return to its long-term trend level.

 Members assessed the domestic financial markets to be showing an

 overall pattern of stability as stock prices had risen and the exchange rate

 had fluctuated within a narrow range on the back of the improved

 domestic and overseas environment including, for instance, the upgrade of

 Korea’s sovereign rating. Several members pointed out, however, that the

 financial situations of some households and firms were deteriorating due to

 differentiation based on credit quality even though market interest rates

 remained at low levels.

###### Members noted that the inflation rate has continued to run below

 2%, influenced by the economic slowdown and base effects, and forecast

 that it would remain at a low level for a considerable time. Members,

 however, also shared the view that attention should be paid to the

 possibility that price rise expectations and run-ups in commodity prices

 could act as risk factors.

 Meanwhile, one member mentioned with regard to real estate prices

 that, while their downtrend in Seoul and its surrounding areas persisted,

 those in the rest of the country appeared to have topped out with their

 uptrend coming to a halt.

 After the members’ discussions, the 1[st] Vice Minister of Strategy and

 Finance, the government representative, made the following comments and

 then left the room before the Base Rate decision:

 Prices were exhibiting stability and domestic demand indicators had

 temporarily improved somewhat, but the sluggishness in mining and

 manufacturing production was becoming more pronounced due mainly to

 the slowdown in exports. In the job market, employment growth had

 slowed somewhat in August, but this was interpreted as reflecting a

 reversion to the norm. Exports had posted negative growth in August, as

 in the previous month, affected chiefly by sharp decreases in those of

 major items including ships, automobiles and steel, and by the vacation

 season. However, the underlying surplus in the current account was

 forecast to be sustained.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Although the sluggishness in domestic demand and exports were

 expected to last while inflation continued to run at a low level, members

 decided unanimously to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the

 intermeeting period, sharing the view that there was a need to keep an

 eye on changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad

 for a while longer, since domestic and overseas financial market instability

 had eased somewhat of late and major countries were taking policy

 measures to boost their economies.

 One of these members pointed out that, should the Base Rate be

 lowered that month, the consequent macroeconomic opportunity costs could

 be very large, given the economic environments at home and abroad, the

 need for pursuit of restructuring, the limited effect of a Base Rate cut and

 the benefit of securing policy space, etc. 

 One other member expressed the opinion that, the central bank

 should make efforts to develop microeconomic policy instruments in the

 medium and long term to raise the economy’s below-potential growth rate,

 including measures to induce stronger competitiveness and strengthen

 macro-leverage management, and also the central bank should ease external

 shocks transmitted through the financial markets by fine-tuning of

 macro-prudential tools and close monitoring of foreign capital in- and

 out-flows, etc.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today
 to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.00% for the intermeeting

 period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the

 economic recovery in the US to have weakened somewhat and the

 sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have deepened. Growth has continued to slow in emerging market

 countries as well, due mostly to the impact of the economic slumps

 in advanced countries. The Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be very modest going forward and judges the

 downside risks to growth to be large, owing chiefly to the spillover

 of the euro area fiscal crisis to the real economy and to the possibility of the so-called fiscal cliff materializing in the US.

 □ In Korea, the Committee appraises economic growth to have been
 weak, as domestic demand has alternated between improving and

 worsening and exports have exhibited a downtrend. On the

 employment front, amid its continued uptrend led by the higher age groups and the service industry, the number of persons employed

 increased by a greater margin in the manufacturing sector as well.

 The Committee anticipates that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will be sustained for a considerable time going

 forward, due mostly to the prolongation of the euro area fiscal crisis

 and to the sluggishness of the global economy.

 □ Consumer price inflation came in low at 1.2% in August, owing

 primarily to the base effect and to the easing of demand-side pressures, and core inflation which excludes the prices of agricultural

 and petroleum products also continued to run at a low level at 1.3%.

 The Committee sees inflation picking up going forward, influenced

###### largely by the recent typhoon damage and the instability of

 international oil and grain prices, but forecasts that it will remain below the 3.0% midpoint of the inflation target for the time being.

 As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas

 sustained their downtrend, and those in the rest of the country generally stabilized at their levels of the previous month.

 □ In the financial markets, price variables have fluctuated in response
 mainly to international financial market conditions and to the

 domestic outlook for economic activity and expectations for monetary

 policy; stock prices have risen, long-term market interest rates have fallen slightly, and the Korean won exchange rate has fluctuated

 within a relatively narrow range.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee will closely monitor external risk

 factors and the consequent changes in financial and economic

 conditions at home and abroad, and conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the inflation target over a

 medium-term horizon while continuing its efforts to lower inflation

 expectations and ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded.
