###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

   After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy

 Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas:

   In regard to the global economy, many members judged that, with

 the tendency of risk aversion strengthening in response to the spread of

 international financial market unrest particularly in the euro area, the

 downside risks to its growth were becoming larger, due to the likelihood

 of economic recession in major countries.

   As to the current state of the domestic economy, most members

 evaluated its growth momentum as still being weak, although some real

 economic indicators showed slight improvements going into April

 compared to the previous month.

 In addition, most members judged that, with destabilizing external

 factors including the sovereign debt problems in the euro area and

 economic sluggishness in major countries persisting for a long time, the

 timing of GDP growth rate’s return to trend was very likely to be delayed

 longer than expected. One among these members assessed that the pace of

 growth through the public sector would also weaken by the reduction in

 the government’s fiscal spending in the latter half-year.

   Members noted with regard to the domestic financial markets that

 volatility had increased with the outflows of foreign stock investment

 funds, the decline in stock prices and interest rates, and the depreciation

 of the Korean won against the US dollar, due to concerns about

 worsening global economic conditions. One member, however, evaluated

 the prospect of an abrupt exodus of foreign investment funds to be low,

###### since foreign bond investors were maintaining a net buying trend and

 stock sales were also found to have been strongly driven by profit taking.

   Although consumer price inflation had shown stable movements at the

 mid-2% level for a third consecutive month, due largely to the impact of

 the government’s free childcare support and to lower international oil prices,

 members pointed out that vigilance against rising prices could not be

 lowered, given the hikes in public utility fees in the second half of 2012,

 the high level of expected inflation and the possibility of wage hikes.

   After the members’ discussions, the 1[st] Vice Minister of Strategy and

 Finance, the government representative, made the following comments and

 then left the room before the Base Rate was discussed:

   With regard to recent economic activity in Korea, the 1[st] Vice

 Minister pointed out that, although the stable trend in employment continued

 and real economy indicators had improved somewhat, indices for assessing

 economic activity appeared subdued, and that although prices showed stable

 movements, destabilizing factors still existed, centering around the prices of

 agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and processed foods. He in

 addition forecast that the current account would sustain its surplus as in

 April, even though exports had recorded negative growth in May owing

 mostly to reduced global demand and to the base effect.

 Ⅲ. Discussions Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

   The main details of the MPC members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

   Members shared the opinion that, although the domestic economy

 appeared to be sustaining its recovery, albeit weakly, it would be better to

###### hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period and

 keep a close watch on changes in financial and economic conditions at

 home and abroad, considering that inflationary pressures remained and that

 uncertainty had mounted somewhat due to recent changes in the domestic

 and international environments. One member expressed the opinion that it

 was necessary to maintain the interest rate normalization stance in order to

 ensure solid economic growth and to make room for policy action in the

 future, since the current level of the Base Rate could still be deemed

 accommodative because it was far lower than prior to the global financial

 crisis.

   Another member mentioned that it was necessary to closely review

 the effectiveness of the interest rate policy transmission mechanism,

 considering for instance that price variable volatility had grown and the

 yield curve flattend significantly due to destabilizing external factors.

   One other member pointed out the need to examine the effectiveness

 and capacity of fiscal policy, which along with monetary policy forms the

 two main pillars of macroeconomic policy.

   As regards financial stability, some members expressed the view that

 efforts should be made to examine the effects of the existing measures to

 reduce capital flow volatility, and to maintain comfortable foreign

 exchange supply and demand conditions, given that Korea’s foreign

 exchange and financial markets were vulnerable to sudden reversals of

 foreign investment fund flows in events of external shock.

   Another member opined that there was a need to even out the maturity

 distribution of household debt, since there was a possibility of a vicious

 circle being set in motion between souring household loans, particularly those

 extended to older age groups, and real estate market instability.

   After the discussions detailed above, the members decided

 unanimously to keep the Base Rate at its current level.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today

 to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the
 trends of improvement in some economic indicators in the US to

 have shown signs of faltering, and economic activities in the euro

 area to have remained sluggish. Growth in emerging market economies has continued its trend of weakening, due mostly to

 slowing exports. Going forward the Committee expects the global

 economy to sustain its recovery, albeit at a moderate pace, but judges that the downside risks to growth are becoming larger, due

 chiefly to the international financial market unrest stemming from

 euro area risks and to the possibilities of economic slumps in major countries.

 □ In Korea, the Committee appraises the trend of economic growth,
 although weak, to be continuing, with consumption and facilities

 investment having shifted to slight increases while exports generally

 maintain their levels of last year. On the employment front, the uptrend in the number of persons employed is being sustained, led

 by the private sector. The Committee anticipates that the domestic

 economy will gradually post long-term trend level growth going forward, but recognizes the situation to be one in which downside

 risks to growth are becoming larger due mostly to the increase in

 external risk factors.

 □ Consumer price inflation sustained a level in the mid-2% range in

 May, and core inflation dropped compared to the previous month.

 The Committee does however recognize the presence of potentially destabilizing factors, such as pressures to hike public utility fees and

###### the ongoing high inflation expectations. In the housing market, sales

 prices have remained weak and leasehold deposits halted their rise in Seoul and its surrounding areas. The uptrends of both sales and

 leasehold deposit prices in the rest of the country have slowed.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices have declined considerably,

 long-term market interest rates have also fallen and the Korean won has depreciated greatly against the US dollar, due mostly to the

 continuation of international financial market unrest and the

 strengthening of risk aversion tendencies.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring external risk

 factors and the consequent changes in domestic financial and economic conditions, and endeavoring to lower inflation expectations,

 will conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price

 inflation at the midpoint of the inflation target over a medium-term horizon amid continuing sound growth of the economy.
