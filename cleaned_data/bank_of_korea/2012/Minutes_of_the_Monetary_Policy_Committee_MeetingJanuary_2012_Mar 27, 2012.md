##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy

 Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas:

 Regarding the global economy many members commented that,

 although some economic indicators in the U.S. were showing favorable

 movements, advanced economies remained sluggish, centering around the

 euro area, and that emerging market countries including China were

 recording somewhat slowing growth. One member assessed the downside

 risks to world economic growth to be expanding, due to the continued

 international financial market instability.

 As to the domestic economy, members mentioned that domestic

 demand and exports were somewhat more sluggish than originally forecast,

 affected mostly by the persistence of destabilizing external factors and the

 consequent pullback in consumer and investor sentiment.

 In addition, most members’ outlook on the economy was that it

 would remain in a downturn for the time being, owing to the heightened

 uncertainty of global economic conditions. One of them expressed concerns

 that uncertainties as to the growth path had risen even further with the

 addition of geopolitical risks related to Iran and North Korea, and that if

 various structural problems latent in the Korean economy surfaced under

 these circumstances, it could make the maintenance of financial market

 stability and economic growth difficult.

 Many members pointed out, concerning the domestic financial

 markets, that price variables such as stock prices and exchange rates

###### continued to fluctuate widely due to the presence of international financial

 market unrest. One of these members mentioned that, although banks’

 foreign currency funding conditions were on the whole favorable, it was

 difficult to relax given the possibility of the current account posting a

 deficit amid the rising short-term external debt ratio.

 Regarding consumer prices, members noted that headline consumer

 price inflation had come in at 4.2% in December, as in the previous

 month, driven by hikes in agricultural and livestock and petroleum product

 prices. One of them expected that the rate of consumer price increase

 would decline gradually, due mostly to the base-period effect and the

 easing of demand-side inflation pressures, but that its pace of decline

 would be moderate owing to high inflation expectations.

 As for housing prices, one member appraised those in Seoul and its

 surrounding areas as having continued their fall, as in the previous month,

 while the pace of their increase in the rest of the country had slowed,

 due chiefly to burdens stemming from their previous rapid surge.

##### Ⅲ. Remarks by Government Representative

###### Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the

 Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance,

 the government representative.

 With regard to the current economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister

 assessed that, although major real economic indicators were weak, some

 indicators which had shown sluggishness were recovering somewhat, amid

 the continuing pattern of improvement in employment. The 1st Vice

 Minister pointed out however that uncertainty about economic conditions

###### was increasing, with the emergence of geopolitical risks in North Korea at

 a time when the possibility of the euro area sovereign debt crisis

 spreading lingered.

 The 1st Vice Minister commented that although headline consumer

 price inflation for 2012 was expected to register 3.2%, lower than in the

 previous year, concerns might arise that growing demand for commodities

 in emerging market countries, destabilizing factors on the supply side

 arising from the political unrest in the Middle East including Iran and from

 the possibility of abnormal changes in weather, and high core inflation and

 expected inflation might act as inflation pressures.

 Concerning employment trends, the 1st Vice Minister judged the

 trend of recovery in the labor market to be continuing, with the number

 of persons employed having increased by 440,000 year-on-year in

 December. He also commented that, with employment elasticity (the rate

 of growth in number of persons employed divided by GDP growth)

 improving greatly, the Korean economy’s job creation capacity was

 improving, and major employment indicators such as the employment rate,

 the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate were also

 improving compared to 2011. He pointed out, however, that, since there

 was a possibility of the employment recovery being limited this year

 compared to last, due to slowing growth and the consequent reduction in

 job gains, there was a need for more job creation in order to restore

 employment conditions, which had deteriorated greatly due to the global

 financial crisis, to their pre-crisis level.

##### Ⅳ. Discussions Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPC members’ discussion concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

###### Members shared the opinion that, it would be better to hold the Base

 Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, in view of the

 situation in which the trend of domestic economic slowdown was

 becoming evident, and the uncertainties as to economic conditions and the

 growth path at home and abroad were higher than ever, even though the

 inflation situation was still difficult due mostly to the high level of

 expected inflation and the possibility of a run-up in international oil

 prices.

 One of these members noted that, although the Committee should

 hold the Base Rate at its current level, it should work to curb rate cut

 expectations while signaling to the market that the negative real interest

 rate situation will have to be normalized as soon as possible. The member

 added that the Committee should seek a way to promote harmony with

 the economic policies of the government, whose top priorities were placed

 upon price stability and job creation.

 Another member expressed the opinion that the Committee should

 attempt to normalize rates without delay once improvements in economic

 circumstances at home and abroad were confirmed, since adverse side

 effects of the long period of low level interest rates due to accommodative

 monetary policy were emerging, such as mounting household debt and

 delays in corporate restructuring. And he raised that concerns about market

 efficiency and appropriate resource allocation might be hampered as a

 consequence, leading thereby to a weakening of the Korean economy’s

 growth potential.

 The member argued in addition that it was necessary to push

 forward with market-driven corporate restructuring, while at the same time

 coming up with social and economic solutions to the problems facing

 low-income vulnerable households.

###### One other member pointed out that government efforts were needed

 at the micro-level to prevent recurrence of the factors that had fueled the

 rise in core inflation last year, such as multiple supply shocks, a rise in

 expected inflation, hikes in personal service charges, and the strengthened

 degree of inflation persistence.

 After the discussions detailed above, the members decided

 unanimously to keep the Base Rate at its current level.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today
 to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting

 period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 major advanced economies to have remained sluggish, and growth in

 emerging market economies to have also slowed somewhat. Going forward the Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery

 to be very moderate, and judges that the downside risks to growth

 are becoming larger, due mostly to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and to the possibilities of the slumps in major country

 economies and the unrest in international financial markets continuing.

 □ In Korea, exports have kept up their steady increase, but domestic

 demand has been subdued with consumption and construction

 investment decreasing from the previous month. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has sustained its large scale

 of increase, led by the private sector. The Committee anticipates that

 domestic economic growth will gradually return to its long-term trend level going forward, after remaining subdued for some time due

 mostly to the impact of external risk factors.

 □ Consumer price inflation continued to exceed 4% in December last

 year, driven by the prices of petroleum products and processed food,

 and core inflation also came in at a level similar to that of the previous month. In the coming months, factors including the base

 effect from the previous year and the easing of demand-side pressures

 will work in favor of price stability, but the Committee expects the pace of decline in the inflation rate to be moderate given factors

 such as ongoing high inflation expectations. In the housing market,

###### prices have remained weak in Seoul and its surrounding areas and

 leasehold deposits there have decreased, due mostly to the impact of low off-season demand. The uptrends of both housing prices and

 leasehold deposits in the rest of the country have slowed.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices and the exchange rate have

 continued to fluctuate widely, due chiefly to unease concerning

 external risk factors and to geopolitical risks. The trend of decline in long-term market interest rates has halted and they have shown

 fluctuations within a narrow range.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and

 economic risk factors both at home and abroad, as well as the

 evolution of inflation expectations, will conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the midpoint of the inflation

 target over a medium term horizon amid continuing sound growth of

 the economy.
