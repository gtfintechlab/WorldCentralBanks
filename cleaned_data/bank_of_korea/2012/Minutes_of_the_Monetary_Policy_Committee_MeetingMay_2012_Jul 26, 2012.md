###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on the Current Economic Situation

 After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy

 Committee (MPC) Members covered the following areas:

 Many members assessed the global economy to be sustaining its

 moderate recovery, but the political uncertainties in the euro area, concerns

 about the Spanish economy, and so on to be further amplifying the

 downside risks to its growth path. One among these members expressed

 the view that the ample global liquidity supplied through major central

 banks’ quantitative easing could stoke inflationary pressures in the future.

 In regard to the current state of the domestic economy, members

 commented that its recovery appeared to be faltering somewhat, with some

 real economy indicators for March coming out lower than expected. One

 of these members deemed the recent economic growth to have been led

 by the government sector through increased fiscal front-loading, and the

 momentum of recovery in private domestic demand such as consumption

 and investment to remain weak.

 As to the outlook, most members judged that, unless economic

 conditions at home and abroad worsened dramatically, the domestic

 economy would show a modest recovery while remaining on the growth

 path predicted in April. One member mentioned, however, that given the

 government’s reduced fiscal space and the uncertainties as to external

 conditions, there was a need to keep a closer watch on the future pace of

 economic recovery.

 Concerning the domestic financial markets, many members assessed

###### that, although foreign portfolio investment funds had shifted to a net

 outflow, owing largely to the heightened international financial market

 unrest, major price variables such as stock prices and exchange rates

 exhibited relatively stable movements, boosted for the most part by strong

 economic fundamentals and adequate foreign currency liquidity. One

 member, however, argued that attention should be paid to the possibility

 of foreign capital in- and outflows surging due chiefly to European

 financial institution deleveraging.

 Regarding consumer prices, members pointed out that the uptrend in

 prices appeared to be cooling, with consumer price inflation having come

 in at the mid-2% level for two consecutive months, but that constant

 attention to underlying inflationary pressures was called for, given the

 existence of destabilizing factors such as the high level of expected

 inflation and the possibility of hikes in public utility charges and nominal

 wages.

 After the members’ discussions, the 1[st] Vice Minister of Strategy and

 Finance, the government representative, made the following comments and

 then left the room before the Base Rate was discussed:

 The 1[st] Vice Minister assessed that, although the trend of improvement

 in employment continued, external uncertainties were running high, caused

 largely by the instability of international oil prices and the possibility of

 economic recession in the eurozone, at a time when real indicator

 improvements were showing signs of faltering. He pointed out that prices

 were showing stable movements as in the previous month, but that upward

 pressures for example from hikes in public utility fees and in processed

 food prices remained. He went on to remark that, while exports had been

 smooth in April, centering around major items such as automobiles and

 steel, exports as a whole had posted negative year-on-year growth, owing

 mostly to a base effect and to the decrease in number of days worked

 sustain its surplus as it had in March.

 Ⅲ. Discussions Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that the domestic economic recovery was

 forecast to be sustained going forward, but that it would be better to hold the

 Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period and keep a close

 watch on changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad,

 considering that inflationary pressures remained and that uncertainty had

 mounted somewhat due to recent changes in conditions at home and abroad.

 One of these members commented that it would be preferable to keep

 the interest rate normalization stance maintained since July 2010 intact for

 the time being, in order to firmly anchor the foundation for price stability

 and prepare against downside risks to the economy going forward.

 One member meanwhile expressed the view that there was a need to

 further strengthen monitoring of such factors causing domestic financial

 market unrest as the recent additional suspensions of mutual savings banks,

 the household debt problem and the potential for an expansion in foreign

 currency fund flows, and to constantly check the possibilities of their

 metastasizing into financial systemic risk.

 In this connection, one other member put forward the opinion that it

 was necessary to review whether there was a possibility of individual

 business loans and group loans causing financial market unrest.

 After the discussions detailed above, the members decided unanimously

 to keep the Base Rate at its current level.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today
 to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting

 period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 some economic indicators in the US to have sustained their trends of

 improvement, but economic activities in the euro area to have remained sluggish. Growth in emerging market economies has

 continued to exhibit signs of weakening, due mostly to slowing

 exports. Going forward the Committee expects the global economy to sustain its recovery, albeit at a moderate pace, and judges that risk
 factors still exist―including the resurgence of sovereign debt
 problems in Europe stemming from the heightening of political uncertainty, the deepening economic slowdown there, and the

 geopolitical risks in the Middle East.

 □ In Korea, the Committee appraises the recovery of economic growth

 to have faltered, with consumption and investment decreasing while

 exports maintain generally sound levels. On the employment front, the uptrend in the number of persons employed is being sustained, led by

 the private sector. The Committee anticipates that the domestic

 economic growth rate will gradually return to its long-term trend going forward, although downside risks remain due mostly to the

 impacts of external risk factors.

 □ Consumer price inflation fell to 2.5% in April, and core inflation

 dropped compared to the previous month as well. The Committee

 does however recognize the presence of potentially destabilizing factors, such as the ongoing high inflation expectations and the

 geopolitical risks in the Middle East. In the housing market, the

###### decline in sales prices gathered pace somewhat and the rise in

 leasehold deposits slowed in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while in the rest of the country both sales and leasehold deposit prices

 sustained high rates of increase similar to those in the previous

 month.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices and long-term market interest

 rates fell and the Korean won depreciated against the US dollar, as price variables fluctuated in line largely with international financial

 market conditions and economic indicators in major countries.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and

 economic risk factors both at home and abroad and endeavoring to

 lower inflation expectations, will conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the midpoint of the inflation

 target over a medium-term horizon amid continuing sound growth of

 the economy.
