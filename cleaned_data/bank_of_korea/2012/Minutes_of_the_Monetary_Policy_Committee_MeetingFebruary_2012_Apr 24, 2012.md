##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy

 Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas:

 Regarding the global economy, many members commented that stock

 and bond prices were rising and inflows of portfolio investment funds to

 emerging market countries becoming prominent, as the tendency toward

 risk aversion in the international financial markets was weakened somewhat

 due to the strengthening of major central banks’ stances of monetary

 policy easing. Most members assessed however that the advanced

 economies were continuing to exhibit sluggishness, particularly in the euro

 area, notwithstanding the improvements in some U.S. economic indicators,

 and that economies of emerging market countries including China had

 been showing signs of weakening in their real economic growth. One of

 these members forecast that, even if the uncertainty over the euro area

 sovereign debt problem did ease somewhat, world economic growth was

 unlikely to expand greatly owing mostly to major advanced countries’

 efforts to restore fiscal soundness.

 In regard to the domestic economy, members mentioned that the

 slowdown in domestic economic growth appeared to be continuing, due to

 the persistence of external destabilizing factors and the consequent pullback

 in consumer and investment confidence.

 As to the outlook, the majority of members forecast that domestic

 economic activity could shift to a recovery, albeit a modest one, on the

 back of the economy’s sound fundamentals, provided the uncertainties

 about external conditions decline from the second half of this year.

###### Concerning the domestic financial markets, many members observed

 that stock prices had risen sharply, the Korean won had appreciated

 against the US dollar, and the volatility of price variables declined, thanks

 to the easing of international financial market unrest. Some of them

 pointed out that attention should have to be paid to the possibility of the

 recent inflows of foreign investors’ portfolio funds shifting to a sudden

 outflow in the event of changes in domestic and international conditions.

 Regarding consumer prices, members noted that headline consumer

 price inflation had come in at 3.4% in January, much lower than in the

 previous month, due mostly to a base-period effect and the blunting of the

 upward pressures on agricultural and livestock prices. Some of them

 anticipated that although factors including the moderation of demand-side

 pressures due to the economic slowdown and base period effects would

 work in favor of price stability, the pace of decline in the inflation rate

 would be very moderate in the coming months due mostly to factors such

 as ongoing high inflation expectations, the run-up in international oil prices

 in line with geopolitical risks in the Middle East, and the pressures for

 public utility charge hikes.

 As for housing prices, one member assessed that those in Seoul and

 its surrounding areas had continued their fall from the previous month,

 while their pace of increase in the rest of the country had slowed.

##### Ⅲ. Remarks by Government Representative

###### Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the

 Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance,

 the government representative.

 With regard to the current economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister

###### assessed that major real economic indicators such as mining and

 manufacturing production were sluggish, although the trend of employment

 growth was continuing and some indicators including facilities and

 construction investment appeared to be improving. He also pointed out that

 uncertainties as to external conditions were high, due for instance to the

 possibility of a global economic slowdown as a result of the euro area

 sovereign debt crisis and to the concerns about a run-up in international

 oil prices.

 The 1st Vice Minister forecast that, although the rate of increase in

 consumer prices had fallen somewhat month-on-month in January, factors

 such as international oil price hikes resulting from the sanctions on Iran,

 international financial market unrest caused by concerns about the euro

 area sovereign debt crisis spreading, and so on would work to destabilize

 prices in the future.

 Concerning the trends of external transactions, the 1st Vice Minister

 judged January’s first year-on-year export decline in 27 months, since

 October 2009, as attributable to one-off seasonal factors such as the

 base-period effect from the concentration of ship exports in January 2011,

 and to the decrease in number of days worked due to the Lunar New

 Year holidays having fallen in January rather than in February. He on the

 other hand estimated that the current account would post a deficit as a

 whole for January, due mostly to a deficit in the trade account and a

 deficit in the services account resulting from increased overseas travel

 during winter vacation etc.

##### Ⅳ. Discussions Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPC members’ discussion concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

###### Members shared the opinion that it would be better to hold the Base

 Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, in view of the

 possibility of domestic economic growth slowdown amid the uncertainties

 as to the price situation and economic conditions at home and abroad.

 One member expressed the view that, in a situation in which it was

 not easy to change interest rate policy, the Committee should clarify the

 central bank’s will to stabilize prices, given the increase in public utility

 charges, the run-up in international oil prices, and the sustained high level

 of expected inflation.

 Another member pointed out that efforts were required to stabilize

 consumer prices through the government’s micro inflation policy, given

 that even though guard against prices should not be lowered, there was

 limited scope for the operation of interest policy due to signs of economic

 slowdown.

 He also asserted that, to engineer a soft-landing of the household

 debt problem, the costs and benefits of various policy measures including

 a Base Rate hike must be reexamined, and ways for mitigating their side

 effects sought.

 One other member remarked that a rate hike might accelerate the

 economic slowdown, entailing risks of an expansion in the amplitude of

 economic fluctuations, even though the current level of the Base Rate and

 the consequent negative real interest rate conditions remained

 accommodative.

 After the discussions detailed above, the members decided

 unanimously to keep the Base Rate at its current level.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today
 to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting

 period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 some economic indicators in the US such as employment to have

 shown improvements, but economic activities in the euro area to have remained sluggish. Growth in emerging market economies has

 continued to exhibit signs of weakening, due mostly to slowing

 exports. Going forward the Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be very moderate, and judges that risk factors

 still exist, stemming for instance from the persistence of the

 sovereign debt problems in Europe and the slumps in major country economies, and from geopolitical risks in the Middle East.

 □ In Korea, economic growth has slowed, with domestic demand
 subdued overall and exports also decreasing. On the employment

 front, however, the uptrend in the number of persons employed is

 being sustained, led by the private sector. The Committee anticipates that the domestic economic growth rate will gradually return to its

 long-term trend level going forward, although viewing downside risks

 as likely to remain high for some time due mostly to the impact of external risk factors.

 □ Consumer price inflation declined to 3.4% in January, owing chiefly
 to the base effect from last year, and core inflation also dropped

 compared to the previous month. In the coming months, factors

 including the easing of demand-side pressures will work in favor of price stability, but the Committee recognizes the presence of

 potentially destabilizing factors such as the ongoing high inflation

###### expectations and the geopolitical risks in the Middle East. In the

 housing market, prices remained weak in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while leasehold deposits there maintained their levels of the

 previous month. Housing prices and leasehold deposits in the rest of

 the country rose at rates similar to those in December.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices rose and the Korean won

 appreciated against the US dollar in line with the huge inflows of foreigners' securities investment funds as the international financial

 market unrest eased somewhat. Long-term market interest rates have

 continued to fluctuate within a narrow range.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and

 economic risk factors both at home and abroad, as well as the evolution of inflation expectations, will conduct monetary policy so

 as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the midpoint of the

 inflation target over a medium-term horizon amid continuing sound growth of the economy.
