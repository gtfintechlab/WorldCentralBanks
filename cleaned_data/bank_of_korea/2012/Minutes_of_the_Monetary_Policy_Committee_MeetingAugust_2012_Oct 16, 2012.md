###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on the Current Economic Situation2)

 After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy

 Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas:

  In regard to the global economy, members assessed its sluggishness

 to be continuing and its downside risks to have increased further, due to

 the economic contractions in major advanced countries and the slowdowns

 of growth in emerging market countries resulting from the high degree of

 uncertainty.

  Concerning the domestic economy, most members pointed out that

 its growth momentum appeared to be weakening, as the recovery of the

 domestic demand sector including private consumption and facilities

 investment was slowing while exports were showing lackluster

 performances as a result of the sluggishness in major economies.

  As to the outlook, many members anticipated that, the growth path

 was highly likely to run below its long-term trend for a considerable time

 considering the uncertainties in the external sector and the weak recovery

 in the domestic demand sector.

  With regard to the domestic financial markets, members mentioned

 that foreign portfolio investment funds had shifted to a net inflow, due

 mostly to the ample global liquidity, the expectations of further Base Rate

 cuts and the increased preference for safe assets, and that this had caused

 market interest rates to drop sharply, thereby leading to manifestations of

 a more inverted yield curve and of a concentration of funds at the

 short-term end of the market.

######  In relation to consumer prices, members forecast that they would

 remain on a stable track for the time being, as consumer price inflation

 had exhibited a low rate of 1.5% in July on the back of the stabilization

 of agricultural and petroleum product prices, and that upward pressures on

 both the supply and demand sides had eased, largely in response to the

 economic sluggishness and to lower international commodity prices. Some

 members, however, took the view that potentially destabilizing factors

 making for price rises were still present, considering the high level of

 inflation expectations, hikes in public utility charges and the possibility of

 a rise in international grain prices, coupled with the fact the current low

 price trends were largely based on a base-period effect and institutional

 factors such as the free childcare support.

  Meanwhile, some members anticipated that the housing market slump

 would persist for some time longer going forward, as the margin of

 decline in real estate prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas was

 widening and prices in the rest of the country were edging up at a slower

 pace.

 After the members’ discussions, the 1[st] Vice Minister of Strategy and

 Finance, the government representative, made the following comments on

 recent economic developments and then left the room before the Base

 Rate decision:

 Prices had kept up a stable trend, but the trend of improvement in

 employment appeared to have slowed and real economy indicators to have

 been somewhat lackluster. Although exports had recorded negative growth

 in July, owing mostly to the decrease in global demand and to the base

 effect, the current account would sustain its surplus as it had in June.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that it would be better to hold the Base

 Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, since for the time

 being there was a need to assess carefully the effects of the recent rate

 cut and to monitor the trends of real economic indicators at home and

 abroad closely, although the recovery of economic growth was very slow

 and CPI had shown a stable trend.

 Furthermore, one member expressed the opinion that, in a situation in

 which the scope for conduct of policy was fairly constrained, the policy

 capacity should be focused now on relieving the weakening sentiment of

 economic agents through an active communication strategy, since it would

 not be easy to undertake bold policy adjustments if the downside risks to

 growth materialized going forward.

 Another member argued that the direction of fiscal policy should be

 considered when making policy decisions in the coming months, since

 greater effects could be expected when the interest rate policy was

 implemented in harmony with other levers of fiscal and macroeconomic

 policy tools.

 Meanwhile, one other member asserted that, although the possibility of

 debt deflation occurring as suggested recently in some circles was

 evaluated as not high, the household debt- and real estate-related

 issues—factors to which the Korean economy was structurally vulnerable—

 posed the risk of escalation to ignite a crisis at any time, and so measures

 to resolve them must be sought with continued interest in the future.

 After the discussions detailed above, the members decided unanimously

 to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today
 to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.00% for the intermeeting

 period.

 - Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the

###### economic recovery in the US to have weakened somewhat and the

 sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have deepened.

 Growth has also continued to slow in emerging market countries, due mostly to the impact of the economic slumps in advanced countries.

 The Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be

 very moderate going forward as well, with the uncertainties
 surrounding the euro area fiscal crisis and the international financial

 markets persisting.

 □ In Korea, the Committee appraises the trend of economic growth to

 have slowed, owing to lackluster exports and domestic demand amid

 a continued surplus in the current account. On the employment front, the uptrend in the number of persons employed is being sustained,

 led by the higher age groups and the service industry. The

 Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will sustain a negative output gap for a considerable time going forward, due

 mostly to the increase in euro area risks and the sluggish economies

 of its major trading partners.

 □ Consumer price inflation came in low at 1.5% in July, owing chiefly

 to the ongoing stable trend of international oil prices and to favorable weather conditions, and core inflation also posted a

 significantly low figure. The Committee forecasts that inflation will

 remain at a low level for the time being, despite for instance pressures to hike public utility fees and the instability of international

 grain prices. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its

5

###### surrounding areas declined at a faster pace and their uptrend in the

 rest of the country slowed.

 □ In the financial markets, price variables have shown fluctuations

 influenced mainly by the changes in international financial markets conditions and revisions of domestic and world economic forecasts;

 stock prices have risen and the Korean won has appreciated against

 the US dollar. Long-term market interest rates have fallen
 substantially, due mostly to the impacts of the economic slowdown

 and of last month’s Base Rate cut.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring external risk

 factors and the consequent changes in financial and economic

 conditions at home and abroad, and also continuing its efforts to lower inflation expectations, will conduct monetary policy so as to

 stabilize consumer price inflation at the inflation target over a

 medium-term horizon amid continuing sound growth of the economy.
