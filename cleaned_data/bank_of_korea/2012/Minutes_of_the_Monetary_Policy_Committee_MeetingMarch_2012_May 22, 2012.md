###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

 After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy

 Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas:

 The assessment of many members regarding the global economy was

 that, although the international financial market unrest showed signs of

 easing, owing mostly to the expansion of the ECB’s long-term refinancing

 operation (LTRO) and the improvements in U.S. economic indicators, the

 real economy was exhibiting signs of weakening growth due the

 contraction of economic activity in the euro area and the slowing of

 emerging market countries’ exports. One of these members mentioned that

 the global liquidity, expanded through additional easing by major central

 banks, had flowed into commodity markets, pushing up prices for raw

 materials, including international oil, which was very likely to curb world

 economic growth.

 In regard to the domestic economy, members judged its pace of

 growth to be breaking out of its sluggishness somewhat, with consumption

 and facilities investment improving and exports expanding. One member

 noted, however, that it was rather premature to consider the improvements

 in some economic indicators as implying a shift to economic recovery

 from the second half of this year, and that no clear momentum driving an

 economic recovery domestically was seen.

 As to the outlook, some members forecast that the domestic economy

 would improve gradually from the second half onward as the uncertainties

 about external conditions eased, although it would be difficult to expect a

 rapid recovery since risk factors still remained, including the euro area

 sovereign debt problems and the cumulative increase in household debt.

###### Concerning the domestic financial markets, many members commented

 that stock prices had risen and the Korean won had appreciated against

 the US dollar, mostly on the easing of risk aversion tendencies and

 inflows of foreign investors’ funds. One of these members pointed out that

 attention should be paid to the possibility of foreign investor fund in- and

 outflow volatility expanding going forward, depending for example on how

 the euro area fiscal problems evolved.

 Regarding consumer prices, members remarked that headline consumer

 price inflation had come in at 3.1% in February, lower than in the

 previous month, helped mostly by a base-period effect and declines in the

 prices of livestock products. One member on the other hand assessed

 inflationary pressures as having rather increased further, since international

 oil prices had risen much more than originally forecast and public utility

 charge hikes were on the horizon, while expected inflation had been

 running above the 4% level for eight consecutive months.

 As for housing prices, one member mentioned that they remained

 sluggish in Seoul and its surrounding areas and their pace of increase in

 the rest of the country had slowed down.

##### Ⅲ. Remarks by Government Representative

###### Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the

 Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance,

 the government representative.

 With regard to the current economic situation, the 1[st] Vice Minister

 commented that, although construction investment was sluggish and the

 coincident composite index seen to have fallen, the trend of employment

 growth was continuing and major real economic indicators improving—

###### boosted for instance by the impact of the Lunar New Year having fallen

 in January rather than in February. He pointed out on the other hand that

 the situation was one in which the uncertainty arising from the run-up in

 international oil prices was rapidly mounting, amid continued fears of a

 global economic slowdown centering around Europe.

 The 1[st] Vice Minister forecast that, although the rate of increase in

 consumer prices had fallen somewhat month-on-month in February, factors

 such as international oil price hikes resulting from the sanctions against

 Iran, and international financial market volatility triggered by the European

 fiscal crisis, would work to destabilize prices in the future.

 Concerning the trends of external transactions, the 1[st] Vice Minister

 remarked that exports had increased 22.7% year-on-year in February,

 buoyed mostly by the increase in number of days worked due to the

 movement of the Lunar New Year to January and the waning of

 after-effects from the concentration of exports at the year-end. He

 meanwhile estimated that the current account, which had posted a deficit

 of 0.77 billion dollars this year, would shift to a surplus for February,

 bolstered for instance by a trade account surplus and an improvement in

 the services account.

##### Ⅳ. Discussions Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPC Members’ discussion concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that it would be better to hold the Base

 Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, agreeing that now

 was the time to examine the conditions for conducting monetary policy by

 keeping a watch on the evolution of the European sovereign debt crisis,

###### the impacts of international oil prices on the real economies at home and

 abroad and on prices, and the policy effects of additional quantitative

 easing by major countries, etc.

 One of these members commented that, although the current level of

 Base Rate remained accommodative, a rise in it at this juncture, when the

 pace of economic slowdown was finally starting to ease, might aggravate

 economic activity further, entailing risks of an expansion in the amplitude

 of economic fluctuations.

 He went on to note that inflows of the abundant global liquidity had

 recently increased, and pointed out that special attention was warranted since

 the possibility of their causing excessive credit expansion and increases in

 asset prices was high, and since it was feared that they might reverse to

 sudden outflows in the event of changes in conditions at home or abroad.

 Another member noted that efforts should be exerted to preemptively

 block the possibility of expected inflation working as a factor amplifying

 the second-round effects from supply shocks, and that there was a need to

 develop more active communication strategies, particularly given that the

 scope for operation of interest rate policy was limited.

 He also asserted that, for a fundamental solution to the household debt

 problem, comprehensive and multi-dimensional proposals should be

 explored—that could bring about a division of roles and policy

 coordination among the various economic policy authorities overseeing not

 just financial supervisory policy but also other policies such as monetary,

 fiscal and employment policies.

 After the discussions detailed above, the members decided unanimously

 to keep the Base Rate at its current level.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today

 to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 some economic indicators in the US such as employment to have sustained their trends of improvement, but economic activities in the

 euro area to have remained sluggish. Growth in emerging market

 economies has continued to exhibit signs of weakening, due mostly to slowing exports. Going forward the Committee expects the pace of

 global economic recovery to be moderate, and judges that risk factors

 still exist, including the sovereign debt problems in Europe and geopolitical risks in the Middle East.

 □ For Korea, the Committee appraises economic growth to have not

 slowed further. Although construction investment has been sluggish, consumption and facilities investment have increased and exports have

 shown a steady expansion. On the employment front, the uptrend in

 the number of persons employed is being sustained, led by the private sector. The Committee anticipates that the domestic economic

 growth rate will gradually return to its long-term trend level going

 forward, although viewing downside risks as likely to remain high for some time due mostly to the impact of external risk factors.

 □ Consumer price inflation fell to 3.1% in February despite the rise in

 petroleum product prices, owing to declines in the prices of livestock products, and core inflation, which excludes the prices of non-grain

 agricultural products and petroleum products, also dropped compared

 to the previous month. In the coming months, factors including the easing of demand-side pressures will work in favor of price stability,

###### but the Committee recognizes the presence of potentially destabilizing

 factors such as the ongoing high inflation expectations and the geopolitical risks in the Middle East. In the housing market, prices

 remained weak in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while leasehold

 deposits there rose. The rates of increase in housing prices and leasehold deposits in the rest of the country fell somewhat compared

 to the month before.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices rose, long-term market interest
 rates increased slightly, and the volatility of the Korean won

 exchange rate diminished, as the international financial market unrest

 eased further.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and

 economic risk factors both at home and abroad and endeavoring to

 lower inflation expectations, will conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the midpoint of the inflation

 target over a medium-term horizon amid continuing sound growth of

 the economy.
