###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

 After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy

 Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas:

 The assessment of many members regarding the global economy was

 that, although some US economic indicators were showing patterns of

 improvement, global economic uncertainty was mounting as the influence

 of the economic slowdown in the euro area spread to emerging market

 countries. One of these members noted that, with the transmission of the

 European sovereign debt crisis to the banking system, deleveraging was

 appearing, and forecast that this would act as an additional burden on the

 growth path of the euro area in the future.

 In regard to the current state of the domestic economy, members

 judged that its growth was showing signs of a recovery, albeit a modest

 one, with the current account shifting back into surplus and consumption

 and construction investment also increasing, amid sustained improvements

 in labor market conditions. One member mentioned, however, that the

 growth momentum was decelerating, in reflection of worsening external

 conditions such as the run-up in international oil prices and the downward

 adjustment of the world economic growth rate, etc.

 As to the outlook, while expecting the domestic economy to sustain

 growth at its long-term trend level, some members judged that the risk

 was also not small of it going into a downtrend due mainly to the high

 level of international oil prices and heightened financial market volatility,

 etc.

 Concerning the domestic financial markets, one member pointed out

###### that they generally presented a pattern of stability, with concerns about the

 domestic economy and prices easing somewhat, but had been exhibiting

 signs of greater volatility since the beginning of April in line largely with

 the sluggish U.S. employment indicators and resurgence of fiscal problems

 in some European countries.

 Regarding consumer prices, members commented that consumer price

 inflation had slowed from the previous month to register 2.6% in March,

 helped mostly by the expansion of government subsidies for childcare fees

 and free school meals. Most members pointed out, however, that attention

 should be given to the fact that upward price pressures were still high,

 due to demand-pull factors arising from the improved economy, to the

 elevated inflation expectations, and to destabilizing factors like geopolitical

 risks in the Middle East, etc.

 As for housing prices, one member mentioned that they had

 remained on a downward path for five consecutive months in Seoul and

 its surrounding areas, and their pace of increase in the rest of the country

 had not accelerated.

##### Ⅲ. Remarks by Government Representative

###### Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the

 Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance,

 the government representative.

 With regard to the current economic situation, the 1[st] Vice Minister

 assessed major real economic indicators, such as production and

 consumption, to have been improving, while the trend of employment

 recovery continued. He pointed out, however, that the situation was one in

 which growth in production appeared to be concentrated in certain sectors

###### amid a slight sluggishness in facilities investment.

 The 1[st] Vice Minister mentioned that headline inflation had fallen to

 the 2% range for the first time in 19 months in March this year.

 Concerning future price conditions, he indicated that it was too soon to

 relax due to the numerous uncertainties, such as international oil prices and

 unstable agricultural product prices. At the same time, he forecast the

 possibility of factors making for price instability materializing after April,

 particularly when the hikes in price of raw materials and oil were

 reflected in public utility charges, fees for personal services and industrial

 product prices.

 Regarding the trend of external transactions going forward, the 1[st]

 Vice Minister remarked that while exports of major items such as

 automobiles and petroleum products had run smoothly in March, total

 exports had declined 1.4% year-on-year, owing mostly to the base effect

 and the difference in the numbers of days worked. He commented on the

 other hand that imports had fallen 1.2% year-on-year in March, due to

 reduced imports of raw materials and capital goods.

 Ⅳ. Discussions Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that both economic and price conditions

 appeared to be improving month-on-month recently, but it would be better

 to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period,

 considering that downside risks to growth and factors making for price

 instability were latent, and that the uncertainties concerning conditions

 overseas persisted.

###### One member noted that, although the current level of the Base Rate

 could still be termed accommodative, it was feared that its rise at this

 juncture when economic uncertainty had become more acute due to the

 recurrence of European fiscal crisis could again worsen business activity

 which was just showing stirrings of improvement, and widen the amplitude

 of business fluctuations.

 He went on to point out that, since the negative effects of low interest

 rates, such as increased leveraging by households and businesses and the

 postponement of corporate restructuring, had intensified with the Base Rate

 being kept low for an extended period, there should be no delay in

 seeking interest rate normalization once signs of the instability at home

 and abroad easing to some degree were confirmed.

 Another member argued that the recent sluggishness in private sector

 consumption was attributable mainly to structural factors―whereby

 household financial conditions worsened as essential consumption

 expenditure increased amid the growing imbalance in income distribution

 between businesses and households―and since this was also related,

 directly and indirectly, to various issues confronting the Korean economy,

 there was a need to focus policy capacity on improving the household

 sector’s wherewithal to consume.

 Meanwhile, one other member expressed the view that there was a

 possibility of the real estate market in Seoul and its surrounding areas

 becoming greatly depressed, with transactions slumping and a reversal of

 the shortage in leasehold units appearing, and that attention to this was

 therefore needed.

 After the discussions detailed above, the members decided

 unanimously to keep the Base Rate at its current level.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today

 to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting

 period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 some economic indicators in the US to have shown trends of further

 improvement, but economic activities in the euro area to have remained sluggish. Growth in emerging market economies has

 continued to exhibit signs of weakening, due mostly to slowing

 exports. Going forward, the Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be moderate, and judges that risk factors still

 exist, including the sovereign debt problems in Europe and

 geopolitical risks in the Middle East.

 □ In Korea, although export growth has slowed the Committee

 appraises economic growth to have shown signs of a moderate recovery, with consumption and construction investment increasing.

 On the employment front, the uptrend in the number of persons

 employed is being sustained, led by the private sector. The Committee anticipates that the domestic economic growth rate will

 gradually return to its long-term trend going forward, although

 downside risks remain due mostly to the impacts of external risk factors.

 □ Consumer price inflation fell to 2.6% in March, influenced chiefly by
 the expansion of government subsidies for childcare fees and free

 school meals, and core inflation dropped compared to the previous

 month as well. The Committee does however recognize the presence of potentially destabilizing factors, such as the ongoing high inflation

 expectations and the geopolitical risks in the Middle East. In the

###### housing market, prices remained on a decline in Seoul and its

 surrounding areas and on a rise in the rest of the country, while the uptrend in leasehold deposits nationwide was maintained.

 □ In the financial markets, price variables displayed fluctuations for a
 time, affected for instance by conditions in the major economies and

 international financial markets, after which stock prices then fell and

 the Korean won depreciated against the US dollar. Long-term market interest rates continued to rise, mitigating the degree of yield curve

 inversion.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and

 economic risk factors both at home and abroad and endeavoring to

 lower inflation expectations, will conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the midpoint of the inflation

 target over a medium-term horizon amid continuing sound growth of

 the economy.
