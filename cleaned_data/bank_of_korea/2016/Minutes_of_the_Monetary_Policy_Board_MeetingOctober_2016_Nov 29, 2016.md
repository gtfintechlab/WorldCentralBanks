##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and

 International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the

 Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that,
 while the US economy had maintained its economic recovery, the euro area still had not shown any signs of improvement, and the Chinese economy had maintained its moderate growth. As to international financial markets, members evaluated that major price variables, such as global interest rates and stock prices, had remained generally stable despite fluctuations owing to changes in expectations of major advanced countries’ monetary policies.

 Concerning the domestic economy, some members assessed that,
 although exports and facilities investment had been sluggish due to negative external conditions, the economy had continued to improve, led mainly by favorable construction investment and increased government spending.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members
 evaluated that major price variables had fluctuated, influenced for instance by the possibility of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and by the rise in global oil prices.

 As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had risen
 sharply to 1.2% from the previous month’s 0.4% due mainly to increases in agricultural product prices, and that core inflation had also risen month-on-month to 1.3%.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 changes in the domestic and international financial and economic

 environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current

 level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.

 One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to closely

 monitor changes in upside and downside macroeconomic risks, housing market

 conditions, the trend of household debt growth, the future directions of major

 countries’ monetary policies, and international oil price movements, while

 maintaining the Base Rate at the current 1.25 percent level for the

 intermeeting period. The member noted that, according to the October

 Economic Outlook released by the Bank of Korea Research Department, real

 GDP is projected to increase by 2.7 percent in 2016 and by 2.8 percent in

 2017, figures that are not low considering external conditions and the GDPs

 of major countries and that do not differ greatly from the Korean economy’s

 potential growth rate. The member, however, put forward the view that

 uncertainties surrounding the forecast growth path still remain high, due

 mainly to the delayed recovery of world trade, possible unstable movements

 in international oil prices, and the worsened economic sentiment associated

 with corporate restructuring. The member added that, according to the price

 inflation outlook, consumer price inflation is expected to rise gradually,

 influenced for instance by the dissipation of the effect of the temporary

 electricity fee reduction and the rise in international oil prices, to be at the

 mid-1% range at around the end of 2016 and to approach the 2% inflation

 target in the first half of 2017. The member, meanwhile, noted that, in terms

 of financial stability, caution should be exercised with respect to several risk

 factors. In particular, the member noted that apartment prices in the Seoul

3


-----

###### Metropolitan region have recently risen greatly, a pattern that was likely to

 spread to other regions or other housing types in view of the current housing

 market conditions. The member also commented that household lending is

 highly likely to maintain strong growth for the time being, influenced for

 instance by the start of the autumn moving season, buoyant sales of new

 apartments, and the trend of housing price increases. Finally, the member

 judged that, although international financial markets have recently been

 relatively stable, there still are factors that could lead to increased volatility in

 these markets, such as the future directions of major countries’ monetary

 policies, uncertainties related to Brexit, the possibility of European bank

 insolvencies, and the US presidential election.

 Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to

 maintain the Base Rate at the current 1.25 percent level for the intermeeting

 period. The member noted that the world economy was sustaining its

 moderate pace of growth, and the impacts of impending US rate hikes on the

 international financial markets and the foreign exchange market in Korea were

 likely to be limited. Concerning the domestic economy, the member

 commented that although exports had remained sluggish and the restructuring

 of vulnerable industries had commenced, there had not been changes in

 macroeconomic conditions that would call for an adjustment to the Base Rate.

 The member, however, expressed concern that Korea’s economic growth in

 the upper-2 percent range, while consistent with the potential growth rate, was

 led by construction investment, and housing construction in particular, which

 was expanding at an unsustainable rate. The member also voiced concern

 over gradually mounting vulnerabilities related to household debt, which was

 increasing rapidly in line with construction growth. The member meanwhile

 anticipated that inflation was likely to settle near the 2 percent target next

 year. The member also expected that the risk of a further decline in

 underlying inflation, which the member judged to still run below target at the

 mid-1 percent range, will be somewhat controllable. Accordingly, the member

###### expressed the need for caution in adjusting the Base Rate and emphasized

 that, in the interest of macroeconomic stability, there was an urgent need to

 encourage a soft landing for both the expansion in construction and the rapid

 increase in household debt.

 One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to

 hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting

 period, as growth and consumer prices were seen to generally follow the

 path originally forecast and the inflation target was likely to be achieved

 over a medium-term horizon given expected changes in exogenous

 variables and movements in the GDP gap. Meanwhile, the member pointed

 out that it was more difficult than ever to accurately calculate potential

 growth and the GDP gap, as Korea, along with many other countries, was

 entering the era of the ‘new normal’. The member argued that domestic

 and overseas factors, such as the decreasing global trade volume, the

 declining number of high-quality manufacturing jobs, the rising savings

 rate and concerns about consumption contraction, would continue to affect

 the industrial structure of the Korean economy and propensity for

 consumption and cause changes in potential growth, and went on to stress

 that if changes occur in the outlook for growth, it would become more

 important to identify the exact causes behind such changes. The member

 stated that a small open economy like Korea should take all these matters

 into consideration in order to maximize the long-term effects of monetary

 policy on the real economy.   

 Meanwhile, one member pointed out a number of major considerations

 for the appropriate conduct of monetary policy. First, the member stated

 that short-term growth was not expected to deviate far from the path

 originally forecast and that economic growth next year was forecast to be

 generally consistent with the pace of potential growth, with improvement

 in exports and facilities investment boosted by a gradual recovery of

5


-----

###### global trade more than offsetting a slowdown in construction investment

 and consumption. The member stated, however, that there was a relatively

 high degree of uncertainty surrounding the growth path. Second, with

 regard to inflation, the member argued that the uptrend in consumer prices

 had slowed owing chiefly to electricity tariff cuts and falls in the

 exchange rate, but the price path decline was estimated to be limited due

 to rising agricultural product prices and weakening downside pressures on

 low oil prices. Looking at various core inflation indicators, the member

 stated that the underlying trend of inflation had continued and that

 inflation would likely converge to its 2-percent target over a medium-term

 horizon. Third, the member argued that the slack in production had been

 worsening again, as the average capacity utilization rate fell significantly

 in line with a decline in production due to inventory adjustments and

 labor strikes at automakers, which more than offset the moderate growth

 in demand-side pressures from facilities investment in the manufacturing

 sector. The member mentioned that the slack in the labor force had

 recently been showing improvement, but the labor market had failed to

 improve in qualitative terms as growth in employment was seen mostly in

 the low-wage and services sectors. Fourth, concerning financial stability

 conditions, the member noted that household debt continued to grow faster

 than usual and that the uptrend of housing prices, which had thus far

 been limited to certain markets, was spreading gradually. The member

 added that the substantial growth in the volume of real estate-related

 finance was heightening the vulnerability and cyclicality of the financial

 system to real estate market conditions. In overall consideration of the

 above-mentioned real economic and inflation trends, slack in production

 and financial stability conditions, the member assessed that it was

 advisable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25

 percent for the intermeeting period.

 Another member presented the view that, in overall consideration of the

6


-----

###### recent inflation, economic and financial stability situations, it would be

 appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level. After stating that

 construction investment remained brisk, boosted largely by accommodative

 monetary policy, while exports and facilities investment remained in a

 slump due to negative external conditions, the member went on to forecast

 this year’s growth rate at near 2.7 percent, as projected by the Bank of

 Korea Research Department in July this year. The member noted that

 inflation had rebounded to 1.2 percent in September from the previous

 month’s 0.4 percent, affected by a rise in agricultural product prices. The

 member forecast that external factors such as oil prices would act as

 major variables for the economy and prices for the next year, and also

 mentioned that a recovery of exports and facilities investment would be

 needed to keep the growth rate at this year’s level, which would also

 need to be supported by a stronger global economic recovery and a

 restoration of the income elasticity of trade. The member forecast that if

 oil prices recover next year as major institutes had projected, faster growth

 in EMEs would lead to a gradual recovery of the global economy, and

 inflation in Korea would converge to its target of 2 percent. Concerning

 the recovery of the income elasticity of trade, however, the member’s

 assessment was that, given a lack of consensus among major institutes on

 the issue, there was a high degree of uncertainty regarding the outlook for

 the recovery of related exports and facilities investment. In this regard, the

 member evaluated that, in the 2017 economic outlook presented by the

 Research Department, growth forecasts were exposed to higher uncertainty

 than inflation forecasts. Meanwhile, the member assessed household debt, a

 major risk factor in terms of financial stability, as maintaining strong

 growth in September, thereby increasing volatility in the housing market,

 which would lead to higher risk of greater economic volatility. The

 member stressed in particular that the trend in the market for new

 apartments was related to the direction of next year’s construction

 investment and growth outlooks, and that it would therefore be necessary

7


-----

###### to closely monitor future housing price trends and actual new apartment

 transactions.

  One other member expressed the view that it would be advisable to

 hold the Base Rate at its current level at this time, and that when

 operating monetary policy in the future, it would be necessary to monitor

 the progress of the economy while paying attention to the possibility of

 rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve. The member stated that the

 economic growth rate was projected at 2.7 percent for this year and 2.8

 percent for next year, but there were various downside risks ─ on the

 external side, the possibility of a global economic slowdown resulting from

 slowing Chinese growth, US Fed rate hikes and Brexit, and on the

 domestic side, corporate restructuring, a possible contraction of economic

 sentiment under the anti-graft law, and destabilization of the labor market

 from strikes and other factors. The member added that it should be

 carefully examined whether the pace of future economic growth would be

 as rapid as suggested in the current growth forecast. The member

 particularly emphasized the need to cope with risk factors while speeding

 up restructuring efforts, including those for industrial structural reform, and

 at the same time maintaining accommodative monetary and fiscal policies.

 In addition, noting the analysis that the uptrend in housing prices would

 continue for the time being and there was only a slight chance of a

 collapse in construction activities, the member argued that, although it was

 important to address household debt with macroprudential policy, recent

 household debt growth was restricting monetary policy and thus household

 debt should be thoroughly and continuously monitored. Finally, the

 member stressed that at the end of last year domestic and overseas

 financial markets had preemptively reflected the US Federal Reserve’s rate

 hike, and the member also emphasized that, although the dominant outlook

 was that the negative effects of US interest rate hikes would be limited

 this year compared with last year, vigilance should be maintained to

 prepare for the possibility of greater market volatility.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

 leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting

 period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Board considers that

 the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and

 that the Chinese economy has maintained its moderate pace of

 growth. However, the improvements in the euro area have remained

 weak. The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain

 its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, while being

 affected by factors including changes in the monetary policies of

 major countries such as the US, the uncertainties related to Britain's

 exit from the European Union, and economic conditions in

 emerging market countries.

 □ Looking at the Korean economy, exports have declined but

 domestic demand activities appear to have continued their

 improvements, driven mainly by investment in construction. On the

 employment front, the trend of increase in the number of persons

 employed slowed in September, while the unemployment rate rose

 compared to that in September of last year. The

 employment-to-population ratio was meanwhile slightly higher. The

 Board forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its trend of

 modest growth going forward, owing chiefly to a gradual recovery

9

###### in global trade and to the effects of expansionary macroeconomic

 policies. However, in view of economic conditions domestically and

 abroad, it judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to

 be high.

 □ Consumer price inflation rose from 0.4% the month before to 1.2%

 in September, owing chiefly to increases in agricultural product

 prices. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product

 prices also rose to 1.3%, from 1.1% in August. In the housing

 market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices

 have continued, centering around the Seoul area. Looking ahead the

 Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will gradually rise,

 due mainly to the disappearance of the effect of the temporary cut

 in electricity fees and to the rebound in international oil prices.

 □ In the domestic financial markets since September, long-term market

 interest rates and the Korean won-US dollar and Korean

 won-Japanese yen exchange rates have risen, in line mainly with

 strengthened expectations of a policy rate hike by the US Federal

 Reserve. Stock prices have rebounded after having declined, owing

 in part to the rise in international oil prices. Household lending has

 sustained a trend of substantial increase at a level exceeding that of

 recent years, led by mortgage loans.

 □ Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to

 ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and

 consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a

 medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.

 In this process it will closely monitor the trend of increase in

 household debt, any changes in the monetary policies of major

 countries, and the progress of corporate restructuring.
