##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and

 International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the

 Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the
 US economy had shown robust growth, the euro area had seen a modest recovery, and the Chinese economy had sustained its stable growth. As to international financial markets, members evaluated that global stock prices and interest rates had risen rapidly and the US dollar had strengthened, influenced mainly by the policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and expectations concerning the new US government’s policies.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members assessed it as having
 continued to grow, albeit slowly, as exports showed a slight increase but domestic demand activities exhibited sluggish movements with facilities and construction investment declining.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members
 evaluated that long-term market interest rates and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate had risen, influenced mainly by the steep rise in US Treasury yields, that stock prices had slightly rebounded after having declined, owing in part to the weakening of investment sentiment, and that bank household lending had sustained its persistently high rate of increase, led by mortgage loans.

 As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had
 registered 1.3%, unchanged from the previous month’s level, and that core inflation had fallen slightly from 1.5% in the previous month to 1.4%.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 changes in the domestic and international financial and economic

 environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current

 level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.

 One member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base Rate

 at its current level for the intermeeting period, the Bank of Korea should

 keep a close watch on the future developments of downside risks in line with

 the recently soaring uncertainties at home and abroad. The member noted

 that, although the world economy had been continuing its gradual recovery,

 close attention should be paid to the possibility of financial instability in

 vulnerable emerging market economies in line with increased protectionism

 and US interest rate normalization. The member, meanwhile, judged that the

 domestic financial markets had remained stable overall, and that the recent

 sharp increases in long-term interest rates were attributable to the

 normalization of the yield curve. The member also assessed the foreign

 exchange market as having the capacity to absorb external shocks to some

 extent, thanks to the current account surplus and a steady fall in the ratio of

 short-term external debt to official foreign reserves. The member, however,

 pointed out the possibility of the overall economy falling short of the

 originally forecast path, considering the trends of decrease in the

 manufacturing capacity utilization ratio and in services production. The

 member then went on to emphasize that attention should be paid to the fact

 that there had been heightened downside risks to the overall macroeconomy

 stemming from increased uncertainties at home and abroad. Concerning

 consumer price inflation, the member noted that there had not been any

 marked underlying upward trend of prices, despite the rebound of oil prices


-----

###### and the easing of concerns about global deflation. The member then raised

 the concern that, against this backdrop, if downside risks materialize, the

 negative output gap could increase, thus gradually lowering the possibility of

 inflation converging to the target. Accordingly, the member stated the view

 that it was desirable at this juncture to assess the direction of future interest

 rate policy based on a detailed analysis of the degree to which downside

 risks to growth and inflation would increase. In addition, to reduce the

 remaining uncertainty in the markets over the direction of monetary policy

 amid the US Fed’s monetary policy normalization, the member stressed that

 Korea’s monetary policy should be implemented in accordance with Korea’s

 own macroeconomic and financial market conditions. The member went on to

 add that an active role for fiscal policy should be emphasized, considering

 the current macroeconomic trends.

 Another member pointed out a number of major considerations for the

 appropriate conduct of monetary policy. First, the member stated that,

 although the domestic economy was expected to maintain a modest trend

 of growth, downside risks to growth were judged to have increased, due

 mainly to growing uncertainties in conditions at home and abroad and to

 the resulting contraction in economic sentiment. The member then noted,

 however, that since there was a high level of uncertainty, the Bank should

 closely and comprehensively examine changes in conditions and the

 resulting impacts to predict the future growth path. Second, the member

 stated that it would be necessary to keep a close watch on how that day’s

 Fed rate hike and policy rate projections by the FOMC meeting

 participants would affect international financial markets and domestic

 financial and foreign exchange markets. The member also noted that the

 Bank needed to pay attention to the possibility that heightened volatility in

 the financial and foreign exchange markets could recur, depending on the

 pace of the Fed’s monetary policy normalization and changes in political

 conditions at home and abroad going forward. Finally, the member found

 it difficult to be optimistic that the trend of household debt growth would


-----

###### stabilize next year, since demand for home mortgage lending was expected

 to be strong, led by apartments under construction that had already been

 sold, despite policy efforts to curb household debt. Accordingly, the

 member noted that it would be better to keep the Base Rate unchanged

 from the current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period. The

 member, meanwhile, noted that as both downside risks to the

 macroeconomy and financial stability risks were increasing amid heightened

 uncertainties, monetary policy alone could not ensure economic and

 financial stability, and so the role of fiscal policy was important. The

 member stated that when there was a high level of uncertainty within the

 economy, fiscal policy, which brings about direct effects, could be a more

 effective policy instrument than monetary policy, whose effects spread

 through indirect channels. The member went on to note that monetary

 easing could increase financial stability risks, for instance by increasing

 foreign portfolio investment outflow pressures and making it difficult to

 rein in household debt growth. Therefore, the member argued that the

 Bank should actively consult with the government to ensure that fiscal

 policy could be operated in a more expansionary manner.

 Meanwhile, one member took the view that it would be appropriate to

 keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, in overall

 consideration of factors such as household debt that cause financial instability

 and the heightened uncertainties concerning domestic and overseas conditions,

 despite a slight increase in downside risks to the recent real economy and

 next year’s inflation. With regard to the real economy, the member assessed

 Korea’s economic growth as having peaked in the second quarter of 2016

 and then having slowed afterwards, with the index of all industry production

 (IAIP) continuing to decline and domestic demand, including private

 consumption and construction investment, showing slower growth. On the

 other hand, the member positively evaluated exports, saying that exports to

 China and the US had all shifted to increases, led primarily by those of


-----

###### semiconductors, and that exports had become more likely to maintain their

 upward trend going forward. In terms of prices, meanwhile, the member

 mentioned that consumer price inflation had accelerated on a rebound of oil

 prices since September 2016, while core inflation had slowed in reflection of

 the economic slowdown, and evaluated that factors such as the widening of

 the negative output gap and the disappearing of the base-period effect from

 oil price declines could act as downward pressures on inflation from 2017

 onwards. Concerning financial stability, the member forecast the household

 debt growth rate to stabilize gradually, as house buyer sentiment had

 contracted since the government’s real estate measures announced on

 November 3, 2016 and the upward trend of housing prices in Seoul and its

 surrounding areas had been showing signs of stabilization, although household

 debt had maintained strong growth at the 10 percent level in November.

 However, the member assessed that it was still difficult to expect overall

 household debt growth to stabilize, due to the sustained growth in other loans

 extended by the banking sector and in mortgage lending by non-bank

 financial institutions. The member went on to stress the need for stronger risk

 management at non-bank financial institutions.

  One member mentioned that, although accommodative monetary policy

 had been implemented in consideration of real economic conditions, this had

 presupposed financial stability to a certain extent, and that it was therefore

 time to enhance the comprehensive coordination of policies, including fiscal

 policy and structural and regulatory reforms. The member also assessed the

 US Federal Reserve’s rate hike that had signalled the end of ultra-loose

 monetary policy as having provided more maneuvering room for the Korean

 monetary policy authorities. The member, however, expressed the view that,

 considering the sustained external uncertainties, the increased downside risks

 forecast in the domestic economic outlook, and the expectation that the price

 path would fall slightly below its estimate, it would be desirable to keep the

 Base Rate at its current level of 1.25% for the intermeeting period. The

 member also emphasized the following points with respect to the responses of


-----

###### the Korean economy to the trend of low interest rates and the implications of

 the US rate hike for the Korean economy. First, the member expressed the

 concern that the recent accommodative policy stance had been supporting the

 Korean economy but capital had been concentrated in the real estate sector,

 which could threaten financial stability going forward. Next, the member

 pointed out that Korea’s yield curve had steepened, affected by US monetary

 policy, and this could help ease the issue of ineffective distribution in the

 real economy. However, the member also noted that vigilance was needed

 against the possibility that rate hikes in advanced countries unaccompanied by

 real economic recoveries could work to worsen global financial market

 unrest.

  Another member pointed out a number of major considerations for the

 appropriate conduct of monetary policy. First, the member stated that

 concerning the trend of growth at home, growth had continued to depend

 on domestic demand, such as consumption and construction investment, as

 external demand still had not shown sufficient improvement despite signs

 that the export sluggishness had eased somewhat. The member went on to

 note that the downside risks to the growth path had been increasing

 gradually with manufacturing production continuing to slow down and

 production in the construction and services sectors weakening somewhat.

 Second, the member stated that consumer price inflation had remained at

 the previous month’s level, but core inflation had decelerated somewhat

 due mainly to a fall in the prices of non-petroleum industrial products.

 The member commented that, although consumer price inflation was

 expected to accelerate gradually with the downward trend of import and

 producer prices coming to an end, there were various upside and downside

 risks for the future price path on the regulatory and supply sides, such as

 electricity tariff revision, oil prices, exchange rates and agricultural product

 prices. Third, the member stated that, although inventory adjustment

 pressures had been decreasing, the substantially increased slack seemed to

 have gradually set in, with the average capacity utilization ratio in the


-----

###### manufacturing sector remaining at its record low level and demand-side

 pressures from facilities investment decreasing for the second consecutive

 month. The slack in the labor force had been overall showing weaker

 improvement, with the average time gap, including the time-related

 underemployed, increasing slightly and the participation gap, including

 potential job seekers, declining at a slower pace than during the same

 month last year. Fourth, looking at financial stability conditions, growth in

 domestic long- and short-term interest rates and the exchange rate had

 stabilized with the easing of the surge in long-term interest rates

 immediately after the US presidential election, but market instability had

 been increasing due chiefly to the resumption of Fed rate hikes and the

 upward adjustment to the Fed’s rate hike projection. Furthermore, despite

 household debt management measures, household debt had continued to

 grow regardless of households’ income conditions, and rising lending rates

 had worked to increase debt payment burdens and the risk of vulnerable

 borrowers going bankrupt. In overall consideration of the above-mentioned

 real economic and inflation trends, slack in production and financial

 stability conditions, the member assessed that it was advisable to keep the

 Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25 percent for the

 intermeeting period.

  One other member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to

 keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level for the intermeeting

 period. The member mentioned that Korea’s economic outlook for next year

 was not bright, with domestic and overseas risks to the Korean economy

 increasing further. The member also took the view that amid sluggish private

 consumption and facilities investment, construction investment, which had

 contributed greatly to growth, was also expected to slow down. He added

 that exports were likely to improve compared to this year, boosted by the

 global economic recovery, but the trend of protectionism was expected to

 have negative effects. In addition, the member argued that considering

 employment instability and the level of excess production capacity in the


-----

###### manufacturing sector, the real economy was likely to be sluggish and the

 situation seemed to require accommodative monetary policy. However, the

 member pointed out that there also remained uncertainties concerning

 monetary policy, including US rate hikes and household debt. The member

 stressed that, although the Korean economy was not likely to be affected

 heavily by US rate hikes, vigilance needed to be maintained considering the

 current high uncertainties, and went on to emphasize that, concerning

 household debt, constant monitoring was needed of real estate market

 conditions and the effects of various government household debt measures.

 The member also assessed that, in response to the recent surge in long-term

 market interest rates, the Bank of Korea had made appropriate measures to

 ease market unrest by buying Treasury bonds and reducing the issuance of

 monetary stabilization bonds, and that since excessive interest rate hikes

 within a short period of time could increase corporate and household burdens

 and undermine financial market stability, efforts should be maintained to

 closely monitor their effects and make appropriate responses if needed.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

 leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Board considers that the

 trend of steady economic recovery in the US has been sustained and

 that the Chinese economy has maintained its moderate pace of growth.

 The euro area has also continued its improvements. The Board

 forecasts that the global economy will maintain its moderate recovery

 going forward, while being affected by factors such as the directions

 of the new government's economic policies and the pace of monetary

 policy normalization in the US, the uncertainties related to Britain's

 exit from the European Union, and economic conditions in emerging

 market countries.

 □ Looking at the Korean economy, exports have shifted to an increase

 but the improvements in domestic demand activities have been weak.

 On the employment front, the employment-to-population ratio in

 November was higher than that in November of last year, as the

 number of persons employed increased. The unemployment rate

 meanwhile maintained the same level as in November last year. The

 Board forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its trend of

 modest growth going forward, in line with a recovery of the global

 economy, but judges that the downside risks to the future growth path


-----

###### have expanded a bit, owing chiefly to the high degrees of uncertainty

 in recent domestic and external conditions.

 □ Consumer price inflation registered 1.3% in November, the same as in

 October despite the extent of decline in petroleum product prices

 having narrowed, as the pace of increase in prices of industrial

 products other than petroleum slowed. Core inflation excluding

 agricultural and petroleum product prices fell slightly to 1.4%, from

 1.5% in October. In the housing market, sales and leasehold deposit

 prices have shown upward trends, centering around Seoul and its

 surrounding areas. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer

 price inflation will gradually rise, due mainly to the effects of the

 increases in international oil prices.

 □ In the domestic financial markets since November, influenced mainly

 by expectations concerning the new US government's economic policies

 and the monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve, long-term market

 interest rates and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate have risen.

 The Korean won-Japanese yen exchange rate has meanwhile fallen, in

 line with the yen’s relative weakening. Stock prices have rebounded

 after having declined, owing in part to increases in global stock prices.

 The extent of growth in household lending has expanded, led by home

 mortgage loans.

 □ Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to

 ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer

 price inflation approaches the target level over a medium-term horizon,

 while paying attention to financial stability. In this process it will

 closely monitor the uncertainties in domestic and external conditions

 and their effects, the progress of monetary policy normalization by the

 US Federal Reserve, and the trend of increase in household debt.
