##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and
 International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the
 US economy had shown robust growth with its employment indicators improving, that although markets had quickly steadied after the Brexit shock, the trend of recovery in the euro area had weakened due mainly to sluggish exports, and that the Chinese economy had maintained its growth, led by consumption. As to international financial markets, some members evaluated that global stock prices had risen substantially, lifted by expectations for additional monetary easing by major countries, while international oil prices had fallen sharply on weakened expectations for resolving the oversupply issue.

 Concerning the domestic economy, most members assessed that, while
 the sluggishness of exports had continued, domestic demand had improved modestly, with consumption and construction investment picking up. However, uncertainties surrounding the growth path were judged to be increasing.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members
 noted that stock prices had risen and the won-dollar rate had plunged, as expectations for monetary policy easing in major countries and improved global risk appetite induced inflows of foreign portfolio investment. Furthermore, they judged long-term market interest rates to show slight fluctuations at very low levels.

 As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had fallen
 from 0.8% the month before to 0.7%, in line with a slowdown in service fee growth as the effects of public transport fare hikes dissipated. They also commented that core inflation had fallen slightly month-on-month to 1.6 percent.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 changes in the domestic and international economic environments, it would

 be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for

 the intermeeting period.

 One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep

 the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, as domestic

 and overseas economic conditions had not changed much from the

 previous month and economic growth had been holding to the existing

 forecast path. The member also presented the view that, as the Korean

 economic structure had been rebalanced toward domestic demand and

 services and away from exports and manufacturing, attention should be

 paid to the interpretation of various economic indicators as well. The

 member stressed that, for example, since there had been a shift in the

 focus of investment demand from volume to knowledge production,

 attention should be directed toward improvement in investment quality,

 rather than the amount invested. The member also emphasized that it was

 more important at this juncture to focus on appropriate changes and

 innovations in goods, including manufactured and service goods, rather

 than on growth in manufacturing production. The member judged that,

 given the structural changes in the Korean economy, reduced productivity,

 population aging, and monetary easing in major advanced countries, it was

 necessary to maintain a low interest rate stance for the time being. The

 member, however, noted that, since the ultimate goals of monetary policy

 were to achieve potential growth and maintain inflation at the target level

 by revitalizing consumption and investment while securing financial

 stability, much thought should continue to be given to the most effective

3

###### ways to harmonize macroprudential and monetary policy tools to achieve

 these goals.

 Another member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base

 Rate at the current 1.25% level for the intermeeting period, it would be best

 to keep a careful watch on changes in risks to the macroeconomy and

 financial stability. The member stressed that, taking into overall consideration

 domestic and overseas economic conditions, special attention should be paid

 to two points in the conduct of monetary policy. First, uncertainties

 surrounding economic growth and the price path were very high. Second,

 despite measures to improve the quality of household debt, risks to financial

 stability were increasing as the amount of such debt continued to sustain

 strong growth. The member also presented the opinion that a careful watch

 should be kept on growth in household debt, developments in asset markets,

 progress in corporate restructuring, monetary policy changes in major countries

 and protectionist stirrings.

 Another member pointed out a number of major considerations for the

 appropriate conduct of monetary policy. First, the member stated that risk

 factors in the second half, such as corporate restructuring, the

 anti-solicitation law and a possible resumption of rate hikes by the US

 Federal Reserve, had already been reflected in the July forecasts, and

 therefore it was too soon to predict that growth would depart significantly

 from the forecast path. Second, the member argued that the downside risks

 to the price path for the second half were increasing, due mainly to the

 falls in oil prices and the strengthening of the won against the dollar.

 Third, the member pointed out that there had been no significant

 improvements with respect to the slack in the manufacturing sector, which

 had increased substantially in line with weakening production resulting

 chiefly from the worsening export slump, and went on to state that overall

 labor market slack continued to improve in July but potential labor market

 instability had increased. Based on an overall examination of labor market

###### slack and the trends in inflation and the real economy, the member argued

 that while keeping the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for

 the intermeeting period, it would be necessary to examine the spillover

 effects of the previous Base Rate cut and observe how things progressed

 with the supplementary budget while keeping a careful watch on the

 developments and related effects of the above-mentioned factors, which are

 giving rise to uncertainties at home and abroad. The member added that,

 as the Base Rate had decreased to its lowest level in history, various risk

 factors were becoming apparent in terms of financial stability, including

 increased household lending by non-bank financial institutions and the

 possibility of greater risk-taking incentives for financial institutions, and

 accordingly close monitoring was required and preemptive action should be

 taken as necessary.

 Meanwhile, another member expressed the opinion that it would be

 appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged for the intermeeting period,

 given that construction investment and consumption had led economic

 growth during the second quarter of this year, that the economy in July

 had not deviated far from the forecast, and that headline inflation was

 expected to converge to the medium-term inflation target in the first half

 of next year. First, looking at business activities, the member stated that

 considering the fast growth in housing construction since the second half of

 last year, construction investment, particularly in housing construction,

 would likely experience corrections, which the member judged as desirable.

 Furthermore, the member evaluated consumption as having shown gradual

 improvement if the effects of the slowdown in automobile sales resulting

 from the termination of individual consumption tax cuts in June were

 excluded. In terms of propensities for consumption, meanwhile, the member

 expressed the view that the average propensity to consume (APC) had

 declined since 2011, and that attention needed to be paid to the fact that

 the APC had declined much more among homeowners compared to

5


-----

###### non-homeowners during the past five years. The member also assessed that

 this phenomenon was likely attributable either to the fall in the values of

 assets held by homeowners in line with the declines in housing prices from

 2011 to 2013 or to the growth in their precautionary savings. The member

 went on to state that, given that housing price rises prior to 2010 were not

 seen as a bubble, that the delinquency rate of household loans remained

 low, and that the recent sharp increase in household loans had been

 supported by the borrowing capacities of households, the increased

 precautionary savings of senior homeowners might have had a major impact

 on the decline in their APC, and their longer residual life expectancies

 might have acted as a factor accelerating this decline. In terms of financial

 stability, the member put forward the view that, since household lending

 had grown rapidly since 2014, a careful watch on the soundness of the

 household sector balance sheet was imperative in order to seek the optimal

 mix of monetary, fiscal and macroprudential policies from the second half

 of this year. Finally, in terms of inflation, the member assessed that,

 although July’s headline inflation stood at 0.7 percent due to low oil prices

 and exchange rates, the headline inflation forecast of nearly 2 percent for

 the first half of next year was still valid, with the effects of oil price

 declines fading away and inflation rising gradually.

 One other member expressed the opinion that it would be necessary to

 keep an eye on future macroeconomic developments while maintaining the

 Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent. The member noted that, while

 no significant change had been seen with respect to anemic global growth,

 markets had steadied quickly after the Brexit shock, and this had helped ease

 the risk aversion of global finance capital, leading to a resumption of capital

 flows into Korea and other EMEs. On the domestic side, the member’s

 assessment was that, although exports had remained sluggish, construction

 investment had continued to pick up and consumption indicators in May and

 June had also been relatively favorable. However, the member judged that

 with housing prices stabilizing in line with the sharp increase in the housing

6


-----

###### supply, the driving force behind the currently favorable construction

 investment was likely to gradually weaken. Moreover, the member assessed

 that the recovery of consumption indicators was largely attributable to the

 one-off factor of individual consumption tax cuts on automobiles, and thus it

 did not necessarily imply a further continuation of consumption recovery. The

 member also called attention to the fact that a tangible recovery of exports

 was unlikely in the short term, and that a careful watch needed to be kept

 on macroeconomic uncertainties resulting from the restructuring of vulnerable

 sectors and on the growing possibility that inflation might fall somewhat short

 of the original forecast path. In this regard, the member considered it

 appropriate to monitor future macroeconomic developments while holding the

 Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period. The member also

 stressed that an improvement in the soundness of household debt was a

 necessary condition for a more flexible monetary policy.

 Another member pointed to the need to hold the Base Rate at its current

 level for the intermeeting period and observe the progress of 

 macroeconomic policy for a little while longer. The member mentioned that

 a preemptive Base Rate cut had been made in June this year and that the

 government’s supplementary budget combined with accommodative monetary

 policy would likely affect consumer and investor sentiment positively. The

 member went on to state that in-depth analyses should continue to be made

 of various risk factors, including the household debt issue, the stability of the

 financial markets amid changes in domestic and external conditions, the

 effects of corporate restructuring and the profitability of financial institutions.

 With regard to the household debt issue in particular, the member argued

 that it was necessary to closely examine the effects of the Base Rate cut on

 the growth in household debt, and also look at the shift to household loans

 issued by non-bank financial institutions rather than banks following

 implementation of a guideline to encourage banks to strengthen their

 mortgage application screening, along with the related effects and policy

 responses. In addition, the member put forward the view that, although the

7

###### international financial market and the Korean FX market had stabilized

 following the Brexit decision, it would be necessary to monitor the FX

 market, in which excessive unidirectional expectations seemed to have

 formed, and the member also stated that the possibility that changed

 circumstances could lead to another US Federal Reserve rate hike should not

 be overlooked. In addition, the member mentioned that attention must be

 paid to the effects of corporate restructuring on the profitability of financial

 institutions and on the financial markets, and also to the possibility of a

 bond market crunch, while examining how continuously low interest rates

 have affected the profitability and investment patterns of financial institutions.

 Finally, the member stressed that the central bank should pay careful

 attention to the risk factors mentioned above while maintaining its monetary

 easing policy.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

 leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting

 period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Bank of Korea

 considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been

 sustained and that the Chinese economy has maintained its moderate

 pace of growth. However, the improvements in the euro area have

 weakened. The Bank of Korea forecasts that, while the global

 economy will maintain its weak recovery going forward, it will be

 affected by factors including changes in the monetary policies of

 major countries, the uncertainties related to Britain’s exit from the

 European Union, and economic conditions in emerging market

 countries.

 □ Looking at the Korean economy, exports have remained on their

 trend of decline but domestic demand activities including

 consumption appear to have continued their albeit moderate

 improvements. The sentiments of economic agents have meanwhile

 improved slightly. On the employment front, as the number of

 persons employed has increased, the employment-to-population ratio

 rose and the unemployment rate fell in July compared to those in

 July of last year. The Bank of Korea forecasts that the domestic

 economy will sustain its trend of modest growth going forward,

###### owing chiefly to expansionary macroeconomic policies, but in view

 of economic conditions domestically and abroad judges the

 uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high.

 □ Consumer price inflation fell from 0.8% the month before to 0.7%

 in July, in line mainly with a slowdown in the rate of increase in

 service fees. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum

 product prices also declined to 1.6%, from 1.7% in June. In the

 housing market, sales and leasehold deposit prices showed low rates

 of increase. Looking ahead the Bank of Korea forecasts that

 consumer price inflation will remain at a low level for the time

 being, and then gradually rise as the effects of the low oil prices

 diminish.

 □ In the domestic financial markets since July, stock prices have risen

 and the Korean won has appreciated to a large extent against the

 US dollar, as foreigners’ securities investment funds have shown net

 inflows owing chiefly to expectations of monetary policy easing in

 major countries. The won has meanwhile appreciated against the

 Japanese yen, in line with the won’s relative strengthening.

 Long-term market interest rates have shown slight fluctuations at

 low levels. Household lending has sustained a trend of substantial

 increase at a level exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage

 loans.

 □ Looking ahead, the Bank of Korea will conduct monetary policy so

 as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and

 consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a

 medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.

 In this process it will closely monitor the trend of increase in

 household debt, any changes in the monetary policies of major

 countries, and the progress of corporate restructuring.
