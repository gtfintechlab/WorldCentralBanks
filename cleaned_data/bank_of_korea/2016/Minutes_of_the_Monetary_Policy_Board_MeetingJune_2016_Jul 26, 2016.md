##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’,

 ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Markets’, the discussions of

 the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that,
 although the US economy was showing recovery from its contraction, uncertainties still existed due to unexpectedly weak employment numbers in the US, that the improvements in the euro area, although weak, had continued, and that the Chinese economy had maintained its moderate growth, boosted by the government’s aggressive policy measures. As to international financial markets, most members evaluated global stock prices as exhibiting generally stable movements, due chiefly to the run-up in international oil prices, and Treasury bond yields and exchange rates in major countries as having shown wide fluctuations, influenced for instance by changes in expectations for the Fed rate hike.

 Concerning the domestic economy, most members assessed that the
 trend of decline in exports had continued and the trend of improvement in domestic demand had weakened, with consumption and construction investment remaining sluggish.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, some
 members evaluated that, with price variable volatility having increased, influenced for instance by changes in expectations related to monetary policies at home and abroad, long-term market interest rates and the won-dollar rate had significantly fallen in June after having risen, and stock prices had rebounded after having fallen.

 As to prices, some members noted that consumer price inflation had
 fallen month-on-month to 0.8 percent, owing chiefly to a slowdown in the extent of increase in agricultural product prices, and that core inflation had also declined slightly month-on-month to 1.6 percent.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 changes in the domestic and international economic environments, it would

 be desirable to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from its current

 level for the intermeeting period.

 One member presented the view that it would be best to lower the

 Base Rate by 25 basis points from its current level for the intermeeting

 period, while closely examining the possibility of expanded risks to

 financial stability brought about by the rate cut. The member noted that,

 given the recent slow growth and low inflation and several latent

 downside risk factors surrounding economic conditions at home and

 abroad, there seemed to be a greater need for more accommodative

 monetary policy. The member went on to comment that an accommodative

 monetary policy stance at this point in time can work to preemptively

 ease the negative impacts of the scheduled full-scale corporate

 restructuring, and that, if the UK decides to leave the European Union,

 international financial market volatility may be heightened greatly, and thus

 measures should be devised in advance to respond to it. Meanwhile, the

 member emphasized that, as a Base Rate cut could cause household debt

 growth, the Bank of Korea should more closely monitor the household

 debt trend and if necessary timely implement macroprudential policy

 measures in consultation with the government and the supervisory

 authorities. The member also stressed that, as the current slow growth and

 low inflation trend is greatly attributable to structural factors, it was

 necessary to pursue continuous structural reforms and expansionary fiscal

 policy, as well as accommodative monetary policy.

###### Another member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to

 lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from its current level to 1.25%

 for the intermeeting period to buffer against growing downside risks to the

 macroeconomy. Concerning recent macroeconomic conditions, the member

 judged that, although the declining trend in inflation was easing, consumer

 price inflation was still far below the inflation target of 2%. The member

 noted that the government’s fiscal policy space was reduced, private

 consumption was restrained by structural factors and thus unlikely to drive

 economic recovery, and there was no high possibility of exports recovering

 within a short space of time, as the lack of global growth momentum

 continued. The member pointed out that, under these circumstances, the

 restructuring of vulnerable industries scheduled for the second half of 2016

 could put heavier downward pressures on the macroeconomy in the short

 term. Accordingly, the member expressed the view that it was necessary to

 buffer against downside risks to the macroeconomy through a preemptive

 Base Rate cut. The member also emphasized the need for close policy

 cooperation with the financial supervisory authorities to strengthen the

 management of the soundness of collective loans, loans from non-banking

 financial institutions, and the Korea Housing Finance Corporation (KHFC)

 to ensure that the household debt problem, regarded as the biggest

 negative side effect of the Base Rate cut, did not expand rapidly.

  One member expressed the opinion that, in overall judgment of the trend

 of the real economy, it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 25

 basis points this month. First, the member argued that, without timely policy

 measures, it would be difficult to be optimistic about a recovery of

 consumption and the economy, noting that downside risks had increased since

 May as consumption and construction investment had started to decrease in

 the second quarter while household consumption continued to mark time, due

 to structural factors such as the rapid progress of population ageing and the

 worsening of income distribution, and also to strengthening preferences for

 liquidity and shrinking consumer sentiment in line with growing uncertainties

###### throughout the economy. Meanwhile, the member presented the view that

 consumer price inflation remained at a low level of around 1 percent

 year-on-year and, although economic participation and employment rates were

 recently rising, this was attributable to the gradual expansion in labor market

 capacity in line with the rising rate of employment of the over-50s offsetting

 the declining rate of youth employment, and this was unlikely to lead to

 upward pressures on inflation over a medium-term horizon. In light of this,

 the member took the view that additional policy measures should be made to

 pull up consumer price inflation to close to its target of 2 percent, and that

 in order to minimize potential risks from the Base Rate cut, it would be

 necessary to carry out corporate restructuring effectively, to manage potential

 risks to cope with the possibility of a spread of international financial market

 unrest, to monitor risks involved with household loans that were increasing

 centering around collective loans, to promote close cooperation for information

 exchanges among the related authorities and to take flexible policy measures.

 Meanwhile, another member expressed the opinion that, in overall

 consideration of the domestic and international economic environment, it

 would be desirable to adjust the Base Rate downward from the current 1.5

 percent to 1.25 percent this month. The member mentioned that,

 considering future downside risks, the growth target presented in the April

 forecast might not be easy to achieve and consumer prices were likely to

 remain short of their 2 percent target for a considerable period of time.

 The member went on to stress that a more accommodative monetary policy

 stance would be needed to prepare for the possibility of a continuation of

 low growth and slow price rises. The member presented the view that the

 growth rate should be improved by strengthening economic fundamentals,

 such as through industrial structural reforms and by supporting such

 structural reforms with aggressive fiscal and monetary policies, and the

 member further added that it would be necessary to respond preemptively

 to the possibility of corporate restructuring acting as a downside risk to

 investment and consumption in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, the

5

###### member argued that it would be necessary to cope continuously with

 household debt problems with supervisory policies, so as to create

 conditions for the implementation of accommodative monetary policy. In

 addition, the member noted the analysis that, since the US Fed was highly

 likely to maintain its stance of gradual rate hikes, overall market instability

 was unlikely to occur, although capital outflows and a rise in foreign

 exchange rate volatility might take place in the short term. The member

 went on to state that now would be the right time for the Bank of Korea

 to reduce its Base Rate, prior to a possible US rate hike. In conclusion,

 the member emphasized that it is time to strengthen the monitoring of

 uncertain external conditions, including a possible Brexit and potential US

 rate hikes, and to consider above all the sluggish economic situation, in

 order to respond preemptively to future downside risks.

 One other member expressed the opinion that downside risks to economic

 growth had grown, and as a result the targets presented in the April forecast

 might not be achieved easily. Looking at cyclical factors, the member

 mentioned that consumption had been weakening, and if corporate profitability

 decreased as international oil prices returned to normal, real wages and

 consumption could be restricted. In terms of structural factors, meanwhile, the

 member argued that the Korean economy was faced with fundamental

 problems that included a decline in the global trade volume, excess capacity

 in the manufacturing industry throughout the globe, and changes in the

 demand structure, and the member added that heightened uncertainties

 concerning future incomes and life extension, combined with population aging,

 led to more savings and thereby weakened consumption capacity more than

 expected. The member set out the view that restructuring at this point in time

 was considered highly desirable and essential to enhance the potential growth

 rate, but if corporate restructuring began in full scale, this could dampen

 consumer and investor sentiment, and the member added that macroeconomic

 policy measures needed to be implemented to further boost economic growth.

 The member went on to argue that, in overall consideration of these factors,

6

###### it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate this month by 25 basis points

 from the current 1.5 percent to 1.25 percent.

  Another member presented a number of major considerations for the

 appropriate operation of monetary policy. First, downside risks to the growth

 path had increased significantly, as fiscal expenditure capacity had been

 weakening and negative effects of the progress of corporate restructuring on

 production and employment, such as the shrinking of investor sentiment, had

 become apparent, while external demand had remained sluggish for a long

 time. Second, demand-side inflationary pressures were seen to be somewhat

 insufficient to pull inflation up to its target over a medium-term horizon,

 considering the trend of prices of items sensitive to business cycles. Third,

 slack in the production sector had been expanding, with the average capacity

 utilization ratio in the manufacturing sector declining to the lowest level

 since the financial crisis and facilities investment demand pressures

 decreasing at a faster pace. Looking at the labor market, the member also

 noted that overall slack had not improved due to the widening

 unemployment rate gap, and there existed a high level of instability with

 corporate restructuring taking shape. Based on the examination of these

 considerations, the need for a Base Rate adjustment seemed to have

 increased month-on-month from a macroeconomic perspective, and

 considering that it takes some time for a policy measure to take effect, it

 would be desirable to lower the Base Rate from the current 1.50 percent to

 1.25 percent this month. Cutting the already record-low Base Rate could

 entail a substantial amount of costs and risks in terms of financial stability.

 In this regard, in the future efforts should be made to minimize the negative

 side effects of policies with attention paid to changes in the credit cycle and

 the trend of related risks, to international financial market instability caused

 by the possibility of Brexit and changing expectations of the US Fed’s rate

 hikes, and to the spread of risks involving the real economy and financial

 stability in line with the implementation of corporate restructuring.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

 lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.50% to 1.25%.

 □ Based on currently available information the Board considers that

 the US economy has appeared to be emerging from its temporary

 slowdown. The improvements in the euro area, although weak,

 have continued, and the Chinese economy has maintained its

 moderate growth. The Bank of Korea forecasts that, while the

 global economy will maintain its weak recovery going forward, it

 will be affected by factors including the monetary policy

 normalization by the US Federal Reserve, financial and economic

 conditions in emerging market countries, and international oil price

 movements.

 □ Looking at the Korean economy, exports have continued their trend

 of decline and the improvements in domestic demand activities such

 as consumption have weakened, while the sentiments of economic

 agents have also been sluggish. On the employment front, although

 the pace of increase in the number of persons employed slowed

 somewhat in April, the employment-to-population ratio and the

 unemployment rate maintained the same levels as in April of last

 year. The Bank of Korea forecasts that the domestic economy will

 sustain its trend of modest growth going forward, but in view of

 economic conditions domestically and abroad judges that the

###### downside risks to the growth path forecast made in April have

 expanded.

 □ Consumer price inflation fell from 1.0% the month before to 0.8%

 in May, owing chiefly to a slowdown in the extent of increase in

 agricultural product prices. Core inflation excluding agricultural and

 petroleum product prices also declined to 1.6%, from 1.8% in

 April. Looking ahead the Bank of Korea forecasts that consumer

 price inflation will continue at a low level, under the influence of

 the low oil prices for example. In the housing market, sales and

 leasehold deposit prices showed low rates of increase.

 □ In the domestic financial markets since May, stock prices have

 risen after having previously fallen, in reflection mainly of global

 stock market movements, and long-term market interest rates have

 declined, influenced mostly by the sluggishness of some economic

 indicators. The Korean won has fluctuated to a large extent against

 the US dollar, affected mainly by changes in the expectations for a

 policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. The won has

 meanwhile depreciated against the Japanese yen. Household lending

 has sustained a trend of substantial increase at a level exceeding

 that of recent years, led by mortgage loans.

 □ Looking ahead, the Bank of Korea will conduct monetary policy so

 as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and

 consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a

 medium-term horizon, while paying greater attention to financial

 stability. In this process it will closely monitor the possibility of a

 British exit from the European Union, any changes in the monetary

 policies of major countries and capital flow movements, the

 progress of corporate restructuring, and the trend of increase in

 household debt.
