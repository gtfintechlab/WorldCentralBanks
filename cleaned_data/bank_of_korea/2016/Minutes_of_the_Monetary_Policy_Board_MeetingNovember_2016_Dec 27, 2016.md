##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and

 International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the

 Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the
 US had maintained its robust recovery, the euro area had improved, albeit slightly, and the Chinese economy had sustained its stable growth. As to international financial markets, members evaluated that major price
 variables, such as global stocks, bonds and crude oil, had become more volatile, affected by the result of the US presidential election, uncertainties surrounding the US Federal Reserve’s rate hike, and weakening expectations of OPEC reducing its production.

 Concerning the domestic economy, some members assessed the growth
 momentum as weakening overall, with the continued trend of decline in exports and slowing improvements in domestic demand activities, such as retail sales and facilities and construction investment.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members
 evaluated that the volatility of major price variables, including interest rates, stock prices and exchange rates, had increased, as also seen in the international financial markets, and that long-term market interest rates had risen substantially, affected chiefly by expectations of a US policy rate hike and rises in major country Treasury bond yields, while stock prices had fallen due to the increased uncertainties at home and abroad.

 As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had risen
 from 1.2% the month before to 1.3% in October, owing chiefly to the expiration of a temporary cut in electricity fees, and that core inflation had also risen month-on-month.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 changes in the domestic and international financial and economic

 environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current

 level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.

  One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep

 the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period. With regard to

 the economic outlooks for the fourth quarter this year and for next year, the

 member noted growing uncertainties in line with the worsening of domestic

 and external conditions, and went on to argue that, looking at external

 factors, while the domestic and overseas financial markets had stabilized after

 having shown heightened volatility after the US presidential election, the

 possibility of a shift in the US government’s economic policies, such as

 moving toward protective trade policies, might have huge impacts on Korea’s

 real sector, and in-depth analyses of and preparations for this were therefore

 required. On the home front, the member stressed that more aggressive efforts

 should be made to cope with growing uncertainties as well as difficult

 economic conditions, and emphasized the need for a multifaceted analysis of

 and continuous policy attention on how the implementation of the anti-graft

 law and corporate restructuring had been affecting consumption, facilities

 investment and employment. The member also presented the view that, while

 continuing to examine risk factors such as the possibilities of a US Federal

 Reserve rate hike, a Chinese economic slowdown, and a post-Brexit global

 economic slowdown, thought should be given to whether further monetary

 easing would be needed should future economic conditions turn out to be

 worse than the current forecast. Meanwhile, the member stated that the

 household debt issue should be addressed based on steady examination of the

3


-----

###### effectiveness of related government measures. The member added that,

 considering various external soundness indicators, Korea was unlikely to be

 affected greatly by a US policy rate hike, but it would be necessary to work

 in closer cooperation with the government going forward while strengthening

 the monitoring of domestic and overseas financial market trends.

 Another member meanwhile mentioned a number of points that should be

 considered in this month’s Base Rate decision. First, the member expressed

 the view that uncertainties over the future growth path had increased due to

 factors such as the unexpected result of the US presidential election, but it

 would be necessary to observe a little longer to see how these factors would

 actually affect growth. Second, the member stated that although the financial

 and foreign exchange markets were stabilizing after having fluctuated

 significantly immediately after the US presidential election, there is a

 possibility that these markets could become volatile again considering the high

 uncertainties surrounding domestic and overseas conditions. The member then

 stressed that a close eye should be kept on the possibility of further capital

 outflows and the heightening of financial and exchange market unrest. The

 member went on to argue that it should also be considered that the

 probability of a US Federal Reserve policy rate hike, having temporarily

 decreased after the US presidential election, had been rising again owing

 chiefly to the stabilization of financial markets and expectations of stronger

 inflationary pressures due to the incoming Trump administration’s proposed

 fiscal expansion. Regarding household debt growth and housing market

 conditions, meanwhile, the member presented the view that, although housing

 prices in some parts of the Seoul Metropolitan region had stabilized after the

 government’s announcement of its real estate measures on November 3, the

 housing market could be hardly seen as having become stable, given the

 sustained excessive demand for housing in popular regions such as Gangnam,

 Seoul, the persistent trend of low interest rates, and the continued easy

 availability of housing loans. In this regard, the member argued that it would

 be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25% during the

4


-----

###### intermeeting period and closely monitor any changes in domestic and overseas

 uncertainties and the related impacts. 

 Meanwhile, one member pointed out a number of major considerations

 for the appropriate conduct of monetary policy. First, the member stated

 that concerning the trend of growth at home, growth momentum had been

 weakening overall, as the trend of improvement in domestic demand

 including private consumption and construction investment had decelerated

 with the continued contraction in manufacturing production stemming from

 export sluggishness. The member noted that uncertainties surrounding the

 future growth path had heightened further, as there were factors making

 for political and economic instability at home and abroad, and as the

 economy was expected to slow down in the fourth quarter, influenced for

 instance by discontinued production of some items, corporate restructuring

 and the anti-graft law. Second, consumer price inflation and core inflation

 had maintained their gradual uptrends, consistent with their October

 forecasts. The member commented that, going forward, consumer price

 inflation was expected to show a gradually faster pace of increase as the

 effects of low oil prices dissipate, and was anticipated to converge to near

 the target level in the first half of 2017. Third, slack in the production

 sector had not improved much, as the average capacity utilization ratio in

 the manufacturing sector continued at an all-time low due mainly to

 inventory adjustments, and as facilities investment demand pressures began

 to decrease. The member noted that, although overall labor force slack had

 been continuing to improve, the labor market had failed to improve in

 qualitative terms as growth in employment was seen mostly in

 self-employed businesses and in the low-wage services sectors. Fourth,

 looking at financial stability conditions, as short- and long-term interest

 rates rebounded and foreign bond investment registered a net outflow from

 the domestic financial markets, the yield curve had steepened, credit

 spreads of corporate bonds had widened, and stock price volatility had

 risen. The member also expressed the need for monitoring the effects of

5


-----

###### the government’s real estate measures, as household debt continued to

 grow faster than usual. In overall consideration of the above-mentioned

 real economic and inflation trends, slack in production and financial

 stability conditions, the member assessed that it was advisable to keep the

 Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25 percent for the

 intermeeting period.

  Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold

 the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, as inflation

 was not seen to have deviated greatly from the original forecast path and

 was expected to converge to near the inflation target over the

 medium-term horizon, despite growing uncertainties surrounding real

 economic conditions and exogenous variables. The member emphasized the

 following three points with respect to effectively achieving the Bank of

 Korea’s objectives. The member first pointed out that, although the growth

 engines that had weakened due to changes in the economic structure could

 be spurred to some extent through fiscal and monetary policies, there was

 an issue of resource distribution trade-offs between generations. Next,

 noting uncertain external variables, the member expressed the view that the

 heavy dependence of advanced economies on monetary policy to overcome

 the financial crisis had given rise to various side effects, and the expected

 US policy rate hike could pave the way for a shift in global interest rate

 trends. Finally, the member raised concerns about a bias toward

 accommodative monetary policy. The member presented the view that the

 introduction of unconventional measures to maintain low interest rates by

 advanced country central banks had failed to have the desired effects on

 the real economy because of an excessive reliance on monetary policy. 

  One other member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base

 Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, the Bank of Korea

 should keep a close watch on the impacts of the recently soaring political

6


-----

###### and economic uncertainties at home and abroad on the future development of

 the Korean economy. The member judged the world economy to have

 maintained modest growth and the Korean economy to have continued its

 weak growth as well, as the boom in the construction market served as a

 buffer against sluggish exports. The member also evaluated that pressures for

 a further decline in underlying inflation had been easing gradually. The

 member, however, emphasized that a close watch should be kept on the

 impacts of the recently introduced anti-graft law and the government measures

 to stabilize the housing market. Looking ahead, the member stressed the need

 for paying special attention to greatly heightened uncertainties surrounding the

 Korean economy in line with sharply increasing political uncertainties in

 Korea and the US. Accordingly, the member suggested that the Bank of

 Korea should keep a close eye on how these uncertainties might change

 future Korean macroeconomic trends, while mitigating potential risk factors,

 such as the buildup of household debt, that could amplify the spillover effects

 of unforseen negative shocks. The member also expressed the need for

 harmonization with fiscal policy, which is less likely than monetary policy to

 bring about the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances in the private

 sector.

  One member presented the view that, in overall consideration of the

 recent inflation, economic and financial stability conditions, it would be

 appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level. With respect to the

 real economy, the member noted that, despite continued robust growth in

 construction investment, the actual GDP growth rate for the fourth quarter

 may come in below the forecast because of weakened growth, as

 exemplified by the negative figures seen in September industrial production

 and retail sales and in October export growth. The member judged the

 uncertainty of the economic outlook to have heightened further as the

 unexpected US presidential election result had cast uncertainty on whether

 the world trade volume would recover, although the growth pattern of

7


-----

###### recoveries in exports and facilities investment serving as a buffer against

 slower construction investment was expected for 2017. Meanwhile, the

 member evaluated inflation to have held to the existing forecast path, and

 anticipated that consumer price inflation would converge to its target of 2

 percent in the first half of next year. In terms of financial stability, the

 member expressed concern that household debt had continued to sustain a

 trend of substantial increase in October as well. The member went on to

 note that, since household debt growth may pose a risk of adjustments to

 housing prices after their excessive increases, future housing price

 adjustments could worsen household balance sheets, thus leading to an

 additional slump in household consumption. Accordingly, the member

 noted that securing housing price stability by controlling expectations of

 rising housing prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas would form the

 core of household debt risk management. The member then emphasized

 the need for close monitoring of housing market trends for the time being.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

 leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting

 period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Bank of Korea

 considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been

 sustained and that the Chinese economy has maintained its

 moderate pace of growth. The euro area has also shown

 improvements, although they have been weak. the Bank of Korea

 forecasts that the global economy will maintain its moderate

 recovery going forward, while being affected by factors such as

 changes in US monetary policy, the directions of the new US

 government’s economic policies, the uncertainties related to Britain's

 exit from the European Union, and economic conditions in

 emerging market countries.

 □ Looking at the Korean economy, exports have continued their trend

 of decline while the improvements in domestic demand activities

 appear to have weakened a bit. On the employment front, the

 employment-to-population ratio in October was slightly higher than

 that in October of last year, as the number of persons employed

 increased. The unemployment rate meanwhile rose somewhat. The

 Bank of Korea forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its

 trend of modest growth going forward, in line with a recovery of

 the global economy, but in view of recent changes in domestic and

 external conditions judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth

 path to have increased further.

###### □ Consumer price inflation rose from 1.2% the month before to 1.3%

 in October, owing chiefly to the expiration of a temporary cut in

 electricity fees. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum

 product prices also rose to 1.5%, from 1.3% in September. In the

 housing market, the extents of increase in sales and leasehold

 deposit prices have expanded, centering around the Seoul area.

 Looking ahead the Bank of Korea forecasts that consumer price

 inflation will gradually rise, due mainly to the weakening influence

 of the low oil prices.

 □ In the domestic financial markets since October, influenced mainly

 by strengthened expectations of a policy rate hike by the US

 Federal Reserve, and by the result of the US presidential election,

 long-term market interest rates and the Korean won-US dollar

 exchange rate have risen to large extents and stock prices have

 declined. The Korean won-Japanese yen exchange rate has fallen

 slightly. Household lending has sustained a trend of substantial

 increase at a level exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage

 loans.

 □ Looking ahead, the Bank of Korea will conduct monetary policy so

 as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and

 consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a

 medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.

 In this process it will closely monitor the uncertainties in domestic

 and external conditions and their effects, any changes in the

 monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve, and the trend of

 increase in household debt.
