###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

 After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’,

 ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Markets’, the discussions of

 the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the
 euro area recovery had somewhat weakened with major sentiment indexes slowing, China’s economic slowdown had continued with its exports decreasing significantly, and the US economy was maintaining modest growth with consumption and employment indexes improving. As to international financial markets, most members evaluated Treasury bond yields in major countries as having fallen, generally due to concerns about a global economic slowdown and expectations of additional easing measures by the ECB, and stock prices as having started to rise, influenced largely by increases in international oil prices.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members assessed that the recovery
 had slowed due to the continued sluggishness of exports and domestic demand.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members
 noted that, with international financial market instability having eased, outflows of foreigners’ portfolio investment funds had slowed and stock prices had rebounded significantly since mid-February, and the won-dollar rate had fallen back substantially since the beginning of March.

 As to prices, most members observed that consumer price inflation had
 stood at 1.3 percent, a substantial increase from the previous month, due mainly to sharp increases in agricultural product prices, and that core inflation had also increased slightly month-on-month to 1.8%.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision

##### (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the
 changes in the domestic and international economic environments, it would be desirable this month to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.

 Among them, one member evaluated that, on the external side, there

 had been a possibility of greater volatility in the international financial

 markets, and on the domestic side, there had been no driving force

 triggering a shift in the economic trend due to sluggish exports and

 domestic demand, and the member also stated that keen attention should

 be paid to financial stability issues, such as outflows of foreigners’

 portfolio investment funds or growth in household and corporate debt. The

 member went on to state the view that, while holding the Base Rate at its

 current level for the intermeeting period, attention should be paid to

 various risks at home and abroad and efforts should be made to discover

 momentum for improvement in economic activities and to maintain

 macroeconomic stability. The member stressed that it would be necessary

 to address the uncertainties felt by economic agents and stop

 self-reinforcing dynamic adaptation, while sharing the view that it was

 difficult to expect the domestic economy to grow at more than a modest

 pace in a situation where exports were unlikely to recover easily. The

 member also expressed the view that, as the shadow of a crisis cast by

 global macroeconomic adjustments now taking place in China and EMEs

 following the US and Europe was revealing itself in slightly different

 forms of volatility, various external volatility issues needed to be addressed

 carefully. The member went on to mention the need for the monitoring

 and continuous management of household debt risks and added that

3


-----

###### promotion of greater use of non-recourse Didimdol loans or mortgage

 insurances would help reduce vulnerable households’ debt risks. The

 member also presented the views that attention should be paid to the

 significance and future impact of persistently low growth that added to

 financial instability, that new technology-based services should be further

 reflected in GDP statistics, and that efforts should be strengthened to

 comprehensively analyze various information variables and identify the

 relationship between business and financial cycles in order to expand

 monetary policy infrastructure.

 Another member expressed the opinion that it would be advisable to

 cut this month’s Base Rate by 25 basis points from the current 1.5% to

 1.25%. The member mentioned that this downward adjustment would

 contribute substantially to the easing the worsening of economic sentiment,

 to improvements in exports and domestic demand, and to stabilization of

 the financial and foreign exchange markets. Based on the member’s

 evaluation that global monetary easing was very likely to expand going

 forward and that global interest rates would remain at ultra low levels for

 the time being even if the US normalizes its monetary policy, the member

 stressed that it would be necessary for the Korean economy, with its high

 dependence upon external trade and high degree of financial openness, to

 adapt itself flexibly to the easing stances of its major trading partners. The

 member expressed the opinion that the risk of further foreign capital

 outflows and greater household debt, having been pointed out as potential

 policy costs to be incurred by additional rate cuts, had been substantially

 decreasing recently, and that monetary policy divergence among the US

 and other major countries was likely to expand, which would limit the

 Korean monetary authorities’ policy space. In addition, the member put

 forward his view that the related policy authorities should look more

 closely at economic developments and seek appropriate preemptive

 measures in order to prevent the formation of a vicious circle in which

4


-----

###### sluggish economic indicators arouse anxiety among economic agents,

 leading to a delay in consumption and investment, which in turnerm

 would make the Korean economy less resilient. The member went on to

 argue that the policy authorities should work hard to improve economic

 sentiment by conveying their policy intentions more clearly and by

 ensuring that they are equipped with various policy instruments and are 

 prepared to implement them.

 One other member put forward the view that, although prices had risen

 temporarily, there had been no major changes in the overall trend, and that,

 amid slightly weakening signs of improvement in economic activities during

 January and February, downside risks seemed to have increased somewhat,

 due mainly to the persistent sluggishness of external demand and the

 weakening of economic sentiment. The member went on to state that, amid

 the current structurally weakened economic recovery, providing stimulus

 through policy rate adjustment had some limitations, and thus it would be

 advisable to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the

 intermeeting period, while waiting and observing changes in the monetary

 policies of the ECB and the US Federal Reserve, movements of

 international oil prices, and domestic economic situation. The member also

 noted that, although the domestic economy was likely to maintain its

 recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering around

 domestic demand, the uncertainties surrounding the growth path going

 forward were still judged to be high, as the recovery of consumption was

 likely to be limited due to the weakening of household confidence amid

 persistently sluggish exports stemming from a shortage of external demand.

 The member also argued that, since inflows/outflows of foreign securities

 investment funds were greatly affected by external factors, a close watch

 should be kept on the possibility that outward pressures of foreign

 securities investment funds would grow again, if economic instabilities in

 EMEs increase again or if there is any change in the monetary policies of

5

###### major central banks. 

 Meanwhile, one member set forth a number of points that the Board

 consider in its operation of appropriate monetary policy. First, as the

 effects of sluggish exports, which had thus far been confined to the

 manufacturing sector, were gradually spreading to the service sector,

 economic sentiment and the recovery of domestic demand both had

 weakened. As a result, growth in the first quarter had fallen short of the

 original forecast, and thus there was an increased possibility of a widening

 negative GDP gap. Second, as underlying upward trends of consumer price

 inflation and core inflation continued and inflation expectations remained

 stable, disinflationary pressure was gradually weakening. However, there

 was a need for a little more observation to determine whether demand-side

 upward pressures on core inflation would increase sufficiently to reach an

 appropriate inflation level over a medium-term horizon. Third, slack in the

 production sector had expanded further, and although slack in the labor

 market had improved slightly, it was concentrated in relatively vulnerable

 sectors. The member then expressed the view that, although an overall

 consideration of these points could lead to the conclusion that there is

 room for further Base Rate adjustments, it would be desirable to hold the

 Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, and to closely

 examine the extent of actual changes in the growth and price paths and

 factors causing financial instability at home and abroad, thus maintaining a

 flexible policy stance. The member also expressed the opinion that,

 concerning future policy operation, the Board should cautiously examine

 changes in the policies of major countries, keep a close eye on their

 effects on the domestic markets and the consequent changes related to

 risks of capital outflows, and thoroughly analyze major expected monetary

 policy transmission channels and the policy effects, in consideration of

 changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad. The

 member went on to mention that the Board should pay attention to the

 fact that, at this stage, the positive effects of monetary policy could be

6


-----

###### maximized and its negative side effects could be minimized only if it is

 implemented as part of an appropriate policy mix, including the

 implementation of structural reform, the expansion of the role of fiscal

 policy, and the effective operation of macroprudential policy.

 Another member put forward the view that it would be desirable to

 keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period and

 closely examine changes in external conditions, including international oil

 prices, the monetary policies of major countries, inflows/outflows of

 foreign investment funds, and movements of price variables in the

 financial markets. The member commented that, although downside risks to

 growth and inflation had increased somewhat since the January forecast,

 uncertainty over external economic conditions was high, and thus it was

 necessary to maintain a closer examination of future changes in conditions

 in order to effectively assess the underlying trends of growth and inflation.

 The member went on to state the necessity of closely monitoring the

 effects on the Korean economy of the recent rebound in international oil

 prices and of the monetary policy decisions of the ECB, the Bank of

 Japan, the US Federal Reserve and other major country central banks

 scheduled for this month. The member also put forward the view that,

 although financial markets at home and abroad were showing a somewhat

 stable pattern of movements, it was difficult to say that financial market

 uncertainty had fundamentally eased, so even a minor shock might cause a

 reoccurrence of heightened market volatility.

 One other member put forward the view that, in overall consideration

 of economic conditions at home and abroad, it would be desirable to hold

 the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period. The member

 then noted three options that could be considered to manage household

 debt, which presently stands at more than 1,200 trillion won. The member

 stated that the first option--partial debt write-offs--does not address the root

 of the problem, and the second option, which is to curb the pace of

7


-----

###### increase in household debt, could cause a conflict between economic

 recovery and financial stability. The member then stressed the necessity of

 looking into the third option, which is to boost the housing rental market.

 Through this option, debt that is concentrated in the household sector can

 be transferred to other sectors. In this regard, the member stated the view

 that there was an urgent need to collect micro-data related to household

 debt in order to gain an understanding of the exact state of household

 debt in Korea, including lending to self-employed business operators and

 the debt of unregistered landlords, and to set up a system of managing

 such data systemically. The member noted that, for actual residential

 households, it was necessary to reduce demand for housing purchases and

 leasehold deposit-based rentals by promoting the housing rental industry to

 ensure that the corporate and public sectors could purchase and rent

 houses on a monthly basis. Specifically, the member proposed two policy

 alternatives; first, to have corporations consider expanding their investment

 in houses by building accommodations for their employees, and second, to

 have pension funds actively participate in the housing rental business.

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

  Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, members

 compiled a statement reflecting the views of the majority.

 Mr. Seong Keun Ha, however, dissented, expressing his clear opposition

 to keeping the Base Rate at its current level, and arguing for lowering it

 by 0.25 of a percentage point.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

 leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting

 period.

 - Based on currently available information the Board considers that

###### the US economy has emerged from its temporary slowdown and

 shown a trend of moderate growth. However, the trend of economic

 recovery in the euro area has weakened somewhat, while economic

 growth in emerging market countries including China has continued

 to slow. The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain

 its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering

 around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that it will

 be affected by factors such as financial and economic conditions in

 China and other emerging market countries, international oil price

 movements, and global financial market volatility.

 □ Looking at the Korean economy, the trend of decline in exports

 and the weakening recovery of domestic demand activities such as

 consumption are continuing, while the sentiments of economic

 agents have been sluggish. On the employment front, as the

 number of persons employed has steadily increased, the

 employment-to-population ratio rose in January compared to that in

 January last year, while the unemployment rate fell. The Board

 forecasts that the domestic economy will continue its recovery

 going forward, centering around domestic demand activities, but in

 view of external economic conditions judges the uncertainties

 surrounding the growth path to be high.

###### □ Consumer price inflation rose to a significant extent in February,

 from 0.8% the month before to 1.3%, owing chiefly to increases in

 agricultural product prices. Core inflation excluding agricultural and

 petroleum product prices meanwhile rose slightly to 1.8%, from

 1.7% in January. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer

 price inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the low

 oil prices. In the housing market, sales and leasehold deposit prices

 showed low rates of increase in both Seoul and its surrounding

 areas and the rest of the country.

 □ In the domestic financial markets, influenced by the global stock

 market recovery and by a subsiding of foreigners’ securities

 investment fund outflows, stock prices have risen sharply since

 February and the Korean won, after having depreciated, has

 appreciated to a considerable extent against the US dollar. The

 won has meanwhile depreciated against the Japanese yen, in line

 with the yen’s strengthening. Long-term market interest rates have

 rebounded slightly after having declined, in response mainly to

 interest rate movements in major countries. Bank household lending

 has sustained a trend of increase at a level exceeding that of

 recent years, led by mortgage loans.

 □ Looking ahead, while working to sustain the recovery of economic

 growth, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain

 price stability over a medium-term horizon, and pay attention to

 financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor external

 risk factors such as any changes in the monetary policies of major

 countries or in financial and economic conditions in China, the

 movements of capital flows, geopolitical risks, and the trend of

 increase in household debt.
