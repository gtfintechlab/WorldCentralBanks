###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation

After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook_ (February 2022),[2)] _FX and_

_International Finance Trends, and_ _Financial Market Trends, the discussions of the_

Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

Members assessed that, despite the spread of COVID-19 variants, the domestic

economy continued to recover overall, led by the underlying trend of improvement in

private consumption, especially in goods consumption, and by the solid trend of increase

in exports. Some members stressed that it would be necessary to remain on the alert

against the possibility of uncertainties such as geopolitical risks and prolonged global

supply constraints having a negative impact on the future domestic economic recovery.

In terms of inflation, members assessed upside risks to inflation as having increased,

with inflationary pressure expanding into a wide range of core items. Some members

expressed the view that attention should be paid to the potential effects of the Ukraine

crisis on inflation in Korea through channels of international commodity prices and

inflation expectations.

Meanwhile, members assessed that volatility in price variables of some financial

assets had heightened, owing chiefly to monetary policy changes at home and abroad

and geopolitical risks. Some members mentioned that, despite slowed growth in

household lending due to rate hikes and stronger regulations, corporate lending had been

showing strong growth, and it would be therefore necessary to pay attention to financial

imbalances stemming from increased leverage in the private sector.

Some members also stressed the need to pay close attention to export conditions

from a medium- and long-term perspective and the effect of overseas portfolio

investment by Korean residents on capital flows.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision

The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the

Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

All members took the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and

international financial and economic situations, it would be desirable to keep the Base

Rate at its current level of 1.25% for the intermeeting period.

One member judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged

from its current level of 1.25%

The member evaluated that, despite the spread of COVID-19 variants, the trend of

the global economy and trade continued to recover, but global inflation pressures had

heightened even further with a recovery in supply disruptions delayed longer than

expected and global oil prices increasing at a faster pace. In particular, the member

forecast that the recently escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine would have a

substantial impact on the global economy by way of a delayed recovery of global

supply chains and contraction of international trade, as well as rises in energy,

commodity and grain prices.

The member expected that the domestic economy would remain on the growth path

projected in November, since economic activity was getting back to normal and goods

exports continued their solid trend of increase, although COVID-19 was spreading

rapidly in Korea unlike in the rest of the world. The member however noted that

careful analysis and assessment of the future growth path were needed, since there

existed downside risks to exports, such as the escalating geopolitical risks and a delayed

recovery of global supply chains, and there was a lack of improvement in structural

factors behind low growth, including population aging, the surge in household debt, the

slowdown in fixed capital stock growth, and the sluggishness of services sectors with

low added values. In terms of consumption, the member expressed concerns that,

although consumption capacity was expected to increase on the back of increased forced

savings since the pandemic, increased burdens of household debt repayment and housing

expenses could act as factors limiting consumption. The member added that, as foreign

direct investment had recently increased in quantitative terms on the back of

strengthening trade and environmental regulations, and in qualitative terms as well with

growth seen in overseas investment for local production rather than processing and

intermediate trade, there was a possibility of an increased negative substitution effect on

exports and domestic investment.


-----

With regard to inflation, the member’s assessment was, although that the Research

Department had raised its inflation forecast for this year significantly to 3.1% and also

adjusted its core inflation forecast upward to 2.6%, upside risks were even greater

considering the recent global oil price trend and inflation pressures. The member also

stated that, with the recent inflation pressures attributable largely to supply-side factors,

producer prices were rising faster than consumer prices. The member went on to stress

that, since the Korean economy is dependent highly on exports and investment, it would

be necessary to pay close attention to the channel through which producer prices

directly limit growth by way of cost increases.

Looking at financial stability, the member assessed the exchange rate and capital

flows as showing limited volatility thanks to improved external soundness, although

stock market volatility had expanded due to a likely early tapering by the US Federal

Reserve and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The member mentioned that, although

household debt growth had slowed, household debt was estimated to be exhibiting faster

year-on-year growth than nominal GDP, and corporate lending sustained strong growth,

resulting in a continued increase in the private sector leverage.

In summary, the member’s evaluation was that, compared with the previous

meeting, downside risks to growth had increased somewhat, but the economy had

maintained its recovery since last year. The member also assessed that upside risks to

inflation had grown even further and financial imbalances still required attention. In this

regard, the member assessed that it would be appropriate to operate the Base Rate so

as to reduce the degree of monetary easing. The member however argued that, since

uncertainties surrounding economic conditions at home and abroad had increased recently

owing to the spread of the pandemic, geopolitical risks and early normalization of major

country monetary policies, and since there was a need to examine the effect of three

Base Rate hikes last year, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current

level and monitor future changes in the domestic and international economic situations.

Another member judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its

current level of 1.25%.

The member mentioned that the global economy seemed to have maintained its

recovery overall, with the US and Europe easing COVID-19 restrictions after having

gone through the peak of the spread of the Omicron variant. The member assessed that,

although global supply disruptions had improved somewhat, global oil prices had risen

and the international financial markets had become more volatile owing to the escalating

geopolitical risks involving Russia and Ukraine.

The member noted that, although short-term downside risks had expanded somewhat


-----

in line with a surge in the spread of the Omicron variant since February, the domestic

economy seemed to maintain its recovery overall and was expected to grow by around

the previous projection of 3.0% this year. The member mentioned that private

consumption had slowed, due to temporary factors such as the shutdown of automakers

for a transition to new production lines, but maintained its underlying trend of recovery

based on improved income conditions for households. The member went on to note that

exports also continued to grow, led by those of semiconductor and petroleum products.

The member also stated that improvement in construction investment had been limited

owing to stronger safety management of construction sites and facilities investment had

been adjusted slightly centering around machinery and automobiles. The member

assessed employment as continuing to improve, with the number of persons employed

rising significantly and the unemployment rate declining. The member took the view

that, when the spread of the virus peaks and the pandemic gradually turns into an

endemic, consumption related to face-to-face activities, which had been suppressed so

far, would become brisk and exports and investment would sustain growth based on

demand for the digital transition and the fight against climate change.

The member noted that concerns about a possible prolongation of inflation had

recently heightened even further and that keeping inflation under control had emerged as

a key issue for monetary policy in major advanced countries. As for the Korean

economy, the member mentioned that the rate of increase in import prices had remained

high in the 20-30% range for a considerable period of time since the second half of

last year. The member projected that consumer price inflation would remain in the mid
to upper-3% range for the time being, since a rise in imported raw material prices had

affected consumer prices in Korea with a time lag, causing dining-out costs and prices

of processed food products to increase at even faster paces, and would likely continue

to exert upward pressures on consumer prices in Korea going forward. The member

presented the view that, although the wage growth rate and inflation expectations had

been changing gradually and upward pressures on inflation would likely weaken

somewhat in the second half of this year, consumer price inflation for this year would

exceed 3%, considering the recent increasing tendency of corporations to pass on cost

increases to consumers, and a possible increase in personal service charges, such as

private education costs and leisure facility fees.

Regarding financial markets, the member assessed that financial market volatility had

increased since the previous meeting, with the Treasury bond yield rising and stock

prices substantially falling on the back of expectations of an acceleration of rate hikes

by the US Federal Reserve and concerns about a supplementary budget. The member

pointed out that, although household lending growth had slowed, affected by


-----

strengthening regulations and rising interest rates, and housing prices had been

stabilizing recently, corporate lending maintained strong growth, influenced by the

control on household lending, and the M2 growth rate remained high. The member

stressed that regulations on credit extension had been eased temporarily in response to

the COVID-19 shock in a situation where marginal firms accounted for a substantial

portion of Korea’ corporate sector. Since this measure would inevitably have to be

normalized gradually and interest rates were rising at home and abroad, it would be

necessary to carefully analyze and assess effects of credit to the corporate sector, which

had exhibited a sharp increase, on financial system stability and corporate financial

soundness.

The member judged that the three rate hikes since August last year had been easing

the household debt risk and excessive yield-seeking behavior at a pace that had

provided accommodative financial conditions to support the economic recovery while at

the same time ensuring that the economic recovery was not undermined significantly.

The member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate

unchanged from its current level of 1.25% at this meeting. The member’s evaluation

was that it would be necessary to take more time to observe the trends and impacts of

the ongoing massive spread of the Omicron variant and the Ukraine crisis, and that

another rate hike at this time following the previous two consecutive rate hikes could

make financial markets more volatile in the short term in a situation where market

anxiety had heightened due to expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and

external risk factors.

The member, however, noted that increased inflation expectations and continued

strong liquidity growth suggested that the current monetary policy stance remained

substantially accommodative, and that if the current trend of an economic upturn

continues, an additional adjustment of the degree of monetary easing would be needed.

The member mentioned that, unless the adjustment is made at the right time and at the

right pace, a larger degree of adjustment would be inevitable later on, which could have

a huge impact on the economy and financial markets. The member presented the view

that it would be necessary to raise the Base Rate further at an appropriate time while

closely monitoring the trends of prices and inflation expectations as well as the

domestic economy, changes in major country monetary policies and financial market

developments at home and abroad.

One member took the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at

its current level of 1.25%.

The member assessed that the global economy had continued to recover as in the


-----

previous year, but the pace of recovery had been slowing recently affected largely by

the spread of Omicron, and inflation had continued to grow in major countries owing to

the further uptrend in energy prices and prolonged disruptions in global supply chains.

The member noted that, in reflection of this, the IMF had adjusted the global economic

growth rate downward by 50 basis points in its recent adjusted outlook (in January).

With regard to the domestic economy, the member evaluated that consumption had

improved at a slower pace, due to the spread of COVID-19 and the prolonged measures

to combat the pandemic, and the recent surge in the number of confirmed Omicron

cases had further heightened uncertainty of consumption. The member noted that the

underlying trend of improvement in consumption had continued driven by consumption

of goods, but consumption of services still depended upon developments of the

pandemic. Concerning investment, the member mentioned that facilities investment,

having grown significantly over the last two years, was going through a correction,

while a rise in material prices had led to a delay in the recovery of construction

investment. The member added that, as imports surged even though exports of most

items had continued their uptrend led by strong global goods demand, the trade account

had registered a deficit and the Ukraine crisis had added to uncertainties.

The member mentioned that consumer price inflation had remained at the 3% level

since October last year. The member noted that, driven by the recovery in domestic

demand, combined with supply-side factors including a surge in energy prices and

supply chain disruptions, upward pressures on inflation had increased more than

originally expected, and core inflation also stood at the mid-2% level, with inflationary

pressure expanding into core items such as personal services and durables. The member

added that the recent surge in inflation was taking place throughout the world and the

IMF had made a huge upward adjustment to its global inflation forecast for this year

(2.3→3.9% for advanced countries and 4.9→5.9% for emerging market countries).

The member assessed that major countries had been attempting to change their

monetary policy stances in response to rising inflation. The member noted that the Bank

of England had raised its policy rate in February this year as in December last year,

and expected the US Federal Reserve to start rate hikes from March onwards. The

member however evaluated that, although inflation had exceeded the target in most

countries, measures to cope with this varied from country to country. The member

mentioned that the ECB had been taking a careful approach focusing more on the

economy than on inflation, while countries like Sweden had expressed their

determination to maintain their monetary easing stances out of concerns about

unpredictable effects of a monetary policy shift on production and employment. The

member added that Korea, with its three Base Rate hikes since August last year, is one


-----

of the major countries which started normalizing monetary policy preemptively.

The member stressed that the most distinct aspect of Korea’s policy shift was the

strengthening of regulations on household lending along with Base Rate hikes, and noted

that interest rates on household lending had risen rapidly due to the heightened lending

regulations, while real interest rates excluding inflation expectations had already

exceeded their pre-COVID-19 levels. The member presented the view that monetary

policy needed an entirely different approach in a new environment with stronger lending

regulations, and emphasized that it was time to focus more on the non-discriminating

effects of the Base Rate on the real economy than on measures to promote financial

stability.

The member argued that the Korean economy had been overcoming the crisis

relatively successfully based on strong goods exports, but it was now faced with a new

challenge — increases in interest rates and inflation had caused the production costs of

businesses to rise and household purchasing power to weaken compared with the

pre-COVID-19 period. The member judged that inflationary pressures were high but not

to such a critical degree as to require measures to suppress them, which would contract

economic activity. The member noted that inflationary pressures would continue until the

first half of this year at the earliest, but things could change drastically if supply-side

problems are resolved to some extent.

The member’s evaluation was that the COVID-19 pandemic was an asymmetrical

shock that had hit the services sector and consumption harder than the manufacturing

sector and exports. The member mentioned that if it were concluded that the crisis is

over based only on aggregate indicators such as GDP growth, or if rate hikes were

accelerated on the basis of cost-push inflation, the economic recovery would lose

momentum. The member noted that real private consumption had declined by 1.6% over

two years since 2019 and employment of the prime-age labor force (those aged between

30 and 59) had not yet returned to its pre-pandemic level. The member expressed the

view that it would be necessary to observe the effects of the previous three Base Rate

hikes since August last year. The member stressed the need to keep the Base Rate at

its current level for the time being while closely examining developments of virus

variants, the trend of recovery in overall domestic demand and sectors hit hard by the

pandemic, and movements of core inflation and inflation expectations. The member

noted that consumer price inflation and core inflation had risen by 4.6% and 3.3%,

respectively, over the two years since January 2020, immediately before the outbreak of

COVID-19, and emphasized the importance of achieving the inflation target over a

medium-term horizon. In particular, the member argued that, since the current

inflationary pressures had been caused by an exceptional situation of a pandemic, even


-----

if inflation exceeds its target but is not extemely excessive, it would be appropriate

cautiously respond to a departure of inflation from its target while monitoring the path

of convergence toward its target.

Meanwhile, another member presented the opinion that it would be appropriate to

keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25% at this meeting.

The member judged that the Korean economy was maintaining a trend of recovery,

despite the worsening of the spread of the Omicron variant. The member’s assessment

was that, while facilities investment was undergoing an adjustment, exports were

maintaining high growth, bolstered by solid global demand, and private consumption was

maintaining an underlying trend of recovery, thanks to a favorable increase in

consumption of goods, despite a slight slowdown in face-to-face service consumption

stemming from the worsening of the spread of the pandemic. Concerning labor market

conditions, the member noted that the number of persons employed was maintaining its

substantial uptrend, and household income conditions were improving thanks to a solid

upward trend in wages.

The member expected the Korean economy to grow at around 3%, consistent with

the 2021 November forecast, thanks to buoyant exports and sustained recovery in

private consumption. The member forecast that exports and investment were likely to

remain strong in line with improved global trade, particularly since major countries

would resume economic activity thanks to the easing of their social distancing measures.

The member expected consumption to be affected by the spread of the Omicron variant

for some time, and then to return to rapid recovery, as this virus spread cycle would

stabilize after reaching its peak. However, the member judged uncertainties surrounding

the growth path to be heightened further, since major countries were changing their

monetary policy stances rapidly to respond to higher inflation since the second half of

last year, and geopolitical risks surrounding Ukraine were also increasing.

The member noted that a stronger-than-expected upward trend in prices was

continuing. Looking at recent price conditions, the member saw that, as factors pointed

to as upside risks such as an ongoing upward trend in commodity prices and prolonged

global supply bottlenecks were materializing, strong upward trends in prices were

witnessed across core items. The member argued that, although the Bank of Korea

Research Department had revised upward the inflation forecast for this year to the 3%

range in reflection of this, upside risks to the price path still remained high. The

member stated that inflationary pressures could accumulate, as accommodative financial

conditions were continuing, despite economic recovery particularly in major advanced

economies. The member saw that the recent Ukraine crisis was not only accelerating the


-----

upward trend in prices through a rise in international commodity prices, but also making

inflation expectations unstable. The member emphasized that it would be necessary to

guard against the possibility of second-round effects of the consequent interaction

between price indexes and inflation expectations.

The member evaluated that investor sentiment was partially contracting, as volatility

in the financial market had increased, with interest rates rising steeply and stock prices

falling. However, the member judged financial conditions to remain accommodative,

since M2 growth had not shown any sign of decline since the beginning of this year

after rising to the 13% level, and corporations were raising funds on a large scale

through stocks and corporate bonds.

On the financial stability side, the member pointed out the need to pay attention to

the rapid increase in credit supply to the corporate sector, although increase in housing

prices had slowed significantly of late, and household debt growth was moderating. The

member added that attention should be paid to the possibility that there had been a

significant buildup of funds provision which failed to properly reflect credit risk in the

course of providing financial support to vulnerable sectors.

The member took the view that, in overall consideration of growth, price and

financial conditions of the Korean economy, it would be necessary to further reduce the

degree of monetary policy accommodation. The member added that it was important that

preemptive measures be taken, particularly given that upside risks surrounding the future

price path were heavily dependent upon inflation expectations, and that Base Rate hikes

affected the economy with a time lag. The member also emphasized the need to anchor

expectations of economic agents by communicating with the market about resolute

policy intention. From the perspective of financial stability, the member stated that it

would be necessary to prepare against possible volatility shocks in the international

financial market by inducing economic agents to adjust excessively heightened leverage

and making the financial market more resilient.

However, the member also took the view that, in consideration of the need to

assess the effects of the past three Base Rate hikes and to keep a close watch on the

developments of factors causing recently heightened uncertainties, such as a move

toward acceleration of monetary policy normalization in major economies and heightened

geopolitical risks stemming from the Ukraine crisis, it would be appropriate to keep the

Base Rate unchanged from its current level of 1.25%.

One member presented the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the Base

Rate at its current level of 1.25% at this meeting.

The member noted that, although the global economy was continuing its sound


-----

recovery trend, as seen in growth in global trade and real economic indicators of major

economies, the future growth path could be seriously affected by the evolution of the

COVID-19 pandemic, global inflation and changes in monetary policy in major

economies, and the development of geopolitical risks related to Ukraine.

The member assessed that, on the domestic economic front, although facilities

investment and construction investment were sluggish due to one-off factors, private

consumption was maintaining an underlying trend of recovery and employment was

continuing to improve. The member also noted that market income excluding the

secondary income from government transfers had risen in all income groups of late, and

the trend of improvement was expanding even in the low-income group hit the hardest

at the initial stage of COVID-19 pandemic. With respect to the financial and foreign

exchange sectors, the member assessed that economic agents’ search-for-yield across

asset markets had abated, and macroprudential indicators appeared favorable in the

internal and external sectors. The member stated that growth in household lending and

housing prices, two major factors causing financial imbalances, had slowed, due to the

impacts of several factors such as strengthened loan management and higher lending

rates.

The member took the view that special policy attention should be paid to inflation.

The member noted that consumer price inflation was not higher than in most major

economies for the moment and consumer price inflation and inflation expectations were

still low even compared to past periods of heightened price inflation. However, the

member stated that consumer price inflation was remaining at the mid- to upper-3%

range, and core inflation also had risen to the mid-2% range. The member stated that

taking into account the possibility of the effects of energy price shocks and trends of

increase in global grain prices stemming from the Ukraine crisis spreading with a time

lag, concern about inflation would not be small. However, the member suggested a few

reasons for preferring keeping the Base Rate unchanged, despite such concern.

First, it was still unclear how large the uncertainties surrounding and shocks

stemming from the Ukraine crisis would be and how long they would continue for the

moment. Although Korea does not have large trade volumes with Russia and Ukraine,

negative supply shocks might be seen through higher commodity prices, and negative

demand shocks via an indirect route through for instance the EU. The member noted

that the negative supply shocks clearly would increase inflation. However, the member

expressed the opinion that in a situation in which it was difficult to reasonably predict

the size and persistence of such shocks, a Base Rate hike could negatively affect the

recovery and growth path of the domestic economy going forward through the demand

side.


-----

Second, it would be necessary to keep a close watch on monetary policy trends in

major economies and their impacts on the market. Some overseas central banks had

already begun monetary tightening and the US Federal Reserve and the ECB were

expected to join this trend soon, and this would mean a decline in the massive liquidity

injected in the economy due to COVID-19. In this situation, investment portfolios and

fund flows could change greatly. The member assessed that the international financial

market was already seeing a risk-off pattern and the market was highly likely to be

more volatile. The member took the view that, in consideration of risks related to the

newly added Ukraine crisis as well, a better option at this juncture would be to decide

to take response measures after observing the effects of the existing preemptive

monetary policy measures and the development of external uncertainties, rather than to

take policy countermeasures based on uncertain information.

The member emphasized that, while the most important variables in the future

would be those related to inflation, it would be necessary to carefully monitor

uncertainties in the asset markets caused by changes in monetary policy in major

economies, and the evolution of global risks stemming from the Ukraine crisis, as

external factors. The member noted that, to this end, it would be necessary to

strengthen market monitoring and communications with market participants, and actively

consider market stabilization measures in times of rapidly heightened market volatility.

Concerning financial imbalances, the member expressed the opinion that there was a

need for close monitoring of the possibility of a recovery of profit-seeking demand in

the housing market, and of whether unproductive demand for funds was increasing in

the commercial real estate market.

Another member presented the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the

Base Rate unchanged at its current level of 1.25% at this meeting.

Looking at changes in the domestic and overseas economic environments since the

previous MPB meeting, the member judged that the global economy was continuing its

recovery trend, despite the spread of the pandemic, and inflationary pressures were

continuing to increase. The member noted that, while growth was moderating somewhat

of late, due to worsened health care conditions, given the nature of the Omicron variant

identified by major advanced economies, the economic impacts during this spread of

COVID-19 were highly likely to moderate or last for a shorter period of time than

previous waves.

The member noted that, in the domestic economy, growth in service consumption in

particular was slowing, due to stronger social distancing measures and weakened

consumer sentiment since December last year. However, the member assessed that the


-----

GDP gap would likely shift into positive territory in the first half of this year as

originally forecast, as exports remained strong and goods consumption and employment

conditions were sustaining relatively favorable improvement, with the correlation between

the spread of COVID-19 and economic activity having become much lower. However,

the member stated that economic uncertainties had heightened as the spread of the

pandemic in Korea was deepening and persisting longer than in major advanced

economies. The member also cautioned that global supply bottlenecks could be resolved

later than expected, due to the restrengthening of social distancing measures in some

emerging economies including China, and the intensification of geopolitical conflicts,

changes in monetary policies of major economies, and heightened financial market

volatility could negatively affect economic trends at home and abroad.

Meanwhile, the member stated that consumer price inflation continued to run at the

3% level, recording 3.6% in January, and the range of items with rising prices had

widened further. The member assessed that since, above all, inflationary pressures were

increasing rapidly for items with strong downward rigidity such as durable goods and

personal services, inflation would remain well above the target for a long time, and its

interactions with inflation expectations and wage increases were highly likely to

materialize. The member estimated that, although the Bank of Korea Research

Department had revised the price outlook upward, there still were huge upside risks to

the price path, in consideration of global energy price movements, prolongation of

supply disruptions and geopolitical risks, and trend of demand-side inflationary pressures.

Finally, the member evaluated that, in the financial market, market volatility had

been increasing, due to strengthened risk aversion stemming for instance from changes

in expectations for monetary policy normalization by major economies and intensified

geopolitical conflicts. The member saw that, against this backdrop, the risks of a

buildup in financial imbalances were easing somewhat, with the rate of household

lending growth falling for the second consecutive month and prices of assets such as

stocks and real estate undergoing corrections, due to policy effects such as strengthened

loan regulations and the Base Rate hikes. However, the member noted that since the

household debt-to-income ratio and housing price-to-income ratio were remaining at

much higher levels than those of major economies and compared to their long-term

trends, they remained as potential vulnerabilities in the financial system over the

medium- to long-term horizon. The member saw that corporate-sector leverage was

continuing a substantial uptrend, backed by abundant market liquidity, and

regulation-avoiding balloon effects such as a sharp increase in real estate investment

through corporate lending were being observed. The member thus emphasized the need

to continue policy efforts to ease the risks of an accumulation of financial imbalances.


-----

The member judged that, overall, the Korean economy was maintaining an

underlying trend of recovery, and upward pressures on inflation expectations were

continuing to increase, as the GDP gap was expected to shift into positive territory in

the first half of this year, and inflation had been exceeding the target for a long time.

The member thus stated that it would be desirable to continue to reduce the degree of

monetary policy accommodation to stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level

over a medium-term horizon. However, the member pointed out that financial

imbalances were showing signs of slight improvement thanks to the three preemptive

Base Rate hikes since August last year, while uncertainties surrounding the growth path

had heightened due to recent pandemic conditions, geopolitical risks, and monetary

policy normalization by major economies. The member thus took the view that it would

be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current level and closely monitor

domestic and international financial and economic conditions and the ripple effects of

the policy rate hikes.

###### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy

Decision statement was compiled. All MPB members supported the decision

unanimously.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base

Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.

- Currently available information suggests that the global economy has continued to

recover despite the spread of coronavirus variants, as economic activity has not

contracted significantly, supported by accelerated vaccinations. Volatility in global

financial markets has increased, affected by concerns over the pace of the US

Federal Reserve’s policy rate hikes as well as the Ukraine crisis. Government bond

yields in major countries have risen sharply and stock prices have fallen

considerably. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global

financial markets as likely to be affected largely by COVID-19 developments, global


-----

inflation movements, monetary policy changes in major countries and geopolitical risks.

- The Korean economy has continued to recover despite the resurgence of COVID-19.

Although the improvement in private consumption has moderated owing to the

tightening of domestic COVID-19 restrictions, exports have sustained their buoyancy

thanks to robust global demand. Facilities investment has somewhat slowed due to

global supply constraints. Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with a

sustained trend of increase in the number of persons employed. Going forward, the

economy is likely to sustain its sound growth, as the recovery of private

consumption is forecast to gradually pick up again while exports are expected to

continue their solid trend of increase. GDP growth this year is projected to be

around 3%, not deviating greatly from the November forecast.

- Consumer price inflation has remained high in the mid- to upper-3% range due to

the ongoing sharp rise in the prices of petroleum products, as well as the

accelerating increase in the prices of personal services and industrial products. Core

inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has risen to

the mid-2% level. The inflation expectations of the general public have run at the

mid- to upper-2% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation

will run substantially above 3% for a considerable time, exceeding the path

projected in November, and run at the lower-3% level for the year overall. Core

inflation is forecast to rise to the mid-2% level this year.

- In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates have risen significantly and

stock prices have fallen considerably while the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate

has increased slightly, mainly driven by global financial market movements. The amount

of increase in household loans has lessened, and the increase in housing prices has

moderated in all parts of the country.

- The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to sustain the recovery

of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a

medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. The Board will

appropriately adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation as the Korean
