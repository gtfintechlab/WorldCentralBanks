Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation

```
After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments_ (July 2022),[2)] _FX and_
_International Finance Trends, and_ _Financial Market Trends, the discussions of the_
Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas.

Members assessed that, despite a recovery in private consumption, driven by
face-to-face service consumption and ongoing favorable labor conditions, domestic
economic growth was slowing due mainly to sluggish investment as well as slowing
export growth stemming from a weakening of economic growth in major countries.
Some of the members expected growth to remain higher than its potential level, despite
external uncertainties surrounding the future growth path.

In terms of inflation, members assessed upside risks to inflation as having increased
significantly and inflation as having been accelerating, with consumer price inflation
reaching 6.0% in June, due to stronger demand-side pressure, as well as sustained
pressure on the supply side, including a rise in commodity and food prices. Some of
the members stressed the urgent need to reduce inflationary pressure and stabilize
inflation expectations, even if this would mean a loss of growth compared to the
current level, in consideration of the interaction between inflation and wages, the lag of
cost increases to consumers through prices, and the lag of monetary policy, although
there were uncertainties surrounding the future path.

In addition, members assessed that it would be necessary to be ready for increased
volatility in the foreign exchange market in line with worsened global financial
conditions, as risk aversion was strengthening due mainly to monetary policy
normalization in major countries and to concerns about a global economic slowdown.
Some of the members presented the view that it would be necessary to prevent a sharp
widening of the gap between domestic and overseas interest rates through a Base Rate
hike.

Some members also stressed the need to pay close attention to the possibility of
risks, such as heavier debt-servicing burdens and housing price declines in times of
interest rate hikes, and of interest rate hike shocks in vulnerable sectors, spilling over
into the larger financial system.

  Ⅲ. Summary of Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision

```
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the

Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows.

All members took the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and

international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to raise the

Base Rate to 2.25% from the current 1.75% at this meeting.

One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate

by 50 basis points to 2.25% from the current 1.75% at this meeting.

The member mentioned that global inflation had been accelerating since the second

half of last year due to the combined effect of supply shocks caused by the COVID-19

pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, and due to the demand recovery that was based

on the significantly accommodative monetary and fiscal policies since the pandemic. The

member noted that, in response to this, major countries had been rapidly adjusting such

accommodative monetary policies and that the adjustments so far and expectations of

further adjustments had been bringing down asset prices and reducing global liquidity.

The member also assessed that these adjustments had also been noted in consumer and

investor sentiment, leading to a slowdown in the momentum of economic recovery.

The member noted that inflation concerns were growing even further in Korea as

well, with inflation expectations surging to 3.9% from 3.3% a month before, and CPI

inflation for June reaching 6%, and went on to state that supply-side and demand-side

factors driving inflation each accounted for roughly 50% of the inflation.

The member mentioned that private consumption in Korea had been showing a

rapid recovery led by consumption of face-to-face services, while exports had slowed

significantly due to slowing overseas demand and supply disruptions. The member noted

that the average capacity utilization ratio and PMI of the manufacturing sector had

declined and the sluggishness of facilities investment had eased somewhat affected by

improved supply disruptions, while construction investment had remained sluggish owing

to rising material prices, strikes, and worsening weather conditions. The member

assessed that the employment situation was favorable overall, with the number of

persons employed continuing to rise and the unemployment rate remaining low.

The member assessed that financial market volatility had increased as major price

variables had reflected expectations of tighter financial conditions in line with rapid

policy rate hikes in major countries. The member mentioned that household lending had


-----

exhibited slower growth owing to lending regulations and rising lending rates, while

corporate lending had continued to grow significantly. The member presented the view

that, in terms of liquidity, M2 growth remained high compared with the 10-year average

before the pandemic and, although the corporate bond market had somewhat contracted

recently, overall funding conditions in the corporate sector seemed favorable.

The member evaluated that the priority of monetary policy in the current economic

situation should be reducing inflationary pressure and stabilizing inflation expectations

and that the current Base Rate remained accommodative, below the estimated range for

the neutral interest rate. The member argued that the economic growth rate for this year

and next was expected to be adjusted downward somewhat but would not deviate far

from the potential growth path and that, unless inflation expectations are addressed

actively, the Korean economy could pay a higher price in the long run. The member

assessed that, although the current high inflation was attributable largely to supply-side

factors, the central bank should take aggressive monetary policy measures to cope with

it even if they weigh on economic recovery, since there were only limited options to

resolve supply-side inflationary pressure. The member went on to state that, since steep

rate hikes by the U.S. were expected, it would be necessary to ease growing pressure

on the FX sector in line with the widening U.S.-Korea interest rate differential.

The member added that it would be necessary to further adjust the Base Rate while

continuing to closely analyze the inflation trend, changes in the conditions for economic

growth, and financial market conditions, and while monitoring monetary policy changes

in major countries.

Another member judged that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 2.25%

from the current 1.75% at this meeting.

The member mentioned that the domestic economy was maintaining growth

exceeding its potential. The member stated that, while export growth was slowing

moderately and facilities investment was continuing to undergo adjustments, private

consumption, led by service sectors, was showing sound growth, and the member

forecast that the domestic economy would maintain steady growth momentum, boosted by

the effects of supplementary budgets. The member noted that labor market conditions

were showing favorable movements with the number of persons employed maintaining its

substantial uptrend and wages showing a solid upward trend. However, the member saw

that there were high uncertainties surrounding the future growth path associated with the

Ukraine crisis, the policy stances of major country central banks, and the spread of

COVID-19. The member thus stressed the need to pay attention to these points.


-----

The member noted that prices had risen rapidly and consumer price inflation had

climbed to the 6% level in June, but upside risks still appeared to be large. The

member commented that, as the steep uptrend in prices had continued since the middle

of last year and had gathered pace of late, inflation expectations were rising rapidly and

there was a growing possibility of this leading to an interaction between inflation and

wages going forward. The member stressed the need to keep a close watch on the

possibility that a high inflation phase could take root in the domestic and global

economy if such destabilizing factors at home and abroad persisted.

Looking at the financial situation, the member stated that financial conditions were

continuing to show a reduction in the degree of accommodation, with market interest

rates rising substantially and stock prices falling considerably. However, the member

added that it would be necessary to consider the point that real interest rates were

actually falling, given the recent steep rise in inflation expectations. The member noted

that financial conditions did not appear to be greatly constrained given that M2 growth

remained high at the 8% level. Meanwhile, the member commented that the Korean won

to U.S. dollar exchange rate had risen, working as additional upward pressure on prices.

On the financial stability side, the member assessed that the widening of imbalances

in the financial sector at home were being curbed, as growth in domestic household

lending was slowing and housing prices were falling slightly. However, the member

took the view that the external sector could become less resilient as large-scale overseas

investment by, for instance, institutional investors, was continuing, while the current

account surplus had been narrowing of late.

Taking all these into consideration, the member stated that there were growing risks

that macroeconomic stability and external sector balances could be shaken going

forward, due to higher inflation of late, and that it would be necessary to continue

policy measures in response with a focus placed on price stability for some time. The

member especially stressed the need to prevent growth momentum of inflation itself

from setting in by raising the Base Rate as rapidly as possible to the neutral level, as

prices had risen steeply of late and inflation expectations were also rising rapidly. The

member saw that a large rate hike would have some negative impacts on the current

growth trend, but that this was unavoidable to secure stability in the medium- to

long-term macroeconomy, and that the rate hike would help enhance the domestic

financial market’s ability to absorb shocks from increased volatility in international

financial markets and would ease pressure for an increase in imbalances in the foreign

exchange sector. In the meantime, the member presented the view that the ensuing

difficulties faced by vulnerable sectors should be addressed with appropriate

microeconomic policy measures through concerted policy efforts.


-----

Meanwhile, the member stated the need to decide on the timing and the degree of

further Base Rate adjustments by closely monitoring the development of external

uncertainties and any resulting changes in the paces of growth and inflation at home.

One member took the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to

2.25% from the current 1.75% at this meeting.

The member saw that a main reason for the current Base Rate hike was inflation

and stated that consumer price inflation in June (year-on-year) was 6.0%, the highest

since November 1998 when consumer price inflation stood at 6.8%. The member

explained that inflation was largely triggered by overseas factors, including supply chain

issues, China’s lockdown measures, and the Russia-Ukraine crisis, but that inflationary

pressure on the demand side had been gradually increasing of late with half of the

current inflation being caused by demand-side factors, and the diffusion index for core

items maintaining growth. In addition, the member noted that one-year-ahead inflation

expectations among the general public stood at 3.9% as of June.

The member mentioned that there were also some positive aspects, such as

somewhat slower month-on-month price inflation growth and the anchoring of long-term

inflation expectations among experts at 2.0%. However, the member expressed the

opinion that a Base Rate hike was unavoidable in overall consideration of the level and

trend of inflation, growing demand-side factors, and a rise in short-term inflation

expectations. The member saw that what was worrisome in deciding on a 0.5%p Base

Rate hike was an unintended sudden economic downturn following the rate hike.

However, the member judged that inflation urgently needed to be dealt with first to

prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched and that the real economy could

withstand the rate hike at the current level. The member saw that the real economy

could not deviate greatly from the potential GDP path, although consideration should

also be given to the quality of employment, demographic changes, and the possibility of

structural change during the COVID-19 pandemic. The member noted that the low

unemployment rate and the very high job vacancy rate meant that even if there would

be a slight downturn in the economy, if the job vacancy rate signifying labor demand

were to decline first, losses on the employment side would be relatively small.

The need to prepare against factors causing disturbances in the FX market in line

with foreign portfolio investment net outflows was partially considered in this month’s

decision. The member particularly emphasized that the volume of capital outflows could

increase in a short period of time if the U.S. Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were larger

than expected and if international financial markets became unstable at a time when the


-----

expected return on won-denominated financial assets had fallen due to the widening gap

between domestic and overseas interest rates. The member went on to stress the need to

prevent the interest rate gap from widening to a worrisome extent.

The member expressed the view that the factors mentioned above had been taken

into consideration in determining the degree of a Base Rate hike for this month, but

that the rate hike should be accompanied by monitoring of vulnerable sectors. The

member first noted that a Base Rate hike would add to the debt-servicing burden of

economic agents. The member added that, during a period of rate hikes, a concerning

situation could arise with respect to vulnerable household borrowers, young people with

excessive debt, small business owners with deficits or who suffer from liquidity

shortages, and insolvent firms, and that the proportion of households whose consumption

would be limited by rising interest rates could grow rapidly. The member presented the

opinion that it would be necessary to closely monitor these vulnerable groups and also

to preemptively examine measures to deal with household loans that might turn sour,

businesses and financial institution liquidity problems, and the resolution of

non-performing loans.

The member also mentioned the need to prepare against a possible drop in housing

prices to a greater extent than expected. The member added that there were views that

such a risk was relatively low in Korea, where household loans were concentrated

mostly among high-income and high-credit borrowers, but according to the Survey of

Household Finances and Living Conditions, real estate accounted for more than 70% of

assets across all income quintiles and the share of their financial liabilities was much

lower than that in advanced countries. The member presented the view that this

indicated that a very small proportion of liquid assets, regardless of income level, would

serve as a buffer against shocks such as a housing price decline.

The member also noted that it would be necessary to prepare against the possibility

of shocks to vulnerable groups developing into systemic risks in order to fulfill the

central bank’s mandate of ensuring financial stability, and that it would also be

necessary to pay attention to overseas factors. The member stated that, at a time when

U.S. dollar supply and demand conditions had been worsening for some time, it would

be important to closely monitor global risk factors and changes in indicators of external

soundness in order to maintain Korea’s international credit standing.

One member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 2.25%

from the current 1.75% at this meeting.

The member noted that, looking at recent economic conditions, growth in major


-----

countries had weakened, the pace of global trade growth had slowed, and in financial

markets, the U.S. dollar had strengthened further and volatility in interest rates and

stock prices had increased. Accordingly, the member commented that Korea’s export

growth had slowed, but the extent of the slowdown appeared to be limited thanks to

structural demand expansion in the IT sector, and to private consumption, particularly

face-to-face services, which were continuing to recover. The member judged that,

although downside risks to growth were high due to worsened export and investment

conditions and to the resurgence of COVID-19, the economy would be able to maintain

growth at a level higher than its potential, as long as there were no large deteriorations

in domestic or overseas conditions.

With regard to prices, the member noted that, amid ongoing pressure on the

demand side, pressure on the supply side, including oil prices, exchange rates and

wages, had increased further, and, as a result, consumer price inflation stood at 6.0% in

June, the highest level since 1998. The member forecast that, while prices would rise

somewhat slowly as a slowdown in global demand would lead to oil and grain price

declines, high prices would continue for a considerable time.

The member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate by an

unprecedentedly sharp 50 basis points at this meeting in consideration of recent

economic and financial conditions and suggested a few reasons for this judgment.

First, the member judged that the pace of price rises and the range of inflation

diffusion were far exceeding expectations and the upside risks appeared to be greater,

considering prolonged geopolitical risks, the resurgence of COVID-19, and supply chain

disruptions, and the possibility of worsened weather conditions. The member stressed the

importance at this juncture of preventing a vicious cycle of interaction between inflation

expectations and actual prices, as wage growth was expanding with inflation expectations

rising rapidly. The member saw the need to speed up Base Rate hikes given that

interest rate policy would be transmitted to prices after a time lag of several quarters.

The member presented the opinion that, according to an analysis by the Bank of Korea

Research Department, growth for this year and the next was unlikely to be lower than

the 2% level, and thus it would be necessary to place a priority on price stability for

some time. The member added that it would be necessary to recall historical

experiences, that a further surge in inflation would inevitably lead to a larger rate hike

and to a loss of growth in the future.

The member also considered the need to actively respond to the possibility of

capital outflows, as global liquidity was declining and tendencies toward risk aversion

were growing due to financial tightening and concerns about an economic slowdown in

major countries. The member noted that, while a reversal to a net outflow had been


-----

seen concerning foreign exchange supply and demand conditions, the short-term external

debt ratio had increased and foreign portfolio investment continued to show a net

outflow since the beginning of this year, and thus related concerns were growing. The

member took the view that, while sound fundamentals, such as macroeconomic stability,

were important to ensure soundness in the foreign exchange sector, it would also be

necessary to prevent a rapid inversion of the gap between domestic and overseas

interest rates, during a period of soaring global interest rates, as seen recently.

The member saw that a Base Rate hike would help deal with financial imbalances

by ensuring stability in household debt and curbing corporate lending. The member

judged that the entire financial system would be able to withstand a large rate hike,

considering that private debt growth so far had been led by high-income and high-credit

borrowers. The member noted, however, that default risks in vulnerable sectors,

including vulnerable households and corporate borrowers, heavily indebted youth, and

self-employed business owners lacking liquidity, could all be much greater, and thus it

would be necessary to seek separate supplementary measures to alleviate their principal

and interest repayment burdens.

Taking into consideration the economic and price outlooks and financial conditions,

the member saw a need to maintain the Base Rate hike stance for some time. However,

the member judged that it would be desirable to maintain a gradual pace of Base Rate

hikes, considering economic uncertainties at home and abroad, and the time lag of

monetary policy, unless price inflation ran well above the expected trajectory.

Another member judged that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 2.25%

from the current 1.75% at this meeting.

The member mentioned that the global economic recovery had been weakening

significantly due to slowing trade growth and ongoing high inflation. The member noted

that global prices remained on the rise in most countries, centering on energy and food

prices, and upward pressure was spreading widely. Concerning the domestic economy,

the member judged that consumption and the services industry were leading the

economic recovery, while export growth was slowing and investment was sluggish. The

member stated that the growth rate for this year would be somewhat below the Research

Department’s May forecast (2.7%) and that Base Rate hikes would act as an additional

downside risk. The member presented the view that the annual inflation rate would

substantially exceed the previous forecast (4.5%), and that the future direction of the price

path would depend mostly on overseas factors, such as developments in the Ukraine crisis,

fluctuations in international commodity prices, and changes in global aggregate demand.


-----

The member assessed that, despite slowing growth, inflationary pressure made it

difficult for the central bank to make monetary policy responses. The member judged

that, considering the fact that cost increases are passed on to prices with a time lag,

inflationary pressure would continue for the time being. The member, meanwhile,

mentioned that last year’s 4.1% growth, boosted by strong exports, had led to

significant increases in household income and employment this year, and that pressure

on consumption demand had accordingly increased substantially. The member noted that

the number of persons employed, the economic activity participation rate, the

employment rate, and the job openings-to-seeker ratio had all risen, that the

unemployment rate gap had remained negative for several months, and that total time in

employment had increased by more than 4% from that during the pre-pandemic period,

despite a gradual decline in working hours per person. The member evaluated that the

increase in earned income and excess savings during the pandemic would support

consumption to some extent, and that, since consumption was at a low level given

employment and household income, household consumption could expand further despite

the decrease in real purchasing power due to inflation. The member also forecast that,

despite sluggish investment and slowing exports, aggregate consumption would lead

economic growth this year, just as government consumption maintained last year’s strong

growth.

The member mentioned that, considering such inflation and employment conditions,

###### there were good reasons to maintain the rate hike stance and that the Base Rate

 would be continuously adjusted for some time, consistent with real economic

 activity and the inflation outlook. The member however expressed the view that,

 since uncertainties over the mid- to long-term neutral interest rate level had

 increased due to global inflation shocks and prolonged supply disruptions, it

 would be necessary to respond while carefully examining how prices and the

 economy respond to interest rate hikes and how financial variables fluctuate.

The member meanwhile expected that international financial markets would remain

highly volatile for the time being, as in the domestic FX sector price variable volatility

had increased, some external soundness indicators had worsened in the domestic FX

sector, the risk of global economic recession has been growing, and the U.S. Federal

Reserve has been accelerating rate hikes since the previous MPB meeting. The member

stressed that, although vulnerabilities had not yet been exposed, careful examination was

needed as to how worsening global financial conditions affect the stability of the

domestic FX sector.

```
Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

```
Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy

Decision statement was compiled. All MPB members supported the decision

unanimously.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

`□` The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base

Rate by 50 basis points, from 1.75% to 2.25%. The Board judges that a pre-emptive

policy response to prevent the entrenchment of high inflation is of greater

importance for some time as high inflation is continuing and becoming broad-based

while short-term inflation expectations are rising sharply, although economic

downside risks have increased at home and abroad.

`□` Currently available information suggests that global economic growth has weakened,

affected by the prolonged Ukraine crisis, while inflation has remained high. In global

financial markets, risk aversion has strengthened due to the acceleration of policy

rate hikes in major countries and consequent concerns about economic slowdown.

The US dollar has remained strong and stock prices have fallen considerably, while

government bond yields in major countries have fluctuated significantly. Looking

ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely

to be affected largely by global inflation movements, monetary policy changes in

major countries, geopolitical risks, and COVID-19 restrictions in major countries.

`□` The Korean economy has continued to recover. Private consumption has sustained

its improvement and sluggishness in facilities investment has eased, while export

growth has somewhat slowed. Labor market conditions have continued to improve,

with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed remaining high.

Going forward, while private consumption is likely to sustain its recovery, GDP

growth this year is projected to be somewhat below the May forecast of 2.7%,

affected by the slowdown in exports owing to weakening of economic growth in

major countries. Uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook are judged to be

elevated.


-----

`□` Consumer price inflation has risen significantly to 6.0% due to the ongoing sharp

rise in the prices of petroleum products and the accelerating price increases in other

expenditure categories. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices

from the CPI) and the inflation expectations of the general public have increased to

close to 4%. It is forecast that consumer price inflation will remain high at above

6% for some time and run substantially above the May forecast of 4.5% for the

year overall. Core inflation is forecast to remain elevated at 4% or higher for a

considerable time.

`□` In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates have risen considerably,

due to expectations about policy rate hikes at home and abroad, while stock prices

have fallen sharply driven mainly by concerns about global economic slowdown. The

Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has risen significantly, reflecting the global

strengthening of the US dollar. Household loans have increased slightly and housing

prices have remained steady.

`□` Considering inflation and economic conditions, though economic downside risk is

indeed high, uncertainties remain elevated, and thus the Board sees it as important at

this time to curb the spread of inflation expectations through a 50-basis-point rate

hike to prevent acceleration of inflation.

`□` The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to stabilize consumer

price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon as it monitors

economic growth, while paying attention to financial stability. The Board sees

continued rate hikes as warranted, as inflation is expected to run above the target

level for a considerable time. In this process the Board will determine the size and

pace of further increase of the Base Rate while thoroughly assessing the trends of

growth and inflation, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, monetary policy

changes in major countries, and external economic conditions including geopolitical

risks.
