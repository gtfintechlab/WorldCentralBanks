Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation

```
After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments_ (April 2022),[2)] _FX and_

_International Finance Trends, and_ _Financial Market Trends, the discussions of the_

Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

Members assessed that, despite sluggishness in facilities and construction investment,

the domestic economy was continuing its sound recovery, led by a modest improvement

in private consumption following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, as well as by

buoyant exports in line with robust global demand. In addition, members stated that

labor market conditions had continued to improve, with the number of persons

employed surging and the unemployment rate falling.

In terms of inflation, members assessed upside risks to inflation as having increased

greatly, with inflationary pressure expanding into a wide range of items, and the

Ukraine crisis working as additional upward pressure, expecting inflation to remain

above the target for a considerable period of time going forward. Some members

expressed the need to take preemptive measures to ensure stable management of

inflation expectations, while keeping a close watch on the possibility of persistent

inflation affected by cumulative supply-side and demand-side inflationary factors, and on

second-round effects leading to wage increases. In addition, some members expressed

the view that there would be a need to monitor the impacts on prices of structural

factors, such as the restructuring of global value chains, as well as cyclical factors.

Meanwhile, members assessed that volatility in price indices of financial assets had

heightened, owing chiefly to heightened uncertainties stemming from monetary policy

changes at home and abroad and the prolongation of geopolitical risks. Some members

mentioned that, despite slowed growth in household lending, financial conditions still

remained accommodative, with credit to the corporate sector exhibiting a sharp increase

and financial institutions easing their lending attitudes, and, taking these points into

account, it would be necessary to pay attention to the risk of financial imbalances.

Some members also stressed the need to pay close attention to soundness changes

in the external sector, such as capital flows associated with heightened volatility in the

foreign exchange and international financial markets in the future.

 Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

```
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the

Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

All members took the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and

international financial and economic situations, it would be desirable to raise the Base

Rate from 1.25% to 1.50%.

One member took the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate from its

current level of 1.25% to 1.50%.

The member judged that the domestic economy had been continuing its steady

growth of late, despite heightened external uncertainties caused by the Ukraine crisis.

The member noted that, although facilities investment was undergoing a correction,

exports were sustaining strong growth, thanks to the robust global demand for goods.

The member stated that private consumption was returning to the path of recovery,

supported by the relaxing of disease control measures, after slowing under the effects of

a more severe spread of COVID-19 in the country. On the employment front, the

member added that there had been clear improvements in employment conditions, thanks

to a sustained trend of significant increase in the number of persons employed and a

sharp fall in the unemployment rate.

The member expected the domestic economy to show growth falling somewhat short

of the path forecast in February, but saw that growth in the upper 2% range still

exceeding the potential level would be possible going forward, led by strong exports

and private consumption recovery. The member noted that the Ukraine crisis and

China’s zero-COVID policy might work to constrain global economic recovery mainly

on the supply side, but exports and investment would maintain favorable growth, since

global demand for goods was expected to remain solid. The member expected

consumption to rapidly return to recovery, as the spread of COVID-19 in the country

had passed the peak and was gradually stabilizing, and income conditions were

improving on the back of favorable labor conditions. However, the member expressed

the need to carefully monitor factors acting to increase uncertainties concerning the

future growth path at home, including acceleration of monetary policy normalization in

major economies, the prolonged Ukraine crisis, and a possible economic growth

slowdown in China.

With respect to inflation, the member noted that with upward pressures increasing,


-----

consumer price inflation had exceeded 4% of late, and core inflation had risen to a

level close to 3%. The member expected consumer price inflation to far exceed the path

projected in February, as impacts of rises in commodity prices and global supply

disruptions, the two factors working to increase prices since the second half of last

year, had grown since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis. The member noted that,

accordingly, inflation expectations of the general public had been nearing 3% of late,

and raised concern about the possibility of second-round effects of the consequent

interaction between prices and inflation expectations materializing in full. The member

stated that domestic prices were heavily influenced by the external sector, and argued

that at the base of the recent global high inflation there were not only supply-side

factors but also demand pressures exceeding the potential level stemming from the

expansionary policy operations. The member added that unless these upward inflationary

pressures disappeared, global inflation could remain high for a long time.

Looking at financial conditions, the member evaluated that volatility had increased

considerably, as market interest rates were rising significantly on changes in expectations

for monetary policy at home and abroad and stock prices had been sensitive to changes

in the international political landscape. The member noted in particular that the Korean

won to US dollar exchange rate had risen significantly, driven by the strong dollar

trend, influenced by preference for safe haven assets stemming from escalating

geopolitical risks, as well as by expectations of an acceleration of monetary policy

normalization by the Federal Reseve. Meanwhile, the member noted that, while the risk

of financial imbalances related to domestic household debt was easing gradually, banks

had been gradually relaxing their lending attitudes of late. The member thus added that

it would be necessary to observe a little longer to see whether these trends would

continue. The member judged overall financial conditions to still remain accommodative,

as the M2 growth rate was remaining high exceeding 10% due to the continued supply

of credit to the corporate sector in particular, although it had declined slightly due to a

base effect. The member pointed out the possibility that there could have been a

significant buildup of funds provision which failed to properly reflect credit risk in the

course of providing financial support to corporations and small business owners, and

presented the opinion that special attention should be paid to the point that this could

work as another destabilizing factor on the financial stability side going forward.

The member judged that, in overall consideration of domestic economic growth,

inflation and financial conditions, it would be necessary to steadily reduce the degree of

monetary policy accommodation. The member evaluated that, despite heightened external

uncertainties, the economy was expected to maintain a growth trend above the potential

level for some time, while upward inflationary pressures had increased further of late


-----

and there would be an increasing possibility of much clearer second-round effects

through inflation expectations. The member noted that the recently heightened upward

pressures on wages and the gradual spread of the uptrend in prices from commodities

to final goods and service charges were suggesting that such concerns were

materializing to some extent. The member added that it would be necessary to keep in

mind that the recent rise in the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate was acting as

an additional upward pressure on domestic prices through import prices. The member

saw that, against this backdrop, it would be very important to stabilize inflation

expectations by maintaining the current preemptive monetary policy stance in a

consistent manner and communicating clear policy intentions to economic agents, and

this policy response would serve as a foundation for macroeconomic stability in the

medium to long term.

On the financial stability side, the member stressed the need to prepare against

possible volatility shocks in the international financial market that might occur during

the course of steep monetary policy normalization in major economies, by inducing

economic agents to adjust excessively heightened leverage in an orderly manner and

making the financial market more resilient.

The member thus presented the view that it would be better to raise the Base Rate

from its current level of 1.25% to 1.50% at this meeting.

The member stated that the Board should judge when to further adjust the degree

of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to uncertainties such

as monetary policy normalization in major economies and the impacts from the Ukraine

crisis. The member went on to express the opinion that, absent any major changes in

such circumstances, the Board should preemptively reduce the degree of accommodation

in a consistent manner, while putting the top priority on ensuring stability in inflation

expectations.

Another member judged that it would be appropriate to make an upward adjustment

of the Base Rate to 1.50% from the current 1.25%.

The member evaluated that uncertainties had grown again, due to the combination

of shocks such as the recent Ukraine-Russia War, economic slowdown in China, and

monetary policy normalization in major economies, although the world economy was

gradually emerging from a health crisis that had persisted for the past two years. The

member saw that such shocks would likely have only limited impacts on growth during

the course of world economic recovery, but expected the extent and duration of global

inflation to increase further, due to rising international commodity prices and worsening


-----

global supply chain disruptions.

The member evaluated that, despite somewhat sluggish facilities and construction

investment affected by supply disruptions, the domestic economy was making a soft

landing, thanks to the ongoing decoupling between private consumption and the

pandemic situation, and to a sustained solid recovery in exports. The member expected

the positive GDP gap to widen gradually after the second quarter, as the economy

would continue to show growth exceeding its potential level. However, the member saw

that consumer price inflation and core inflation were running at 4.1% and 2.9%,

respectively, in March, well above the target of 2%, and saw these patterns as unlikely

to reverse to a trend of price stabilization in a short period of time. The member noted

that the surge in inflation was highly likely to act as a downside risk to growth

through a decline in real purchasing power, an increase in production costs, and

heightened economic uncertainties.

The member evaluated that, when comparing the recent period of inflation with

periods of supply shocks, such as the commodity supercycle in the mid-2000s and the

period of political unrest in the Middle East in the early 2010s, the increase in

commodity prices was larger and compounded by demand-side upward inflationary

pressures. The member stated that, contrary to the past periods, core inflation had risen

sharply and the diffusion index for consumer prices remained high, clearly showing

second-round effects. The member added that accordingly there was a lot of concern

that high inflation could persist. The member noted that, most importantly, prices and

wages were showing a clearer correlation due to the rapid pace of rise in nominal

wages since last year and keen attention was being paid in this regard.

Meanwhile, the member evaluated that the slowing of household debt and housing

price growth since the beginning of this year was largely attributable to tighter

regulations, and that the continued high growth in market liquidity and the sustained

accumulation of stand-by funds by financial institutions were factors making the Board

stay vigilant from the perspective of financial imbalances.

Given economic, inflation and financial conditions of late, the member judged that

it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate at this meeting. The member saw that

inflationary pressures of late were greatly attributable to supply shocks. However, the

member pointed out that, contrary to the past, there was a large trade-off between

growth and inflation due mainly to recovery in demand at home and abroad. The

member thus evaluated that the benefits of suppressed inflation from a Base Rate hike

would outweigh the cost of slower growth. The member raised concern about increased

burdens of household debt repayment resulting from a Base Rate hike, but expected the

improvement in household income so far and the lengthening of loan maturities to work


-----

to ease the actual repayment burdens.

Given that the rapid decline in real interest rates of late had made them deviate

more widely from the neutral interest rate, the member presented the view that the

Board should move toward reducing the accommodative stance in its conduct of

monetary policy going forward. However, the member expressed the need to determine

the time and pace of an additional Base Rate hike depending on developments in

economic and financial conditions. The member added that uncertainties surrounding the

price path remained high in the short term, and there were upward inflationary pressures

from energy conversion and contracted global supply chains, as well as downward

pressures from population aging, debt growth and technological innovation from a

long-term perspective. The member thus saw the need to thoroughly review the relevant

developments going forward. Meanwhile, the member noted that debt risk for vulnerable

households could increase, affected by a Base Rate hike and tighter regulations

including debt service ratio (DSR) rules differentiated by borrower. The member thus

added that it would be necessary to continuously monitor the relevant risks, while

stepping up policy efforts to improve the qualitative structure of debt.

One member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate from

1.25% to 1.50%.

Looking at changes in the domestic and overseas economic environments since the

previous MPB meeting, the member judged that the global economy was continuing its

underlying recovery trend, despite combined developments of various risk factors.

However, the member noted that with inflation increasing rapidly, the recovery

momentum was weakening and economic uncertainties had heightened in most countries

including Korea. The member stressed that factors such as growing geopolitical risks

from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the spread of the Omicron variant in the Asian

region, and the Chinese government’s “zero-COVID” policy could not only directly limit

economic growth, but also lead to rising production costs and a decrease in real

purchasing power through inflationary pressures caused by supply disruptions, and thus

have greatly expanded negative spillover effects.

Against this backdrop, the member noted the following factors that were considered

in making the monetary policy decision. First, the member evaluated that inflation

expectations were continuing to spread as the trend of inflation far exceeding the target

had become more likely to persist for a long time. The member stated that the impacts

on prices of geopolitical risks and disease control measures tended of course to be

mostly temporary, limiting their implications for monetary policy. However, the member


-----

commented that the pressures on domestic inflation had broadly increased as recent

supply shock had occurred in the midst of already prolonged rises in international

commodity prices and it was combined with the depreciation of the won stemming from

the spread of global risk aversion. The member added that the interaction from wages

to prices through a rise in inflation expectations could already have begun, as

second-round effects into other items were materializing in full due to the combined

effects of cyclical and structural factors, employment conditions were recovering, and the

pace of wage increases was accelerating in some industries of late.

Second, the member judged that, although downside risks to growth were growing,

they had not yet been undermining the underlying recovery. The member saw that

exports and manufacturing production remained relatively robust, while economic

recovery had slowed, particularly in private consumption, due to the rapid spread of

Omicron in the first quarter. The member evaluated that private consumption was

showing a sign of renewed improvement, albeit modest, bolstered by the relaxing of

disease control measures, and the partial slowing of the spread of COVID-19, although

recent supply chain disruptions and the heightened possibility of global economic

slowdown were exerting a drag on the outlook for exports. The member thus judged

that the trend of recovery exceeding the potential growth rate would likely to continue

this year, as in the previous year, while the output gap was likely to shift into positive

territory not much later than the originally forecast.

Third, the member evaluated that, despite the three Base Rate hikes since August

last year, monetary policy still remained accommodative. The member estimated that,

although financial conditions had become less accommodative, due to a steep rise in

market interest rates entering this year, the real Base Rate had fallen below the average

for last year and was running considerably below the neutral interest rate.

Finally, in terms of financial stability, the member assessed that growth in

household lending and housing prices had slowed since the second half of last year, but

continued caution about the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances was required. The

member mentioned that destabilizing factors remained, as the household debt-to-income

ratio and housing price-to-income ratio continued to be above their long-term trends and

higher than those of major countries due to the accumulation of leverage, while

financial institutions had somewhat eased their lending attitudes, and housing price

sentiment had stopped declining recently amid ample market liquidity. Furthermore, the

member expressed the view that, since the FX sector could remain highly volatile and

work to destabilize financial markets for some time due to changes in expectations of

major country monetary policies, external soundness should be a matter of policy

concern as well.


-----

Taking all this into consideration, the member evaluated that it would be

appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.50% from the current 1.25% at this meeting.

The member argued that, despite concerns about the fact that downside risks to growth

and upside risks to inflation had been growing at the same time at home and abroad,

stabilizing inflation expectations and curbing the risk of a buildup of financial

imbalances through continued effort to return to a neutral monetary policy stance was a

choice that would meet policy objectives over the medium- and long-term horizon,

considering growth would likely continue to exceed its potential level. The member also

noted that, keeping in mind that credit risk of vulnerable sectors could increase in the

course of monetary policy normalization, it would be necessary to manage related risks

preemptively through coordination with fiscal and financial policies.

Another member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to

1.50% from the current 1.25% at this meeting.

The member assessed that, although the global economic recovery had slowed

somewhat affected by the Ukraine crisis, the US economy had maintained strong growth

in terms of employment and consumption and global trade had also sustained modest

growth.

Concerning the domestic economy, the member noted that the number of persons

employed remained on a sharp rise and exports continued to be strong, while the

recovery in facilities and construction investment had been delayed due to supply-side

factors. The member added that private consumption had been also returning to the path

of recovery since March, as people had been adapting to the pandemic situation. With

regard to the FX and financial sectors, the member assessed that the domestic financial

system remained sound while major economic variables had become more volatile due

to common uncertainties at home and abroad such as geopolitical risks, the monetary

policy directions of major countries, and pandemic-related developments.

The member stressed that the top consideration in the current Base Rate decision

was movements of inflation variables. The member mentioned that consumer price

inflation had stood at 4.1% in March, exceeding 4% for the first time since 2011, and

that core inflation had also reached 2.9%. The member added that, although the

long-term inflation expectations of an expert group had not yet deviated far from the

inflation target, the short-term inflation expectations of the general public had risen to

2.9%.

The member noted that uncertainties remained with regard to the depth and duration

of the shock from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which had begun on the day of the


-----

BOK’s February MPB meeting. The member mentioned that, looking at its impact on

the economy so far, the invasion had put downward pressures on the real economy,

although these repurcussions were not as large as expected and uncertainties were high,

but the invasion had put massive and conspicuous upward pressures on inflation. The

member noted that, since a rise in commodity prices does not spread to import prices,

producer prices and then to consumer prices with a time lag but rather commodity

prices move in concert with other prices, a surge in energy and grain prices was

spreading rapidly to domestic prices, and a rise in grain prices in particular could have

a long-term effect. The member added that a growing number of core and non-core

inflation items had all been exhibiting growth of 2% or higher. The member assessed

that, with these factors taken into account, consumer price inflation was forecast to

remain in the 4% range for the time being and consumer price inflation for the year as

a whole was likely to exceed the February forecast of 3.1%.

The member mentioned that a close watch should be kept not only on the

above-mentioned spread but also on the possibility of a secondary effect in which

inflation leads to a rise in wages. The member evaluated that special payments had

contributed most to wage increases during 2021, but toward the end of the year, regular

payments, which tend to be persistent, had made an increasingly large contribution and

the trend of wage growth had been spreading to various industries. The member noted

that in this situation most indicators that affect wages had returned to their

pre-pandemic levels, including inflation expectations and the job vacancy rate, as well as

the employment rate, jobless claims and working hours that indicate slack in the labor

market. The member presented the view that this could mean a recovery in the real

economy but could also lead to wage increases, causing further rises in prices of some

items such as personal services.

The member mentioned that a rise in market interest rates following a Base Rate

hike could limit the momentum of economic recovery. The member however emphasized

that both historical experience and economic theory indicate that stabilizing inflation

expectations is essential in responding to negative price shocks and that the monetary

authorities should send a clear signal in this regard. The member noted that, even if

raised this time, the Base Rate would remain accommodative relative to real economic

conditions. The member added that a Base Rate hike also remained crucial in a

scenario in which the growth forecast had been adjusted downward and the inflation

forecast upward in reflection of the Ukraine crisis. The member assessed that the real

economy would be able to endure a Base Rate hike given the positive effects that

future easing of disease-control measures would have on private consumption and

employment. The member argued that with all this taken into consideration it would be


-----

advisable for now to deal with the more obvious and conspicuous risk of inflation.

The member stated that particular attention should be kept to price-related variables

in determining the monetary policy stance but macro-prudence also required special

attention. The member mentioned that, on the domestic front, attention should be paid

to financial imbalances arising from the housing market. The member’s evaluation was

that the housing market had been gradually stabilizing recently, with lending to

households decreasing slightly and housing prices and leasehold deposits declining

slightly as well. The member added that Base Rate increases had been working to curb

demand for loans due to rising costs. In quantitative terms, however, the member noted

that there remained a possibility of a rise in lending to households, led by leasehold

deposit loans. The member also mentioned that there were incentives for financial

institutions to expand lending since the rate of growth in household lending was below

the annual administered target. The member stressed the need to keep a close watch on

future developments of lending and housing prices in this context and went on to

emphasize that it would be necessary to carefully monitor any yield-seeking behavior.

Concerning macro-prudence in the external sector, the member mentioned that,

looking back at previous experiences, attention should be paid to sudden changes in

capital flows and the exchange rate. The member assessed that foreign reserves were

currently abundant, the short-term external debt ratio was relatively low, the banking

sector was maintaining a favorable level of soundness, and the correlation coefficient of

flows of funds for bond investment in Korea and emerging market countries had

decreased, all of which could be seen as positive factors. The member however noted

that risk factors also existed, such as the prolongation of geopolitical risks and potential

shocks that could arise over the course of monetary policy normalization in advanced

economies. The member also expressed the opinion that there was a need to prepare for

a weakening of China’s growth due to its stronger measures against COVID-19 and the

impact of possible monetary easing in response.

One member took the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to

1.50% from the current 1.25% at this meeting.

Concerning the global economy, the member judged that the recovery of growth

had been slower than previously expected and the uptrend in prices had been

accelerating. The member mentioned that this was attributable to the worsening of trade

and supply disruptions due to the Russia-Ukraine war, amid the growing pressure for

major central banks to normalize their accommodative monetary policy stance with

supply bottlenecks and a strong recovery in demand since the pandemic leading to


-----

further inflation.

Regarding the domestic economy, the member assessed prices as rising at a faster

pace than previously forecast. The member noted that, in the underlying inflation

situation in which inflationary pressure was expanding into a wide range of items,

global oil and commodity prices were acting as further upward pressures on prices due

to the Ukraine crisis, and went on to state that inflation expectations had already risen

close to 3%.

The member expected that the domestic economic growth forecast for this year

would be lowered somewhat from the previous forecast (3.0%) due to the slow recovery

during the first quarter, but the economy would sustain its sound recovery later on,

boosted by improvements in consumption and strong exports. As to private consumption,

the member mentioned that, although hit by a surge in virus infections and quarantines,

the mobility index and the amount of credit card usage had improved since mid-March,

and went on to argue that, boosted by favorable household income conditions, private

consumption was likely to sustain its recovery in line with a gradual return to everyday

life, led by face-to-face consumption such as leisure activities. The member stated that a

recovery in facilities investment was limited by global supply disruptions and anticipated

that a recovery in construction investment would be delayed longer than originally

expected owing to a delay in material supply. The member assessed that exports would

maintain favorable growth based on strong demand from major economies. The member

noted that employment continued to improve, with the number of persons employed

rising significantly and the unemployment rate declining, and that upward pressures on

wages seemed to be strengthening gradually.

With regard to the financial markets, the member noted that Treasury bond yields

had risen significantly, affected by the Federal Reserve’s recent monetary policy

decision. The member mentioned that credit to the corporate sector had been exhibiting

strong growth and financial institutions’ lending attitudes had been easing, while banks’

lending to households continued to slow. The member evaluated that significantly

negative short-term real interest rates and the continued strong growth in market

liquidity suggested that financial conditions remained accommodative.

The member assessed that the most-watched aspect of recent domestic and overseas

economic developments was the escalating inflation and its sustainability. The member

judged that the sharp rise in inflation at home and abroad since the middle of last year

had been attributable mainly to supply-side factors, but a surge in liquidity and

increased demand in line with accommodative monetary and fiscal policies had been

also responsible. The member presented the view that, given the additional and

sustainable impact on price conditions of structural dynamics at this turning point of the


-----

global economy, such as changes in the geopolitical environment including the

emergence of a new cold war, demographic change, a reorganization of global value

chains, changes in investment and trade patterns, and climate change, attention should be

paid to the possibility of the underlying inflationary pressure that had been spreading so

far becoming more than a transitory phenomenon. The member mentioned that inflation

expectations of the general public had been growing recently along with the continued

uptrend in prices, and went on to state that in order to prevent this from imposing an

additional burden on the future path of the domestic economy and also on monetary

policy options, preemptive measures needed to be taken for stable management of

inflation expectations. The member also assessed that the Federal Reseve could

normalize its monetary policy faster and to a greater extent than expected a couple of

months earlier, and in this regard attention should be paid to consequent potential

pressures from the FX sector and possible restriction on domestic monetary policy. The

member also stressed the need to ensure monetary policy space in advance to respond

more effectively to changes in the domestic economic situation.

Taking all this into comprehensive consideration, the member presented the view

that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.50% from the current 1.25% at

this meeting. The member expected that a Base Rate hike was unlikely to limit the

momentum of economic recovery as the spread of the pandemic slows and

disease-control measures are eased gradually.

Concerning the future monetary policy direction, the member noted that it would be

necessary to further adjust the degree of monetary easing at an appropriate pace while

closely monitoring changes in economic and price conditions at home and abroad,

whether inflation expectations are firmly anchored, and financial stability conditions.

Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

```
Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy

Decision statement was compiled. All MPB members supported the decision

unanimously.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

`□` The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base

Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.25% to 1.50%.

`□` Currently available information suggests that inflation has accelerated while the

recovery of the global economy has somewhat moderated, affected by the Ukraine

crisis. In global financial markets, government bond yields in major countries have

risen sharply and the US dollar has strengthened, mainly due to changes in

expectations about the pace of the US Federal Reserve’s policy normalization. Stock

prices have rebounded after a considerable decline. Looking ahead, the Board

expects that the global economy will resume its trend of recovery, supported by the

easing of COVID-19 restrictions in major countries, but sees it as likely to be

affected largely by COVID-19 developments, global inflation movements, monetary

policy changes in major countries and geopolitical risks.

`□` The Korean economy has continued to recover. Exports have sustained their

buoyancy while facilities investment has slowed due to global supply constraints.

Private consumption has recently shown modest improvement thanks to the easing of

domestic COVID-19 restrictions, after having moderated. Labor market conditions

have continued to improve, with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons

employed remaining high. Going forward, the economy is likely to sustain its

recovery albeit partly affected by the Ukraine crisis, as exports are expected to

continue their solid trend of growth while private consumption is likely to improve.

GDP growth this year is projected to be somewhat below the February forecast of

3%.

`□` Consumer price inflation has risen significantly to the lower-4% level due to soaring

prices of petroleum products as well as the accelerating increase in the prices of

industrial products and personal services. Core inflation (excluding changes in food


-----

and energy prices from the CPI) and the inflation expectations of the general public

have increased to the upper-2% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer

price inflation will remain high in the 4% range for some time, and run

substantially above the February forecast of 3.1% for the year overall. Core inflation

is forecast to remain around 3% for a considerable time.

`□` In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates and the Korean won to

US dollar exchange rate have risen significantly while stock prices have fluctuated

considerably, mainly driven by global financial market movements. Household loans

have decreased slightly and housing prices have fallen slightly, especially in the

Seoul metropolitan area.

`□` The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to sustain the recovery

of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a

medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. The Board will

appropriately adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation as the Korean

economy is expected to continue its recovery and inflation to run above the target

level for a considerable time, despite underlying uncertainties in domestic and

external conditions. In this process the Board will judge when to further adjust the

degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to

COVID-19, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, monetary policy changes

in major countries, geopolitical risks, and the trends of growth and inflation.
