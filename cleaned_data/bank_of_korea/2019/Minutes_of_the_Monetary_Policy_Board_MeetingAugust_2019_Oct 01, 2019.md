Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation

```
After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments,[2)]_ _FX and International Finance_

_Trends, and_ _Financial Market Trends, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB)_

members covered the following areas:

Members evaluated that, looking at the global economy, global trade growth had continued to

slow and economic growth in major countries had shown sluggishness in line with the escalation of

trade conflicts between major countries and an increase in geopolitical risks. As for the global

financial markets, members judged that preferences for safe-haven assets had strengthened in

reflection of these heightened uncertainties.

Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that, with the trend of decline in

exports stemming from the contraction in global trade continuing, facilities and construction

investment had continued to undergo adjustments. Members voiced concerns that, as household and

business sentiments were contracting, growth in private consumption showed signs of weakening.

Members judged that the downside risks to the future growth path had increased in light of these

domestic and international conditions.

Concerning inflation, members saw that consumer price inflation had remained low at around

the mid-to-upper 0% range, as supply-side factors had acted as downward pressures and

demand-side inflationary pressures had weakened. With demand-side inflationary pressures remaining

low, members forecast consumer price inflation to decline further, influenced by the base effect of

sharp price increases for some items last year, but then to gradually rise to the 1% range.

Finally, as to the domestic financial markets, members saw that volatility had increased greatly

with long-term interest rates falling significantly and the stock market slumping. Members also saw

that household debt had been continuing to show much slower growth in the first half of 2019.

Given that apartment prices were shifting to increases in some areas and the slowdown in

household lending was gradually moderating, however, members judged that continued attention

should be paid to the risk of financial imbalances. Meanwhile, members’ assessment was that, in

the foreign exchange markets, the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate had risen considerably and

exchange rate volatility had increased, but external soundness indicators remained favorable.

Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

```
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea

Base Rate were as follows:

The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and

international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at

its current level of 1.50% for the intermeeting period, while two members called for a 0.25

percentage point cut.

One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current

1.50% level at this meeting.

The member saw that, as trade disputes had escalated and political uncertainties had heightened

since the previous MPB meeting, volatility in the global financial markets had increased and the

trend of low growth had become further entrenched. The member noted that uncertainties

surrounding service industries, which are assessed to have been drivers of employment and

consumption in major countries, looked to have increased, due to ongoing sluggishness in the IT

sector and the continued scaling down of manufacturing production.

The member’s assessment was that major countries were responding to this situation with

accommodative monetary policies, and these policy responses were inevitable from the perspective of

inflation targeting. The member, however, noted that even some central bankers had raised doubts

about whether such responses could be fundamental solutions to the current problems. The member

pointed out that, given that political uncertainties and the structural weakening of the virtuous circle

of income and investment caused the demand slump, there was uncertainty as to the extent of

macroeconomic policy responses that should be taken and to the amount of costs that would be

incurred as a result. The member explained that these doubts had been raised because accumulated

financial imbalances may have already been expanded due to interest rates, which should play the

most important role in resource allocation, remaining low for a long period.

The member assessed that growth had weakened in Korea as well, due to a combination of

structural problems and global issues. The member saw that economic growth was below its

potential level, due to a re-correction in the real estate market and a delay in the recovery of IT

industry activity. The member noted that inflation remained low in reflection of these domestic and

international conditions, and price indices showing demand-side pressures remained flat in the

upper-1% range. Although expected inflation had declined slightly in August, as in July, the

member expressed the view that for the time being it was necessary to monitor what impacts the

recent rate cut and expansionary fiscal policy would have on expected inflation in the future.

Taking the following points into consideration, the member expressed the view that it seemed

3


-----

proper for the Korean economy to use an expansionary macroeconomic policy mix with a focus

placed on fiscal policy. The member first saw that sluggish demand was attributable to structural

factors. The member commented that, in a situation in which resources are not allocated flexibly

due to a number of structural factors, or in which corporate debt ratios are already high owing to

prolonged and continued low interest rates, a fiscal policy that selectively supports vulnerable groups

could be more efficient. Next, the member pointed out that the possibility of capital becoming

concentrated in the real estate market was still high. The member noted that fiscal policy is more

effective in stimulating demand while reining in financial imbalances. Last, the member presented

the opinion that stimulation of demand through fiscal policy could contribute more to a reduction in

exchange rate volatility than that through monetary policy. The member saw that the won was

seeking a new equilibrium in reflection of several downside risks to the Korean economy, and as

the won was in sync with the yuan, volatility had expanded.

The member meanwhile assessed that, when making a simple comparison among major OECD

countries with respect to the combined effects on GDP growth of fiscal stimulus for this year and

of recent policy rate changes, Korea was implementing the most expansionary macroeconomic

policy. The member judged this policy stance to be appropriate for the moment, but emphasized

that close attention should be paid to the possibility that the US-China trade dispute and Japan’s

export regulations could be prolonged or further expand. Finally, the member emphasized that not

only large-scale fiscal expansion but also efficient targeting of expenditure sectors were essential to

ensure the efficiency of such a policy mix. The member added that it was urgent to strongly

implement mid- to long-term reforms for more fundamental structural problems, thus securing

national competitiveness and seeking the creation of value added in new areas.

Another member stated that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate from the current

1.50% to 1.25% to secure a buffer against the trend of sluggish demand in the private sector.

The member diagnosed that the Korean economy was in a considerable slump. The member

saw that exports were continuing to decline significantly, due to a correction in semiconductor

activity and to a contraction in international trade stemming from the US-China trade dispute. The

member’s assessment was that this was working to cause a decrease in facilities investment through

a slump in the manufacturing sector. The member also judged that, while construction investment

had not been showing any sign of breaking out of its current correction, private consumption

growth had been slowing of late. The member’s assessment was that demand in the private sector

had stagnated overall, and weak growth dependent entirely on expansionary fiscal policy was

continuing.

The member mentioned that inflation was declining in reflection of shrinking aggregate demand.

The member saw that consumer price inflation ran at 0.6% in the first half of this year and could

decline to around 0% in the second half, albeit temporarily. The member’s assessment was that

4


-----

underlying price inflation with temporary factors excluded had remained at around 1% recently, far

below the target. The member expressed the opinion that, given recent economic conditions, it was

difficult to see what could be a force driving up inflation in the near future.

The member voiced concern that changes in the domestic and international economic

environments had been worsening further since the last MPB meeting. The member’s assessment

was that downside risks to the Korean economy had heightened further due to an escalation of the

US-China trade dispute, rising tensions with Japan, and emerging concerns about the US economy,

which had maintained solid growth. The member also expressed the view that fiscal policy alone

would have limited capacity to sustain growth without any medium-term recovery in private-sector

demand, as tax revenue growth stagnated in line with the economic decline. The member diagnosed

that, given recent economic conditions, growth for this year could run below 2% and it was

difficult to be optimistic about economic recovery for next year.

Accordingly, the member took the view that it was desirable to cut the Base Rate from the

current 1.50% to 1.25% to secure a buffer against the trend of sluggish demand in the private

sector. The member saw that, judging the monetary policy stance using standard methodology, the

1.25% level of Base Rate could not be assessed to be low under recent macroeconomic conditions,

and the expected benefits from deferring the necessary policy adjustment were unclear. Meanwhile,

the member added that securing economic recovery in the medium- to long-term would require not

only short-term macroeconomic policy but also strengthened policy efforts to enhance

competitiveness in the private sector.

One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its

current level at this meeting.

The member noted that there had even been some concerns about a global recession due to the

continuation of slower growth in the world economy. The member assessed domestic growth to be

weakening in sync with such global economic conditions. The member saw that, given the Korean

economy’s high economic openness and its heavy dependence on exports, a deterioration in external

conditions could have greater impacts, which seemed to have been reflected in the fact that Korea

had recently seen a larger decline in stock prices and more severe currency depreciation than major

countries.

The member judged slower global growth to be mainly attributable to so-called slowbalization,

or the slowing of globalization. The member’s assessment was that decades of progress in

globalization, while having generated substantial negative side effects, had also greatly contributed to

sustained growth in the world economy based on the international division of labor according to

comparative advantages and on the free movement of goods, services, capital, technologies and

labor. The member, however, noted that, the recent slowbalization was heightening concern that

economic prosperity backed by expanded international trade and market opening could be reversed.

5


-----

The member saw that slower growth in the world economy looked to be inevitable for some time,

due to contractions in trade and investment. The member voiced concern about the possibility of a

negative feedback loop whereby the consequent deteriorated financial and real economic indicators

and dampened household and corporate sentiments would affect consumption and investment.

The member expressed the opinion that monetary and fiscal policies should be expansionary to

mitigate the negative impacts of external shocks. The member, however, added that, if the global

supply chain weakened further and the movements of goods and production factors were constrained

further—in other words, if a structural supply shock occurred—macroeconomic policies for adjusting

aggregate demand would not be a fundamental solution.

The member noted that it was necessary to respond to the contraction in consumer and

investment sentiments by operating accommodative monetary policy to cope with slower growth,

although monetary policy would not be a fundamental solution. The member commented that the

Base Rate had been lowered at the last MPB meeting from this perspective. The member saw that

it was desirable to maintain the Base Rate at its current level at this meeting, since it was

necessary to give balanced consideration to the burden on the financial stability side, including the

following issues: the recent faster growth in banks’ household lending; the shift to an increase in

apartment prices and increased expectations for higher apartment prices, particularly in Seoul; and

the expanded volatility of global capital flows.

One member, meanwhile, presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate

at 1.50% at this time.

The member’s assessment was that, since the previous meeting, trade conflicts between major

countries and geopolitical risks had been growing and the growth momentum for the global

economy had continued to soften. The member evaluated that, although growth had been slowing

relatively gradually, this decline in the growth rate had been seen mostly in the manufacturing and

investment sectors that are closely related to global trade and the Korean economy, and went on to

express concerns that global manufacturing and investment were not highly likely to show

meaningful improvement in the second half of this year. Most importantly, the member mentioned

that attention should be paid to the contraction of corporate sentiment amid the extremely unstable

policy environment that would affect performance of the tradables sector. The member assessed that

the US and other countries with favorable external soundness had been implementing accommodative

monetary policies and some of them had been undergoing fiscal expansion, but the recent

strengthening of the flight to quality in the financial markets was limiting the transmission channels

of these policies. The member went on to argue that uncertainty surrounding the future growth path

remained high in this regard.

The member assessed that the domestic economy had maintained weak growth due to a

combination of structural and cyclical factors. The member evaluated that the significant rebound in

6


-----

the real GDP growth rate during the second quarter had been attributable mostly to increased

government spending while the contribution of the private sector had decreased, and that in this

respect, the rebound in real GDP could not been seen as an encouraging result for the growth

outlook for the second half. The member noted that recent monthly indicators suggested that

corporate and consumer sentiment had been weakening, investment had continued to go through a

correction and private consumption had been growing at a somewhat slower pace. Concerning

exports, the member stated that the decline in the export volume had slowed somewhat entering the

third quarter, but due to growing uncertainties surrounding external conditions, exports would remain

sluggish for the time being, with their volatility increasing significantly. The member assessed that

there was a growing possibility of the future growth path falling below the July forecast, especially

in line with the escalation of the US-China trade dispute and the strengthening of Japan’s export

restrictions, and added that this could weaken demand-side inflation pressures and act as a factor

increasing the time needed for consumer price inflation to get back to the target level.

Meanwhile, the member mentioned that the spread of global risk-off sentiment had increased

financial market volatility significantly, and the policy implications of the rising won-dollar exchange

rate could be examined from various perspectives. The member took the view that, as the

depreciation of a country’s currency has a significant impact on its export competitiveness and

inflation in both theoretical and empirical terms, the won’s depreciation during a phase of economic

slowdown could work to partly ease the downside risks to the economy and inflation. On the other

hand, however, the member noted that there had been many instances during times of insufficient

external soundness when the won depreciated rapidly following external shocks, resulting in financial

instability and economic welfare loss. The member assessed Korea’s external soundness as currently

being substantially favorable, but considering that the current account surplus had been decreasing

gradually and the external debt ratio had been showing a modest increase, the member emphasized

that it would be necessary to pay keen attention to and monitor various indicators related to

external soundness.

In overall consideration of the above, the member judged that growing financial market

volatility and uncertainties surrounding domestic and overseas economic conditions had substantially

increased the possibility of a realization of the downside risks to growth and inflation that were of

concern in the July forecast. However, given that a certain degree of downside risk had already

been taken into consideration in the course of making a rate-cut decision at the previous meeting,

that the effect of a Base Rate cut spreads with a time lag, that expansionary fiscal policy had been

adopted for counter-cyclical purposes, and that the slowdown in the growth rate had been

attributable in part to structural factors, the member expressed the view that it would be desirable

to keep the Base Rate at 1.50% at the present meeting while taking more time to examine whether

the current policy mix would effectively serve as a buffer against downside risks to the

medium-term growth and inflation paths.

-----

Another member took the view that an adjustment to the Base Rate policy was needed to keep

up with changes in economic conditions, and in this regard it would be desirable to lower the Base

Rate to 1.25% at this meeting.

The member assessed that the domestic and external environments had deteriorated since the

previous meeting. On the external side, the member noted that, while the continued slowdown in

global trade had been negatively affecting major countries’ real economies, uncertainties involving

the US-China trade dispute and other existing risk factors had been growing and new geopolitical

risk factors including protests in Hong Kong had emerged. In this regard, the member pointed out

there were growing concerns that the global economy would continue to slow or fall into an even

worse slump, unlike the original expectation that the economy would recover in the second half of

this year. The member also judged that the longer-than-expected sluggishness of global trade and

the consequent global economic slowdown, combined with geopolitical factors, had recently been

affecting economic sentiment negatively. The member’s evaluation was that capital in advanced

market countries was shifting from stock to bond markets, and emerging market countries were

seeing their financial asset prices falling and exchange rates showing greater volatility due to capital

outflows, suggesting the strengthening of a flight to quality in the international financial markets.

The member assessed that, as the global economic environment had been deteriorating more

than expected, Korea’s export slump had been worsening somewhat, and facilities investment, which

is closely related to exports, had also remained lackluster. The member also expressed concerns that

private consumption, having increased gradually in the first half, was exhibiting signs of

slower-than-expected growth in the second half. The member evaluated that the continued strong

growth in nominal wages was a positive factor, but it seemed to be having only limited effects on

improvement in consumer sentiment as well as income conditions of households as a whole. In

comprehensive consideration of these trends, the member assessed that there were increasing

downside risks to the Research Department’s July growth forecast of 2.2% for this year.

The member noted that inflation had remained very low, and from a long-term perspective, it

had remained below the target of 2% since 2013. The member also assessed that, since the

beginning of this year in particular, core inflation and consumer price inflation had both remained

within the 0% range, entering a new phase of sluggishness. The member expressed concerns that

inflation was increasingly likely to remain weak next year as well, due to the growing likelihood

that Korea’s economic slump would be prolonged. The member stressed that it would be necessary

to take aggressive measures to manage inflation expectations, considering that sustained low inflation

could lead to a decline in inflation expectations. More specifically, the member expressed the view

that, aside from adjusting the Base Rate, which is the central bank’s direct monetary policy

instrument, more aggressive communication policy instruments, such as the forward guidance

introduced by major central banks facing similar problems, should be explored and their use should

be considered.

-----

The member assessed that, despite the recent increase in international financial market unrest,

the trends of CDS premiums and other indicators pointed to the strength of Korea’s international

credit standing. The member’s evaluation was that the won’s depreciation reflected mainly changes

in the macroeconomic conditions at home and abroad and was not serious enough to raise concerns

about a fall in Korea’s international credit standing. The member added that flexible fluctuations in

the exchange rate would be necessary for nominal macroeconomic variables to return to normal in

an economy where interest rate policy is implemented under an inflation targeting regime.

Meanwhile, the member argued that, in cases where underlying inflation pressures had built up with

respect to items for which prices are administered, which account for a substantial part of Korea’s

consumer prices, it would be desirable in terms of stable macroeconomic management to actively

consider reflecting these factors in price-setting policy.

In summary, the member judged that the economy and inflation had remained sluggish, in line

with the worsening of economic conditions led by the global trade slowdown, and assessed

downside risks as having increased somewhat compared with the July forecast path. The member

expressed the opinion that the Base Rate policy should be adjusted to keep up with changes in

economic conditions, and that it would be appropriate to lower the Base Rate to 1.25% in this

regard.

One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its

current 1.50% level at this meeting and take more time to observe real economic conditions as well

as domestic and overseas financial market trends.

The member assessed that uncertainties in global economy had been increasing, affected largely

by the US-China trade dispute. The member noted that US consumption and employment indicators

had been exhibiting favorable movements, while the Chinese economic slowdown had been

becoming evident. The member expressed concerns that the prolongation of the US-China trade

dispute could have negative spillover effects on the Korean and global economies. Moreover, the

member noted that various geopolitical risk factors were spreading simultaneously and stressed the

need to closely monitor these developments.

The member mentioned that, in line with the sluggishness of the global economy and trade,

Korea’s facilities and construction investment as well as exports had continued to go through

corrections. The member judged that the situation concerning private consumption, having exhibited

modest growth, had worsened with retail sales declining for the second consecutive month, and

added that private consumption growth was highly likely to fall below the previous forecast in this

regard. The member also noted that, amid the sustained sluggishness of semiconductor exports and

China-bound exports, there were some concerns about the possibility of facilities investment,

previously expected to rebound from the second half, remaining lackluster until the year-end. The

member also expressed concerns that the worsening Korea-Japan conflict, along with the US-China

9


-----

trade dispute, would add to downside risks to growth. The member argued that, although

employment had been showing improvement due mainly to a base-period effect, it was a little too

early to be optimistic about employment, as it had continued to worsen in the manufacturing sector.

The member forecast that inflation could be even lower than the July forecast in the second

half. The member mentioned that this would be affected by supply-side factors, such as the

stabilization of agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices, but the fact that core inflation

was also running within the 0% range was worrisome. The member expressed the view that it

would be necessary to maintain accommodative monetary policy given that downside risks to the

consumer price inflation forecast had been increasing amid growing uncertainties concerning the

domestic economy in line with global economic instability.

The member judged that, in the domestic financial markets, long-term interest rates had declined

significantly, reflecting expectations of an economic slowdown, and the stock market had also been

sluggish. Concerning household debt, the member noted that growth in household debt had slowed

greatly in the first half, affected largely by strong government measures. The member added,

however, that attention should be paid to fact that household debt had generally increased at a

faster pace in the second half and went on to argue that continuous monitoring was needed of

growing household debt in line with increasing real estate transactions resulting from recent real

estate price rises in some regions.

With regard to the international financial markets, the member mentioned that various opinions

had been suggested regarding the possibility of additional rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, and

with the US Treasury yield curve having inverted, there had been a keen interest in how the Fed

saw the US economy and in which direction it would operate monetary policy. The member

emphasized that developments related to the Fed’s monetary policy should be monitored closely

given their significant impacts on Korea’s financial markets, while attention should be devoted to

making sure that foreign exchange market volatility would not increase excessively.

The member set out the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and external

economic conditions mentioned above, it would be advisable to keep the Base Rate at its current

level of 1.50% at the present meeting and take more time to monitor real economic conditions and

financial market developments at home and abroad.

Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

```
Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision

statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.

However, Dr. Cho, Dongchul and Dr. Shin, Inseok expressed clear opposition to keeping the

Base Rate at its current level and argued for cutting it by 0.25 percentage points.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

`□` The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate

unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.

`□` Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic

growth has slowed as trade has contracted. Volatility in the global financial markets has

increased. Government bond yields and stock prices in major countries have fallen significantly

in line mainly with the US-China trade dispute and concerns about the consequent global

economic slowdown. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global

financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade

protectionism, the changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and geopolitical risks.

`□` The Board judges that the pace of domestic economic growth has remained slow, as

consumption growth has weakened, while the adjustment in construction investment and the

sluggishness in exports and facilities investment have continued. Employment conditions have

partially improved, with the increase in the number of persons employed having risen. With

respect to future domestic economic growth, the Board judges that the uncertainties concerning

the growth path forecast have further increased, owing chiefly to the escalation of the US-China

trade dispute and the heightened geopolitical risks.

`□` Consumer price inflation has slowed to the mid-0% range, in consequence mainly of the

declines in the prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.

Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the

upper-0% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been at the 2%

level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fluctuate for some time at

the lower-0% level as downside risks to the path projected in July have increased, and then run

11


-----

at the low- to mid-1% level from next year. Core inflation will also gradually rise.

`□` The high volatility of price variables in the domestic financial markets has continued, in line

mainly with concerns about the US-China trade dispute, geopolitical risks, and the consequent

economic slowdowns at home and abroad. Long-term market interest rates and stock prices have

fallen significantly, while the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has risen considerably. The

slowdown in household lending growth has weakened somewhat, while housing prices have

continued their downtrend but have risen in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas.

`□` Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of

economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level

over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is expected that

domestic economic growth will be moderate and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the

demand side will remain at a low level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary

policy stance. In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy

accommodation, while closely examining any changes in macroeconomic and financial stability

conditions. It will also carefully monitor the US-China trade dispute, any changes in the

economies and monetary policies of major countries, the trend of increase in household debt,

and geopolitical risks.
