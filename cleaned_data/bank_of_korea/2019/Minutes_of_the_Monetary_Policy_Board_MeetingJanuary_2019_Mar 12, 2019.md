##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation

###### After briefings by staff on “Economic Outlook for 2019[2)],” “FX and

 International Finance Trends,” and “Financial Market Trends,” the

 discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the

 following areas:

 Members evaluated that there were growing concerns about downside

 risks to the global economy, particularly with respect to the euro area and

 Chinese economies. As for the global financial markets, members mentioned

 that volatility of major price variables such as stock prices and exchange

 rates had seen sharp increase in December last year, but had been

 generally stable since the beginning of this year in line chiefly with

 changing expectations about the US-China trade negotiations and the pace

 of the US Federal Reserve’s rate hikes.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that the

 domestic economy had sustained growth centering around exports and

 consumption, while facilities and construction investment had continued to

 undergo corrections. The members forecast the domestic economy to grow

 by 2.6 percent this year and next, with the contribution of fiscal

 expenditure to growth likely to increase, and mentioned that uncertainties

 surrounding the future growth path were high, due mainly to changes in

 monetary and trade policies―particularly in the US―and concerns about a

 possible Chinese economic slowdown.

 Concerning inflation, members forecast consumer price inflation at 1.4

 percent for this year and 1.6 percent for next year, in reflection of

 supply-side factors such as the decline in international oil prices and 

 increased downward pressures on administered prices in line with the

 government’s strengthening of its welfare policy, amid small demand-side

###### inflation pressures.

 As to the domestic financial markets, members assessed that the

 volatility in the stock market had expanded in December last year but

 then stabilized overall this year, and capital flows and the won-dollar rate

 had also shown stability. Members pointed out that household debt growth

 was slowing gradually but continued to outpace income growth, and thus

 it would be necessary to remain vigilant.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a

 change in Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would

 be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.75 percent for

 the intermeeting period.

 One member stated that there had been no significant changes in

 domestic economic trends since the previous MPB meeting, concerns remained

 about the possibility of financial imbalances accumulating, and uncertainties

 surrounding domestic and external conditions were high, and therefore it

 would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.75 percent

 at this meeting and closely examine future developments.

 The member noted that the growth and inflation forecasts had been

 adjusted downward, but judged that there had been no major changes to

 the overall macroeconomic trends, as the growth rate was unlikely to

 deviate far from its potential level and the inflation forecast was being

 affected chiefly by supply-side factors and the strengthening of welfare

 policy. The member mentioned, however, that uncertainties surrounding the

 future growth path remained high, considering various domestic and

 external factors including US-led changes in monetary and trade policies,

 the slowdown in Chinese economic growth, political risks in major

 countries, sluggish domestic employment, and the contraction of

 private-sector economic sentiment.

 The member assessed that domestic and overseas financial markets had

 seen sharp increases in major price variable volatility in December last

 year, but had been generally stable since the beginning of this year in line

 chiefly with changing expectations about the US-China trade negotiations

 and the pace of the US Federal Reserve’s rate hikes.

###### In terms of financial stability, the member took the view that

 household debt growth would likely continue to slow this year, affected

 largely by stronger regulations, housing market sluggishness, and the

 previous Base Rate hike. The member added, however, that it would be

 necessary to remain cautious about the possibility of financial imbalances

 accumulating due to rising household debt, as demand for leasehold deposit

 loans and collective loans would likely be strong, owing mainly to a rise in

 the number of move-in ready apartments.

 In conclusion, the member expressed the view that it would be

 appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.75 percent at

 this meeting and keep an eye on future developments, and went on to

 argue that it would be desirable to carefully decide whether to further

 adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation after comprehensively 

 evaluating economic growth and inflation trends as well as changes in

 financial stability risks, based on economic indicators.

 Another member took the view that it would be desirable to keep the

 Base Rate unchanged from its current level of 1.75 percent at this meeting,

 while keeping a close watch on real economic developments, the household

 lending trend, and international financial market developments.

 The member assessed that economic agents’ concerns had increased

 significantly due to the sustained policy uncertainties in major countries and

 the increased financial market volatility since the previous MPB meeting, and

 judged that, although this could cause domestic and global economies to slow

 further, there remained only a limited possibility of growth rate adjustments

 leading to a full-fledged downturn in the near future. The member noted that

 attention should be paid to the favorable growth sustained in advanced

 countries, based on improvements in employment conditions, and to expanded

 stimulus measures, particularly in EMEs with relatively favorable external

 soundness. Furthermore, the member noted positively that risk aversion had

 somewhat eased with anxiety about the pace of the US Federal Reserve’s rate

 hikes having been substantially reduced recently and US-China trade

###### negotiations having resumed. On the other hand, the member pointed out that

 if uncertainties involving the US-China trade negotiations, the US government

 shutdown, and Brexit continued for a longer period of time, they could act as

 additional downside risks to the growth path.

 Looking at the domestic economy, the member mentioned that there

 were significant uncertainties surrounding the medium- and long-term

 growth forecasts, as the global economic slowdown had been concentrated

 in regions and sectors where Korean exports are highly dependent on,

 while various changes had been made to domestic microeconomic policy.

 However, the member assessed the degree of adjustment in exports as

 somewhat excessive, since the recent plunge in customs-cleared exports

 had been attributable mainly to technical factors, including declines in

 export unit prices affected by semiconductor and oil prices and the

 impacts of export volume adjustments prior to tariff hikes in major

 countries. The member added that a more accommodative fiscal policy

 would be underway this year, enhancing the contribution of fiscal

 expenditure to growth.

 The member forecast that consumer price inflation might run below the

 current level for some time, affected by international oil prices and

 administered prices, but is likely to rebound to near the mid- to upper-1

 percent level in the medium term, considering movements of prices of items

 less affected by one-off and policy factors and given the Bank of Korea

 Research Department’s forecast that Korea’s economic growth would not

 diverge significantly from its potential level this year.

 With regard to financial stability, the member took the view that the

 current slowing trend, albeit slight, of household debt growth would likely

 continue, as the effects of strengthened micro-level regulations had started

 to materialize and were combined with the effects of the reduction in the

 degree of monetary easing, but continued vigilance would be necessary as

 household debt growth had continued to outpace income growth and

 demand for household loans was likely to be substantial amid a rise in the

6

###### number of move-in ready apartments. As to financial markets, meanwhile, the

 member evaluated that, although stock price volatility had increased

 immensely, capital flows and the won-dollar exchange rate had been relatively

 stable, boosted by favorable external soundness indicators, and went on to

 mention that the possibility of greater financial market volatility should be

 closely monitored in consideration of high uncertainties concerning policies in

 major countries.

 In overall consideration of the factors mentioned above, the member

 judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level

 at this meeting and take more time to observe economic and inflation trends

 and global financial market conditions.

 One other member noted that, while the outlook for economic growth

 this year had been revised slightly downward, there had been some positive

 changes on the financial stability side. The member thus took the view that it

 would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current 1.75 percent level at

 the current meeting, while closely monitoring changes in US monetary policy

 and economic conditions, as well as trends in the domestic real economy.

 With respect to the global economy, the member evaluated that it was

 still showing growth at the level of the potential growth rate, despite

 increasing concerns about downside risks since the October forecast last

 year. The member added that, despite these real economic conditions, the

 financial markets seemed to have responded quite sensitively in December.

 As for the US economy, the member noted that the real economy was

 showing sound growth, despite sluggish survey indicators, and stated that

 it was important to assess US economic conditions and analyze financial

 market trends. The member also saw the need for close monitoring of the

 European economy, which had been somewhat sluggish, and of the

 Chinese economy, whose growth was expected to slow, adding that

 attention should be paid to international oil prices and global trade flows.

 Looking at the domestic economy, the member saw that, although private

7


-----

###### consumption had remained relatively stable, adjustments to facilities investment

 and construction investment had continued, and growth in exports was

 forecast to be slower this year than last year. The member expected an

 upturn in the semiconductor industry from the second half of this year, and

 anticipated that the shipbuilding sector, which had partially started to recover,

 would supplement exports and investment, albeit to a limited extent. The

 member predicted that employment conditions would be better than last year,

 but the pace of recovery would be moderate. As difficulties in some

 industries were highly likely to continue despite government policies, the

 member noted that close monitoring should continue. 

 The member assessed that, in light of the economic outlook presented by

 Bank of Korea’s Research Department, the GDP gap was estimated to remain

 slightly negative. The member noted that the ongoing decline in economic

 indicators and the weakness in sentiment indicators would weigh on the future

 Korean economy. The member, however, expressed the opinion that the

 government sector was expected to compensate somewhat for the weakening

 of economic growth this year, just like last year. The member also stated the

 view that the accommodative monetary policy stance should be maintained, as

 demand-side inflationary pressures seemed likely to be mild in the future as

 well.

 With respect to financial stability, the member assessed that there had

 been some positive changes, such as somewhat diminished stock market

 volatility and slowing household debt growth, influenced for instance by

 suggestions that the US Federal Reserve would adjust the pace of its policy

 rate hikes. The member, however, expressed the view that the effects of

 government measures should be examined and the relevant developments

 should be monitored, since household debt growth still exceeded household

 income growth.

 Last, the member noted that a prolongation or widening of the

 inversion of the US and Korean policy rates could add to market volatility

 in the long run, and therefore it was necessary to constantly examine the

8


-----

###### US Federal Reserve’s movements toward monetary policy normalization as

 well.

 In overall consideration of the factors mentioned above, the member

 judged that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the

 current 1.75 percent level, while reviewing developments in the real economy

 and financial stability conditions.

  One member noted that the accommodative monetary policy stance should

 be maintained due to weak inflationary pressures, and the financial imbalances

 that had been built up should be dealt with. The member thus presented the

 view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the

 current 1.75 percent at the current meeting, while continuing to examine the

 appropriateness of the monetary policy stance.

 With respect to the global economy, the member judged that it had

 temporarily rebounded, led by the US economy, but had then approached

 its potential rate of growth, which was somewhat weaker than in the past

 due to various structural issues. The member saw a heightened possibility

 that global economic growth could weaken, as the scope for

 macroeconomic policy adjustment in EMEs had narrowed and global trade

 growth had slowed in the course of US monetary policy normalization.

 The member, however, assessed that financial markets had remained stable

 overall and global dollar liquidity conditions had remained favorable.

 The member saw that Korea’s economic growth was gradually

 approaching its potential level, as real estate-related construction investment

 and IT-related facilities investment had undergone adjustments after showing

 strong growth for the past years. The member commented that the potential

 growth rate was judged to have declined to the mid-2 percent range or

 slightly above due to structural problems at home and abroad, including a

 decrease in the working-age population. The member noted that the Korean

 economy was sustaining a trend of growth led by exports and consumption,

 despite huge investment adjustments. The member saw that exports were

 maintaining strong competitiveness, thanks to some industries such as the IT

###### sector. The member also commented that private consumption was maintaining

 relatively solid growth, boosted by ongoing income improvements and

 increased government transfer payments and welfare spending, although

 sentiment indicators had been sluggish. The member went on to explain that

 fiscal policy had positively affected private consumption and growth by

 strengthening redistribution, although the government had shifted to a

 tightening stance as tax revenues grew faster than fiscal spending in 2018.

 Looking at prices, the member noted that the sticky price index and

 inflation with food and energy product prices excluded stood at the lower-2

 percent range and the mid-1 percent range respectively, both with

 administered items excluded, which was a better indicator of demand

 pressures than the CPI. On the other hand, the member added that core

 inflation was only in the lower-1 percent range due to sluggishness in

 administered items, leasehold deposits, monthly rental payments, and industrial

 products. The member expected core inflation to remain flat in the lower- to

 mid-1 percent range, due to weak demand-side pressures, slower growth in

 housing rents, and low rises in the export and import prices of global

 industrial products and in public service prices.

 Meanwhile, the member assessed that the accumulation of financial

 imbalances had been easing, as the government’s various regulatory policy

 measures had led to slower growth in real estate-related lending and a trend

 of decline in housing prices. The member, however, expressed the need for

 keeping a close eye on the accumulation of financial imbalances, as the

 over-concentration of capital in the real estate sector was continuing through

 sole proprietor loans, and the demand for loans was likely to continue to

 some extent because this year’s supply of new housing was expected to be

 higher than in past years. The member noted that the process of resolving

 accumulated financial imbalances could weigh on growth in the short term,

 but this would lay a foundation to further consolidate Korea’s economic

 fundamentals over the medium-term horizon.

 The member noted that inflationary pressures were forecast to remain

10


-----

###### at their current (albeit weak) level, but it would likely be difficult for

 domestic demand pressures to offset exogenous downward pressures on

 prices and bring inflation up to its target. The member thus found it

 necessary to maintain the current accommodative stance. On the other

 hand, the member noted that there was a possibility of a widening of

 financial imbalances, and there was also a need for a gradual resolution of

 imbalances accumulated thus far. The member thus found it desirable to

 keep the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75 percent at this meeting, while

 keeping a close watch on economic conditions in the future and assessing

 the appropriateness of the current monetary policy stance.

 Another member took the view that it would be desirable to keep the

 Base Rate at its current level while closely examining future macroeconomic

 trends, given that growth momentum in the private sector was weak and

 prices remained low.

 The member stated that real GDP growth stood at 2.7 percent last year,

 but nominal GDP growth, an indicator of the actual national income, was

 estimated to be only around 3 percent, the lowest since the Asian Financial

 Crisis. The member thus judged the degree of actual value added in the

 economy to be very low. The member added that, by sector, government

 income growth was estimated to greatly exceed 3 percent, while that in the

 corporate sector was significantly lower than 3 percent. The member’s

 assessment was that the government’s direct consumption had surged and

 private consumption had also maintained its trend of growth, led by health

 care and social welfare services where fiscal support had been expanding. The

 member, however, judged that business conditions had been sluggish in the

 areas of the private sector not directly linked with fiscal support, and with

 respect to the labor market as well there was little meaningful employment

 growth to be found in the private service sector apart from health care and

 social welfare.

 The member presented the view that growth in the private sector was

 unlikely to gain further momentum in the short term in view of the

11


-----

###### economic conditions at home and abroad. The member noted that the

 more moderate expansion of the world economy, particularly in Europe

 and China, had led to a gradual slowdown of the export growth that had

 been contributing greatly to the domestic expansion for a year, while

 investment-related indicators did not suggest the possibility of an

 investment recovery in the short term. The member, however, commented

 that the large contribution of fiscal spending to growth was highly likely

 to continue in view of the government’s plan for active fiscal policy.

 The member noted that core inflation had remained weak in the

 lower-1 percent range for over a year, and even when prices of

 administered items were excluded, the inflation estimate stood in the mid-1

 percent range. The member’s assessment was that overall consumer price

 inflation was converging to the level of core inflation in the lower- to

 mid-1 percent range, as one-off factors were diminishing. Considering

 recent employment and economic conditions, the member saw little

 likelihood of a rapid acceleration of core inflation in the short term, and

 expected overall consumer prices to fluctuate at around the level of core

 inflation.

 The member took the view that, given the aforementioned environment, it

 would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level, while keeping

 a close watch on the direction of macroeconomic changes in the future. The

 member also presented the view that it was necessary to assess the degree to

 which active fiscal policy would compensate for the lack of private demand,

 whether self-driven recovery momentum in the private sector would

 materialize, and whether aggregate demand from the private and government

 sectors would expand to the extent that low price inflation would converge

 toward its target.

 One other member presented the view that it would be appropriate to

 keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level at the present meeting,

 as the impacts of negative external conditions such as slower real indicators

 in China were gradually appearing in the Korean economy, and inflationary

12


-----

###### pressures remained weak.

 Concerning the recent state of Korea’s real economy, the member’s

 assessment was that, with negative developments in the external

 environment continuing, the trend of domestic growth was also weakening

 somewhat, with recovery in private consumption slowing. On the

 international front, the member noted that US real indicators were

 generally showing favorable movements, but unrest had increased greatly,

 especially in financial markets. The member also commented that the euro

 area had witnessed a trend of slower growth, while China had seen

 significant deterioration in all real economic indicators for the past two

 months. The member took the view in particular that the shift to a decline

 in Chinese exports last December had been working to increase downside

 risks to the growth paths of the world economy and trade.

 The member noted that, in line with developments in the external

 environment, Korean exports had shown favorable movements until October

 last year but then saw slower growth in November on a customs clearance

 basis and shifted to a decline in December, showing a pattern similar to

 exports in China. The member commented that the recent large declines in

 prices of semiconductors and petrochemical products, Korea’s two main

 export items, had created a gap between the export value on a customs

 clearance basis and the export volume. The member expressed the opinion

 that the decrease in the contribution of exports to real growth would be

 smaller than the decrease in export value but still considerable.

 Looking at domestic demand, the member noted that private

 consumption had shown 2.8 percent growth last year, stronger than GDP

 growth. The member went on to mention that consumption growth had

 exceeded GDP growth for the first time since 2010. The member saw that

 as the trend of decline in the household propensity to consume had ended

 in 2017, household consumption growth had technically rebounded, but the

 propensity to consume had failed to return to past levels. The member

 thus took the view that there was uncertainty as to whether private

13


-----

###### consumption growth, which had been robust for the past year, would

 remain high.

 The member expressed the opinion that, given the recent developments in

 the world economy and real indicators related to domestic demand, the

 adjusted forecast prepared by Bank of Korea’s Research Department seemed

 to have some degree of downside risk. The member, however, noted that the

 ongoing strong growth in government spending since last year could serve as

 a substantial buffer against slower growth in aggregate demand in the private

 sector.

 Concerning prices, the member argued that, in view of slower growth

 in the real economy, it would be difficult to expect inflationary pressures

 to rise this year as well. The member went on to express the view that

 the Research Department’s adjusted forecasts, revised downward to 1.4

 percent for both core inflation and CPI this year, were more consistent

 with actual price conditions.

 The member noted that, taking these points into overall consideration,

 there were great uncertainties surrounding the external environment, real

 economic growth was slowing somewhat, and inflation remained low. The

 member thus took the view that it was appropriate to hold the Base Rate

 at its current level at this meeting.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following

 Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled and was approved

 unanimously by the members.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

###### leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period.

- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the

###### pace of global economic growth has slowed somewhat. The volatilities

 in the global financial markets, which had previously expanded, have

 diminished slightly this year, in line mainly with the possibility of the

 US Federal Reserve adjusting the pace of its rate hikes and with

 expectations of progress in the US-China trade negotiations. Looking

 ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial

 markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the

 spread of trade protectionism, the paces of monetary policy

 normalization in major countries, and the uncertainties concerning

 Brexit.

- The Board judges that the domestic economy has sustained a rate of

###### growth at its potential level generally, as the increases in consumption

 and exports have been sustained, although the adjustments in facilities

 and construction investment have continued. Employment conditions

 have been sluggish, with the amount of increase in the number of

 persons employed having lessened substantially in December. Going

15


-----

###### forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to fall slightly

 short of the path projected in October, but to sustain a rate that does

 not diverge significantly from its potential level thanks to increased

 government expenditures for example.

- Consumer price inflation has slowed to the lower-1% level, in

###### consequence mainly of declines in the prices of petroleum products and

 reductions in the extents of increase in agricultural, livestock and

 fisheries product prices. Core inflation (with food and energy product

 prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the lower-1% level, and the

 rate of inflation expected by the general public has been in the

 mid-2% range. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price

 inflation will fluctuate at the 1% level for some time and then steadily

 increase to the mid-1% level in the second half of this year. Core

 inflation will also gradually rise.

- The domestic financial markets saw increased volatility in December

###### last year, but have been generally stable since the beginning of this

 year. Stock prices had fallen, in line mostly with concerns about the

 global economic slowdown, but have rebounded on expectations of an

 easing of the US-China trade dispute for example. Long-term market

 interest rates, after a decline, have been fluctuating slightly. The Korean

 won-US dollar exchange rate has been generally stable while moving

 within a narrow range. The amount of increase in household lending

 has diminished, while housing prices have continued to slow.

- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure

###### that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price

 inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term

 horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast

 that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the

 time being, and that the domestic economy will sustain a rate of

16


-----

###### growth that does not diverge significantly from its potential level, the

 Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this

 process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy

 accommodation further, while closely checking future economic growth

 and inflation trends. It will also carefully monitor conditions related to

 trade with major countries, any changes in the monetary policies of

 major countries, financial and economic conditions in emerging market

 economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical

 risks.
