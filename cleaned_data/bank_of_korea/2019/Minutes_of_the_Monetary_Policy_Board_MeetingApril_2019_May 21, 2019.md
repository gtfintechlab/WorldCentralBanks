Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation

```
After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook for 2019 (revised),[2)]_ _FX and International_

_Finance Trends, and_ _Financial Market Trends, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB)_

members covered the following areas:

Members evaluated that the pace of global economic growth had continued to slow and that the

rate of global trade growth had declined, affected largely by the US-China trade dispute. As for the

global financial markets, members judged that volatility of price variables, such as interest rates in

major countries, had increased temporarily but then stabilized with risk-off sentiment easing in

accordance chiefly with a reduction in major country policy uncertainties.

Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that private consumption growth

had slowed and exports and facilities investment had been also sluggish, particularly in the

semiconductor and other IT sectors. The members forecast that, although the economic outlook for

this year had been adjusted slightly downward with first-quarter growth more sluggish than

originally expected, the growth momentum would improve going forward as the effects of

expansionary fiscal policy gradually increased and semiconductor demand picked up. Meanwhile,

some of the members took the view that, despite the recent downward adjustment to the economic

outlook, the downside risks seemed to outweigh the upside risks.

Concerning inflation, members saw that consumer price inflation had declined substantially due

to supply-side factors, including the government’s stronger social-welfare policy and declines in the

prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, amid modest

demand-side pressures. However, members expected inflation to show modest growth going forward,

affected largely by increases in some public utility charges. Meanwhile, the majority of members

stressed the importance of the anchoring of inflation expectations, and expressed the view that it

would be necessary to closely analyze the recent low inflation and focus on communication

concerning underlying inflation.

Finally, as to the domestic financial markets, members assessed them to have stabilized overall,

although the volatility of price variables, such as long-term interest rates, had expanded somewhat.

Members also noted that growth in household lending had continued to slow, influenced by

strengthened micro-level regulations and the reduced degree of monetary easing. However, the

majority of members emphasized the need to keep a close watch on financial imbalances, which

remained at a high level.

Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

```
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea

Base Rate were as follows:

Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international

financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current

level of 1.75 percent for the intermeeting period.

One member stated that it would be advisable to keep the Base Rate at its current level and

take time to examine whether the global economy, including the US economy, would rebound,

while also watching the trends of the domestic economy, employment, household debt and the real

estate market.

The member expressed concerns that the global economy had exhibited slower growth than

originally forecast in January and that this trend could continue for some time. The member noted

that the US economy, in particular, had been slowing overall and it would be necessary to closely

examine the extent to which the economy would rebound from the second quarter. In the global

financial markets, stock prices had been rising since the beginning of April and currencies of

emerging market countries, except for some vulnerable countries, had exhibited stable movements.

With regard to the domestic economy, the member forecast that government spending would

maintain strong growth, but the growth of private consumption would become modest, facilities and

construction investment would continue to undergo corrections, and exports would grow more slowly

than a year earlier. The member expressed particular concern that exports and facilities investment

had remained sluggish, particularly in the semiconductor sector. The member expected exports and

facilities investment to start to pick up from the second half with the semiconductor industry

improving gradually, but the pace of recovery in facilities investment to be slower than originally

forecast. Looking at employment, which had been recently recovering somewhat, the member noted

that employment in the services sector was anticipated to improve, while that in the manufacturing

sector was forecast to remain lackluster for the time being, and careful monitoring was required in

this regard. The member took the view that, although a supplementary budget that the government

had been working on would make up for the sluggishness of the domestic economy to a certain

extent, the domestic economy would not be able to avoid the effects of the global economic

slowdown. However, the member also forecast that, if concerns about external destabilizing factors,

such as the US-China trade dispute, were resolved, this could work as an upside risk to economic

growth in the second half.

The member took the view that outlook for consumer price inflation this year had been

3


-----

adjusted downward to a larger extent from the January forecast, and that the current monetary

easing stance should be maintained since demand-side inflation pressures were unlikely to be large

going forward.

The member’s assessment of financial stability was positive. The member evaluated that the

stock market had remained bullish and the supply of funding to the corporate sector had been

seamless amid a favorable credit market. The member added that household debt had remained

stable thanks largely to strong government measures. However, the member stressed the need to

continuously examine the trends of household debt and the real estate market to determine whether

concerns regarding financial imbalances would be clearly resolved.

Finally, the member mentioned that after the March FOMC meeting the market had expected

the US Federal Reserve not to raise its policy rate for the time being, but some forecast the Fed to

make further rate hikes next year if the US economy picked up in the second half of this year and

inflation neared its target. In light of this, the member noted that it would be necessary to

thoroughly analyze the US economy and financial market.

Another member took the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at

the current meeting, since inflation had continued to slow and the domestic and overseas economic

slowdowns had been becoming more evident amid sluggish global trade.

With respect to the real economy, the member judged that the domestic economy had been

slowing more rapidly than expected, as on the external side the global economy had continued to

decelerate and on the domestic side there was a correction in facilities investment, driven by

external factors, as well as signs of a slowdown in private consumption. The member pointed out

that global trade-related indicators directly affecting the domestic economy had been plunging

recently, while the outlook for modest slowdown of US economic growth had strengthened. The

member went on to state that it would be necessary to keep an eye on whether the sluggishness of

global trade would be temporary. The member assessed that facilities investment had been shrinking

further than expected due to the overall sluggishness of exports centering around the IT sector, and

that private consumption growth had continued to slow since the second half of last year with

households’ propensities for consumption failing to maintain recovery. The member noted that the

Bank of Korea Research Department had adjusted its growth forecast slightly downward from 2.6

percent to 2.5 percent in expectation of a recovery in the growth rate from the second quarter, but

whether this expectation would actually materialize was substantially uncertain. The member added

that there remained some downside risks to the inflation forecast as well, given the real economic

and inflation trends.

Meanwhile, the member noted that core inflation had remained in the lower-1 percent range for

a long period of time, and this sluggishness or gradual decline in inflation was likely to continue

rather than be resolved this year, which was a matter of concern to the monetary policy authorities.

The member took the view that, from a long-term perspective, inflation had started to decline in

around 2012 and, in statistical terms, this was explained substantially by the decline in underlying

inflation resulting mainly from global factors such as oil prices. However, the member also argued

that attention should be paid to the increasing role of domestic factors in recent times, including

service charges. The member expressed the view that the decline in inflation caused by domestic

factors could and must be managed by active policy responses, and stressed that long-lasting low

inflation could cause inflation expectations to decline. The member added that, if inflation

expectations declined to the 1 percent level, the current Base Rate level would likely become

similar to or higher than the neutral interest rate, and argued that attention should be paid to

changes in inflation expectations as they could directly affect the degree of monetary easing even if

the Base Rate remained unchanged.

The member expressed the opinion that it would be advisable to resolve to some extent the

accumulated upward pressures on administered prices so that the overall inflation rate could increase to

near its target this year. On the other hand, the member stated that, considering the low inflation trends

and the gradual decline in the real neutral interest rate resulting mainly from population aging, the gap

between the Base Rate and the neutral interest rate was narrowing rapidly, and that, in light of this,

further rate hikes were not likely to become the future direction of monetary policy.

With regard to financial stability, the member’s evaluation was that some changes were witnessed to

the previous year’s trend of household debt growth being led by leasehold deposit loans and credit

loans extended by banks. The member added that leasehold deposit loans continued to be extended

briskly but their growth rate showed signs of stagnating and growth in credit loans had reversed to a

decrease in the first quarter this year, and went on to state that, if growth in leasehold deposit loans

continued to be curbed, the overall rate of household debt growth would likely continue to decline

gradually.

One other member took the view that, considering inflation and financial stability conditions and

the government’s expansionary policy stance, it would be important to maintain the current

accommodative monetary policy stance to anchor inflation expectations and curb the widening of

financial imbalances, and that in light of this it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at

the current meeting.

The member evaluated that consumer price inflation had recently stood at the mid-0 percent

level, but underlying inflation had held steady when accounting for the trends of sticky prices and

prices of items sensitive to business cycles. However, the member also expressed the view that, as

some indicators of inflation expectations had been weakening, it would be necessary to adopt a mix

of macroeconomic policies reflecting the following points so that low consumer price inflation

would not be prolonged.

First, the member stressed the importance of an accurate understanding of the current inflation

5


-----

trend. The member argued that an appropriate strategy was needed to anchor inflation expectations, as

the sustained low consumer price inflation appeared to have stemmed substantially from administered

prices as well as global and structural factors.

Second, the member argued that it would be necessary to rethink the causes underlying the

accumulation of financial imbalances. The member stated that financial imbalances seemed to have

worsened in Korea due to increased leverage amid a weakened virtuous circle of the economy, and that

attention should be paid to the possibility that, if demand is stimulated through monetary policy alone

without fundamental problems being resolved, the buildup of financial imbalances, along with inflation,

could accelerate in another way. The member also took the view that debt growth and inefficient

investment could ultimately act as downward pressures on growth and inflation and, in this regard, it

would be necessary to examine policy effects over a more medium-term horizon.

Third, the member stressed the need to look at the cases of advanced countries experiencing

difficulties on the inflation front. The member stated that, since the global financial crisis, Europe and

Japan had strengthened communication based largely on negative interest rates and quantitative easing,

but inflation in these regions had continued to fall short of targets for more than a decade, suggesting

that there might have been changes in the dynamics among interest rates, currencies, liquidity and asset

prices.

Finally, the member predicted that the volume of tax revenues would correspond with the budget

and that fiscal policy would shift to a very expansionary stance.

With the aforementioned matters taken into consideration, the member expressed the view that it

would be desirable to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy stance. The member expected

that the sustained accommodative stance, combined with the expansionary fiscal policy, would contribute

to driving demand-side pressures and maintaining inflation expectations. The member also suggested that

monetary policy could create a stable environment in which consumption and investment would be

based on economic fundamentals, consequently curbing the widening of financial imbalances, and that

fiscal policy could have stronger effects by selectively supporting specific areas. Meanwhile, the member

assessed this policy mix as appropriate in terms of macroeconomic balance, as an expansion of Treasury

bond issuance was unlikely to weigh on the market and fiscal policy-led stimulation of demand could

narrow the current account surplus, reducing excessive upward pressures on the Korean won.

One member, meanwhile, noted that, given the current macroeconomic conditions, the possibility

of marked improvement in the slowdowns of economic activity and prices was not high. The

member thus expressed the view that it was necessary to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the

current level at the present meeting, while paying more attention to buffering against downside risks

to the macroeconomy in the conduct of monetary policy going forward.

Concerning the recent Korean economy, the member’s assessment was that the buoyancy seen

for the last two years in the semiconductor sector had ended, resulting in an overall weakening of

6


-----

macroeconomic indicators. The member first saw that export growth, which had been heavily

dependent upon the semiconductor industry, was declining significantly, and the decrease in facilities

investment had become more pronounced, led by the IT sector. The member added that private

consumption, which had shown relatively favorable movements, had been slowing since the second

half of last year, accompanied by an overall contraction in the macroeconomy. The member noted

that the government’s active fiscal policy alone was serving as a buffer against a contraction in

private-sector economic activity.

The member’s assessment was that consumer price inflation had sharply slowed to the mid-0

percent range in the first quarter, due to declines in oil prices and agricultural product prices, and

that core inflation had declined to around 1 percent, sustaining the downward trend seen since

2016. The member saw that this slowdown in underlying price inflation was having negative

impacts on the economic recovery, by working to increase actual interest burdens.

The member expressed the opinion that, although there were both upside and downside risks to

the future outlook, it was not easy to expect tangible reversals of the current slowdowns of

economic activity and prices. As positive points, the member mentioned the relative stability of

international financial markets, thanks for instance to changes in the monetary policy stances of

major advanced economies, and the increasing possibility of an agreement in the US-China trade

dispute. The member, however, pointed out that the ongoing decline in trade growth stemming from

the slowdown in the world economy would weigh on the Korean economy. The member also

presented the view that, although the declining demand for semiconductors seen since the fourth

quarter of last year had eased of late, it would be difficult to expect that last year’s unprecedented

buoyancy of the semiconductor sector would return. The member expressed the view that, on the

domestic front, slowdowns in household debt growth and the housing market were highly likely to

continue due to the implementation of strong macroprudential policy. The member thought that

fiscal policy could be expected to have some degree of counter-cyclical buffer effects, as the

government was pursuing a large fiscal expansion.

Another member noted that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from its

current level, since financial conditions remained accommodative and there still were concerns about

financial imbalances, despite downward adjustments to the growth and inflation outlooks.

The member noted that the 2019 GDP growth outlook by the Bank of Korea Research

Department had been revised slightly downward from the January forecast, which appeared to reflect

more-sluggish-than-expected exports and facilities investment. The member saw that weaker global

growth and a contraction in global trade, stemming for instance from the US-China trade conflict,

and a slowdown in the semiconductor industry had exerted huge negative impacts on the Korean

economy, which was heavily dependent upon semiconductor exports and the Chinese economy. The

member, however, noted that the possibility had increased of some form of agreement being reached

7


-----

in the US-China trade negotiations, that many experts were forecasting a recovery in the

semiconductor sector from the second half onward, and that the effects from an expansionary fiscal

policy were expected to increase gradually. Given these points, the member projected the growth

momentum to improve going forward. As a result, the member expected the Korean economy to

show a trend of growth, not greatly deviating from its potential rate, again in the second half of

this year and next year.

With respect to inflation, the member commented that the outlook for consumer price inflation

for this year was revised downward to 1.1 percent, which appeared to be attributable to an increase

in downward inflationary pressures stemming from non-cyclical factors, such as lower prices of

petroleum and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, and the government’s stronger

social-welfare policy. The member expected inflation to increase, albeit modestly, due mainly to

rises in some public utility fees going forward. The member, however, saw that, given structural

downside risks to prices, such as population aging, globalization, and innovations in distribution,

inflation could run below its target for a considerable time. The member noted that such persistent

low inflation was observed commonly in most major countries, and for central banks adopting

inflation targeting, this added to the difficulties in monetary policy operation and public

communication. The member commented that, particularly since the Bank of Korea had decided to

strengthen its responsibilities of explaining inflation assessment to the public, by for instance

regularly publishing a report reviewing its operation of the inflation targeting starting from this year,

every effort should be made in this regard.

Last, the member found financial conditions to remain accommodative, in overall consideration

of major price variables in the financial markets and of credit and liquidity conditions. The member

also presented the opinion that it was necessary to keep in mind that there still were great concerns

about the household debt level, a major risk to financial stability.

Another member noted that, given recent developments in the policies of major countries and

financial conditions, the growth slowdowns of the domestic and global economies were not expected

to deepen further from the second quarter onward, while financial imbalances in the domestic

economy were still high. The member thus presented the view that it would be desirable to keep

the Base Rate on hold at the present meeting, while closely monitoring overall macroeconomic and

financial market conditions for the time being.

The member expressed the view that global growth had continued to slow, with the pace of

slowdown estimated to have been deeper than previously expected in the first quarter. Yet, given

that policies in major countries and financial conditions had been moving in relatively favorable

directions, the member noted that the global growth slowdown was more likely to stabilize

eventually, if not rebound, than lead to a full-fledged downturn phase. The member commented that

the reduced uncertainty about major country policies had been easing global financial conditions via

8


-----

the retreat of risk aversion, which in turn could work in favor of policy flexibility of the countries

where external conditions were not considered sound. The member also noted that some survey

indicators had been showing signs of improvement of late. The member saw these changes as

positive, but pointed out that, since the US-China trade negotiations had not yet been finalized and

global manufacturing and investment still remained sluggish, it was necessary to constantly keep an

eye on the relevant developments. The member added that major countries’ policy responses were

focusing on short-term stimulus measures, not structural improvements, and thus uncertainties

surrounding the medium- to long-term growth path still remained high.

The member, meanwhile, presented the opinion that there had been ongoing concerns about a

possible domestic economic downturn, as a global economic slowdown had been underway, led by

industries upon which Korean exports heavily rely on. The member’s assessment was that, although

growth in the first quarter was estimated to have slowed significantly, sluggishness in some

indicators, including export and employment indexes, had been moderating from the middle of the

first quarter onward when controlling for seasonal and irregular factors, and the growth contribution

of fiscal expenditures had been rising further. The member, however, added that it was necessary to

take some time to monitor whether these movements would lead to a meaningful rebound.

The member saw consumer inflation as likely to remain muted throughout the first half of this

year, due to the base effect from last year. The member, however, expected it to pick up from the

second half onward, given recent movements of prices of oil and agricultural, livestock and fisheries

products, and planned hikes to public utility fees. The member also noted that the rate of increase

in the business cycle-sensitive price index and the rate of inflation expected by the general public

had been stable.

The member noted that, on the financial stability side, risk from the buildup of financial

imbalances had been easing gradually, due to an ongoing slowdown in growth of household lending

and real estate-related lending, but the level of financial imbalances was still high. The member

emphasized the need for keeping a constant eye on the relevant developments, in consideration of

the volumes of apartments allotted and newly built this year in the Seoul Capital area. The member

saw that, although domestic and international financial markets had been stable since the beginning

of this year, there still were concerns about economic conditions and uncertainties surrounding

policies of major countries. The member thus expressed the opinion that attention should be paid to

the possibility of increased market volatility.

Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

```
Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision

statement was compiled and was approved unanimously by the members.

**Monetary Policy Decision**

`□` The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate

unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period.

`□` Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic

growth has continued to slow. Volatility in the global financial markets increased temporarily.

Government bond yields in major countries have fallen considerably, in line mainly with

concerns about the global economic slowdown and changes in expectations about the monetary

policies of such countries, while the exchange rates of some vulnerable emerging economies

have risen significantly. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global

financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade

protectionism, the changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and the uncertainties

concerning Brexit.

`□` The Board judges that the pace of domestic economic growth has moderated somewhat as

consumption growth has temporarily slowed, facilities and construction investment have continued

undergoing adjustments and export growth has continued to slow. The sluggishness in

employment conditions has partially lessened, with the increase in the number of persons

employed having risen. Going forward the Board expects that consumption will continue to

grow, while exports and facilities investment will also recover gradually toward the second half

of this year, although the adjustment in construction investment will continue. GDP is forecast

to grow at the mid-2% level this year, slightly below the level projected in January (2.6%).

`□` Consumer price inflation has slowed to the mid-0% range, in consequence mainly of declines in

the prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products. Core inflation

(with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the upper-0% level,

and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been in the low- to mid-2% range.

Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fluctuate for some time below

1%, lower than the path projected in January, and then run at the low- to mid-1% level from

the second half of this year. Core inflation will also gradually rise.

10


-----

`□` The volatility of price variables in the domestic financial markets has expanded slightly.

Long-term market interest rates and stock prices have rebounded after having fallen, affected by

movements in the global financial markets in line with projections of weakening growth in

major countries and expectations of progress in the US-China trade negotiations. The Korean

won-US dollar exchange rate has risen, in line with the strengthening of the US dollar. The rate

of increase in household lending has continued to slow, while housing prices have continued

their downtrend.

- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of

economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over

a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is expected that the

domestic economy will continue to grow at a rate that does not diverge significantly from its

potential level and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high,

the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will

carefully monitor developments such as conditions related to trade with major countries, any

changes in the economies and monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic

conditions in emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and

geopolitical risks, while examining their effects on domestic growth and inflation.
