Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation

```
After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook for the Second Half of 2019,[2)]_ _FX and_

_International Finance Trends, and_ _Financial Market Trends, the discussions of the Monetary Policy_

Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

Members evaluated that, looking at the global economy, trade growth had slowed significantly

and major countries except the US had shown weaker economic growth, amid the prolongation of

uncertainties caused by trade conflicts between major countries and by shifts in their policies. As

for the global financial markets, members judged that interest rates in major countries had continued

to decline in expectation of the US Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy, while the

volatility of major exchange rates had increased.

Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that, along with sluggish exports,

facilities and construction investment had continued to undergo adjustments, while private

consumption had continued to grow albeit slowly. Members judged that the Bank of Korea’s

downward adjustments to the growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020 reflected the situation that the

pace of domestic economic growth had been slower than expected. Members also noted that

changes in domestic and external conditions, including growing global economic uncertainties, the

global trade slowdown in line with the spread of trade protectionism, and Japan’s export restrictions,

could act as downside risks to the growth path.

Concerning inflation, members saw that consumer price inflation had remained low, running

below 1%, due to the combined effects of structural and cyclical factors. Members forecast

demand-side inflation pressures to remain at a low level for the time being.

Finally, as to the domestic financial markets, members saw that market interest rates had fallen

significantly and the stock market had been sluggish, but credit market funding conditions had

remained stable overall. Members also judged that, while household debt had been continuing to

show slower growth, continued attention should be paid to the risk of financial imbalances.

Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

```
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea

Base Rate were as follows:

Most members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international

financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate by 0.25 percentage

points this month, while one member argued for holding it at its current level.

One member stated that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate from the current 1.75%

to 1.50%.

The member judged that the domestic economy had continued to slow overall since last year.

The member’s diagnosis was that, as the semiconductor industry had continued to go through a

correction and the negative spillover effects of shrinking global trade in line with the US-China

trade dispute had become apparent, the downward trend of exports had been spreading to other

items. The member evaluated that the worsening of export sluggishness amid already-shrinking

domestic demand affected largely by a correction in construction investment had been slowing down

growth in the private sector significantly. In this regard, the member expected the overall economy

to remain lackluster for the time being, even when accounting for the government’s active fiscal

policy. In particular, as the trade conflict between Korea and Japan had been intensifying recently,

the member’s judgment was that there remained downside risks to the 2019 growth forecast, which

the Research Department had adjusted downward this time.

The member also mentioned that the nominal GDP growth rate, representing the rate of growth

in the income of all economic agents, had slowed dramatically to 3.1% last year and was forecast

to slow much further this year. In particular, the member expressed concerns that it was difficult to

expect the corporate sector to regain its growth momentum for the time being, as its disposable

income had declined by more than 5% last year, despite the booming semiconductor industry, and

was likely to decrease to a greater extent this year.

The member noted that, in line with the decline in economic activities, consumer price inflation

and core inflation had remained in the upper-0% range, far below the target. Considering that it

would be difficult to expect the economy to recover within a short period of time, the member saw

only a slight possibility of the current underlying trend of a slowdown in inflation reversing in the

second half of this year.

Considering these economic conditions mentioned above, the member stated that it would be

desirable to cut the Base Rate from the current 1.75% to 1.50%. Although it was difficult to expect

a 0.25 percentage point cut to lead to tangible economic recovery at this point in time, the member

expected the rate cut to act as a buffer against further slowdowns in economic activities and

3


-----

inflation that could occur if a Base Rate adjustment were delayed. Meanwhile, the member added

that it would be advisable to steadily strengthen prudential policy to prevent moral hazard, thereby

reducing potential risk factors in the financial markets that might stem from household debt.

Another member took the view that a shift in the Base Rate policy stance was needed to cope

with the changing economic conditions and, in this regard, it would be desirable to lower the Base

Rate to 1.50% at this meeting.

Looking at the real economy, the member’s assessment was that the slowdown in global trade

growth had become a trend while exports and facilities investment had become more lackluster, and

as a result, an economic slowdown had become apparent, with the growth rate far below the

potential growth rate.

With regard to major economies, the member mentioned that, while the US had maintained

relatively favorable growth, the euro area had remained sluggish and Chinese economic growth had

been gradually decelerating. The member added that global trade growth, which affects the Korean

economy more directly, had been slowing at a much faster pace than the global real economic

trend.

In these external conditions, the member’s evaluation was that Korea’s exports and investment

had undergone a wider range of corrections in the first half of this year, leading a slowdown in

overall growth. The member noted that the decline in facilities investment had accelerated to record

a two-digit rate of decrease in the first half, and goods exports had reversed to a decrease in terms

of both value and volume. The member also assessed that, as the real economic slump had led to

sluggish employment, particularly in the manufacturing sector, household income growth had slowed

and heightened uncertainties had dampened household consumer sentiment. As a result, the member

estimated that the lackluster private consumption of the first quarter had continued in the second

quarter. In light of the economic downturn and newly emerging risk factors such as Japan’s export

restrictions, the Research Department’s downward adjustment of its previous growth forecast had

been inevitable.

Concerning inflation, the member forecast consumer price inflation for this year not to exceed

the upper-0% level, given its movements so far and the recent economic trend. The member

expressed the view that Korea’s inflation to date had been affected substantially by factors such as

global factors and administered prices that are not closely related to domestic monetary policy.

Taking a more detailed look at the recent inflation, however, the member assessed that a pattern

had become more evident: aggregate demand-pull pressures had been sluggish in line with the

economic downturn, leading to a slowdown in inflation.

In terms of financial stability, meanwhile, the member’s evaluation was that household debt

growth had continued to slow. The member forecast that, although leasehold deposit loans and

group loans by the banking sector had remained on the rise, there were no unique factors that

4


-----

would contribute to a further acceleration of household debt growth, and in light of this, it would

gradually stabilize downward this year to a level no higher than 5%.

In overall consideration of the above, the member judged that, with domestic demand sluggish

in line with a substantial slowdown in global trade, Korea’s real economic downturn was

progressing rapidly and inflation was stagnating in the 0% range. Due to these changes in economic

conditions, the member took the view that it was hard to see the current Base Rate level as an

accommodative monetary policy stance. In this regard, the member stated that it would be

appropriate to cut the Base Rate to 1.50% at this meeting.

One other member expressed the view that, in consideration of real economic and inflation

trends, it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate to 1.50% at this time.

The member saw that, with respect to the global economy, uncertainties related to trade

tensions between major countries and policy changes had lasted for a longer period of time and the

growth momentum had been slowing gradually. The member estimated that the global economic

growth rate during the first half of this year had fallen slightly below that of the second half of

last year, and pointed out that the differentiation in economic trends by industry should be noted―

the non-manufacturing sector and consumption had remained relatively favorable while the

manufacturing sector and investment had stayed sluggish. The member judged that, as uncertainties

related to trade disputes had heightened again since May, their negative impacts on global trade and

the domestic economy had been increasing substantially.

As to the domestic economy, the member expressed concerns that downside risks to the growth

path had increased significantly due to the changes in domestic and external conditions, even though

the quarter-on-quarter growth rate was estimated to have shifted to positive in the second quarter.

The member pointed out that the decline in the value of customs-cleared exports had accelerated

since May while their volume had also reversed to a decrease, and went on to state that Japan’s

export restrictions had the potential to substantially disrupt Korea’s production and exports

depending on how the situation developed going forward, and thus it would be necessary to map

out and analyze various scenarios concerning potential downside risks. Next, looking at domestic

demand by sector, the member assessed that, while the degree of the contribution of public-sector

spending to growth had increased and private consumption had shown modest growth, consumption

of durables had been relatively weak and corporate investment had remained lackluster. The member

added that, although month-on-month declines in machinery and construction orders, known to be

leading indicators, had been moderating somewhat, there was little possibility that they would

recover significantly within a short period of time, considering that domestic and external

uncertainties had been large and corporate sentiment had shrunk.

Concerning inflation, the member’s evaluation was that consumer price inflation had remained

low at the 0% level in the first half, but with supply-side and one-off factors excluded, underlying

5


-----

inflation had been higher than consumer price inflation. Given that the negative output gap was

likely to widen and limit demand-side pressures, however, the member forecast that consumer price

inflation would depart from its 2% target for a longer-than-expected period of time.

Given the aforementioned matters, the member expressed the view that it would be appropriate

to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 1.50% at this time. Looking back at the policy

judgments made over the past several months, the member mentioned that, amid uncertainties related

to trade disputes, the slope of the medium-term monetary policy path had been gradually adjusted

while a rebalancing had been performed in terms of the effects of policy decisions on the growth

and inflation paths versus the risk of an accumulation of financial imbalances. However, the

member judged that, as trade tensions had heightened again since May and downside risks that had

raised concerns had been partly realized or had become more likely to be realized, it would be

desirable to adjust the level of the Base Rate downward to buffer downside risks to the growth

path and help get inflation back on track.

Meanwhile, the member expressed the view that continued coordination with other policies

would be needed to minimize potential policy costs incident to the Base Rate cut. The member also

emphasized that, since it could not be ruled out that more accommodative financial conditions could

cause the degree of the accumulation of financial imbalances to increase again, related risks should

be monitored continuously. The member added that medium- and long-term policy efforts should be

strengthened to enhance growth potential, bearing in mind that the prolongation of low interest rates

had in many cases weakened corporate restructuring efforts and that the slowdown in Korea’s

economic growth had been attributable to several structural problems as well.

One member, meanwhile, presented the view that it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate

by 0.25 percentage points from 1.75% to 1.50%, with more focus placed on growth and inflation

conditions.

Looking at the domestic economy, the member assessed the sluggishness in exports and

investment as having continued, as global growth and trade slowed and the semiconductor business’s

recovery was pushed back compared to original expectations. In the future, the sluggish trend in

global trade, stemming for instance from the escalation of the US-China trade dispute, could

continue longer than anticipated. The member added that Japan’s restrictions on exports could also

cause setbacks in production and investment in Korea’s core industries. With respect to prices, the

member saw that demand-side inflationary pressures had weakened due to the economic slowdown,

while downward pressures from government policy had been sustained.

The member mentioned that, in the financial markets, long-term market interest rates had fallen

significantly in reflection of these growth and price conditions. The member, however, saw that

household debt growth was showing signs of expansion of late despite concerns about an economic

slowdown, after having previously exhibited a slowing trend, and corporate bond issuance and

6


-----

corporate lending, including lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises, had steadily expanded.

The member diagnosed these developments as being contrary to the procyclicality of the financial

system in general and assessed that they could serve as positive factors partially easing downward

pressures on the economy, but could also be factors requiring continued vigilance in terms of

financial imbalances.

The member noted that overall macroeconomic and financial stability conditions had been

considered in monetary policy decisions made to date. The member saw that, since the economic

growth rate was forecast to be below its potential level and consumer price inflation to run well

below the target level, the need for accommodative monetary policy had grown in terms of

macroeconomic conditions. The member, however, noted that lending to households had expanded

again of late, led by bank lending, and housing prices in parts of the Seoul metropolitan region had

also been showing signs of a rebound, centering around apartments planned for reconstruction and

new presale apartments. The member thus emphasized the need to remain on the alert to risks

concerning financial stability.

The member took the view that, although macroeconomic and financial stability conditions had

been acting as conflicting considerations for monetary policy decisions, it would be better to lower

the Base Rate by 0.25 percentage points from 1.75% to 1.50%, with more focus placed on growth

and inflation conditions. The member, however, emphasized that, when cutting the Base Rate, close

scrutiny of various risk factors was necessary to prevent a large expansion of financial imbalance

risks, which had been cause for concern for some time. The member also expressed the view that

the government and the supervisory authorities should also carry out macroeconomic and housing

policies for stabilization of household debt and the housing market in a consistent manner. The

member noted that the sustained low growth of the Korean economy was largely attributable to

economic structural factors such as population aging and slower growth in productivity, and thus it

was important not only to implement short-term economic stimulus on the monetary and fiscal

policy side but also to work to enhance competitiveness and expand growth potential by carrying

out structural reforms in all areas of the economy.

Another member took the view that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate from 1.75% to

1.50% at this meeting in overall consideration of domestic and overseas economic conditions.

The member assessed that, concerning the global economy, trends of growth in major countries

other than the US had been weakening. The member also diagnosed that instability in the Chinese

economy could continue due to prolonged US-China trade negotiations, and the spread of other

trade disputes had worked to increase concerns about the global economy. The member noted that,

accordingly, world trade growth had fallen far below original projections. With respect to the

international financial markets, the member pointed out the need for ongoing monitoring, since

volatility in major exchange rates had become higher with interest rates in major countries showing

7


-----

a trend of decline due to expectations of accommodative monetary policy by the US Federal

Reserve.

The member’s evaluation was that, following negative growth in the first quarter, corrections in

facilities and construction investment had continued in the second quarter with exports being

sluggish. In particular, the member saw that the real economy had been worse than expected since

the beginning of May as the US and China had failed to find a way to reach an agreement in

their trade dispute. The member also pointed out that, although employment was showing

improvement due mainly to a base effect, qualitative improvement had been sluggish with continued

deterioration in employment conditions in the manufacturing sector. The member thus presented the

view that, although the Research Department had made a large downward adjustment to the

economic outlook in consideration of those conditions, there still looked to be downside risks given

recent domestic and overseas economic conditions, including the trade issue with Japan. The

member voiced concern that there was still a long way to go before the real economy would show

a rapid recovery, particularly due to negative synergy effects of growing uncertainties surrounding

the global economy, the export slump stemming from the US-China trade dispute, and the

difficulties facing Korea’s IT industry.

The member saw that inflation would remain very low this year, due to low demand-side

inflationary pressures amid the combined interactions of structural and cyclical factors. The member

presented the view that, particularly since the output and inflation gaps were both negative, it was

necessary to maintain an accommodative monetary policy.

As to the domestic financial markets, the member’s assessment was that market interest rates

had fallen significantly and the stock market had been somewhat sluggish, due to factors such as

the deteriorating performances of Korean companies. The member expressed the view that, although

credit market funding conditions had remained relatively stable, attention should be paid to the

herding behavior seen in some credit bond markets.

The member, meanwhile, saw that household debt growth had slowed to around 5%, thanks for

instance to strong government measures, and judged that this had been a positive change. The

member expected household debt growth to remain stable overall, although the volume of household

debt growth could increase somewhat in the second half of this year compared to the first half.

The member, however, stressed the need to closely monitor the household debt trend in the future

as well.

Finally, the member judged that, with the US Federal Reserve highly likely to lower its policy

rate in July, concerns about the widening of the interest rate gap between Korea and the US, which

had been showing an inversion, could ease to some extent, given a change in the monetary policy

stance of the US Federal Reserve.

With the aforementioned domestic and overseas economic conditions taken into consideration,

the member expressed the view that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate from 1.75% to

8


-----

1.50% at this meeting.

One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its

current 1.75% level at this meeting.

The member saw that, after a temporary rebound in 2017-2018, the world economy looked to

have entered a somewhat steep re-correction phase due to the escalation of trade disputes, with the

effects of US fiscal policy and the contribution to growth of investment in China weakening. The

member noted that this could also be seen in sluggishness in IT and other manufacturing

production. On the other hand, the member saw that the leading growth drivers for economic

activity in major countries still looked to be services and consumption, but presented the view that

it was uncertain how long the virtuous circle led by domestic demand would last. The member

noted that major country central banks had been showing movements toward re-expanding their

accommodative stances to deal with weakened inflationary pressures. The member went on to voice

concern that this could again stimulate prices of financial and real assets, which had already been

high.

The member expected domestic economic growth to continue for some time at a level lower

than potential growth, which had shown a trend of decline, as growth was being weighed on by

the readjustment of real estate and IT investment, on top of the above-mentioned changes in the

global environment. The member also anticipated inflation to remain low, influenced by weaker

demand-side pressures and administered prices.

The member stated that it was necessary to respond to this situation with expansionary

macroeconomic policy. The member, however, noted that the low growth trend was due mainly to

domestic and overseas structural factors and readjustment of excess investment, that the narrowing

of the current account surplus and the depreciation pressure on the won had appeared

simultaneously, and that there still was a risk of financial imbalances. Given these points, the

member took the view that an appropriate mix would be to carry out a large expansionary fiscal

policy and to maintain the current level of accommodative monetary policy. The member first

expected that if fiscal policy was implemented in line with the budget bill, its contribution to

economic growth would rise substantially from last year through direct effects of fiscal spending

and indirect effects of tax revenues on consumption. The member’s assessment was that monetary

policy still remained accommodative, in view of abundant market liquidity conditions. The member

commented that even the estimates of proxy indicators of the natural interest rate, such as marginal

productivity of capital, confirmed that monetary policy was accommodative. The member added that

this was also reflected well by a calculation of the neutral interest rate using expected inflation or

price indexes that better capture demand-side pressures.

The member pointed out that, if the degree of monetary policy accommodation were expanded

further in the current situation, the possibility could not be ruled out of the policy effects leaning

9


-----

toward rises in asset prices due to oversupply of liquidity. The member added that household debt,

together with faster growth in the debt of small- and medium-sized enterprises, which had increased

greatly for the past ten years, could put downward pressures on potential growth in the medium

term.

However, the member pointed out that, despite the risk of financial imbalances, the weakening

inflation expectations stemming from persistent low inflation conditions could not be ignored. The

member expressed the opinion that, if the trend of decline in inflation expectations continued, which

had been ongoing since the end of last year, the relative importance of concerns about the widening

of financial imbalances and the decline in inflation expectations should be reconsidered. The

member also emphasized that the global financial and real market trends stemming from changes in

the monetary policies of major countries should be closely watched.

Taking into overall consideration the above-mentioned factors, the member took the view that it

would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.75% level. The member added that, with

uncertainties surrounding external conditions increasing sharply, the macroeconomic policy mix

should be adjusted carefully in the future, while closely watching future developments in the

domestic economy, and the flow of private consumption and inflation expectations in particular.

Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

```
Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision

statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.

However, Dr. Lee, Il Houng expressed clear opposition to the idea of cutting the Base Rate by

0.25 percentage points and argued for keeping it at its current level.

**Monetary Policy Decision**

`□` The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25

basis points, from 1.75% to 1.50%.

`□` Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic

growth has continued to slow as trade contracted mainly due to the US-China trade dispute.

Global financial markets have been stable in general, with stock prices in major countries

increasing in line primarily with expectations of monetary easing in major countries. Looking

ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be

affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the changes in the

monetary policies of major countries, and geopolitical risks.

`□` The Board judges that the pace of domestic economic growth has slowed as construction

investment has continued undergoing an adjustment and the slowdowns in exports and facilities

investment have deepened, although consumption has continued to grow moderately. Employment

conditions have partially improved, with the increase in the number of persons employed having

risen. With respect to future domestic economic growth, the Board expects that the adjustment

in construction investment will continue and exports and facilities investment will recover later

than originally expected, although consumption will continue to grow. GDP is forecast to grow

at the lower-2% level this year, below the April forecast (2.5%).

`□` Consumer price inflation has remained low at the mid- to upper-0% level, in consequence

mainly of the continued decline in petroleum product prices. Core inflation (with food and

energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the mid- to upper-0% range, and the

rate of inflation expected by the general public has been at the low-2% level. Looking ahead, it

is forecast that consumer price inflation will fall short of the path projected in April and

11


-----

fluctuate for some time below 1% and then run at the low- to mid-1% level from next year.

Core inflation will also gradually rise.

`□` The volatility of price variables in the domestic financial markets has increased. Long-term

market interest rates have fallen significantly, in line mainly with concerns about economic

slowdowns at home and abroad. Stock prices and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate have

fluctuated considerably, mainly affected by the US-China trade dispute and Japan’s export

restrictions. The rate of increase in household lending has continued to slow, while housing

prices have continued their downtrend.

`□` Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of

economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level

over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is expected that

domestic economic growth will be moderate and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the

demand side will remain at a low level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary

policy stance. In this process it will carefully monitor developments such as the US-China trade

dispute, Japan’s export restrictions, any changes in the economies and monetary policies of

major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks, while examining

their effects on domestic growth and inflation.
