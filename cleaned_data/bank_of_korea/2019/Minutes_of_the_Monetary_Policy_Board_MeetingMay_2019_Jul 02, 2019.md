Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation

After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments,[2)]_ _FX and International Finance_

_Trends, and_ _Financial Market Trends, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members_

covered the following areas:

Members evaluated that, looking at the global economy, major countries had shown

stronger-than-expected growth in the first quarter, but underlying growth had continued to exhibit a

slowing trend, and trade growth had also slowed. As for the global financial markets, members

judged that, as risk aversion had increased, due for instance to the escalation of the US-China trade

dispute, stock prices had fallen and the currencies of emerging economies had depreciated.

Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that private consumption had

continued to grow albeit slowly, although facilities and construction investment had continued to

undergo adjustments and exports had remained sluggish. Members expected growth to rebound,

aided by the pickup in the government sector in the second quarter, although the growth trend had

been sluggish in the first quarter. Members, however, saw that uncertainties concerning the forecast

path had risen, due chiefly to the escalation of the US-China trade dispute.

Concerning inflation, members saw that consumer price inflation had remained low, running

below 1%, due to the combined effects of structural and cyclical factors. Members saw that there

were some upside risks such as the exchange rate and international oil prices. Members, however,

assessed the downside risks to the projected path of inflation to have increased somewhat, given the

recent inflation trend as well as the government’s social-welfare policies and its policy measures to

stabilize people’s livelihoods.

Finally, as to the domestic financial markets, members saw that market interest rates had fallen

significantly and the stock market had been sluggish, but credit market funding conditions had

remained stable. Members, meanwhile, noted that household debt had been continuing to show

slower growth, but a significant number of apartments were scheduled to be available for sale and

to be newly occupied. Members, thus, found the need to keep a close watch on the risk of

financial imbalances.

Base Rate were as follows:

Most members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international

financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current

level of 1.75% for the intermeeting period.

One member stated that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level for

the intermeeting period, despite concerns about weakening inflation expectations, as it was desirable

to sustain the current accommodative monetary policy stance given the expansionary fiscal policy,

which was being pursued in consideration of a number of structural problems and the current policy

operating conditions.

The member noted that, since last monetary policy decision meeting, inflation had remained in

the mid-0% range and some indicators of inflation expectations had been responding to this. In

addition, the member expressed the view that downside risks to external conditions looked to have

expanded and the trend of domestic growth to have weakened, but more accurate assessments could

be made using the relevant indicators in the second quarter.

The member found that price inflation in Korea had fallen to a low level compared to those in

major countries because the negative contribution of administered prices had continued and the

effects from oil price movements had been asymmetric. The member, however, added that a trend

of decline, albeit moderate, in prices of personal services with administered prices excluded implied

a possible weakening of pressures on the demand side. The member evaluated that the weakening

of demand-side pressures was attributable to a decline in the potential growth rate to the mid-2%

range or lower. The member noted that significant changes had been seen in the Korean economy,

including a rapid rebalancing of the economic structure toward domestic demand-driven economy

and an acceleration of population aging. Against this backdrop, the member assessed that

adjustments to over-investment in construction and a delay in facilities investment related to the IT

sector were increasing downward pressures on the economy. Concerning private consumption,

however, the member saw the need to monitor the relevant developments a bit longer, but assessed

it to have continued its steady growth in the first quarter as well, given base effects related to the

Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and the irregular execution of government spending at the beginning

of the year.

The member mentioned that, although financial imbalances had been narrowing, they were still

wider than those of other countries. The member judged that, despite ample liquidity, demand for

funds to expand production capacities was not great, due to the weakening of the virtuous circle of

the economy. The member expressed the need to take action under a broad framework of structural

reforms, including macroprudential policy as well as a mix of fiscal and monetary policies, in an

effort to increase the potential growth rate and to ease downside pressures on the economy. The

3


-----

member noted that, if demand was stimulated through monetary policy alone without these efforts,

the buildup of financial imbalances, along with inflation, could accelerate in another way, thus

possibly incurring social costs.

The member expected that fiscal policy would contribute considerably to economic recovery,

due to a large year-on-year increase in the managed fiscal deficit. The member also expected

selective support for vulnerable groups to increase. The member judged that a policy response to

minimize the negative side effects of macroeconomic policy would be a combination of maintaining

the current accommodative monetary policy stance and, in terms of fiscal policy, ensuring timely

execution of this year’s budget. The member, however, stressed the need to keep a close eye on

the developments in the domestic economy, as downside risks to external conditions had increased,

as exemplified by the delayed recovery of the global IT-related cycle and the continuation of the

US-China trade dispute. The member added that, while considering whether to adjust the

macroeconomic policy stance in accordance with changes in relevant conditions, efforts should also

be made to seek various policy measures to enhance the efficiency of monetary policy and reduce

its adverse effects.

Another member took the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at

the current meeting, while continuing to examine the development of external risks, such as the

US-China trade dispute, and continuing to monitor whether the trend of growth in the domestic

economy would recover.

The member’s assessment was that, with respect to the global economy, the downside risks to

growth had been increasing since the April forecast. The member commented that, as the US-China

trade negotiations had unexpectedly failed to find a way to reach an agreement, the economies of

the two countries had become unstable and concerns about the negative impacts on the economies

of other countries had grown. The member added that, with political uncertainties such as Brexit

serving as downside risks to the European economy, world trade growth was slowing. The member

saw that, in the international financial markets, price variables, such as interest rates, stock prices

and exchange rates, were showing instability. As market volatility was highly likely to heighten for

some time, the member judged that thorough preparations were needed.

Concerning the domestic economy, the member noted that negative growth had been recorded in

the first quarter due to a decrease in the contribution of the government sector. The member also

saw that, up until recently, adjustments to facilities and construction investment had continued and

exports had remained mired in a slump. The member commented that the Bank of Korea’s baseline

forecast was that from the latter half of this year, exports and facilities investment would rebound

along with a recovery in the semiconductor sector and a resolution of the US-China conflict. The

member, however, pointed out that there was also a concern that the intensity of the economic

recovery would be weaker than expected. The member noted that employment growth had slowed

4

somewhat in April, but expected employment to improve compared to the original forecast on an

annual basis. The member stated that it was necessary to pay continued attention to the

deterioration in employment conditions in the manufacturing sector, and to the employment situations

in the wholesale & retail and lodging & restaurants sectors. Given these points, the member stated

that it had become more important to judge if the Korean economy would recover in the second

half of this year in line with the Bank’s forecast. The member thus emphasized the need to closely

observe growth in the second quarter and make an accurate forecast of second-half growth.

The member noted that consumer price inflation had remained lower than previously forecast.

The member stated that this was undoubtedly due to a combination of structural and cyclical

factors, but added that, since the economy was sustaining a negative output gap, it was necessary to

maintain an accommodative monetary policy.

The member noted that, on the financial stability side, household debt growth was slowing, due

mainly to strong government household debt measures, and market interest rates had been declining

greatly in the financial markets, while there was a slump in the stock market. The member,

however, judged the funding conditions in the credit market to have remained stable. Noting the

recently heightened synchronization between the Korean won and the Chinese yuan, the member

emphasized that it was necessary to closely monitor developments in the financial and foreign

exchange markets through which the impacts of the US-China trade conflict on the real economy

could be amplified.

One other member took the view that, since domestic and international economic conditions

were not favorable and downside risks to the economy had been materializing, it was desirable to

cut the Base Rate by 0.25 percentage points at the current meeting to buffer against the slowdowns

in price inflation and business activity in the private sector.

The member saw that, with respect to the domestic economy, the adjustment to construction

investment had been sustained and the declines in exports and facilities investment were continuing.

Accordingly, the member’s assessment was that economic activity generally had weakened and

growth in private consumption was gradually slowing. The member judged that overall growth had

been fluctuating in accordance with the degree of the growth contribution of the government sector,

with growth in the private sector being almost at a standstill since the fourth quarter of last year.

The member took the view that, looking at biannual statistics, the slowdown in the Korean

economy had become more evident since last year. The member expected that economic growth for

the first half of this year was unlikely to rise well above 2%, even with a possible rebound in the

second quarter. The member added that the downturn in the nominal growth rate had been steeper,

and there was a growing possibility that it would fall to the 1% level, falling below the real

economic growth rate in the first half of this year.

The member judged that future economic conditions would not be favorable. The member

5


-----

commented that, amid the ongoing slowdown in the global economy, exports had not been showing

any sign of recovery, and it had become more difficult to expect a recovery in exports in the

immediate future, due to recently growing uncertainties surrounding the US-China trade dispute. The

member added that it was also difficult to expect a significant rebound in private consumption due

to ongoing employment sluggishness and the slowing pace of increase in household income. The

member expected increased fiscal spending to serve as a partial buffer against the trend of

economic downturn. The member, however, took the view that it was uncertain whether such an

increase would lead to a rebound in private-sector activity.

The member, meanwhile, noted that consumer price inflation was decelerating further to the

mid-0% range, in line with the contraction in economic activity. The member took the view that

the decline to the lower-1% level of core inflation with “prices of administered items” excluded, in

particular, implied that the recent slowing of inflation was not attributable to one-off disturbances.

The member commented that if the current economic downturn continued, underlying inflation could

run well below its target for a long time. The member went on to voice a concern that this could

undermine the credibility of the inflation targeting regime, thus greatly hampering future monetary

policy.

With the aforementioned economic conditions taken into consideration, the member expressed the

view that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate from 1.75% to 1.50%. The member noted that, at

this time, the Research Department’s April forecast looked to have significant downside risks, and even

if the forecast materialized, it was still difficult to see the Base Rate of 1.50% as low relative to

economic fundamentals. The member went on to note that any delay in changing the Base Rate, on the

other hand, would lead to accumulated economic and social losses stemming from increased idle

resources. The member added that policy measures to enhance macroprudential stability, including the

DSR regulations, should be implemented in a consistent and steady manner going forward, since they

could gradually reduce potential risks to the financial markets stemming from household debt.

One member, meanwhile, presented the view that although downside risks to the growth

forecast had increased, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level and take

time to examine changes in domestic and external conditions, as growth and inflation were expected

to improve gradually.

Looking at the recent changes in domestic and external conditions, the member assessed

downside risks to the growth and price paths as having increased somewhat from the April forecast.

The member mentioned that global economic and trade growth had been slowing, the US-China

trade dispute had intensified unexpectedly, and there were concerns that semiconductor demand

might pick up later than expected. The member also expressed the view that, with the risk aversion

tendencies in the domestic and overseas financial markets having strengthened, stock prices had

fallen and EME currencies including the Korean won had weakened, and as a result, household and

6


-----

corporate economic sentiment had weakened. On the other hand, however, the member noted that

major international organizations forecast next year’s global economic and trade growth rates to be

much higher than this year’s and that the prevailing forecast was that the US-China trade dispute

would be resolved in some way, although there were concerns about its prolongation. The member

stated that the volume of semiconductor exports had been showing faster growth, demand for

DRAM chips was likely to increase gradually, and government fiscal spending, having been sluggish

in the first quarter, had been growing centering around investment, and the member expected the

growth contribution of the government sector to rise. The member mentioned that this forecast

implied that the factors that had negatively affected the domestic economy in the first quarter would

not do so or would even positively affect the Korean economy going forward.

As for the price path, the member’s assessment was that, although factors such as the

government’s welfare policies would act as downside risks, there were upside risks as well, such as

global oil prices and exchange rates, and the member forecast consumer price inflation to rise

gradually to run in the low- to mid-1% range in the second half of this year. The member also

noted that, although consumer price inflation remained low, the general public’s inflation perceptions

and expectations were seen to be slightly higher than the 2% target.

Taking into overall consideration the above-mentioned factors, the member took the view that it

would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level and monitor how domestic and

external conditions would change, since growth and inflation were highly likely to show upward

movement as forecast in April this year, despite downside risks. The member also mentioned that

continued attention to the risk of financial imbalances was needed, since bank lending to households

had expanded somewhat in April and May and a substantial number of apartments were scheduled

to be available for sale and to be newly occupied, although household debt growth had significantly

slowed recently.

Another member took the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged

at this meeting and keep an eye on the related developments, since uncertainties surrounding the

future growth path had mounted and caution about heightening volatility in domestic and overseas

financial markets was needed.

The member assessed that the global economy had achieved better-than-expected growth in the

first quarter, particularly in major countries, but this growth was unlikely to be sustained as

improvement in the growth rate had been mostly seen in non-manufacturing sectors and one-off

factors had made a substantial contribution. The member also judged that uncertainties surrounding

the medium- to long-term growth path had increased, with the US-China trade conflict further

worsening and financial market volatility heightening. The member stated that risk aversion was

spreading at a modest pace thanks to major countries’ policy responses to potential downside risks,

but expressed concern that if the trade conflict were to be prolonged going forward, corporate

7


-----

investment would remain sluggish due to uncertainties, substantially limiting global trade and

manufacturing activities.

The member mentioned that there were growing concerns in the financial markets about the

possibility of economic downturn, as Korea’s GDP growth had shifted to negative in the first

quarter of this year and destabilizing external factors had emerged. However, since the decline in

GDP in the first quarter had been attributable substantially to the volatility of the contribution of

the government sector, the member expected a substantial rebound of the growth rate in the second

quarter, considering fiscal plans for this year and fiscal spending to date. In addition, the member

forecast the growth contribution of the private sector to increase somewhat, as the export volume

was shifting to modest growth and the sluggishness of the manufacturing sector was showing signs

of easing somewhat. However, with the US-China trade dispute escalating again and consumer and

corporate sentiment shrinking, the member judged that the uncertainty of the growth forecast for the

second half and onwards had increased even further.

Meanwhile, the member found it noteworthy that the economic slowdown had been attributable

partly to structural factors. The member’s evaluation was that, on the external side, trade

protectionism had been causing changes to the world trade order and global value chains,

dampening intra-regional trade and increasing production costs. On the domestic front, the member

expressed the view that, as the working-age population had been decreasing and labor market-related

institutional arrangements had been changing, it would be necessary to enhance productivity and

improve the economic activity participation rate to maintain the growth potential. The member added

that, since domestic and overseas economic conditions were undergoing rapid structural changes, a

more careful approach should be adopted with respect to the estimation of the potential growth rate

and the output gap.

The member noted that consumer price inflation, although having remained at a low level in

April as well, had increased slightly, and expected that the easing of supply-side downward

pressures would last for some time, boosting inflation even further. The member added that this

forecast was also supported by the fact that increase in inflation indicators not heavily affected by

supply-side factors, such as the price index of items sensitive to business cycles, had continued to

outpace consumer price inflation.

Looking at the financial conditions, the member noted that volatility in domestic and overseas

financial markets had increased significantly with the US-China trade dispute deteriorating again.

The member presented the view that there was only a limited possibility of sudden capital outflows,

with external soundness indicators remaining favorable, but attention should be paid to the gradual

decline in the current account surplus amid high external uncertainties. The member also commented

that the risk of the accumulation of financial imbalances should be monitored carefully, as there

were strong demand for household loans in line with the increased number of apartments scheduled

for sale and occupation.

One other member argued that, although there was a need for a Base Rate cut given the

increased downside risks to the growth path and the sluggishness of inflation, it would be desirable

to keep the Base Rate unchanged for the intermeeting period, as it would be advisable to signal a

change in the policy stance in advance.

With respect to the real economy, the member noted that on the external side conditions were

becoming worse as the global economy had continued to decelerate and the US-China trade dispute

had been escalating, and on the domestic side there was a growing likelihood of growth slowing

even further with the first-quarter growth rate coming in below the original forecast.

The member judged that the US and eurozone economies had exhibited higher-than-expected

growth in the first quarter, but looking at the underlying trends, the US economy had been slowing

gradually and the eurozone economy had remained sluggish. The member expressed concerns that

the US-China trade dispute had been intensifying while the global goods trade volume had not been

showing any sign of rebound after its plunge in the fourth quarter of last year, adding to the risk

that global trade would remain lackluster this year.

The member noted that Korea’s exports and investment had been undergoing adjustments since

the end of last year, in reflection of the global economic trend, and household consumption had

also exhibited slowing growth since the second half of last year. The member’s evaluation was that

the economy had been expected to slow this year, due largely to the negative effects of declining

semiconductor prices, but the –0.34% GDP growth rate during the first quarter had been worse than

expected. The member judged that it would be difficult to view the growth path of the domestic

economy as consistent with the Bank of Korea’s April forecast of 2.5%, considering that no clear

improvement had been seen in indicator trends and external conditions had been deteriorating with

the escalation of the US-China trade dispute.

With regard to inflation remaining low, the member’s assessment was that, even if the recent

weakening of the Korean won worked to increase inflation, there was a growing likelihood of this

year’s inflation coming in below 1%, considering the inflation trend so far. More specifically, the

member noted that the remarkable sluggishness in the domestically-generated inflationary pressure

indicator and in the price growth of items sensitive to the business cycle implied that the

sluggishness of aggregate demand-pull pressures had been driving the slowdown in inflation.

In terms of financial stability, meanwhile, the member evaluated that housing prices had

remained on a downward path and household debt growth had continued to slow. More specifically,

the member’s judgment was that group loans and individual mortgage loans had remained stable,

but banks’ leasehold deposit loans had maintained strong growth similar to last year, leading total

household loan growth. In terms of leasehold deposit loans, the member presented the view that,

since there were policy factors causing increases, such as the exemption from DSR regulations and

guarantees by housing guarantee companies, if household debt should be stabilized further, it should

be done through macroprudential policy, not monetary policy.

Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision

statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.

However, Dr. Dongchul Cho expressed clear opposition to the idea of keeping the Base Rate at

its current level and argued for cutting it by 0.25 percentage points. Dr. Inseok Shin agreed with

keeping the Base Rate unchanged from its current level, but disagreed with the phrase in the

Monetary Policy Decision stating that “the domestic economy will continue to grow at a rate that

does not diverge significantly from its potential level.”

**Monetary Policy Decision**

- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate

unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period.

- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic

growth has continued to slow. Volatility in the global financial markets has increased.

Government bond yields and stock prices in major countries have fallen while the currencies of

emerging economies have depreciated, in line mainly with the escalation of the US-China trade

dispute and the sluggishness of economic indicators in major countries. Looking ahead, the

Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by

factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the changes in the monetary

policies of major countries, and geopolitical risks.

- The Board judges that the domestic economy has recovered slightly from its slowdown in the

1st quarter, as consumption has continued to grow albeit slowly, although facilities and

construction investment have continued undergoing adjustments and exports have been sluggish.

On the employment front, the increase in the number of persons employed has lessened while

the unemployment rate has increased. Going forward the Board expects the domestic economy

will grow at a rate that does not diverge significantly from the path projected in April.

Consumption will continue to grow, while exports and facilities investment will also recover

gradually in the second half of this year, although the adjustment in construction investment

will continue. However, uncertainties concerning the forecast path have risen, chiefly due to the

escalation of the US-China trade dispute.

10


-----

- Consumer price inflation has slightly risen within the mid-0% range, in consequence mainly of

the smaller decline in petroleum product prices. Core inflation (with food and energy product

prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the upper-0% level, and the rate of inflation

expected by the general public has been at the low-2% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that

consumer price inflation will fluctuate for some time below 1% and then run at the low- to

mid-1% level from the second half of this year, but downside risks to the projected path have

increased somewhat. Core inflation will also gradually rise.

- The volatility of price variables in the domestic financial markets has increased, in line mainly

with movements in the international financial markets and concerns about economic slowdowns

at home and abroad. Long-term market interest rates and stock prices have fallen significantly

while the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has risen considerably. The rate of increase in

household lending has continued to slow, while housing prices have continued their downtrend.

- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of

economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level

over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is expected that

the domestic economy will continue to grow at a rate that does not diverge significantly from

its potential level and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be

high, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will

carefully monitor developments such as the US-China trade dispute, any changes in the

economies and monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions in

emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks,

while examining their effects on domestic growth and inflation.
