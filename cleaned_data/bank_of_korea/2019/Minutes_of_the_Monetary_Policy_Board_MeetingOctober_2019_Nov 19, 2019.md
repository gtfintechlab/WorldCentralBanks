Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation

```
After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments,[2)]_ _FX and International Finance_

_Trends, and_ _Financial Market Trends, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB)_

members covered the following areas:

Members assessed that, looking at the global economy, economic slumps in major countries had

worsened due to the growing negative spillover effects of the global trade slowdown, and concerns

about downside risks to the global economy had been gradually increasing accordingly. Members

evaluated that, in this regard, the US Federal Reserve and major central banks had strengthened

their accommodative monetary policy stances.

Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that the sluggishness in exports

and facilities investment had continued and private consumption growth had slowed slightly.

Members also judged that the sustained effects from worsening external conditions had increased the

possibility of the growth rate for this year falling short of the BOK’s July forecast. Some members

expressed the view that, without a recovery in private demand, the economy would remain sluggish

for a longer period of time than originally expected.

With regard to consumer prices, members saw that inflation had temporarily recorded a negative

figure, amid modest demand-side inflationary pressures combined with the effects of government

policies and the base effect from last year’s surge in agricultural, livestock and fisheries product

prices. Some members mentioned that core inflation and other inflation indicators reflecting

demand-side inflationary pressures had declined to the lower-1% level, and took the view that

attention should be paid to the possibility that the fall in underlying inflation could affect inflation

expectations.

Finally, as to household debt, members saw that its growth had slowed owing chiefly to

government measures, but judged that attention should be paid to the accelerated rise in unsecured

household loans amid the recent hike in housing prices in some regions.

Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

```
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea

Base Rate were as follows:

The majority of members presented the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and

international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate by

25 basis points at this meeting, while some members called for keeping it at its current level.

One member presented the view that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis

points to 1.25%.

The member saw that the global trade slowdown, which was causing simultaneous slumps in

major economies, had recently been worsening and was lasting longer than expected. The member

also pointed out that the negative impacts of global trade sluggishness had been increasing,

particularly in countries heavily dependent on trade. The member expressed concerns that, as

China’s economic indicators had recently been deteriorating even further, it was difficult to rule out

the possibility that the global economic slump affected by trade sluggishness could be amplified by

the Chinese economic slowdown.

The member judged that, as the global economic environment had been deteriorating further,

Korea’s export slump had also been worsening. The member also noted that, in terms of domestic

demand, facilities investment, which is closely related to exports, had remained lackluster and

private consumption growth had also remained stagnant at a low level or had even slowed slightly.

The member assessed that, in overall evaluation of recent domestic economic developments and the

trend of the environment surrounding the domestic economy, the growth rate for this year was

increasingly likely to fall below the Research Department’s July forecast and the risk of the current

economic slump being prolonged had risen.

Looking at prices, the member mentioned that consumer price inflation and core inflation had

both fallen to the 0% level and that growth both in domestically generated inflationary pressure

indicators with administered prices counted out and in prices of items sensitive to business cycles

had recently slowed to the lower-1% level. The member expressed concerns that, although inflation

in Korea had been expected to remain low throughout this year, the recent sluggishness of the real

economy, inflation, and ultimately the entire economy was increasingly likely to be prolonged. The

member argued that, while inflation had remained short of its target since 2013, core inflation had

declined to the 0% level this year, entering a new phase of sluggishness. The member pointed out

that, although public attention had been focused on the recent first-ever recording of negative

consumer price inflation, it would be necessary to pay more attention to the steady decline in core

inflation, which is seen to better reflect demand-side inflationary pressures and to be linked to

3


-----

inflation expectations in a more stable manner. The member stated that this sustained and rapid

decline in core inflation was unusual, and went on to stress that, since it increased the likelihood

of a divergence of inflation expectations from the target, aggressive measures should be taken to

manage inflation expectations, which is the ultimate goal of monetary policy.

Looking at current economic conditions in terms of the neutral interest rate, the member judged

that, with the potential growth rate continuing to decline, the global trade slowdown had been

acting as a shock pulling down the real neutral interest rate. The member’s assessment was that,

although the accommodative fiscal policy had been acting as a buffer against the real neutral

interest rate decline, this would have only a limited effect, considering the sluggish income and

inflation indicators. The member added that the fall in the nominal neutral interest rate could be

greater due to the sluggish inflation. The member evaluated that, in overall consideration of the

above, the current level of the Base Rate could be hardly seen as representing an accommodative

monetary policy, and in this regard, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis

points to 1.25% for now.

Another member stated that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points

from the current 1.50% to 1.25%.

Looking at the recent domestic and overseas economic conditions, the member noted that there

had been growing concerns about a global economic slowdown, particularly in the manufacturing

sector, as world trade growth had slowed significantly affected by the spread of trade protectionism

such as the US-China trade dispute and by the weakening of the international division of labor. The

member assessed that, since a deterioration in external conditions could have greater impacts on

Korea due to its high economic openness and heavy dependence on exports, downside risks to

domestic growth had been increasing. In terms of inflation, the member judged that, in addition to

these demand-side factors, government policies and supply-side factors including agricultural,

livestock and fisheries product prices had also contributed to the continuation of downward

pressures. The member presented the view that, in consideration of these domestic and foreign

economic conditions, it seemed inevitable that the growth and inflation forecasts for this year and

the next would be adjusted downward, and in this respect, it would be advisable to lower the Base

Rate by 25 basis points.

The member expressed the opinion that, if the Base Rate were cut at the current meeting, it

would be consistent with the Bank’s external communications that it would maintain its

accommodative monetary policy stance to support recovery of economic growth since the Base Rate

cut last July. However, the member also evaluated that a Base Rate cut in consideration of the

macroeconomic side, such as growth and inflation, could further increase the need to pay attention

to the financial stability side. The member mentioned that, since greater borrowing incentives and

stronger search for yield under the accommodative financial conditions could add to financial

4


-----

vulnerabilities, it would be necessary to further strengthen the monitoring of domestic flow of funds

going forward. The member also pointed out that, with housing prices in the Seoul metropolitan

region shifting to a rise recently, unsecured household loans, which had been less strictly regulated,

had been showing faster growth, and went on to stress that the government and the supervisory

authorities should play even more important roles in order to stabilize the housing market and

household debt and ensure the soundness and resilience of financial institutions.

Meanwhile, the member expressed the view that not only cyclical factors but also structural

factors such as the plunging birth rate, rapid population aging, and slowdown of productivity

growth, as well as institutional factors including increased public welfare support to promote the

stability of people’s livelihoods had contributed significantly to the prolongation of the low-growth,

low-inflation trend, and went on to argue that this could not be resolved by monetary policy

measures alone, which are designed to regulate the business cycle. The member added that, in this

respect, it would be crucial to step up aggressive structural reform efforts, and went on to state that

fiscal policy should be operated to contribute to stimulating the economy in the short term and also

to expanding growth potential and enhancing productivity over the medium- to long-term horizon.

One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate to 1.25%

from the current 1.50% at the present time to serve as a buffer against sluggish demand in the

private sector and downward pressures on inflation.

The member’s assessment of the domestic economy since the end of last year was that demand

in the private sector had stagnated and weak growth dependent on expansion in public sector

expenditure was continuing. The member noted that, in reflection of such sluggish domestic demand,

inflation was declining as well. The member evaluated that the recent negative consumer price

inflation seemed a transient phenomenon reflecting the base effect from the surge in agricultural

product prices during the same period of last year, but given that core inflation had remained below

1% recently and it had fallen to the lower-1% level when excluding administered prices, there was

a clear trend of underlying price inflation deviating from the target and declining over the past two

to three years.

The member took the view that it was difficult to be optimistic about future economic

conditions. The member pointed out that there were growing concerns about the global economy

due to the signs of an economic slowdown in the US, which had maintained solid growth. On the

domestic front, the member’s judgment was that, since sluggish domestic demand had not shown

any sign of recovery, for the time being it would be difficult to expect any significant economic

recovery beyond a technical rebound. The member voiced concern that if the economic sluggishness

continued, it could lead to a further decline in underlying price inflation, which would cause a

decrease in inflation expectations followed by a rise in the real interest rate, ultimately leading to

an economic slump. The member also expressed the opinion that a slowdown in the nominal

5


-----

growth rate following the decline in inflation would make it difficult to maintain tax revenue

growth, thereby acting as a major obstacle to expansionary fiscal policy.

Accordingly, the member evaluated that it was desirable to cut the Base Rate from the current

1.50% to 1.25% for now to provide a buffer against sluggish demand in the private sector and

downward pressures on inflation. The member’s assessment was that the 1.25% nominal level of the

Base Rate could not be assessed to be low under recent macroeconomic conditions with the

inflation falling to a historically low level, and that the real interest rate with underlying price

inflation excluded remained the highest among major advanced countries. The member emphasized,

meanwhile, that securing economic recovery in the medium- to long-term would require not only

short-term macroeconomic policy but also strengthened policy efforts to enhance competitiveness in

the private sector.

One member stated that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate from the current 1.50%

to 1.25%.

The member stated that downside risks to the world economy had further expanded since the

previous MPB meeting. The member raised the concern that, in the domestic economy, the

slowdowns in exports and facilities investment had continued, and private consumption, which had

seen modest growth, had recently been showing signs of slowing. The member presented the view

that employment had seen significant improvement of late due mainly to a base effect, but it was

too early to feel the effects from such improvement.

Looking at prices, the member’s assessment was that there were growing downside risks to the

price outlook, with consumer price inflation recording a negative figure in September. The member

was also concerned that core inflation was running within the 0% range and the trend of decline in

inflation expectations was continuing. The member noted that, for the moment, growth was falling

short of the potential rate, which was estimated in the mid-2% range, and consumer prices also

remained lower than the target. The member commented that this showed that low inflationary

pressures on the demand side were a major cause of the low inflation. The member presented the

view that, in light of this, there was a need to maintain an accommodative monetary policy.

The member, however, pointed out that the slowdown in exports and facilities investment and

the worsening of the labor market were attributable more to structural factors, such as the weakened

competitiveness of key industries, than to short-term cyclical factors, and thus there would be limits

to responding to them through monetary policy. The member thus emphasized that it would be

necessary to make constant efforts to increase the potential growth rate and raise the neutral real

interest rate by improving economic fundamentals.

The member saw that, although household debt growth had been slowing due mainly to strong

government measures, the already greatly increased debt size could work not only to cause

instability in the financial markets, but also to constrain private consumption, thus having negative

6


-----

impacts on the real economy. The member thus expressed the opinion that careful attention should

be paid in this regard in the future as well. The member noted that a close watch had been kept

on real estate market trends when deciding monetary policy, due to concerns about negative side

effects from excessive household debt growth. The member noted that, if the recent rise in real

estate prices in certain regions was not accompanied by a significant increase in household debt, the

real estate market would become a less significant consideration for monetary policy, but it was still

too early to be optimistic, with some pointing out that demand related to housing purchases was a

cause of the recent growth in unsecured household loans. The member thus added that close

monitoring of the relevant developments should continue.

Finally, the member had a positive view with respect to the strengthened accommodative

monetary policy stances of central banks of major countries including the US, since they would

allow us to focus more on domestic economic sluggishness when making monetary policy decisions.

The member set out the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and external

economic conditions mentioned above, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate from 1.50% to

1.25% at the present meeting.

Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its

current 1.50% level at this meeting and take more time to closely watch developments related to

the economy and inflation.

The member diagnosed that, in the global economy, trade conflicts between major countries and

geopolitical risks had been prolonged, while the growth momentum had continued to weaken. The

member evaluated that the growth slowdown had thus far been relatively modest, but the possibility

of a more severe slowdown stemming from changes in the policy environments of major countries

could not be ruled out. The member also saw that there had been some positive changes, such as

the recent slight weakening of risk aversion in the financial markets and the easing of

manufacturing sluggishness in some EMEs. The member, however, judged uncertainty surrounding

the future growth path to remain high, in that these positive trends could change again depending

upon how trade conflicts between major countries unfold in the future.

The member evaluated that the concentration of the global growth slowdown in tradable sectors

that were closely related to the domestic economy was putting downward pressures on domestic

growth. The member noted that, against this backdrop, the GDP growth rate in Q2 had fallen short

of expectations and the recovery of the semiconductor industry was likely to be pushed back

further. The member thus saw that the growth rate for this year was highly likely to fall below the

Research Department’s July forecast. The member, however, noted that some indicators, such as

service industry production, consumer sentiment, producer shipments, and facilities investment, had

been showing signs of improvement since the last MPB meeting, and thus close attention was being

paid to their sustainability. However, the member presented the opinion that, since the domestic and

7


-----

overseas policy environments remained fluid and macro indicators had become more volatile, it was

necessary to take a little more time to monitor the relevant indicators to see if the recent

developments would lead to meaningful recovery or would be mere one-off events.

The member, meanwhile, noted that there was heightened concern about the possibility of a

widening of the negative inflation gap due to the shift to negative consumer price inflation in

September. The member, however, expected that consumer price inflation would turn positive again

from the end of this year onward, when the base effect would weaken. The member presented the

view that, given movements of major asset prices and the counter-cyclicality of the won/dollar

exchange rate, it was quite unreasonable to view the recent price decline as a sign of deflation.

The member, however, pointed out that close attention should be paid to the possibility that

movements of these headline indexes and inflation expectations could influence each other

negatively, since year-on-year consumer price inflation had turned negative for the first time.

In overall consideration of the above, the member judged that, as domestic and overseas policy

uncertainties persisted, there still remained a high possibility that the downside risks to growth and

inflation that were of concern in the July forecast would be realized. However, given that a certain

degree of downside risk had already been taken into consideration in the course of making the

rate-cut decision in July, and most importantly that downside risks had not heightened further since

the August meeting while some indicators related to future economic trends were showing signs of

change, the member expressed the view that it would be desirable to take some time to judge the

sustainability of these developments. Moreover, the member judged that monetary policy at the

current level of the Base Rate was sufficiently accommodative, given overall financial conditions,

and added that it should also be considered that an expansionary fiscal policy had been adopted.

Accordingly, the member presented the view that the Base Rate should be kept unchanged at 1.50%

at the present meeting while future developments in economic activity and prices are further

observed.

Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its

current 1.50% level at this meeting and maintain the current macroeconomic policy mix.

The member saw that domestic economic growth remained low due to decreased potential

growth and negative base effects in the investment sector. The member assessed that, due to the

consequent sluggishness in demand, price inflation was slower than that in major advanced

economies, even when one-off supply-side price factors were taken into consideration. The member

thus presented the view that it was appropriate to stimulate demand through a macroeconomic

policy more accommodative than other advanced economies, as was currently being done. However,

the member added that, given the risk of financial imbalances, it was necessary to maintain the

current policy mix with a focus placed on expansionary fiscal policy, while paying attention to

developments in growth and inflation and adjusting the policy mix if necessary.

The member’s assessment was that the recent decline in Korea’s potential growth was

attributable to sluggish global manufacturing production and the decline in global trade volume. The

member saw that in the future domestic economic growth would return to the level of potential

growth, which had declined, as the base effect gradually dissipated. The member, however, raised

the concern that such a recovery could be pushed back further if the sustainability of private

consumption was not secured.

The member noted that a preemptive and more expansionary macroeconomic policy could be

considered in the current circumstances. The member, however, expressed the opinion that caution

should be exercised for the moment, since on the monetary policy side there remained a potential

risk of the accumulation of financial imbalances, while on the fiscal policy front a long-term plan

should first be established to prepare for population aging. The member diagnosed that financial

imbalances were side effects stemming from excessive investment going beyond the level the

economy could absorb, due to inappropriate macroprudential regulations in certain sectors or

excessive expansionary macroeconomic policy. The member emphasized that attention should be paid

to the points that excessive investment could lead to sluggishness in the capacity utilization ratio

and a decline in prices, and that a steep adjustment in financial imbalances caused by domestic and

overseas shocks could trigger a financial crisis. The member noted that a relatively high rate of

savings had been maintained in Korea. The member, however, commented that assets and debt were

expanding rapidly and were concentrated in the real estate market. The member pointed out that,

consequently, as the real purchasing power of real estate assets purchased in preparation for

population aging continued to decline, the real savings gap was actually widening.

Next, the member assessed that Korea’s fiscal position was relatively sound compared to those

of other advanced economies. The member saw that caution should be exercised in terms of fiscal

space, in consideration of the population aging issue. The member, however, presented the opinion

that it was first necessary to ease the shock from the structural decline in growth and protect

vulnerable groups.

Considering the level and mix of macroeconomic policies, the member saw that attention should

be paid to the points that unintended policy effects could be easily triggered due to the weakening

of economy, and that the recent demand slump was caused by the structural weakening of growth,

rather than by cyclical factors. The member thus expressed the view that it was desirable to keep

the Base Rate unchanged at the present meeting and maintain the current macroeconomic policy

mix.

Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

```
Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision

statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.

However, Dr. Lee, Il Houng and Dr. Lim, Jiwon expressed clear opposition to cutting the Base

Rate by 0.25 percentage points and argued for keeping it at the current level.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25

basis points, from 1.50% to 1.25%.

###### □ Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic

growth has continued to slow as trade has contracted. The global financial markets have shown

high levels of volatility, affected mainly by the uncertainties concerning the US-China trade

dispute and the sluggishness of economic indicators in major countries. Looking ahead, the

Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by

factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the changes in the monetary

policies of major countries, and geopolitical risks.

###### □ The Board judges that the pace of domestic economic growth has remained slow, as

consumption growth has weakened, while the adjustment in construction investment and the

sluggishness in exports and facilities investment have continued. Employment conditions have

partially improved, with the increase in the number of persons employed having risen. Going

forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to fall below the July projection, owing

chiefly to the continued US-China trade dispute and the heightened geopolitical risks.

###### □ Consumer price inflation recorded a negative rate, in consequence mainly of the declines in the

prices of petroleum products, agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, and public services.

Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the

mid-0% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has fallen to the

upper-1% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fall short of the

path projected in July and fluctuate for some time at around the 0% level, and then run in the

1% range from next year. Core inflation will also gradually rise.

10


-----

###### □ In the domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates and stock prices have risen

and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen, with major price variables fluctuating

considerably due to movements in the global financial markets. The rate of increase in

household lending has continued to slow. Housing prices have remained steady overall but have

risen in Seoul and its surrounding areas.

- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of

economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over

a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is expected that

domestic economic growth will be moderate and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the

demand side will remain at a low level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary

policy stance. In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy

accommodation, while observing any changes in macroeconomic and financial stability conditions

and the effects of the two Base Rate cuts. It will also carefully monitor the US-China trade

dispute, any changes in the economies and monetary policies of major countries, the trend of

increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.
