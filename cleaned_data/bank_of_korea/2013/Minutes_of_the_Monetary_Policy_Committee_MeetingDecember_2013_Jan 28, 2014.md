###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

  After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea',

 'FX and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following

 areas:

  Concerning the global economy, members’ assessment was that the

 trend of economic recovery in the US had been sustained, and that the

 sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appeared to be easing,

 with major sentiment indicators continually improving. Members also

 appraised economic growth trends in emerging market countries, above all

 China, to have been maintained. Many members expected the global

 economy to sustain its recovery going forward, centering around advanced

 countries, but forecast that factors such as the possibility of changes in

 global financial market conditions in line with QE tapering by the US

 Federal Reserve, and the continued US fiscal uncertainties, would act as

 downside risks to growth.

  Many members noted that, in the international financial markets, while

 global interest rates were rising, due mainly to improvements in economic

 indicators in advanced countries and to the expectations of early tapering

 by the US Federal Reserve, stock prices had risen, centering around

 advanced countries, although in some weak emerging market countries they

 had fallen in response to outflows of foreign investment funds.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members’ assessment was that it

 was maintaining its trend of recovery, as the current account had

 registered a huge surplus in November while the exceptional factors seen

 in the previous month had disappeared and real indicators related to

###### production and domestic demand were showing buoyancy.

 As to the future outlook, many members anticipated that the trend of

 domestic economic recovery would be moderate, as the pace of the global

 economic recovery was sluggish while destabilizing factors remained,

 including the intensification of the trend of Japanese yen weakening and

 the possibility of increases in financial and FX market volatility.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out

 that stock prices had fallen and interest rates had risen, amid foreigners’

 securities investment funds having flowed out on concerns about QE

 tapering by the US Federal Reserve, and that the Korean won had

 appreciated in line mainly with the current account surplus.

 Many members' judged that, with consumer price inflation maintaining

 its low level of around the 0% for the third consecutive month, due

 mainly to declines in agricultural product prices, there was an increased

 possibility of the low inflation lasting longer than expected if the stable

 trend of supply-side factors and the slow recovery of demand-side factors

 were to persist.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base

 Rate at its current level for the inter-meeting period, judging that the

 recent paths of growth and prices were not greatly different from those

 forecast in October, with prices maintaining their low upward trend and

 the domestic economy continuing its steady trend of recovery.

 One member expressed the opinion that the effects of monetary and

 fiscal policies should be examined so as to ensure that the trend of low

 growth and low inflation did not become permanent, while monitoring

 should be strengthened of foreign exchange market movements such as in
 and outflows of foreign currency funds and exchange rate volatility caused

 by changes in major countries’ monetary policies. He added that attention

 should be paid to factors disturbing the financial system, including the

 possibility of deterioration in fund-raising conditions for vulnerable sectors

 and the household debt situation.

 Another member commented that medium- and long-term interest rates

 were rising sharply, given the increasing expectations that the US Fed

 would implement its exit strategy before long due mainly to the

 improvement in US employment conditions. This rise in interest rates

 might, he added, significantly worsen the debt servicing burdens of

 households and businesses, and so a further strengthening was called for of

 efforts to stabilize market interest rates and prevent an excessive rate of

 growth in household lending exceeding the nominal GDP growth rate.

 One other member asserted that, in order to keep the foreign exchange

 and financial markets stable and minimize the negative effects of the

###### weakening yen, attention should be paid to preventing any excessive

 increases in exchange rate volatility. And to achieve this, he further

 stressed the importance of developing a buffer system, for example through

 the diversification of settlement currencies.

 One member presented the view in addition that attention should be

 paid to the facts that the share in overall bank lending of loans to SMEs

 had been decreasing since the financial crisis and, furthermore, that the

 share of credit-based loans in total bank lending to SMEs had also

 continued to decline.

 Finally, another member stated his opinion that, when setting the

 operating directions for its monetary and credit policies next year, the

 Bank of Korea should endeavor to enhance their effectiveness by

 objectively evaluating the outcomes of this year’s monetary and credit

 policy implementation.

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation of Monetary Policy Directions

 Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following

 statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Committee considers

 that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained

 and that the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area

 appears to have continued to ease, while economic growth trends in

 emerging market countries, above all China, have been maintained.

 The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its

 modest recovery going forward, but judges that the likelihood of

 changes in global financial market conditions related to QE tapering

 by the US Federal Reserve, and the continued US fiscal

 uncertainties remain as downside risks to growth.

 □ In Korea, the Committee appraises the economic recovery to be

 continuing in line with the trend of growth, as domestic demand

 and exports have both increased. On the employment front, the

 scale of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded

 substantially in line with increases in the 50-and-above age group

 and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the domestic

 economy will maintain a negative output gap for a considerable

 time going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will narrow.

 □ Consumer price inflation rose from 0.7% the previous month to

 0.9% in November, due mainly to the slower downward trends in

 the prices of agricultural and petroleum products, increases in the

 prices of some industrial goods and the hike in electricity charges.

###### Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices

 also rose from 1.6% to 1.8%. The Committee forecasts that, due

 largely to the stability of international agricultural prices, inflation

 will remain low for the time being, but that it will be higher than

 its current level. As for the housing market, sales prices in Seoul

 and its surrounding areas maintained their level of the previous

 month while the uptrend of those in the rest of the country

 increased slightly. The rise in leasehold-deposit prices slowed in

 Seoul and its surrounding areas, while the uptrend in the rest of

 the country kept to its pace of the previous month.

 □ In the domestic financial markets, stock prices have fallen

 substantially and long-term market interest rates have risen, affected

 by expectations of the US Federal Reserve’s QE tapering. The

 Korean won has strengthened while fluctuating in line with the

 influences of the continued current account surplus and outflows of

 foreigners’ securities investment funds.

 □ Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and

 the influences of external risk factors, and monitoring the effects of

 the Base Rate cut and of the government’s economic policies

 including the supplementary budget, the Committee will conduct

 monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the

 inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring

 that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of

 slow growth.
