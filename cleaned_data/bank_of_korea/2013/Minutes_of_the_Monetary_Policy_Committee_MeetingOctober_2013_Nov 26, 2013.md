###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

  After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea',

 'FX and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following

 areas:

 Concerning the global economy, members’ assessment was that, while

 the moderate economic recovery in the US had been sustained, the

 economic sluggishness in the euro area showed signs of easing and the

 modest recovery in Japan had been maintained, bolstered by an expansion

 in domestic demand, economic growth in some emerging market countries

 had slowed, influenced in part by financial instability. Many members

 expected the global economy to sustain its recovery going forward,

 centering around advanced countries, but forecast that factors such as the

 heightening of uncertainties surrounding the US government budget bill and

 debt ceiling increase, fiscal uncertainties in major countries, and the

 likelihood of changes in global financial market conditions related to QE

 tapering by the US Federal Reserve would act as downside risks to

 growth.

 Many members noted that, in the international financial markets,

 long-term interest rates in major countries had fallen substantially and stock

 prices had risen, while the US dollar had shifted to a trend of depreciation

 and the financial instability in some emerging market countries had eased

 temporarily, as the US Federal Reserve, contrary to market expectations,

 had decided to keep the amount of its asset purchases unchanged.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members assessed that it had been

 sustaining its modest pace of growth of late, as domestic demand such as

###### for consumption and investment had increased and as exports showed

 buoyancy, helped chiefly by the Base Rate cut and the stimulus measures

 taken by the government.

 As to the future outlook, many members anticipated that the negative

 output gap would steadily narrow, owing for example to the gradual

 improvements in external conditions.

 Members pointed out that the domestic financial markets had shown

 stable movements, with stock prices rising sharply as foreigners’ domestic

 stock investment had expanded significantly, while interest rates had fallen

 and the Korean won had appreciated slightly.

 Most members mentioned that consumer price inflation stood at a low

 level of below 1%, affected largely by decreases in the prices of

 agricultural and petroleum products. Many members forecast that consumer

 price inflation would remain low for the time being going forward, due to

 demand-side inflationary pressures being mild given the sluggish aggregate

 demand, on top of the exceptional price stability of supply-side factors and

 institutional factors related to social welfare.

 Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that it would be desirable to hold the

 Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, as, with prices

 sustaining their low upward trend, the domestic economy appeared to be

 improving, albeit moderately.

 One member expressed the opinion that, although the continuous

 current account surplus could be seen from the microeconomic perspective

###### as a result of the enhanced global competitiveness of Korean goods and

 services, attention should be directed from the macroeconomic perspective

 to the question of whether it implied that there was a big change taking

 place in the composition of expenditure by economic sector.

 Another member took the view that it was necessary to strengthen the

 monitoring of in- and outflows of short-term speculative capital, of the

 series of failures of large corporations, and of the possibility of a credit

 crunch in the corporate bond and CP markets, in order to prevent them

 from acting as factors destabilizing the domestic financial markets.

 Another member pointed out that, taking into account the high degree

 of openness of the Korean financial markets and their asymmetric

 characteristics, it would be necessary to move away from reliance on

 foreign reserve accumulation or macro-prudential regulations in the foreign

 exchange sector and to devise multifaceted measures for achieving foreign

 exchange market stabilization.

 In addition, one member mentioned that it would be necessary to

 closely examine the trends of early warning indicators such as the ratio of

 domestic credit and liabilities to GDP and the debt service ratio, and,

 while encouraging leverage adjustments in each economic sector, to strive

 constantly to improve the domestic economic fundamentals in the medium

 and long term through restructuring.

 Finally, another member pointed out that the current low inflation

 should be seen as disinflation, a slight slowing down in the rate of

 inflation, rather than as deflation, a declining in the level of prices itself,

 and expressed the view that undertaking an overall review of consumer

 price inflation, inflation expectations and the inflation target range, and, if

 necessary, establishing an inflation targeting regime appropriate to the new

 economic situation and circumstances were very important tasks.

###### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation of Monetary Policy Directions

 Reflecting the outcome of these discussions, the following Monetary

 Policy Decision statement was prepared and then unanimously approved by

 the members:

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 that the economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that

 the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears to

 be easing, while the trends of economic growth in emerging market

 countries, above all China, have shown signs of recovery to some

 extent. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will

 sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the

 heightening of uncertainties surrounding the US government budget

 bill and debt ceiling increase, and the likelihood of changes in

 global financial market conditions related to QE tapering by the US

 Federal Reserve are acting as downside risks to growth.

 □ In Korea, the Committee appraises the moderate economic growth

 to be continuing, with exports showing buoyancy and domestic

 demand also improving. On the employment front, the scale of

 increase in the number of persons employed has expanded in line

 with increases in the 50-and-above age group and the service

 sector. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will

 maintain a negative output gap for a considerable time going

 forward, although it forecasts that the gap will narrow.

 □ Consumer price inflation fell from 1.3% the previous month to

 0.8% in September, due mainly to declines in the prices of

 agricultural and petroleum products, but core inflation excluding

###### agricultural and petroleum product prices rose from 1.3% to 1.6%.

 The Committee forecasts that, despite increases in some public

 utility fees, inflation will remain low for the time being, owing

 primarily to the inflation reducing effects of policies such as free

 childcare provision and to the downward stabilization of

 international agricultural prices. As for the housing market, the

 scale of decline in sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas

 narrowed while the uptrend of those in the rest of the country

 continued. The increase in leasehold-deposit prices in Seoul and its

 surrounding areas meanwhile accelerated, and the uptrend in these

 prices in the rest of the country continued.

 □ The domestic financial markets have shown generally stable

 movements, due in large part to the scale of QE in the US

 remaining unchanged. Stock prices have risen substantially and the

 Korean won has appreciated, driven mainly by net inflows of

 foreigners’ stock investment funds. Long-term market interest rates

 have fallen slightly in line with those in major economies.

 □ Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and

 the influences of external risk factors, and monitoring the effects of

 the Base Rate cut and of the government’s economic policies

 including the supplementary budget, the Committee will conduct

 monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the

 inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring

 that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of

 slow growth.
