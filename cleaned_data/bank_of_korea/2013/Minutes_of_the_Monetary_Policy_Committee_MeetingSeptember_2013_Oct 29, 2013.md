###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

  After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea',

 'FX and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following

 areas:

 Concerning the global economy, members’ assessment was that the

 moderate economic recovery in the US had been sustained and the

 economic sluggishness in the euro area showed signs of easing, while

 economic growth in some emerging market countries continued to

 deteriorate affected mainly by export sluggishness and capital outflows.

 Many members expected the global economy to sustain its modest recovery

 going forward, due largely to continuation of the U.S. economic recovery,

 but forecast that factors such as the possibility of slower economic growth

 in emerging market countries including natural resource exporters, and

 changes in global financial market conditions would act as downside risks

 to growth.

 Many members mentioned that the international financial markets had

 shown a somewhat unstable appearance, with for example the volatilities

 of price variables including stock prices, interest rates and exchange rates

 rising and a concentration of global investment funds at the short-term end

 of the market, in line with the growing possibility of QE tapering by the

 US Federal Reserve. 

  Concerning the domestic economy, members assessed that it was

 maintaining its modest growth, as domestic demand such as for

 consumption and investment had increased and as exports showed

 buoyancy, helped chiefly by the Base Rate cut and the stimulus measures

###### taken by the government.

  As to the future outlook, many members anticipated that the negative

 output gap would steadily narrow, assisted largely by gradual

 improvements in external conditions.

  With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out

 that, after having declined under the influence of the movements of major

 country government bond yields, long-term market interest rates had risen

 with the improvements in economic indicators, causing the spread between

 long- and short-term rates to widen. They went on to note that stock

 prices had fallen again, after having risen due mainly to increases in

 global stock prices and to inflows of foreign capital, while the Korean

 won had appreciated slightly.

 Many members mentioned that consumer price inflation had maintained

 a low level in the lower- to mid-1% range, affected largely by low

 demand-side pressures and by factors on the supply side. Many members

 forecast that, despite increases in international oil prices, consumer price

 inflation would remain low for the time being, owing primarily to the

 inflation reducing effects of policies such as free childcare provision and to

 the downward stabilization of international agricultural prices.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that it would be desirable to hold the

 Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, as with prices

 sustaining their low upward trend the domestic economy appeared to be

 improving, albeit moderately.

 One member expressed the opinion that there was a need to analyze

 the influence of QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve on the Korean

 economy from various perspectives, and to closely monitor the related

 developments. He noted in particular that special attention should be paid

 to the possibility of greatly increased exchange rate and capital flow

 volatility in the future, caused by the differences in timings of major

 countries’ exit strategies.

 Another member pointed out the need to prepare against the

 possibilities of either foreign capital in- or outflows occurring, by

 expanding the remit of the market stabilization measures that had been

 established based on the assumption that there would be a sharp rise in

 the Korean won/U.S. dollar exchange rate and sudden foreign capital

 outflows at times of external shock occurrence. He went on to comment

 that attention should also be paid to measures for utilizing the foreign

 capital that was entering in a way so as to help the expansion of Korea’s

 economic growth potential.

 Another member noted that, in view of the factors contributing to the

 vulnerability of the Korean economy, such as the excessive household debt

 level and low corporate profitability, as a precaution against further

 expansions of financial unrest in emerging market countries there was a

 need to thoroughly prepare measures in advance for responding to any

###### sudden reversal of foreign capital flows.

 One member in addition asserted that, while establishing a risk

 management system related to domestic risk factors, in order to mitigate

 financial uncertainties caused by the spread of external shocks and to

 prevent financial contagion, the early warning system should be

 strengthened so that it could identify vulnerabilities of the economy in

 advance and thus be utilized effectively and appropriately in the policy

 decision-making process.

 Another member expressed the view finally that, while keeping a close

 eye on the effects of the government’s measures to stabilize the leasehold

 deposit and monthly rent markets, and on the influence of the increases in

 leasehold–deposit prices on the real economy and financial markets, it was

 necessary to examine whether there were institutional or structural factors

 compounding the household debt problems.

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation of Monetary Policy Directions

 Reflecting the outcome of these discussions, the following Monetary

 Policy Decision statement was prepared and then unanimously approved by

 the members:

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 that the moderate economic recovery in the US has been sustained

 and that economic activities in the euro area appear to be emerging

 from their sluggishness to some degree, but that trends of

 economic growth in emerging market countries have differed from

 country to country. The Committee forecasts that the global

 economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, helped

 primarily by improvements in the US economy, but judges that the

 uncertainties surrounding the scale of QE tapering by the US

 Federal Reserve and the implementations of fiscal consolidation in

 major countries, the financial instability in some emerging

 economies, and the geopolitical risk in the Middle East remain as

 downside risks to growth.

 □ In Korea, the Committee appraises the moderate economic growth

 to be continuing, with exports and consumption improving. On the

 employment front, the scale of increase in the number of persons

 employed has expanded in line with increases in the 50-and-above

 age group and the service sector. The Committee expects that the

 domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for a

 considerable time going forward, although it forecasts that the gap

 will gradually narrow.

###### □ Consumer price inflation declined slightly to 1.3% in August, from

 1.4% the previous month, and core inflation excluding the prices of

 agricultural and petroleum products also fell slightly to 1.3% from

 1.5%. The Committee forecasts that inflation will remain low for

 the time being despite an increase in international oil prices, owing

 primarily to the inflation reducing effects of policies such as free

 childcare provision and to the downward stabilization of

 international agricultural prices. As for the housing market, sales

 prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas maintained their

 downtrend while the uptrend of those in the rest of the country

 slowed. The increase in leasehold-deposit prices in Seoul and its

 surrounding areas meanwhile accelerated, and the uptrend in these

 prices in the rest of the country continued.

 □ In the domestic financial markets, despite the heightened volatility

 in the international financial markets and the instabilities in the

 financial and foreign exchange markets of some emerging

 economies, stock prices have risen and the Korean won has

 appreciated, due mainly to the net inflows of foreigners’ stock

 investment funds. Long-term market interest rates have fluctuated

 within a relatively narrow range.

 □ Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and

 the influences of external risk factors, and monitoring the effects of

 the Base Rate cut and of the government’s economic policies

 including the supplementary budget, the Committee will conduct

 monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the

 inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring

 that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of

 slow growth.
