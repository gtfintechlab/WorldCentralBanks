###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

  After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', 'FX

 and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the

 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas:

 Members’ assessment was that the overall recovery of the global

 economy was very modest, with the euro area economy remaining sluggish

 and with the trends of improvements in the U.S. and Chinese economies

 falling short of expectations. Many members mentioned that the

 international financial markets were sustaining favorable trends, owing

 mainly to the continued quantitative easing policies of major economies

 and the easing of the euro-area fiscal crisis.

 Members assessed that the domestic economy continued to display

 weak growth, despite exports sustaining their albeit moderate recovery, as

 indicators related to domestic demand alternated between improvement and

 worsening.

 Concerning the outlook, many members anticipated that the negative output

 gap would continue for a considerable length of time, as the pace of economic

 recovery remained modest owing primarily to the slow global economic

 recovery, the weakening of the Japanese yen, and the geopolitical risk.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out

 that stock prices and the exchange rate had fluctuated substantially, under

 the combined effects of geopolitical risk and concerns about the worsening

 of corporate performances, and the consequent outflows of foreigners’

 portfolio funds.

 Many members mentioned that consumer price inflation had maintained

 its low level at around the 1% range, due in large part to declines in

###### agricultural, livestock and marine product prices and to the stabilization of

 international commodity prices. Many members forecast that inflation would

 remain low for the time being, provided there were no occurrences of

 exceptional factors on the supply side.

 Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Many members shared the opinion that, as the recent speed of

 economic recovery was the slowest since that during the Asian Currency

 Crisis in 1997, and as consideration should be given to harmonization with

 the government’s economic policies, it would be desirable to lower the

 Base Rate by 25 basis points from its current level for the intermeeting

 period, even though the domestic economy was forecast to show a trend

 of improvement, albeit moderate, amid domestic price stability.

 One member was of the opinion that the Bank of Korea should on the

 one hand work to constantly refine its monetary policy instruments, by

 examining the side-effects arising from the prolongation of low interest

 rates, the controversies related to the stimulative effect of Base Rate

 adjustment and the effectiveness of the recently reorganized Aggregate

 Credit Ceiling Loan, while on the other hand also strengthen its efforts, as

 the central bank, to put forward policy alternatives for the sound

 development of the Korean economy in view of the heightened concerns

 over entrenchment of a trend of low growth caused by the recent delay in

 economic recovery.

 Another member expressed the view that, while paying attention to

 preventing entrenchment of the trend of low inflation - which had been

 below the BOK’s medium-term inflation target for an extended period - the

###### Bank of Korea should closely monitor the movements of domestic demand

 which, centering around consumption, had not as yet recovered.

 One other member mentioned that a Base Rate cut at this point in

 time was somewhat overdue, but that it would still make an important

 contribution to the strengthening of the weak economic recovery, to the

 improvement of investor sentiment in the private sector, to the reduction

 of uncertainties in the foreign exchange and financial markets, and going

 further to the easing of excessive expectations of Korean won appreciation.

 One member pointed out in addition the need to bear in mind that the

 wasteful costs to the national economy due to the continued controversy

 about the lack of coordination between macro-economic policies could be

 greater, at this point in time, than the opportunity costs arising from a 25

 basis point reduction in the margin for a further rate cut.

 Meanwhile, another member expressed the opinion that, although the

 growth rate had fallen somewhat short of economic agents’ expectations, it

 would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at its current level during

 the intermeeting period, since the need for additional quantitative easing to

 stimulate the economy was small given the potential growth rate, recent

 GDP data and expected growth path of the Korean economy, and the

 accommodative liquidity conditions.

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation of Monetary Policy Directions

 Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the members

 compiled a statement that reflected the views of the majority.

 However, Mr. Moon, Woosik expressed clear opposition to the idea of

 lowering the Base Rate by 25 basis points, and argued for holding it

 unchanged at its current level.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 - The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

###### today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 2.75% to

 2.50%.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 the moderate economic recovery in the US to have continued but

 the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have

 deepened, while the trends of improvement in economic indicators

 in emerging market countries such as China have been weaker than

 initially anticipated, with the result that some central banks,

 including the ECB, have cut their policy rates. The Committee

 expects the global economy to continue its modest recovery going

 forward, but judges that the downside risks to growth remain

 considerable due chiefly to uncertainties related for instance to the

 sluggishness of economic activity in the euro area and to the

 implementations of fiscal consolidation in major countries.

 □ In Korea, exports have maintained their trend of recovery, albeit at

 a modest pace, but the Committee appraises economic growth to

 have remained weak, with indicators related to domestic demand

 alternating between improvement and worsening. On the employment

 front, the increase in the number of persons employed has

 accelerated, centering around the 50-and-above age group. Going

 forward there is no change to the Committee’s forecast that the

 domestic economy will show a negative output gap for a

 considerable time, due mostly to the slow recovery of the global

 economy, to the influence of Japanese yen weakening, and to the

 geopolitical risk in Korea.

###### □ Consumer price inflation recorded 1.2% in April, a level similar to

 that in the previous month (of 1.3%). Core inflation excluding the

 prices of agricultural and petroleum products was 1.4%, also similar

 to its March level of 1.5%. The Committee forecasts that inflation

 will remain low for the time being, provided there are no

 occurrences of exceptional factors on the supply side. As for

 housing prices, the downtrend of those in Seoul and its surrounding

 areas slowed as transactions increased, and those in the rest of the

 country continued on their moderate uptrend.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices and the exchange rate have

 fluctuated substantially under the influence chiefly of concerns about

 geopolitical risk in Korea and about worsening corporate

 performances, and the consequent outflows of foreigner stock

 investment funds. Long-term market interest rates, while greatly

 influenced by foreigners’ investment in bond futures, have fluctuated

 in response to changes in expectations related to monetary policy

 and the economy.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee will closely monitor the effects of

 the Base Rate cut and the economic policies of the government

 including the supplementary budget, strive to improve the sentiments

 of economic agents and lower inflation expectations, and conduct

 monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the

 inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring

 that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of

 slow growth.
