###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

  After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea',

 'FX and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following

 areas:

 Concerning the global economy, members’ assessment was that the

 moderate economic recovery in the US had been sustained but the

 sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area had continued, while

 emerging market countries such as China had shown slightly lower

 economic growth than initially anticipated. Many members expected the

 global economy to sustain its modest recovery going forward, mainly due

 to active countercyclical policies in major countries, but judged that such

 factors as the possibility of a tapering off of US quantitative easing and

 fiscal uncertainties would remain as downside risks to growth.

 Many members noted that, in the international financial markets, stock

 prices and the values of the currencies of some emerging market countries

 had declined significantly, influenced by a sharp rise in long-term interest

 rates in major countries and a reversal of global capital flows, affected by

 concerns about the earlier-than-expected tapering off of the US Fed’s

 quantitative easing.

 Members assessed the domestic economy as sustaining its economic

 growth, albeit weak, despite declines in consumption and facilities

 investment, as exports had improved and construction investment had

 increased to a great extent.

 Concerning the future outlook, many members anticipated that the

 negative output gap would continue for a considerable length of time, as

 the pace of economic recovery remained modest owing primarily to the

###### slow recovery of the global economy.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out

 that stock prices had shifted to sharp declines, long-term market interest

 rates had risen significantly, and the Korean won had also depreciated to

 a considerable extent, affected mainly by the possibility of an

 earlier-than-expected tapering off of US quantitative easing.

 Many members mentioned that consumer price inflation had maintained

 its low level of around the 1% level, due in large part to decreases in the

 prices of agricultural and petroleum products. Many members forecast that,

 although inflation would remain stable for the time being as demand-side

 pressures were weak, it would rise gradually from the latter half of 2013,

 influenced for instance by an increase in the prices of agricultural and

 marine products and by a base effect.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

  Members shared the opinion that it would be desirable to hold the

 Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period as the domestic

 economy had maintained its trend of improvement amid stable prices, and

 as it was forecast to sustain its trend of recovery, albeit moderate, going

 forward due mainly to the gradual recovery of the global economy, despite

 risk factors at home and abroad.

 One member was of the opinion that, in preparation for a possible

 intensification of market instability brought about by changes in the

 monetary policy stance in major countries, the Bank of Korea should

 reexamine its policy instruments to enable it to respond promptly when

 necessary, and that it should at the same time pay attention to measures

 to improve market confidence in order to enhance the policy effect.

 Another member stated his opinion that, as the timing of the US Fed’s

 tapering off of its quantitative easing had become a critical issue, with

 respect to its possible effects on the Korean economy, the Bank of Korea

 should consider the possibilities of both large capital inflows and outflows

 and come up with appropriate measures for either scenario. Notably, he

 expressed the view that it would also be necessary to monitor and develop

 measures in response to the increases in capital flows and sharp

 fluctuations in exchange rates that might be caused by the different timing

 of the unwinding of quantitative easing by major countries such as the US

 and Japan.

 Another member mentioned that the Bank of Korea should pay

 attention to strengthening financial system stability by, for example,

###### mitigating the potential risks of vulnerable groups, while taking care to

 ensure that household debt which had been steadily increasing of late did

 not escalate into systemic risks.

 Furthermore, noting that domestic demand in terms of consumption and

 investment remained sluggish although exports were showing a somewhat

 favorable performance, one member pointed out that it was urgent for the

 sustainable growth and stability of domestic economy to make efforts to

 fundamentally improve those factors limiting investment and consumption

 and to seek new sources of growth.

 Lastly, emphasizing the need for an approach to the causes of the

 slow growth that accorded with a focus on the structural contraction of

 private consumption rather than attributing it solely to the sluggish global

 economy, another member suggested it was necessary to ascertain whether 

 the critical point had now been reached beyond which the recovery of

 private consumption would be held back for a long time by the influence

 of household debt.

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation of Monetary Policy Directions

 Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following

 Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled and was approved

 unanimously by the members.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 the moderate economic recovery in the US to have continued but

 economic activities in the euro area to have remained sluggish,

 while emerging market countries such as China have shown slightly

 lower economic growth than initially anticipated. The Committee

 expects the global economy to sustain its modest recovery going

 forward, but judges that the uncertainties related for instance to the

 possibility of an earlier-than-expected tapering off of US

 quantitative easing policy and to the implementations of fiscal

 consolidation in major countries remain as downside risks to

 growth.

 □ In Korea, consumption and facilities investment have declined but

 the Committee appraises economic growth to be continuing, albeit

 weakly, as exports have improved and construction investment has

 increased to a great extent. On the employment front, the number

 of persons employed has increased, centering around the

 50-and-above age group and the service sector. Due to a slowdown

 in the uptrend in employment in the manufacturing sector, however,

 the increase was smaller in May than in the previous month. Going

 forward there is no change to the Committee’s forecast that the

 domestic economy will show a negative output gap for a

 considerable time, due mostly to the slow recovery of the global

 economy.

###### □ Consumer price inflation declined to 1.0% in May, from 1.2% the

 previous month, owing mainly to decreases in the prices of

 agricultural and petroleum products, while core inflation excluding

 agricultural and petroleum product prices rose to 1.6%, from 1.4%

 in April. The Committee forecasts that inflation will remain low for

 the time being, provided there are no occurrences of exceptional

 factors on the supply side such as fluctuations in the prices of

 international oil and agricultural products. As for housing prices,

 those in Seoul and its surrounding areas remained generally steady,

 and those in the rest of the country continued their slight uptrend.

 □ In the domestic financial markets, just as in the international

 financial markets, stock prices have reversed to sharp declines,

 affected mainly by the possibility of an earlier-than-expected

 tapering off of US quantitative easing. Long-term market interest

 rates have risen significantly and the Korean won has also

 depreciated to a considerable extent.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring the trends

 of changes in external risk factors and the effects of the previous

 month’s Base Rate cut and the economic policies of the

 government, including the supplementary budget, will conduct

 monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the

 inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring

 that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of

 slow growth.
