###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

 After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy

 Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas:

 Members’ assessment was that, despite the continued sluggishness of

 the euro area economy, the global economy was sustaining a recovery,

 albeit weak, on the strength of improvements in US and emerging market

 economies. Many members pointed out that, although the international

 financial markets remained generally stable, due to the easing for now of

 concerns about the US fiscal cliff and to the expanded quantitative easing

 in major countries, the possibility of market instability recurring still

 remained.

 Most members assessed the domestic economy as continuing its weak

 growth with indicators related to exports and domestic demand alternating

 between improving and worsening.

 Concerning the outlook, members anticipated that, although the extent

 of increase in exports would rise as the trend of improvement in the

 world economy continued, it would likely to take some time for the

 economy to return to its long-term growth trend since the recovery of

 domestic demand was constrained.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out

 that stock prices had risen and the Korean won had appreciated against

 the US dollar, due to inflows of foreigners’ securities investment funds in

 consequence of the overall improvement in international financial market

 conditions, and that market interest rates had shifted to a declining trend,

 primarily on expectations of further Base Rate cuts.

###### Many members noted that, helped by the stability of livestock and

 petroleum product prices, consumer price inflation was running at around

 the 1% level, and forecast that, with the negative output gap continuing

 amid stable international commodity prices, it would remain low for the

 time being.

 With regard to real estate prices, one member mentioned that, housing

 prices were continuing their downtrend, due mainly to economic

 uncertainties and the spread of expectations of housing price decline. He

 went on to note that, although housing leasehold deposit prices were

 sustaining their upward trend, their pace of increase was slowing somewhat.

 After the members’ discussions, the 1[st] Vice Minister of Strategy and

 Finance, the government representative, made the following comments and

 then left the room before the Base Rate was discussed:

 While major economic indicators had improved amid the stabilized

 domestic inflation, employment had slowed and investment remained

 sluggish. In addition, there were growing concerns about the deteriorating

 export competitiveness and business profitability due to continuing

 uncertainties of the global economy and to the falling exchange rate. The

 government plans to strengthen its policy measures to enhance economic

 dynamism, for example through facilitation of investment, while closely

 monitoring economic conditions at home and abroad.

 Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

###### Most members shared the opinion that, although domestic economic

 activity was forecast to continue its weak trend of growth while prices

 would likely remain stable for a considerable time, given that the

 uncertainties at home and abroad were gradually decreasing, it would be

 best to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting

 period, while closely monitoring changes in the financial and economic

 environments at home and abroad. 

 Some of these members expressed the opinion that, while paying

 attention to the recent situation of continuing foreign capital inflows due

 to the easing of global financial market unease and the abundant global

 liquidity, and of plunging exchange rates, there was a need for directing

 various efforts to the easing of exchange rate volatility. They also pointed

 out that attention needed to be paid to the possibility that the recent

 upward pressures on the won, if protracted for long at levels greatly

 estranged from domestic economic fundamentals, might have increasingly

 negative effects on the real economy and cause misalignments of price

 variables including exchange and interest rates.

 One other member presented the view that, since the household debt

 issue was closely related with structural changes in the domestic economy,

 such as the imbalance in income distribution between businesses and

 households and the reversal of long-running unidirectional real estate price

 expectations, and that it had a direct effect on expansion of the growth

 potential, the various policy authorities should take comprehensive

 measures to cope with this issue, with a focus on the fundamental changes

 in the economic structure.

 Meanwhile, another member expressed the opinion that, although the

 global economic uncertainties had eased somewhat, considering the

 persisting downside risks and the weaker-than-expected recovery of the

 domestic economy it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 25

 basis points.

###### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation of Monetary Policy Directions

 Taking into consideration the results of the discussions earlier, members

 compiled a statement reflecting the views of the majority.

 However, Mr. Ha, Seong Keun expressed clear opposition to the idea

 of holding the Base Rate at its current level, and argued for a 0.25

 percentage point cut.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 the moderate economic recovery in the US to have continued but

 the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have

 persisted, while economic indicators in emerging market countries

 have shown signs of improvement. The Committee expects the

 global economy to exhibit a modest recovery going forward but

 judges that the uncertainties related for instance to the fiscal crisis

 in the euro area and to fiscal consolidation in the US have not

 lifted and remain as downside risks to growth.

 □ In Korea, the Committee appraises economic growth to have

 remained at a weak level, with indicators related to exports and

 domestic demand alternating between improving and worsening. On

 the employment front, the increase in number of persons employed

 in December was somewhat smaller than that the month before, a

 result mainly of weak construction sector employment due to bad

 weather conditions. Going forward, the Committee anticipates that

 the negative output gap in the domestic economy will persist for a

 considerable time, due mostly to the slow recovery of the global

 economy in consequence chiefly of the sluggishness of economic

 activities in the euro area.

 □ Consumer price inflation fell to 1.4% in December, from 1.6% the

 previous month, owing primarily to the stability in prices of

 livestock products and industrial goods, and core inflation excluding

###### the prices of agricultural and petroleum products continued to run at

 a low level at 1.2%. The Committee forecasts that inflation will

 remain low for the time being, owing primarily to the easing of

 demand-side pressures. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its

 surrounding areas continued on their downtrend and those in the

 rest of the country on their uptrend.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices have risen and the Korean

 won has appreciated against the US dollar, due mostly to the

 additional quantitative easing policies of major advanced countries

 and to international financial market stability. Long-term market

 interest rates have fallen from their end-November levels, fluctuating

 in response mainly to the economic outlook and to developments in

 the negotiations on fiscal consolidation in the US.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee will closely monitor external risk

 factors and the consequent changes in financial and economic

 conditions at home and abroad, continue its efforts to lower

 inflation expectations, and conduct monetary policy so as to keep

 consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a

 medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not

 eroded due to the continuation of slow growth.
