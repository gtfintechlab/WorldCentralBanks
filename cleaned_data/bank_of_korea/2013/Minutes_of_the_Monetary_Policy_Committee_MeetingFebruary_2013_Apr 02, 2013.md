###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

 After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea', 'FX and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the

 discussions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered

 the following areas:

 Members’ assessment was that, despite the continued sluggishness of

 the euro area economy, the global economy was maintaining its modest

 recovery on the strength of improvements in the U.S. and in emerging

 market economies. Many members mentioned that the international

 financial markets were sustaining a favorable trend, owing mainly to

 improvements in global economic conditions and to major countries’

 expansions of their quantitative easing policies.

 Most members assessed the domestic economy as continuing its weak

 pace of growth, despite increasing exports, with domestic demand-related

 indicators alternating between improvement and worsening.

 Concerning the outlook, many members anticipated that, while the

 Korean economy would show improvement, due in large part to the global

 economic recovery amid improving consumer and investor sentiment, the

 pace of this improvement would be slow.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out

 that stock prices had fallen while the KRW/USD rate had risen, due

 mostly to concerns about possible deteriorations in performance of some

 exporters owing to the weakness of the Japanese yen, amid the emergence

 of North-Korea related geopolitical risks.

###### Consumer price inflation had been recorded around the 1% level, owing

 to the stability of domestic petroleum product prices and despite agricultural

 product price instability due to cold spells and hikes in some public utility

 charges. Many members judged that, despite concerns about the rise in

 international oil prices, and imbalances between agricultural product supply

 and demand, inflation would remain low for the time being due for

 example to the easing of demand-side pressures.

 With regard to real estate prices, one member observed that housing

 prices were continuing their downtrend and housing leasehold deposit prices

 their uptrend, due mainly to the continuing economic uncertainties and the

 spread of expectations of housing price declines.

 After the members’ discussions, the 1[st] Vice Minister of Strategy and

 Finance, the government representative, made the following comments and

 then left the room before the Base Rate was discussed:

 While major real economic indicators had improved amid sustained

 price stability, employment had slowed and consumption had been

 somewhat weak. Uncertainties concerning economic conditions remained,

 due mainly to the negotiations on the U.S. sequester and the delay in

 recovery of the European economy on the international front, and to

 sluggish consumption and exchange rate fluctuations domestically. The

 government planned to continue its policy measures to enhance economic

 dynamism, while closely monitoring domestic and international economic

 developments and strengthening its monitoring of financial and foreign

 exchange markets.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Most members shared the opinion that, although the trend of growth in

 domestic economic activity remained weak and prices were stable, given

 that the domestic economy was moving in the direction of recovery, albeit

 a weak one, it would be best to keep the Base Rate at its current level

 during the intermeeting period, while closely monitoring changes in the

 financial and economic environments at home and abroad. 

 One of these members presented the opinion that, for stability of the

 foreign exchange and financial markets and the corporate business

 activities, it was necessary to put into place a system to mitigate excessive

 exchange rate volatility, while at the same time pushing ahead actively

 with plans to facilitate international policy cooperation in the medium- to

 long-term, such as the Korea-China currency swap-financed trade settlement

 facility.

 Another member asserted that, while attention should be paid to 

 harmonize operation of macroprudential policy － to reduce the factors

 disturbing the financial markets, such as the household debt situation and

 the deterioration in fund-raising conditions of those with poor credit ratings

 － and of microprudential policy targeting individual financial institutions,

 monitoring should also be strengthened of the concentration of funds in

 the markets and the intensification of loan discrimination.

 One other member, while stressing the needs for improvement of

 household sector fundamentals and for structural reforms in the corporate

 sector so as to expand the growth potential of the economy, suggested

###### that, particularly with regard to support for SMEs, the central bank should

 consider plans for more active use of its credit policies including its

 Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans, rather than indiscriminate Base Rate

 adjustment.

 Another member, however, expressed the opinion that it would be

 appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points, considering the low

 level of concern about price instability due mainly to the weakened

 demand-side inflation pressures and to stable import prices, the strong

 possibility of the low-growth conditions lasting a considerable time and the

 weak capacity of the private sector for autonomous recovery, and the

 expansions in accommodative monetary policies in major advanced as well

 as some emerging market countries.

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation of Monetary Policy Directions

 Taking into consideration the results of the discussions earlier, the

 members compiled a statement reflecting the views of the majority.

 However, Mr. Ha, Seong Keun expressed clear opposition to the idea

 of holding the Base Rate at its current level, and argued for a 0.25

 percentage point cut.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 the moderate economic recovery in the US to have been sustained

 but economic activities in the euro area to have been unable to

 shake off their sluggishness, while emerging market countries have

 shown continuing economic growth. The Committee expects the

 global economy to sustain its modest recovery going forward, but

 judges that the uncertainties related for instance to the fiscal crisis

 in the euro area and to fiscal consolidation in the US have not

 lifted and remain as downside risks to growth.

 □ In Korea, although exports have maintained their trend of recovery

 and construction investment has increased slightly, the Committee

 appraises the economy to have sustained a weak level of growth as

 consumption and facilities investment have declined owing to

 temporary factors. On the employment front, the increase in the

 number of persons employed was smaller in February than in the

 month before, as a result of the accelerated decline in the number

 of temporary and daily workers due mainly to the Lunar New Year

 holiday. Going forward, there is no change to the Committee’s

 forecast that the domestic economy will show a negative output gap 

 for a considerable time, due mostly to the slow recovery of the

 global economy in consequence chiefly of the sluggishness of

 economic activities in the euro area.

###### □ Consumer price inflation and core inflation excluding the prices of

 agricultural and petroleum products continued to run at low levels

 similar to those in the previous month, at 1.4% and 1.3%

 respectively in February. Inflation appears likely to remain relatively

 low, due to the weakening of demand-side pressures; the Committee

 forecasts, however, that it will rise above its current level as

 downward pressures from institutional factors partially disappear. As

 for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas

 continued on their downtrend and those in the rest of the country

 on their moderate uptrend.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices have shown slight fluctuations,

 as the influences of foreigners’ stock investment fund inflows and

 of the increase in Korea’s geopolitical risk have coincided, while

 long-term market interest rates have fallen due mainly to large

 inflows of foreigners’ bond investment funds. The Korean won-US

 dollar exchange rate had fluctuated within a certain range, but has

 risen recently, owing largely to their emergence of geopolitical risk.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee will closely monitor external risk

 factors and Korea’s geopolitical risk and any consequent changes in

 financial and economic conditions, continue its efforts to lower

 inflation expectations, and conduct monetary policy so as to keep

 consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a

 medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not

 eroded due to the continuation of slow growth.
