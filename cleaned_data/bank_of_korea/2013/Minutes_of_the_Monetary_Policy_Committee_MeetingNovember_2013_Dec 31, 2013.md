###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

  After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea',

 'FX and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following

 areas:

 Concerning the global economy, members’ assessment was that the

 trend of modest economic recovery in the US had been maintained despite

 the temporary slowdowns in improvement of some economic indicators, and

 that major sentiment indicators in the euro area had been showing trends

 of improvement. They also assessed that, although the pace of economic

 growth had slowed in some emerging market countries, China was showing

 signs of recovery, led by consumption and investment. Many members

 expected the global economy to sustain its recovery going forward,

 centering around advanced countries, but forecast that factors such as the

 possibility of changes in global financial market conditions in line with QE

 tapering by the US Federal Reserve, and fiscal uncertainties in major

 countries would act as downside risks to growth.

 Many members noted that, in the international financial markets,

 global interest rates had fallen and then rebounded, and after rising

 substantially stock prices had undergone a correction, in response for

 example to the reaching of agreement in the US budget negotiations and

 to changes in expectations related to QE tapering.

  Concerning the domestic economy, members’ assessment was that it

 was maintaining its recovery, with exports and the current account surplus

 reaching record highs and the employment situation showing favorable

 movements, despite the temporary sluggishness of real economic indicators

 in September due to exceptional factors.

###### As to the future outlook, many members anticipated that, although the

 domestic economy seemed likely to maintain its trend of steady recovery, due mainly to improvements in the global economy, the negative output

 gap would continue for the time being, owing to the sluggish pace of the

 global economic recovery and to potential uncertainties related for example to the revival of investment.

  With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out

 that stock prices had risen substantially and the Korean won had remained

 strong, as a result of continued inflows of foreigners’ stock investment

 funds in response mainly to the reaching of agreement in the US fiscal

 negotiations and to expectations of a delay in QE tapering.

 Most members mentioned that the low inflation had been continuing for

 a considerable period of time, with the increase in the CPI running below

 1 percent as in the previous month due to declines in the prices of

 agricultural and petroleum products. Many members forecast that, despite

 the factors pushing prices up such as hikes in public utility charges,

 consumer price inflation would remain low for the time being due mainly

 to low demand-side pressures and to institutional factors including free

 childcare provision.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base

 Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period as, with inflation

 remaining at a low level, the domestic economy was maintaining its

 steady trend of recovery.

 One member expressed the opinion, considering the strong likelihood

 of structural changes having occurred in the domestic real economy and

 financial market environments, as the aftereffects of the global financial

 crisis were being prolonged, that it was necessary to examine whether

 there might be any problems in the current operational framework of

 monetary policy.

 Another member assessed that, although the Korean economy was

 sustaining its trend of recovery, it would be difficult to see it as having

 entered a full-fledged growth phase, and advocated the necessity of policy

 alternatives to revitalize facilities investment, which was showing an

 extremely lackluster picture in comparison particularly to its long-term

 trend.

 One other member noted that the monitoring of foreign exchange

 market movements such as foreign capital flows and exchange rate

 volatility due to changes in major countries’ monetary policies should be

 strengthened further, and that attention should be paid to factors disturbing

 the financial system, such as the possibility of a worsening of funding

 conditions in fragile economic sectors and the household debt situation. He

 then went on to argue that, with inflation running at a low level, policy

 credibility should be improved by strengthening communication concerning

###### the operational target of inflation targeting.

 One member pointed out in addition that the endogenous resilience of

 private consumption and private investment in the Korean economy had

 weakened greatly compared to in the past, and mentioned that policy

 should focus on broadening the basis for household incomes by the

 creation of new jobs through the facilitation of private investment and the

 setting-up of an employment-friendly system, and going further on

 encouraging the balanced growth of domestic demand and exports.

 Finally, another member expressed the opinion that attention should be

 paid to the possibility of a spreading of systemic risk in line with the rise

 in leasehold deposit prices and the rapid increase in leasehold deposit fund

 loans, since qualitative changes were expected in the pattern of income

 redistribution between landlords and tenants, and in the quality of financial

 institutions’ loan assets, as the dramatic growth in leasehold deposit fund

 loans was causing real LTV ratios for leasehold housing to rise and the

 financial burdens of house owners were being shifted onto their tenants.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Direction

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following

 statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all members:

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Committee considers

 that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been maintained

 despite the temporary slowdowns in improvement of some economic

 indicators, and that the sluggishness of economic activities in the

 euro area appears to have continued to ease, albeit weakly, while

 the trends of economic growth in emerging market countries, above

 all China, have continued to show signs of recovering. The

 Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest

 recovery going forward, but judges that the likelihood of changes

 in global financial market conditions related to QE tapering by the

 US Federal Reserve, and the continued uncertainties surrounding the

 US government’s budget bill and the increase in its debt ceiling

 pose downside risks to growth.

 □ In Korea, indicators related to domestic demand slumped

 temporarily, but as exports have sustained their buoyancy the

 Committee appraises the economic recovery to have continued in

 line with the trend of growth. On the employment front, the scale

###### of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded, led

 by increases in the 50-and-above age group and the service sector.

 The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a

 negative output gap for a considerable time going forward, although

 it forecasts that the gap will narrow.

 □ Consumer price inflation fell slightly from 0.8% the previous month

 to 0.7% in October, due mainly to expansions in the extents of

 decline in the prices of agricultural and petroleum products, but

 core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices

 was 1.6% as in the previous month. The Committee forecasts that

 inflation will remain low for the time being, owing primarily to the

 inflation reducing effects of policies such as free childcare provision

 and to the downward stabilization of international agricultural prices.

 As for the housing market, sales prices in Seoul and its

 surrounding areas turned upward while the uptrend of those in the

 rest of the country increased slightly. Leasehold-deposit prices

 sustained their high rate of increase of the previous month in Seoul

 and its surrounding areas, and their uptrend in the rest of the

 country accelerated.

 □ The domestic financial markets have moved mainly in response to

 the reaching of agreement in the US fiscal negotiations and to

 changes in the expectations of a delay in QE tapering. Stock prices

 have fallen again, after having risen substantially, in line with shifts

 in the flows of foreigners’ stock investment funds, and the Korean

 won has depreciated recently, after having sustained a trend of

 appreciation due to continuation of the current account surplus.

 Long-term market interest rates have risen, after fluctuating within a

 narrow range.

###### □ Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and

 the influences of external risk factors, and monitoring the effects of

 the Base Rate cut and of the government’s economic policies

 including the supplementary budget, the Committee will conduct

 monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the

 inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring

 that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of

 slow growth.
