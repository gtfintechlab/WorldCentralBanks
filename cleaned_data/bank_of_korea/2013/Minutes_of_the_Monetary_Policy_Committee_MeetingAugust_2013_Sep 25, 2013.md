###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)][2)]

  After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea',

 'FX and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following

 areas:

 Concerning the global economy, the members’ assessment was that, the

 moderate economic recovery in the US had been sustained but the

 sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area had continued, while

 economic growth in emerging market countries such as China had slowed

 somewhat. Many members expected the global economy to sustain its

 modest recovery going forward, due mainly to improvements in the US

 economy, but judged that factors such as the uncertainties surrounding the

 monetary policy stances and fiscal consolidations in major countries

 including the US, and the possibilities of slower economic growth in China

 would remain as downside risks to growth.

 Many members mentioned that, in the international financial markets,

 with global interest rates showing stable trends due to the easing of

 concerns about early QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve, stock prices

 had risen sharply.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members assessed domestic demand

 such as for consumption and investment to be increasing, helped by the

 Base Rate cut and the stimulus measures taken by the government, with

 exports also showing buoyancy centering around those to the US and

 China.

 As for the future outlook, many members anticipated that the negative

 output gap would narrow steadily, as the domestic economy sustained its

###### modest recovery due mainly to the gradual improvements in external

 conditions and to continuation of the government policy effects.

 With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out

 that, after having declined under the influence of the movements of major

 country government bond yields, long-term market interest rates had risen

 with the improvements in economic indicators, causing the spread between

 long- and short-term rates to widen. They went on to note that stock

 prices had fallen again, after having risen due mainly to increases in

 global stock prices and to foreign capital inflows, while the Korean won

 had appreciated slightly.

 Many members mentioned that, although consumer price inflation had

 risen compared to the previous month, with the reversals to increase in the

 prices of agricultural and livestock products and petroleum products, it still

 maintained a low level of around 1%. Many members forecast that,

 although inflation would be higher than its current level, due mainly to

 imbalances in supply and demand for agricultural products resulting from

 the bad weather conditions and to a base effect from its low rate of

 increase in the second half of 2012, it would show a stable trend for the

 time being as the output gap remained negative.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

  Members shared the opinion that it would be desirable to hold the

 Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, as with prices

 stabilized the domestic economy was forecast to sustain its trend of

 recovery, albeit moderate, due mainly to the gradual recovery of the global

 economy.

 One member expressed the opinion that, given the ongoing concerns

 about QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve and the occurrences of

 foreign capital outflows from some emerging market countries, it would be

 desirable to review the effectiveness of the measures for mitigating capital

 flow volatility carried out to that point.

 Another member commented that, with the recent expansion in size of

 the domestic bond market and the growing influence of foreign investors,

 the possibility was rising of shocks to the Korean economy caused by

 changes in long-term market interest rates owing to external shocks related

 for example to the question of US exit strategy implementation, and that

 effective policy measures in response should therefore be sought.

 Another member pointed out that, while bearing in mind the

 phenomenon of microeconomic shocks affecting the macroeconomy as

 shocks to certain industries transformed into shocks to macroeconomic

 variables through the interconnected structure of the economy, it was

 necessary for macroprudential policy to be conducted in harmony with

 monetary and credit policy to ensure that financial sector procyclicality did

 not expand through the linkages between input and output.

 In addition, one member noted that the volume of foreign investment

###### in the domestic bond market had recently soared to a level more than 13

 percent higher than at the beginning of the year, and asserted the need for

 devising preemptive measures to stabilize the inflows of short-term

 speculative funds so as to minimize the harmful consequences of excessive

 in- and outflows of investment funds of foreigners.

 Finally, another member expressed the view that it was necessary for the

 Bank of Korea, as the central bank, to analyze the path through which

 household debt could return to an appropriate level that would not pose a

 burden to the macroeconomy and the financial system, and contribute

 thereby to improving the effectiveness of the measures being carried out

 by the government to achieve a soft-landing of the household debt

 problem.

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation of Monetary Policy Directions

 Reflecting the outcome of these discussions, the following Monetary

 Policy Decision statement was prepared and then unanimously approved by

 the members:

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 the moderate economic recovery in the US to have been sustained

 but the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have

 continued, while economic growth in emerging market countries

 such as China has slowed somewhat. The Committee forecasts that

 the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward,

 helped primarily by improvements in the US economy, but judges

 that the possibilities of changes in global financial market

 conditions related to the exit strategy of the US Federal Reserve,

 and of a slowdown in Chinese economic growth, and the

 uncertainties surrounding the implementations of fiscal consolidation

 in major countries, remain as downside risks to growth.

 □ In Korea, the Committee appraises economic growth to be

 continuing, albeit moderately, mainly led by exports. On the

 employment front, the increase in the number of persons employed

 has accelerated, centering around the 50-and-above age group and

 the service sector. The Committee expects that the domestic

 economy will maintain a negative output gap for a considerable

 time going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will gradually

 narrow.

 □ Consumer price inflation rose to 1.4% in July, from 1.0% the

 previous month, as the prices of agricultural and livestock products

###### as well as petroleum products turned upward, and core inflation

 excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products

 increased slightly to 1.5%, from 1.4% in June. The Committee

 forecasts that inflation will show a stable trend for the time being

 as the output gap remains negative, although it will rise above its

 present level due mainly to imbalances in agricultural product

 supply and demand caused by bad weather and to a base effect

 from its low rate of increase in the second half of last year. As

 for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas

 sustained their downtrend, while those in the rest of the country

 continued their uptrend.

 □ The domestic financial markets have generally stabilized with the

 easing of concerns about an earlier-than-expected tapering off of

 US quantitative easing. Long-term market interest rates have risen

 modestly, primarily on improved global economic indicators, after

 having declined in concert with those of major economies. Stock

 prices, after having risen due to a shift to net inflows of

 foreigners’ stock investment funds, have fallen back somewhat

 recently and the Korean won has appreciated.

 □ Looking ahead, while closely monitoring the trends and the

 influences of changes in external risk factors, and the effects of

 the Base Rate cut and of the government’s economic policies

 including the supplementary budget, the Committee will conduct

 monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the

 inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring

 that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of

 slow growth.
