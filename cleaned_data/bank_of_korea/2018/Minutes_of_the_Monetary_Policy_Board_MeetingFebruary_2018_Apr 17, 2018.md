##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and

 International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the

 Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

 Members’ assessment of the global economy was that, with economic

 expansion in the US and other advanced economies continuing, emerging

 economies had been gradually showing clearer economic recovery, driven

 for instance by the stability of commodity prices and the favorable trend of

 trade growth. Members also evaluated that, with respect to the global

 financial markets, with long-term interest rates in major countries rising and

 stock markets fluctuating, the volatility of interest rates and exchange rates

 had expanded.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that,

 despite a slowdown in construction investment, the Korean economy had

 continued to exhibit growth in line with the path projected in January,

 with exports and facilities investment sustaining buoyancy and consumption

 maintaining its trend of recovery, albeit at a moderate pace. Members,

 however, added that there was a need to pay attention to changes in

 export and employment conditions in line for instance with stronger

 protectionism by the US and a foreign automaker’s decision to shut down

 a factory in Korea, while bearing in mind that employment was growing,

 led by export manufacturing industries, and employment growth was

 slowing in the service industries closely associated with domestic demand.

 Concerning inflation, members noted that consumer price inflation was

 expected to gradually approach the target level after a time gap with

 economic activity recovering, given that (i) the slowdown in inflation in

###### January was mainly attributable to non-cyclical factors such as a freeze in

 insurance premiums and the base effect from prices of agricultural,

 livestock and fisheries products, and that (ii) the rate of increase in the

 business cycle-sensitive price index was in the upper-1 percent range.

 As to the domestic financial markets, members’ assessment was that,

 with stock price volatility rising, the yield curve had steepened and the

 term premium had risen in the bond market, but corporate bond credit

 spreads and foreign currency liquidity conditions were stable. Members

 emphasized that, although slower growth in household lending was

 continuing, there was a need to continually monitor credit lending growth

 and the impacts of the surge in real estate prices in some areas of Seoul.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would

 be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.5 percent for

 the intermeeting period.

 One member expressed the view that it would be necessary to

 maintain the accommodative monetary policy until economic recovery firms

 up such that the trend of decline in underlying inflation is reversed.

 The member noted that as major advanced economies had recently

 shown rapid paces of recovery, the negative GDP gap was estimated to be

 almost closed or to have turned positive. The member’s assessment was

 that, in the US in particular, with the labor market assessed as being at

 full employment, there were signs of typical demand-pull inflation driven

 by wage hikes, providing logical and substantive grounds for monetary

 policy normalization. The member added that the Euro area and Japan

 were maintaining very accommodative monetary policies, as price inflation

 was still running well below target, although labor force slack had

 declined rapidly with economic growth continuing to significantly exceed

 potential growth.

 The member noted that, unlike the reflation trend in advanced

 economies, core inflation in the Korean economy had been continuing to

 decline, albeit at a moderate pace, to the lower-1 percent range over the

 past two years. The member commented that this suggested that, in

 contrast to other advanced economies, domestic demand in the Korean

 economy had not recovered sufficiently to boost price inflation overall.

 The member added that, given that there was also little sign of

 improvement in employment in the domestic demand-led services industry,

4


-----

###### the projection that ‘consumer price inflation will approach its 2-percent

 target in the second half of this year, dependent upon economic recovery’

 also seemed somewhat uncertain.

 The member pointed out that a decline in the inflation rate could act

 to effectively tighten the monetary policy stance by raising real interest

 rates, even if the Base Rate remained unchanged. The member then

 emphasized the need to review how accommodative the current Base Rate

 of 1.50 percent actually is. The member thus judged it necessary at this

 juncture to set the primary goal of monetary policy as an increase in price

 inflation through recovery of domestic demand. To this end, the member

 expressed the view that it was necessary to monitor whether economic

 recovery firms up such that labor market conditions improve and the trend

 of decline in price inflation is reversed, while maintaining the current level

 of the Base Rate for some time.

  Another member took the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base

 Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.

 The member’s assessment was that, as exports and facilities investment

 continued their strength despite a slowdown in construction investment, and

 as consumption was maintaining a trend of recovery, albeit at a moderate

 pace, the domestic real economy was sustaining growth not deviating far

 from the path projected in January. The member judged that, although the

 trend of improvement in exports concentrated in IT was gradually

 spreading to non-IT sectors, the trend of recovery in private consumption

 was not enough to drive well-balanced growth in the overall economy.

 The member thus found it still too early to have confidence that there had

 been a tangible reversal to a positive GDP gap.

 The member noted that consumer price inflation had slowed greatly in

 January, due mainly to the strengthening of the won and declines in prices

 of livestock products, and that core inflation was also declining

 significantly, due to the deceleration in price growth in the services sector,

 particularly in the personal services sector. The member saw heightened

5


-----

###### downside risks that this year’s movements of consumer price inflation and

 core inflation would fall short of the path projected in January, due to the

 recent slowdown in inflation. Looking at underlying price movements,

 meanwhile, the member noted that, although core inflation excluding

 regulated prices had slowed, this was mainly attributable to non-cyclical

 factors, such as a freeze in insurance service charges, and business

 cycle-sensitive prices were maintaining a trend of increase similar to that

 of the previous month. The member thus judged that demand-side

 inflationary pressures were not declining significantly.

 Regarding production slack, the member noted that, despite the

 buoyancy of exports, the average capacity utilization ratio in the

 manufacturing sector had declined to hit the lowest level of late, due to

 sluggish production in the existing leading machinery industries such as

 automobiles and shipbuilding. Regarding the labor market, the member’s

 assessment was that, although the number of persons employed had

 increased by a greater margin, particularly in the construction and

 manufacturing sectors, and the unemployment rate had also remained

 unchanged year-on-year, the slack in the labor force had increased slightly

 due to growth in the time and participation gaps.

 Looking at financial stability conditions, the member noted that the

 yield curve in the capital market had steepened, due to a synchronization

 of domestic long-term interest rates following a large increase in global

 long-term interest rates. With respect to the stock market, the member

 judged that an outflow of foreign portfolio investment had led to a

 large-scale correction of stock prices and higher price volatility, and in the

 bond market, the term premium on bonds had risen due to higher

 preferences for short-term bonds, as well as an inversion of domestic and

 overseas interest rates. The member noted that, in the credit market, the

 slowdown in household lending growth had weakened, due mainly to

 growth in housing-related credit lending, despite a rise in lending interest

 rates. The member thus noted that there was a need to carefully observe

6


-----

###### the trends of stabilization of household debt, together with future

 developments in the housing economy.

 Based on the results of this examination of real economic activity,

 price movements and financial stability, the member assessed that, despite

 recent improvements in economic activity, current economic conditions had

 not yet reached a level where it could be verified that there were tangible

 declines in spare capacity in production and labor through the spread of

 robust and well-balanced growth, and the consequent sustainable rise of

 demand-side inflationary pressures.

  One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold

 the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.

 First of all, the member forecast that underlying inflation would bottom

 out in the first quarter of this year and rebound afterwards. The member’s

 assessment was that personal service fees, sensitive to domestic demand,

 had been moving close to 2 percent; prices of industrial products, sensitive

 to global business activities, and those of agricultural, livestock and

 fisheries products, under the influence of exogenous variables, had

 remained in the mid-1 percent range; and public service charges as well

 as monthly housing rental payments and housing leasehold deposit prices

 had remained low, within the 1-percent range. Taking all these into

 consideration, the member estimated the current inflation pressures at the

 mid to upper 1 percent range, somewhat below the target, and expected

 inflation to near its target if global inflation rose and this led to an

 increase in industrial product prices. The member mentioned that this

 forecast presupposed that continuing domestic demand pressures, albeit

 weak, would be sustained. The member also forecast the output gap to

 remain positive, even if slightly, with exports continuing to grow,

 consumption maintaining the trend of improvement, facilities investment

 undergoing a modest adjustment from its high level, and construction

 investment continuing to go through a correction as expected. 

 The member noted the need to additionally examine how growth and

7


-----

###### the price path have been affected by financial imbalances, global economic

 recovery and structural characteristics of the economy. Regarding financial

 imbalances, the member expressed the view that the recent accommodative

 policy seemed to have caused an unsustainable supply of resources to real

 estate-related sectors as well as excessive construction investment, and

 added that accumulated inefficiency of resource allocation would slow

 down economic activities and weaken inflation pressures. Meanwhile, the

 member mentioned that Korea’s economic growth would benefit should the

 global economy continue to improve, for example through global trade

 channels, and this would lead to a rise in neutral interest rates. The

 member went on to state that even if the policy rate was maintained at its

 current level, there thus remained a possibility of an increase in the

 degree of monetary easing. The member also pointed out that due to

 structural problems, such as population aging, capital-intensive technological

 innovation, the rigid labor market and heightened barriers to entry, the

 inflation pressures suggested by the Phillips curve seemed to be

 substantially limited, and went on to argue that while a substantial part of

 this problem should be solved by structural reform, it was related to

 financial imbalances and thus was being reflected in monetary policy

 decision making. 

 The member presented the view that, with all the above-mentioned

 factors taken into consideration, there was a need for an interest rate hike

 in the medium term, but there also existed uncertainties regarding the

 price path, and went on to argue that thus it would be necessary to adjust

 the accommodative monetary policy stance while closely watching how

 Korea’s neutral interest rates move in line with changes in external

 conditions, conflicts between resolving financial imbalances and boosting

 domestic demand, as well as the effects of structural reform underway.

  One member, meanwhile, expressed the view that it would be desirable to

 keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting

 period.

######  Looking at the economic situation since the January 18th Monetary Policy

 Board meeting, the member mentioned that concerns were raised about the

 possibility of consumer price inflation deviating from its target, as it had

 fallen to 1.0 percent in January, with economic sentiment seeming to have

 withered somewhat due mainly to stock price corrections and long-term

 interest rate hikes around the globe, the strengthening of US trade

 protectionist measures and a foreign automaker’s decision to close a factory

 in Korea. However, the member’s assessment was that the recent rise in

 global financial market volatility was attributable to the accelerating growth of

 the global economy, to growing inflation pressures and to the notion that

 major countries might normalize their monetary policies faster than originally

 expected. The member went on to forecast that, since Korea, as a small open

 economy heavily dependent on external economic conditions, would be

 affected by such global growth and price movements, the Korean economy

 would sustain strong growth at its potential level, as forecast in January. The

 member expected inflation to gradually near its target, in line with economic

 recovery and with a time lag, given that (i) the slowdown in consumer price

 inflation in January had stemmed largely from non-cyclical factors such as the

 freezing of insurance premiums and the base effect from agricultural, livestock

 and fisheries product prices, and that (ii) business cycle-sensitive price

 inflation had registered growth of a little under 2 percent.

  With respect to the domestic financial and foreign exchange markets, the

 member’s assessment was that the volatility of price variables had heightened

 significantly, but not enough to raise concerns about market unrest. However,

 as there remained controversy at home and abroad about whether stocks and

 some other assets were overvalued, and there remained a possibility of a

 further hike in market rates, the member argued that it would be necessary to

 closely monitor market conditions. The member also stated that, despite the

 slowing trend of household debt growth, bank lending to households

 continued to show faster growth than usual in January and credit loans were

 growing faster than home mortgage loans, and that it would be therefore

9


-----

###### necessary to remain on the alert and keep an eye on these developments in

 terms of financial stability risks.

  Regarding the monetary policy decision in response, the member stated

 that, as future growth and inflation were expected to reach the potential and

 target levels, respectively, and there recently were growing expectations of

 major countries’ monetary policy normalization, there still remained the need

 to further adjust the degree of monetary easing. The member added, however,

 that it would be advisable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50

 percent this time, given the somewhat heightened uncertainty at home and

 abroad and the fact that more time was required for inflation to converge

 to the target. The member went on to argue that attention should be paid to

 prevent excessive concerns about downside risks from having negative

 self-fulfilling effects through a contraction in economic sentiment.

 Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to hold

 the Base Rate at its current level, since inflation pressures, currently

 requiring more consideration in policy decision-making, had not yet shown

 signs of materialization.

 Looking at the real sector, the member’s assessment was that the real

 economy had remained close to the growth path forecast in January,

 driven chiefly by faster recoveries of the global economy and trade. The

 member judged that factors contributing to global economic growth that

 would affect the Korean economy remained favorable overall although the

 US trade protectionist policies which were taking shape, as seen in the

 safeguard measures recently coming into effect, were considered as risk

 factors undermining the global trade environment. The member also

 assessed domestic demand as overall being on the path forecast in

 January, and evaluated that, while facilities investment in the IT sector had

 been brisk affected by strong semiconductor exports, the slowdown in

 construction investment had been establishing itself as a trend as expected

 and the January index had not yet exhibited a clear sign of faster

10


-----

###### recovery in private consumption. The member argued for the necessity of

 closely examining the movements of these real economic factors since

 February, when factors contributing to consumption growth, such as the

 Winter Olympic Games and the Lunar New Year holiday, were

 concentrated. In terms of supply, the member noted that, although change

 in the number of persons employed had improved somewhat, rising to

 334,000 in January after having declined substantially to 257,000 at the

 previous year-end, this increase had been seen mostly in the agriculture,

 forestry and fishery and manufacturing sectors. With this in mind, the

 member pointed out that the causal chain whereby consumption-led

 domestic demand recovery sustained growth, which in turn led to

 employment improvement in the labor market, especially in the services

 sector, was insufficient.

 In terms of inflation, meanwhile, the member noted that, with

 consumer price inflation registering 1.0 percent and core inflation 1.2

 percent in January, continuing decline in inflation as in the second half of

 last year, had been already projected in the January forecast. However, the

 member assessed the degree of the slowdown as somewhat larger than

 expected, mentioning that factors at work included the effects of a

 government measure to restrain the price growth of regulated items, as

 well as the inflation conditions in which domestic demand and

 employment had not shown full-scale improvement.

 Finally, concerning financial stability, the member mentioned that

 although there had not been any significant changes in the month-to-month

 trend of household debt and its slowdown was expected to continue,

 ongoing monitoring was needed of how the upward trend of real estate

 prices in some regions including Gangnam would affect household debt.

 The member also noted that stock market volatility had heightened in

 countries all around the world in line with the upsurge in US stock

 market volatility, and went on to state that, given that this phenomenon

 had been caused by a change in policy projections that the strengthening

11


-----

###### of the US growth momentum would speed up the US Fed’s policy rate

 hikes, this phenomenon could be seen as being a result of normal capital

 flows and price corrections reflecting the shifting perceptions of the real

 economy.

  One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to

 strengthen the monitoring of real economic trends, including those of business

 activities and inflation, as well as the increase in domestic and overseas

 financial market volatility, while holding the Base Rate at its current level of

 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.

  The member noted that the domestic economy had sustained a modest

 recovery in line with the favorable global economy, but market sentiment 

 had remained weak. The member expressed the view that private consumption

 was expected to recover in February, boosted largely by the Lunar New Year

 holiday, but more time for observation was needed to judge whether private

 consumption would continue to recover as originally forecast. The member

 also argued that closer examination was needed of changes in exports and

 employment situations in line chiefly with the recent foreign automaker issue,

 US trade policy and conditions in shipbuilding and other vulnerable industries,

 and that attention was needed to be paid to the effects of the government’s

 real estate policy on construction investment and employment in the

 construction sector. The member mentioned that consumer price inflation had

 registered a mere 1.0 percent and core inflation had fallen to the lower 1

 percent range in January, pointing to a possibility of greater downside risks

 than originally expected, and also noted a need to keep a watch on whether

 consumer price inflation would reach 1.5 percent in the first half of this year

 as forecast in January. The member judged that this year’s growth rate was

 unlikely to deviate far from its potential level and the output gap was

 accordingly unlikely to turn significantly positive, and stressed that it would

 be necessary for the time being to maintain the accommodative monetary

 policy and continue to monitor the recovery in private consumption and

 improvement in employment conditions.

12


-----

###### With respect to financial stability conditions, meanwhile, the member

 took the view that there was a growing need to cope appropriately with

 the recent rise in global financial market volatility, while at the same time

 paying attention to the accumulation of financial imbalances due to the

 accommodative monetary policy so far. The member noted that there were

 growing concerns that the stabilization of household debt might be affected

 negatively if the surge in real estate prices in some areas of Seoul were

 to spread to other regions, and also other concerns that household debt

 burdens might increase in line with a fall in housing prices in some

 regions that had seen a large increase in the housing supply. The member

 went on to argue that close examination in cooperation with the

 government was needed of real estate market conditions and the trend of

 household debt. The member also expressed the view that, in the lead-up

 to the March FOMC meeting where a policy rate hike was highly likely

 to take place, it would be necessary to closely monitor developments in

 the international financial markets and to examine how the heightening

 global financial market volatility would affect emerging market economies.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

 leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Board considers that the

 acceleration in global economic growth has continued. Volatility in the

 global financial markets has increased substantially, with government

 bond yields rising and stock prices falling in line mainly with

 strengthening expectations of monetary policy normalizations in major

 countries. Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as

 likely to be affected by factors such as the paces of monetary policy

 normalization in major countries, the directions of the US government's

 economic policies, and the movements toward spreading trade

 protectionism.

 □ The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth

 has continued, as exports are sustaining their buoyancy and

 consumption and facilities investment have shown favorable

 movements, although construction investment has declined. The trend

 of improvement in employment conditions appears to have remained

 moderate, even though the extent of increase in the number of persons

 employed accelerated in January owing to temporary factors. Going

 forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be generally

14


-----

###### consistent with the path projected in January. It anticipates that

 investment will slow, but that the trend of steady increase in

 consumption will continue, due in large part to improvements in

 household income conditions, and that exports will also sustain their

 favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy.

 □ Consumer price inflation has slowed to the 1% level recently, in

 consequence mainly of declines in the prices of livestock products and

 of a reduction in the extent of increase in personal service fees. Core

 inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI)

 has fallen to the low 1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by

 the general public has remained at the mid-2% level. Looking ahead it

 is forecast that consumer price inflation, after remaining in the low- to

 mid-1% range for some time, will pick up and gradually approach the

 target level from the second half of this year. Core inflation will also

 gradually rise.

 □ In the domestic financial markets the volatility of price variables has

 expanded considerably, in reflection of global financial market

 movements. Long-term market interest rates have risen, stock prices

 have declined and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen,

 after having previously increased. Household lending has shown a

 higher rate of expansion than in past years, although the amount of its

 expansion has continued to decline. Housing sales prices have shown

 low rates of increase overall, but have risen faster in some parts of

 Seoul and its surrounding areas.

 □ Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to

 ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer

 price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term

 horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast

15


-----

###### that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the

 time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its

 solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary

 policy stance. In this process it will judge carefully whether it is

 necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further,

 while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends. It

 will also carefully monitor any changes in the monetary policies of

 major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the

 trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.
