##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on “Economic Outlooks for 2018 and 2019,”

 “FX and International Finance” and “Financial Market Trends,” the

 discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the

 following areas:

 Members evaluated that, despite slowdowns of economic growth in

 Japan and China, the global economy had continued to show strong

 growth, led by the strength of the US economy. Members also mentioned

 that the volatility of price variables, such as stock prices and exchange and

 interest rates, had increased significantly in the global financial markets,

 affected chiefly by the escalating trade tensions between the US and China

 and concerns about US policy rate hikes.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that

 facilities and construction investment had continued to go through

 corrections, exports had remained buoyant, and consumption had

 maintained modest growth. Members also mentioned that the growth

 forecasts for this year and next had been adjusted downward to 2.7

 percent, in reflection mainly of the faster paces of correction in facilities

 and construction investment and the negative impacts of the US-China

 trade conflict on Korea’s exports.

 Concerning inflation, members noted that consumer price inflation had

 accelerated to 1.9 percent in September, boosted largely by increases in

 international oil and agricultural product prices, while core inflation had

 remained at 1.0 percent with declines in administered prices having

 continued effects. Members mentioned that the CPI growth forecast for

 this year had remained at 1.6 percent, while that for next year had been

###### adjusted downward from 1.9 percent to 1.7 percent.

 As to the domestic financial markets, members assessed that the

 escalating US-China trade tensions and concerns about the US Fed’s rate

 hikes had caused stock prices to fall significantly and the Korean won to

 depreciate greatly, and volatility had increased due to temporary outflows

 of foreign securities investment in October. Members also mentioned that

 household debt was expected to stabilize, thanks for example to

 government measures, but its growth had continued to outpace that of

 household income, while sole proprietor loans had also maintained strong

 growth, all of which required constant attention.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall

 consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic

 environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current

 level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period, while two members

 called for a 0.25 percentage point hike.

 One member took the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base

 Rate from the current 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent at this meeting.

 The member evaluated that, with the buoyancy of the US economy,

 the global economy had continued to show favorable growth on the whole,

 and forecast global trade to maintain favorable growth. With regard to the

 domestic economy, the member noted that exports had remained strong

 and private consumption had shown modest growth, while investment had

 remained sluggish and employment had continued to worsen. The member

 mentioned that the government measures to stimulate the economy and

 strengthen the income base were expected to have positive effects on

 private consumption, but there also existed factors holding it back, such as

 sluggish employment. The member also noted the ongoing corrections in

 facilities investment, which had shown a sharp increase last year in the

 semiconductor sector in particular, and in construction investment, which

 had remained buoyant for the past several years. The member evaluated

 that exports had declined, due mainly to the decrease in the number of

 working days during September and also to a base effect, but remained

 favorable overall, with the daily average export value hitting a record

 high. The member noted that employment had been better than anticipated

 last month, but significant improvement seemed unlikely next year as well.

 The member noted that, taking all this into consideration, the Bank of

4


-----

###### Korea’s Research Department had made downward adjustments to the

 economic outlooks for this year and next as well as a significant

 adjustment to the employment outlook, and went on to argue that the

 growth rate might fall short of its potential, although only slightly, this

 year and next. The member forecast inflation, having increased

 significantly in September driven chiefly by oil price hikes, to nearly

 reach its target at around the end of this year or the beginning of next

 year. The member judged that demand-side inflation pressures had not yet

 been large, however, due to the lower-than-expected core inflation.

 Looking at the estimates of output and inflation gaps based on the

 discussion above, the member judged that the Bank of Korea would have

 to maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance, but unlike advanced

 countries that had experienced massive deleveraging since the global

 financial crisis in 2008, Korea had seen steady household debt growth and

 thus financial stability was gaining even greater importance. The member

 mentioned that the past several years of low interest rates seemed to have

 contributed, to some extent, to household debt growth and housing price

 rises in some regions, and expressed the view that household debt should

 be considered when making monetary policy decisions since its growth

 had been outpacing that of household income. The member noted that,

 while there were concerns that a rate hike could add to the burden of

 vulnerable borrowers, the Bank of Korea should supplement the

 government’s efforts by carrying out stress tests to continually analyze

 vulnerable borrowers, and stressed that, although household debt was

 within a controllable range at the moment, a close eye should be kept on

 it so that it would not grow excessively, which would create a debt trap

 and make it difficult for the central bank to raise its policy rate.

 Lastly, considering Korea’s strong macroeconomic conditions as well as

 its economic fundamentals, such as the current account surplus and foreign

 reserves, the member mentioned that reversals of the policy and market

 rates between the US and Korea seemed unlikely to cause massive capital

5


-----

###### outflows immediately. The member added, however, that since some

 heavily indebted emerging market economies with weak economic

 conditions might remain unstable, and since concerns had been raised

 about China-related risks due mainly to the US-China trade conflict, a

 prolongation and widening of the rate inversion might add to market

 volatility, and it would be therefore necessary to closely monitor the

 consequent effects.

 In summary, the member judged that, given the facts that the growth

 rate was unlikely to deviate far from its potential level and that consumer

 price inflation was forecast to near its target, it would be appropriate to

 place a greater focus on financial stability and reduce the degree of

 monetary policy easing to some extent. In particular, the member

 expressed the view that slower growth and sluggish employment were seen

 to have resulted from structural factors, such as the weakened

 competitiveness of core industries, rather than from cyclical factors, which

 could not be sufficiently dealt with through monetary policy measures

 alone, and added that in this regard it would be necessary to make

 medium- and long-term efforts to increase the potential growth rate.

 Recalling the previous events when excessive credit had caused bubbles to

 form and burst, weakening the financial sector’s soundness and

 intermediary role and ultimately worsening the real economy to a great

 extent, the member stressed that it would be extremely important to ensure

 financial stability for stable growth, and expected that monetary policy

 would have signaling effects.

 Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to raise

 the Base Rate from the current 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent at this meeting.

 The member assessed inflation as nearing its target over a medium-term

 horizon amid weak but sustained demand-side pressures, and expected that a

 slight reduction of the accommodative monetary policy stance was unlikely to

 weaken demand-side pressures enough to have a significant effect on inflation

 but could contribute to curbing the widening of financial imbalances

###### somewhat. The member also argued that, at a time when demand-side

 pressures were forecast to support the economy thanks to the accommodative

 fiscal policy, it would be desirable to change the monetary policy stance for

 harmonious policy operation as well.

 The member judged that the economic growth rate for this year seemed

 to have declined somewhat rapidly due to the base effect from excessive

 construction investment over the past few years and the readjustment of

 IT-related facilities investment that had shown fast growth last year, but

 recorded growth was within the margin of error of the forecast path and at

 the level of the potential growth rate, which itself had remained on a

 downward path. In addition, the member anticipated a continuation of

 demand-side pressures, supporting inflation thanks mainly to a potential

 accommodative fiscal policy, while private consumption had been maintaining

 relatively strong growth. The member also expressed the view that the recent

 low inflation had been attributable mainly to the continued decline in

 administered prices and added that consumer price inflation with these

 administered prices counted out had been exceeding 2 percent since the

 beginning of this year, with sticky prices in particular being above target for

 the past few years. The member mentioned that survey-based inflation

 expectations and forecasts for consumer prices of goods and services of

 companies related directly to the real economy had remained within the 2

 percent range. The member also expected consumer price inflation to

 gradually near its target, boosted by inflation pressures following the global

 economic recovery.

 The member mentioned that the recent low interest rate environment had

 contributed to boosting the economy and raising the growth rate above its

 potential level, but with the increased leverage accumulating in the real estate

 sector, the demand-pull effect seemed to have gradually declined, and

 investment in other sectors had not produced sufficient added value. The

 member attributed this phenomenon to structural factors, such as the

 restructuring of the global economy, the decline in the core working-age

7


-----

###### population, and relatively rigid labor and commodity markets. The member

 also noted that a possible shortage of retirement funds due to rapid

 population aging had been encouraging leveraged short-term investment,

 leading to speculation in real assets. The member presented the view that,

 with growth in private-sector credit continuing to outpace that of nominal

 GDP, stronger macroprudential regulations alone could not effectively curb

 widening financial imbalances but would only create a balloon effect. In this

 regard, the member mentioned that it would be important to reduce the

 degree of monetary easing to weaken inefficient incentives for investment and

 curb financial imbalances.

 The member also judged that, to prepare for a global economic downturn

 and the major impacts it would have on the Korean economy, it would be

 important at this point in time to prevent the accumulation of financial

 imbalances while carrying out intensive structural reforms to enhance the

 efficiency of the economy as a whole and to ensure policy space. The

 member went on to state that these efforts could boost future consumption

 further and minimize the inflation gap over the medium-term horizon.

 One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold

 the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period

 while observing conditions a little longer.

 First, the member noted that the Bank of Korea Research Department

 had revised downward the growth forecasts for this year and next by 0.2

 percentage points and 0.1 percentage points, respectively, to 2.7 percent

 each. The member added that these forecasts reflected the widening of

 corrections in facilities and construction investment, and the negative

 impacts of the US-China trade dispute on exports. The member saw that

 growth was somewhat weaker than existing forecasts, but at 2.7% it was

 generally not deviating from its potential level and the GDP gap was

 holding steady at around zero. The member commented that consumer

 price inflation was forecast to be 1.6 percent this year, the same as the

 previous forecast, and 1.7 percent for next year, 0.2 percentage points

8

###### down from the previous forecast. The member’s assessment was that,

 although the forecasts were somewhat below the inflation target of 2%,

 they were generally continuing to moving closer to the target level.

 In terms of financial and foreign exchange markets, the member noted

 that stock prices had fallen greatly and the Korean won had weakened

 drastically, due mainly to the escalating US-China trade dispute and concerns

 about US rate hikes, while foreign portfolio investment had seen substantial

 albeit temporary outflows. In this regard, the member pointed out that, despite

 Korea’s strong economic fundamentals and external soundness, markets could

 see episodes of heightened volatility depending upon future developments in

 major risk factors. The member commented that, although household lending

 growth had slowed somewhat, its absolute level was very high, and it was

 still continuing to outpace income growth, while sole proprietor loans had

 grown steadily, led by borrowing related to real estate and leasing, resulting

 in a large increase in financial exposures to real estate. Given these

 developments, the member stressed that close attention should be kept on the

 risk of the accumulation of financial imbalances in the Korean economy, even

 though the government’s recent policy measures had helped weaken the

 upturn of apartment prices in some parts of the Seoul Metropolitan region.

 Next, concerning the monetary policy response, the member presented

 the opinion that policy signals and assessments of recent macroeconomic

 and financial stability conditions, when considered comprehensively, pointed

 to a need to reduce the degree of monetary easing. The member added

 that such a policy path appeared even more desirable in light of the

 developments in monetary policy normalization in major countries,

 including continued rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve in the future,

 and given the need to secure policy space over a long-term horizon. The

 member noted that projections of growth and inflation were being revised

 downward, albeit slightly, despite the fact that growth and inflation had

 not deviated from the earlier forecasts, and members’ opinions were mixed

 regarding market expectations about the timing of a hike in the Base Rate.

9


-----

###### Given these points, the member presented the view that it would be better

 to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period

 while keeping a close watch on relevant conditions a little longer, since

 there was no pressing reason to rush to hike the Base Rate at this

 meeting.

 One member, meanwhile, presented the view that it would be appropriate

 to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, while

 examining future developments in domestic and international economic

 conditions a little longer.

 The member evaluated that the global economy had maintained growth

 exceeding its potential, despite trade conflicts among major countries and

 financial unrest in some EMEs. The member raised concerns that most of

 the growth improvement since the second quarter had come from the US.

 The member, however, offered positive assessments as well, noting that

 the finalizing of a revision to the North American Free Trade Agreement

 had led to a view that the US-China trade dispute might not spread

 globally, and that some indicators in the euro area and Japan were also

 showing signs of improvements. The member projected the global economy

 to show relatively robust growth for some time, in consideration of the

 expansionary fiscal policies of major countries and the domestic demand

 stimulus measures of EMEs with favorable external soundness.

 Looking at the domestic economy, the member judged that it was

 sustaining growth consistent with its potential. The member, however,

 noted that attention was being paid to the fact that the divergence between

 exports and domestic demand had continued, with exports continuing their

 strong growth but the correction in investment being more persistent and

 deeper than expectations. Judging from leading indicators, however, the

 member did not expect the gap between exports and domestic demand to

 widen further. The member took the view that, with respect to facilities

 investment in particular, its decline could stabilize or reverse to a

 moderate rise, given the number of machinery orders received. With regard

10


-----

###### to employment, which had shown sluggishness due to a mix of structural,

 policy and cyclical factors, the member pointed out that the number of

 persons employed in the services sector had fallen by a narrower margin

 when controlling for seasonal factors, and the number of persons employed

 in the manufacturing sector had increased moderately for three consecutive

 months. The member, however, expressed the view that, as the degree of

 improvement was weak and changes in policies that could affect consumer

 and corporate sentiments continued at home and abroad, it was appropriate

 to take some time to monitor the relevant developments.

 With regard to inflation, the member noted that consumer price

 inflation had risen substantially to 1.9 percent, due to higher international

 oil prices and agricultural product prices and the ending of a temporary

 reduction of electricity fees. The member, meanwhile, commented that core

 inflation had recorded only 1.0 percent, due to the sustained influences of

 a drop in administered prices. The member presented the opinion that,

 although underlying price trends were difficult to judge, inflationary

 pressures were estimated to be gradually mounting, given the gradual

 retreat of factors that had limited inflation for the past several years. The

 member added that import prices and other supply-side factors were

 starting to induce domestic inflation as global prices entered an

 expansionary phase, while the inflation expectations of the general public

 had risen slightly of late. The member saw that demand-side inflationary

 pressures were no longer acting in a downward direction, but the effects

 of reduced administered prices were likely to continue for some time. The

 member thus forecast that consumer price inflation was unlikely to deviate

 far from the current level for the time being.

 Finally, as to financial stability, the member noted that, although

 household debt was growing at a slower rate, it was still increasing faster

 than household income, and growth in sole proprietor loans was also high.

 The member thus pointed out the need for constant attention to risk from

 the accumulation of financial imbalances. In addition, the member

11


-----

###### commented that volatility in price variables had heightened in the financial

 markets due to the emergence of uncertainties related to the Fed’s rate

 hikes, and as there were significant uncertainties surrounding the future

 political agendas and trade and monetary policies of major countries,

 attention should be paid to the relevant risks.

 Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to hold

 the Base Rate at its current level for some time to buffer against downside

 risks to the macroeconomy, while paying attention to whether inflation caused

 by recent cost-side factors would continue and to the possibility of an

 accumulation of the macroeconomic risks in the real estate market.

 The member’s assessment was that the Korean economy was sustaining

 growth in the mid- to upper-2% range, boosted by the booming world

 economy, and exports were keeping up their robust growth in the third

 quarter as well, despite protectionism and the possibility of a slowdown in

 the manufacturing sector. The member, however, pointed out that the terms of

 trade had worsened due to a sustained rise in oil prices, and thus export

 growth was having a very limited impact on domestic demand. In other

 words, the real GDP growth rate was holding steady as net export growth

 stemming from lower import volume had offset a decline in the contribution

 of domestic demand to growth, resulting in the slowdown of GNI and

 nominal income growth.

 In terms of domestic demand, the member assessed that consumption

 was growing steadily owing to expanded government spending, noting that

 an expansionary fiscal policy and a high income growth rate were likely

 to act as upside risks, while sluggish employment and a contraction in the

 business income of self-employed business owners would serve as

 downside risks. The member, meanwhile, commented that corporate

 spending such as construction and facilities investment had contracted and

 was unlikely to rebound quickly.

 With regard to inflation, the member assessed that it could reach close

 to its 2% target temporarily in the fourth quarter, due mainly to rising oil

12


-----

###### prices and to base effects. The member, however, commented that core

 inflation was still in the 1% range, while core inflation excluding

 administered prices remained flat in the mid-1% range, and thus

 underlying prices were not highly likely to rise rapidly.

 With respect to asset prices, the member commented that the monetary

 authorities could not easily address every fluctuation in asset prices, nor

 were they entrusted with this responsibility. However, the member

 mentioned that policy attention needs to be paid only if nationwide asset

 bubbles accompanied with rapid leverage increase formed because future

 price adjustments could cause a major negative shock to financial markets

 and the macroeconomy. In this regard, the member’s assessment was that

 the recent surge in apartment prices in some parts of the Seoul

 Metropolitan region did not appear to be a nationwide macroeconomic

 phenomenon, but rather appeared to have been triggered by housing

 demand differentiations by region and type, and there was no clear

 evidence that it was accompanied with the rise in household debt. The

 member thus noted that it was desirable to first utilize macroprudential

 policy to address these issues selectively.

 Meanwhile, the member noted that domestic long-term market interest

 rates had been running considerably below US long-term interest rates,

 which reflects financial market woes on Korea’s growth and inflation. The

 member added that capital movements and exchange rate fluctuations due

 to the differences in the macroeconomic fundamentals between Korea and

 the US should be understood as part of natural adjustments.

 One other member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to

 hold the Base Rate at its current level, since real economic growth was

 holding steady around its potential growth path, albeit with some signs of

 slowing, and inflation growth was more moderate than expectations.

 On the external front, the member’s assessment was that, with respect

 to advanced economies, economic growth in Japan and the EU had been

 slowing somewhat since the second half of this year, although the US

13


-----

###### economy was maintaining solid growth. The member also assessed that

 emerging market economies were maintaining overall growth, as slower

 growth in China was offset by robust growth in India and ASEAN

 countries. The member expected global trade growth to continue to be

 impacted by the slower growth in advanced economies next year, as in

 the second half of this year, but the extent of such impacts to be limited,

 as emerging market economies accounted for a steadily increasing share of

 world trade. The member expressed the opinion that Korean exports were

 likely to sustain their strength, in reflection of the trends of the world

 economy and trade, but export growth would slow moderately from the

 second half of this year.

 On the domestic front, the member saw that the correction in 

 construction investment had continued and the correction in facilities

 investment seen since the second quarter of this year would continue in

 the second half of this year as well. The member, however, expressed the

 opinion that private consumption was maintaining moderate growth and the

 sharp increase in government spending this year was buffering sluggish

 investment. The member noted that, given that the correction in

 construction investment was an underlying trend, investment would recover

 somewhat from its current level but was not expected to contribute to

 growth. The member also assessed that, in the future, growth in domestic

 demand would be dependent upon an increase in private consumption.

 The member noted that, with respect to private consumption growth, it

 had shifted to a trend of recovery from a prolonged downturn in the second

 half of last year and had exceeded GDP growth year-on-year until the first

 half of this year, but the savings ratio in the household sector still remained

 high, and thus it was uncertain whether the growth could be maintained. The

 Bank of Korea Research Department currently forecast the economic growth

 rates for this year and next to be 2.7% each, and projected private

 consumption to increase by 2.7% this year and maintain growth at the same

 level next year, even if boosted by expanded government spending. The

14


-----

###### member assessed these forecasts to have some downside risks.

 With regard to inflation, meanwhile, the member noted that consumer

 price inflation had picked up somewhat, while core inflation had fallen to

 the lower- to mid-1% range. The member presented the view that this was

 due to a slight decline in inflation expectations and to weak drivers for

 the buildup of underlying inflationary pressures stemming from moderate

 growth in domestic demand, led by consumption. With respect to the price

 path, the member thus expected consumer price inflation to fluctuate in

 reflection of changes in supply-side factors such as oil prices, with core

 inflation increasing moderately.

 Regarding the Research Department’s downward revision to its core

 inflation estimates―1.2% for this year and 1.6% for next year―the

 member’s assessment was that, given that core inflation had generally

 exhibited rigid movements, the Research Department’s forecast for next

 year had some degree of downside risk, with administered prices as an

 uncertainty variable.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled reflecting the views of the majority.

 However, Mr. Lee, Il Houng and Mr. Koh, Seung Beom expressed

 clear opposition to the idea of keeping the Base Rate at its current level

 and argued for raising it by 0.25 of a percentage point.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

###### leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.

- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the

###### global economy has continued its sound growth. The global financial

 markets have shown increased volatility, with government bond yields

 rising and stock prices falling in major countries. Looking ahead the

 Board sees global economic growth as likely to be affected by factors

 such as the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, the paces

 of monetary policy normalization in major countries, and the directions

 of the US government's economic policies.

- The Board judges that the domestic economy has sustained a rate of

###### growth at its potential level generally, as consumption and exports have

 shown favorable movements although the adjustments in facilities and

 construction investment have persisted. Employment conditions have

 remained sluggish, with the number of persons employed having risen

 only slightly. Going forward the Board expects domestic economic

16


-----

###### growth to be somewhat below the path projected in July, but to sustain

 a rate that does not diverge significantly from its potential level. It

 anticipates that investment will slow but that the trend of steady

 increase in consumption will continue, and that exports will also sustain

 their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global

 economy.

- Consumer price inflation has risen to the upper-1% level, due mainly to

###### an acceleration in the pace of increase in agricultural product prices and

 to the ending of a temporary reduction of electricity fees. Core inflation

 (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has

 remained at the 1% level, and the rate of inflation expected by the

 general public has been in the mid- to upper-2% range. Looking ahead

 it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fluctuate in the mid- to

 upper-1% range. Core inflation will also gradually rise.

- In the domestic financial markets, stock prices have fallen significantly

###### and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has risen to a

 considerable extent, in line mainly with the escalation of the US-China

 trade dispute and the rapid decline in stock prices globally. Long-term

 market interest rates have increased, in reflection of the changes in

 interest rates in major countries. Household lending has sustained its

 higher rate of expansion than in past years, although the amount of its

 expansion has lessened somewhat. Housing sales prices had risen

 substantially in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas, but their

 pace of increase has slowed since the Korean government’s

 announcement of measures to stabilize the housing market.

- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure

###### that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price

 inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term

 horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast

17


-----

###### that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the

 time being, and that the domestic economy will sustain a rate of

 growth that does not diverge significantly from its potential level, the

 Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this

 process it will judge whether it is necessary to adjust its

 accommodative monetary policy stance, while closely checking future

 economic growth and inflation trends. It will also carefully monitor

 conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the

 monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions

 in emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt,

 and geopolitical risks.
