##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and

 International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the

 Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

 Members’ assessment of the global economy was that, although real

 economic indictors in some advanced economies had weakened somewhat

 in the first quarter, the global economy had continued its trend of recovery,

 thanks to expansionary fiscal policies in major countries and favorable

 business conditions in the IT sector, and global trade had maintained strong

 growth. Members also evaluated that, with respect to the global financial

 markets, instability in the financial markets in emerging market economies

 (EMEs), especially in vulnerable EMEs such as Argentina and Turkey, had

 heightened, due to the US dollar’s strength stemming from rising US

 Treasury bond yields.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that,

 despite a correction in investment, the Korean economy was expected to

 show growth at its potential level in the future, as exports and

 consumption continued to show favorable movements. The members,

 however, judged that there were medium-term uncertainties in the labor

 market, and added that a close watch should be kept on the possibility

 that the delayed recovery of the labor market could limit the trend of

 improvement in consumption. The members also noted that downside risks

 included the continued rise of oil prices and stronger protectionism, while

 upside risks included an improved trade environment with China and

 expanded government spending stemming from a supplementary budget.

 Concerning inflation, members noted that consumer price inflation had

###### risen to 1.6% in April, from 1.3% in the first quarter, and core inflation

 had also picked up in April compared to the first quarter, showing a shift

 from the previous downward trend in price inflation. The members,

 however, expected that it would take more time for consumer price

 inflation to stabilize above the target level.

 As to the domestic financial markets, members saw that, on the

 external side, there was financial instability in some EMEs mainly from

 US monetary policy normalization, and on the domestic side, growth in

 household lending by the banking sector had expanded, led by leasehold

 deposit and other loans. Accordingly, the members assessed risks to have

 grown somewhat.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would

 be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for

 the intermeeting period.

 One member took the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base

 Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.

 The member noted that, although the global economy had been

 maintaining a trend of recovery thanks to expansionary fiscal policies in

 major countries and favorable business conditions in the IT sector, some

 EMEs with weak foreign exchange sectors had shown signs of market

 unrest, due to the strength of the US dollar stemming from the US

 Federal Reserve’s implementation of monetary policy tightening. The

 member stated that, with respect to the domestic financial markets, the

 won had maintained relative strength thanks to an improvement in South

 Korea’s relationship with North Korea, and the swap market had generally

 remained stable. The member commented that, although the expansion in

 non-IT exports had been more sluggish than expected, and investment was

 going through a correction as projected, the real economy was showing

 recovery somewhat beyond its potential growth level, thanks to strong IT

 exports and moderate improvement in consumption. The member saw that,

 with the share of labor income having shown stability for the past few

 years in particular, labor income was distributed more widely due to an

 increase in the number of persons employed. The member assessed this to

 have contributed to the trend of improvement in consumption. The

 member, however, presented the view that the demand recovery had not

 contributed to inflationary pressures through wage increases because,

4


-----

###### despite a decline in average working hours, total working hours had

 increased due to a constant rise in the economic participation rate

 stemming from the delayed retirements of workers aged 50 and older. The

 member, however, added that there was a high possibility that the decline

 of total labor supply due to the shrinking working-age population could

 contribute to higher average wages beginning this year. Accordingly, the

 member expected inflation to near its target next year when the base

 effect would disappear and downside pressures on regulated prices would

 be offset by the upside pressures on global prices, given current domestic

 demand pressures and room for future wage hikes.

 The member noted that the degree of monetary policy accommodation

 should be determined in consideration of its impacts on prices and the real

 economy over a medium-term horizon. The member stated that the

 accommodative monetary policy for the past years had been driving

 inflation through boosted domestic demand, but the housing oversupply

 that would be observed from this year would put downward pressure on

 housing rents and prices while also showing direct social costs from

 inefficient resource allocation. The member added that attention should be

 paid to the possibility of balloon effects being created in various sectors if

 the current stance remained unchanged. In short, the member saw a need

 to somewhat reduce the current degree of accommodation, but expressed

 the view that the monetary policy accommodation stance should be

 adjusted while closely observing the followings: changes in external

 conditions, which had undergone rapid changes of late; uncertain balloon

 effects; and the currently ongoing structural reforms, particularly in the

 labor market.

 Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to hold

 the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent this time.

 Looking at the recent economic situations since the Monetary Policy

 Board meeting on April 12th, the member judged uncertainties surrounding

 the future growth and inflation paths to have heightened somewhat, but

5


-----

###### saw that there was not a high possibility of the domestic economy

 significantly deviating from its previously expected trajectory. The member

 stated that investment was undergoing a correction phase, but exports and

 consumption remained strong. Pointing to the implementation of a

 supplementary budget and signs of improvement in trade conditions with

 China, the member projected the solid trend of economic growth to

 continue at its potential level in the future. Meanwhile, the member noted

 that consumer price inflation would likely accelerate to its target of 2.0

 percent, as originally forecast. The member, however, presented the view

 that, given that the Korean economy was maintaining growth at its

 potential level, the sluggish employment conditions of late seemed to be

 attributable to structural factors, not cyclical factors, and thus it was

 necessary to take structural or microeconomic policy measures rather than

 utilize macroeconomic business cycle adjustment instruments. The member

 expected the supplementary budget to have some effect in that it was a

 microeconomic measure focused on the employment sector, including the

 creation of jobs for the youth.

 The member’s assessment was that, with respect to financial stability,

 risks had increased somewhat. The member pointed out that, on the

 external front, there was a low possibility of financial instability in EMEs

 spreading to Korea in consideration of its favorable external soundness, but

 the possibility of continued monetary policy normalization by the US

 Federal Reserve causing instability in Korea’s capital flows and domestic

 financial market price variables could not be ruled out. The member noted

 that, on the domestic front, household credit was continuing to grow more

 rapidly than in the past, and corporate credit had also shown accelerated

 growth of late. The member went on to comment that, if accommodative

 financial conditions continued, there was a possibility that the rapid growth

 of private sector credit would not be contained, which could undermine

 external confidence. The member thus stressed the need to closely watch

 the relevant developments.

###### With respect to the corresponding monetary policy direction, the

 member expressed the opinion that risks on the macroeconomic side had

 shown no great changes, with the economy expected to maintain growth at

 its potential level this year and consumer price inflation to near its target.

 The member, however, stated that risks on the domestic and international

 financial stability fronts had increased somewhat. The member thus noted

 that, at this juncture, it was necessary to reduce the degree of monetary

 policy accommodation, while giving more attention to financial stability in

 monetary policy operations. In addition, the member found it desirable to

 raise the Base Rate to an appropriate level in times of solid growth in

 order to ensure space for monetary policy in preparation for a possible

 change in the phase of the business cycle over a longer time horizon.

 However, the member stated that some had raised concerns about an

 economic slowdown due to growing uncertainties surrounding domestic and

 international conditions of late, and that a hike in the Base Rate under

 these circumstances could deteriorate economic sentiment. The member

 thus expressed the view that it would be better to keep the Base Rate at

 its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period, while keeping

 a close watch on changes in financial and economic conditions a little

 longer.

  One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to

 hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, based on

 the judgment that it would be appropriate to determine when to raise the

 Base Rate after further examining whether the uptrend in prices would

 accelerate or continue.

  Looking at the real economy, the member’s evaluation was that,

 despite some risk factors, the trend of growth had continued while going

 through adjustment due to one-off factors. The member mentioned that some

 real economic indicators had weakened in Europe and other regions, and that

 the uptrend of US interest rates had led to financial instability in vulnerable

7


-----

###### EMEs such as Argentina and Turkey. However, the member stated that such

 instability was unlikely to develop into a liquidity crunch in the international

 financial markets, and assessed Korean exports, particularly of semiconductors,

 as maintaining their strength driven by the continued rapid growth of the

 global trade volume. In terms of domestic demand, the member also

 evaluated that, although there were some negative indicators, they were not

 serious enough to undermine the original forecast of sustained growth. The

 member went on to state that the April monitoring indicators had suggested

 signs of a slowdown in consumption and a correction in facilities investment,

 but these merely represented a technical decline from the previous rapid

 growth and thus it was a little too early to see this decline as a trend

 reversal.

  Looking at the labor market, meanwhile, the member noted that

 employment conditions had worsened even further, as shown in the continued

 sluggish employment in the wholesale & retail and food & accommodation

 sectors and in the rapid slowdown in the year-on-year change in

 manufacturing employment in April, while growth in wages, and basic wages

 in particular, had been accelerating substantially this year. The member

 attributed the worsening employment sluggishness and faster wage growth to

 a combination of factors, including cyclical changes in labor demand in line

 with economic recovery, structural changes in labor demand caused by the

 restructurings of some manufacturing companies, and structural changes in

 labor supply following the minimum wage hike, and went on to state that the

 medium-term uncertainties for the Korean economy came from the labor

 market.

  As for inflation, the member noted that there had been a shift in the

 downward trend of inflation, with consumer price inflation accelerating from

 1.3% in the first quarter to 1.6% in April, and core inflation, excluding the

 prices of agricultural and petroleum products, increasing from 1.2% to 1.4%

 over the same period. The member also mentioned that, amid the positive

 GDP gap, inflation was forecast to accelerate and the real neutral interest rate

8


-----

###### remained on the rise, as suggested by global economic trends, and thus the

 member argued that the policy judgment that the future policy rate path

 should also increase still held. However, the member assessed that, since

 inflation remained low, the timing of rate hikes could still be adjusted after

 watching for the forecast of higher inflation to be realized.

  Concerning financial stability, the member’s evaluation was that the

 growth in bank lending to households, having exhibited signs of slowing

 down early this year, had started to accelerate again from March, and added

 that this faster growth, driven by leasehold deposit and other loans, was

 different from the expansion in household lending up to 2017, which had

 been led by group lending. The member also emphasized that, compared with

 other loans, leasehold deposit loans had inherent factors weakening risk

 management incentives for banks: such loans were guaranteed by public

 institutions and their principal was excluded from the DSR calculation, which

 is why some banks had recently been aggressively marketing them. The

 member stressed that it would be necessary to carefully reexamine factors

 distorting risk management incentives for financial institutions involved in

 leasehold deposit lending.

 Meanwhile, one member expressed the view that it would be desirable to

 keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting

 period.

 The member forecast that the global economy would maintain strong

 growth exceeding its potential this year and global trade would sustain strong

 growth for the time being, and assessed the weakening of real economic

 indicators in some advanced countries during the first quarter as having been

 attributable to one-off factors. The member added that in the medium and

 long term, however, the possibility could not be ruled out that the spread of

 trade protectionism, rising oil prices, and financial instability in some EMEs

 could act as downside risks to the global economy and trade.

 The member stated that the Korean economy had exhibited solid,

 export-led growth in the first quarter but this faster growth had been

9


-----

###### attributable also to one-off factors, such as a base effect and increased

 demand during the Winter Olympic Games, and expected the

 quarter-on-quarter growth rate to slow down in the second quarter. The

 member evaluated that, looking at the major economic indicators released

 since the previous meeting, the average growth rate during the first half of

 this year would not deviate far from the April forecast, and added that the

 secular improvement in the output gap had continued.

 The member expressed the view that there was, however, a mix of upside

 and downside risks on the future growth path. As for major downside risks,

 the member pointed to the possibility of a slower-than-expected recovery in

 employment that might restrict future improvements in consumption, and went

 on to argue that, although the pace of increase in nominal wages, and those

 of regular employees in particular, had been accelerating, any corresponding

 growth in employment had not yet been seen. Second, the member mentioned

 that if the recent rise in oil prices persisted for a long time, this might have

 negative impacts on the real economy, restricting households’ real purchasing

 power and increasing corporate production costs. Third, the member stressed

 that attention should be paid to the fact that export growth still had been

 seen mostly in some IT sectors and that the pace of increase in the

 international prices of related items had recently been slowing significantly,

 and added that hikes in the prices of oil and other commodities and the

 spread of trade protectionism might lead companies to make conservative

 investment and employment decisions. On the other hand, the member

 expressed the view that improved trade conditions with China, an

 increased number of foreign tourists, and increased government expenditure

 following the drawing up of a supplementary budget were likely to act as

 upside risks. Meanwhile, with respect to the reduction in statutory working

 hours scheduled to come into effect in July this year, the member

 mentioned that the effects on business activities and consumption would

 depend on the specifics of implementation.

 Concerning inflation, the member stated that consumer price inflation had

10


-----

###### accelerated to the mid-1% level and expected upside pressure on inflation to

 increase gradually if the secular improvement in the output gap continued, but

 the member also forecast that it would take more time for inflation to

 stabilize above the target level. The member went on to argue that the price

 path for the second half of this year might exhibit higher volatility, however,

 due mainly to the possible persistence of high global oil prices, movements

 of the Korean won’s exchange rate, and possible hikes in regulated prices

 following local elections.

 Looking at the financial and foreign exchange markets, the member

 expressed the view that the markets had remained stable overall but attention

 should be paid to the fact that household lending growth had started to

 accelerate again and that monetary normalization in major countries might

 progress more rapidly than expected.

  Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to keep

 the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.

  The member evaluated that, despite financial instability in some EMEs

 occurring in the course of the recent US monetary policy normalization, the

 global economy had overall sustained a relatively high rate of growth, and

 the Korean economy accordingly had continued to exhibit a growth rate close

 to its potential level, driven by exports. The member pointed out, however,

 that the export boom had been concentrated in specific industries such as

 semiconductors, and that concerns had been raised about a possible weakening

 of structural competitiveness in some other industries. The member also noted

 that the restructurings of some manufacturing sectors suffering from worsening

 profitability seemed to have acted as a key factor, along with the recent

 shock from higher employment-related expenses, causing the pace of growth

 in the number of persons employed to slow significantly.

  The member assessed that, unlike these structural or aggregate supply-side

 changes, aggregate demand-side changes were difficult to identify. The

 member also argued that increased government spending, particularly in health

 and welfare, and signs that the plunge in the number of foreign tourists was

11


-----

###### easing had partly acted as buffers against insufficient aggregate domestic

 demand, but there were growing uncertainties regarding how the recent

 changes in labor market conditions would affect household consumption and

 corporate investment spending decisions.

  The member accordingly argued that, as there were too much uncertainties

 to predict future growth and inflation at this point of time, it would be

 necessary to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the time being and,

 at the same time, to examine whether aggregate demand in the Korean

 economy was increasing in line with its forecast by closely analyzing the

 overall macroeconomy, including economic conditions and inflation.

  The member, meanwhile, expected capital flow fluctuations, caused partly

 by US monetary policy normalization, to be absorbed smoothly by flexible

 exchange rate adjustments. The member went on to state that the household

 debt problem would be eased gradually by a housing market correction and

 by continuously strengthening macroprudential policies.

 One other member expressed the view that it would be desirable to

 observe economic and inflation developments as well as international

 financial market conditions a little longer, while holding the Base Rate at

 the current level of 1.50% this time.

 Concerning the outlook for the global economy, the member expected

 the trend of growth to continue overall, with some advanced economies

 recovering from their sluggishness during the first quarter. However, the

 member also argued that it was necessary to closely monitor the impacts

 on international financial markets from monetary normalization in major

 countries in line with their economic recoveries, and also the possibility of

 consequent financial instability in EMEs.

 With regard to the domestic economy, the member’s assessment was

 that, while the economy had been overall exhibiting modest growth, the

 recent sluggish employment conditions and other factors might negatively

 affect private consumption, and attention was needed to be paid to how

12


-----

###### the slower growth of the real estate market would affect future

 construction investment. The member stated that exports had remained

 buoyant overall but concerns had continued about the dependency of the

 export growth on specific items, including semiconductors. The member

 went on to argue that Korean exports did not seem to have fully taken

 advantage of favorable global economic and trade growth, and it would

 therefore be necessary to examine whether export-related industries were

 suffering from worsening structural problems. The member also stressed

 that, as concerns had been raised that the employment sluggishness had

 been attributable to structural factors relating to the manufacturing industry

 and the self-employed, it would be necessary to analyze the effectiveness

 of the government’s employment policy measures. The member’s

 assessment was that consumer price inflation had accelerated somewhat

 while core inflation had remained low, and the member’s forecast was that

 inflation would fail to reach its target of 2 percent this year, even when

 upside risks from oil price hikes were factored in.

 In overall consideration of real economic conditions, the member

 evaluated that it would be necessary to maintain the current

 accommodative monetary policy for the time being, since there existed

 various uncertainties related to business activities, concerns had arisen

 about labor market conditions, and the inflation gap was highly likely to

 remain negative this year, although the output gap remained positive.

 In terms of financial stability, the member took the view that it would

 be appropriate to pay more attention to the recent heightening of

 international financial market volatility while coping with the accumulation

 of financial imbalances. With respect to household debt, the member called

 for analysis of the trend of growth in credit lending, and stated that the

 possibility of continued demand for housing-related loans should not be

 overlooked, considering factors such as the demand for new apartments.

 Meanwhile, the member argued that, amid the growing financial instability

 in EMEs following the appreciation of the US dollar, it would be

13


-----

###### advisable to prepare against a possible increase in international financial

 market volatility in line for example with the US Federal Reserve’s rate

 hike in June.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

 leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Board considers that the

 global economy has continued its robust growth. Financial markets in

 some emerging market economies with weak external soundness have

 shown instability, as capital outflows from them have increased.

 Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as likely to be

 affected by factors such as the paces of monetary policy normalization

 in major countries, the movements toward spreading trade

 protectionism, and the directions of the US government's economic

 policies.

 □ The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth

 has continued, as consumption and exports have shown favorable

 movements although facilities investment has slowed somewhat.

 Employment conditions have been sluggish, with the extent of increase

 in the number of persons employed having remained at a low level.

 Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be

 generally consistent with the path projected in April. It anticipates that

 investment will slow but that the trend of steady increase in

15


-----

###### consumption will continue, and that exports will also sustain their

 favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy.

 □ Consumer price inflation has risen to the mid-1% level, due mainly to

 increases in the prices of agricultural products. Core inflation (with

 food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has also been

 in the mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general

 public has remained at the mid-2% level. Looking ahead it is forecast

 that consumer price inflation, after remaining in the mid-1% range for

 some time, will pick up and gradually approach the target level from

 the second half of this year. Core inflation will also gradually rise.

 □ The domestic financial markets have been generally stable. Although

 long-term market interest rates have increased, under the effects chiefly

 of rising government bond yields in major countries, the Korean

 won-US dollar exchange rate has fluctuated within a relatively narrow

 range, in line mainly with the global strengthening of the US dollar

 and with the decline in risks related to North Korea. Household

 lending has sustained its higher rate of expansion than in past years,

 led by unsecured loans. The paces of increase in housing sales prices

 have slowed, especially in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding

 areas.

 □ Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to

 ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer

 price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term

 horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast

 that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the

 time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its

 solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary

 policy stance. In this process it will judge carefully whether it is

16


-----

###### necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further,

 while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends. It

 will also carefully monitor any changes in the monetary policies of

 major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the

 trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.
