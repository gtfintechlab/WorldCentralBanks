##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on “Recent Economic Developments,” “FX and

 International Finance” and “Financial Market Trends,” the discussions of the

 Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

 Members evaluated that, despite slower growth in emerging market

 economies (EMEs), the global economy had continued to show strong

 growth, led for instance by the buoyancy of the US economy. Members

 also mentioned that volatility could heighten in the global financial markets,

 as the US-China trade dispute continued, concerns about spreading financial

 unrest in Turkey and some other EMEs had grown, and the monetary

 policy normalization of the US Federal Reserve was likely to continue.

 Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that it

 was continuing to grow at its potential level with the steady growth of

 private consumption and exports, although facilities and construction

 investment had been going through corrections. Members, however, noted

 that it was necessary to keep a close eye on heightened downside risks

 stemming for instance from the US-China trade dispute, financial unrest in

 EMEs, and worsening employment sluggishness. 

 Concerning inflation, members noted that consumer price inflation had

 remained in the mid-1% range, and core inflation had slowed to the 1%

 range. Members expected the price path to be lowered slightly from the

 July path forecast.

 As to the domestic financial markets, members assessed that they had

 shown a stable trend overall, despite expanded volatility in the

 international financial markets due mainly to the US-China trade dispute

 lending growth had been slowing, attention should be paid to the

 continued strong growth in sole proprietor loans.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall

 consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic

 environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current

 level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.

 One member took the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base

 Rate from the current 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent at this meeting.

 The member noted that monetary policy had to be considered within

 the framework of the global economic outlook, effective utilization of

 limited policy space, and harmony with other macroeconomic policies, with

 the goal of minimizing volatility and the width of the inflation gap from a

 medium- to long-term perspective. First, the member assessed that with

 respect to the economic situation in Korea, growth seemed to be anchored

 at the upper-2% range, lower than in the past. The member noted that the

 potential growth path in Korea still seemed to be going through a

 correction due to ongoing structural changes, such as a decline in the

 domestic labor force and a shift into a new global trade order,

 emphasizing that this could not be easily distinguished from cyclical

 fluctuations. In this regard, the member saw that the Korean economy was

 likely to be more influenced by cyclical fluctuations of the global

 economy, rather than by domestic factors. On the domestic front, the

 member expected downward pressures on consumption stemming from

 sluggish employment and income polarization would be offset to some

 extent by solid growth in total wages. The member, however, presented

 the view that, on the external front, if the global economy, which had

 peaked, entered into an economic downturn, this, together with effects

 from a reduction in dollar liquidity, could weigh cyclically on growth.

###### Next, with respect to the inflation gap and financial imbalances, the

 member noted that (i) the price index with administered items excluded,

 which was a better indicator of demand pressures than the CPI, had

 already been fluctuating at around its target for months; (ii) inflation

 expectations among the general public had also remained at the mid-2%

 range; and (iii) the forecasts of corporations (an important link with the

 real economy) for consumer prices and for the rate of increase in their

 product prices seemed to show movements similar to these expectations.

 The member also noted that the GDP gap was forecast to be positive,

 albeit slightly, and inflation in OECD countries were projected to be

 revised upward. Against this backdrop, the member expected that, absent

 any additional shock, consumer price inflation would gradually near its

 target. The member, however, emphasized that if a judgement is made to

 maintain domestic demand pressures, which are slightly above potential

 growth, in consideration only of the current inflation gap, the resulting

 deepened financial imbalances would lead to the widening of the mid-term

 inflation gap due to difficulties in responding to cyclical downward

 pressures, and more policy space and time would be needed to narrow the

 inflation gap. The member saw that financial imbalances had been

 continuing to build up under the current easing stance, pointing out that

 non-bank sole proprietor loans had been on the rise, that real estate

 investment was not leading to sustainable income, and that Korea’s

 household leverage compared to income was very high internationally and

 had been continuing to increase.

 In this regard, the member’s judgment was that, from the perspective

 of policy coordination, it would be desirable to improve the efficiency of

 resource distribution and to maintain appropriate incentives for investment

 by slightly reducing monetary policy easing at this point in time when

 demand pressures were driven by an expansionary fiscal policy to provide

 income support for vulnerable groups.

 Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to hold

5


-----

###### the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period,

 while continuing to observe future economic developments.

 First, looking at recent economic conditions in consideration of changes in

 circumstances since the previous MPB meeting, the member saw that, on the

 growth front, the economy was judged to maintain growth at its potential

 level thanks to steady growth in consumption and exports, despite corrections

 in facilities and construction investment. The member also noted that

 economic sentiment had weakened considerably, due to growing concerns

 about downside risks stemming for instance from the US-China trade dispute,

 financial unrest in EMEs and the deepened employment sluggishness. The

 member, however, commented that economic agents seemed to have

 responded somewhat excessively given the coexistence of upside risks, such

 as fiscal expansion to support job creation and income, government policy

 measures including a cut in the individual consumption tax, and major large

 corporations’ plans to expand their investment. The member went on to

 express the view that the excessive weakening of sentiment might amplify

 adverse effects through a self-realization process, and thus a careful watch

 needed to be kept in this regard.

 In terms of prices, the member expected the price path to be lowered

 slightly from the July forecast. The member, however, assessed this to be

 largely attributable not to demand factors but to policy factors, which include

 the government’s welfare policy measures, such as an increase in public heath

 care benefit coverage, an expansion of free school meals, and temporary cuts

 in the individual consumption tax and electricity fees. Accordingly, the

 member anticipated that, although inflation would approach the target

 somewhat more slowly and reach it somewhat later, the upward movement of

 inflation toward the target was likely to remain unchanged. The member,

 meanwhile, presented the opinion that if inflation diverged from its target due

 to reasons other than demand factors, it would be desirable to further increase

 the degree of flexibility in operating monetary policy under the inflation

 targeting regime.

###### In terms of domestic and international financial and foreign exchange

 markets, the member’s assessment was that these markets had generally

 remained stable, despite heightened volatility in the international financial

 markets due mainly to the US-China trade dispute and financial unrest in

 EMEs. In particular, the member commented that growth of monetary

 aggregates such as M2 and Lf had been on the rise, as funding to

 corporations had expanded thanks to improved sales performances and the

 easing of credit risk aversion, and as household and sole proprietor loans had

 also been increasing steadily. In addition, the member stressed the need for

 paying attention to the possibility that these financial easing conditions could

 work to build up the risk of financial imbalances, as could be seen in the

 recent growth in credit related to real estate and the run-up in real estate

 prices in some parts of the Seoul Metropolitan region.

 Concerning the monetary policy response, the member’s assessment was

 that, taking current growth, inflation and financial conditions into overall

 consideration, it was necessary to somewhat reduce the degree of monetary

 easing from the current level through an increase in the Base Rate,

 focusing on the risk of financial imbalances rather than the risk of

 macroeconomic imbalances. The member, however, judged that, given the

 high uncertainties over external conditions such as the US-China trade

 dispute and financial unrest in EMEs, and the significant weakening of

 economic sentiment stemming for instance from more

 sluggish-than-expected employment indicators in July, a raise in the Base

 rate at this meeting could have unintended negative effects.

 One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold

 the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period

 while examining closely the real economic trend as seen in economic

 activities, employment and inflation and also constantly monitoring financial

 stability conditions.

 The member evaluated that the global economy had maintained overall

 growth, boosted chiefly by the strong US economy. However, the member

7


-----

###### also mentioned a possibility of greater international financial market

 volatility due to the sustained US-China trade dispute, growing concerns

 about the spread of financial instability in Turkey and some other EMEs,

 and the prospect of continued monetary policy normalization by the US

 Federal Reserve. The member went on to argue that if the US carried out

 trade protectionist measures as it had already signalled, it would be

 necessary to closely monitor how these measures would affect the Korean

 economy.

 Looking at the domestic economy, the member did not expect growth 

 to deviate far from the level forecast in July. The member noted that,

 although private consumption had remained stable and exports had been

 strong as originally expected, the recent employment sluggishness might

 restrict private consumption, and facilities and construction investment had

 been going through corrections, which taken together increased concerns

 about the real economy as a whole. The member added that it would be

 very important to analyze the cyclical, structural and policy factors behind

 the investment and employment sluggishness. The member emphasized that,

 since inflation was likely to remain lower than originally forecast in July,

 a close analysis of inflation should be made for the second half of this

 year and for the first half of next year.

 The member noted that, under these real economic conditions, many had

 pointed not to short-term cyclical factors but rather to structural and policy

 factors, including the gradually weakening competitiveness of the

 manufacturing sector, as largely responsible for the recent economic

 difficulties, and thus the member took the view that more efforts should be

 made to improve economic fundamentals in the medium and long term.

 However, the member also judged that, since cyclical factors might have also

 contributed to the sluggish employment and below-target inflation, it would be

 necessary to develop monetary policy to cope with short-term economic

 fluctuations, while considering whether growth would deviate far from its

 potential level and whether consumer price inflation would gradually approach

8


-----

###### its target level from the fourth quarter of this year.

 In this regard, the member evaluated that more time should be taken to

 monitor movements of macroeconomic indicators while holding the Base

 Rate at its current level. The member also expressed the view that,

 although household debt was expected to remain stable in the second half

 of this year, largely due to the effects of government measures, more

 careful attention should be paid to financial stability when making

 monetary policy decisions at a time when the economy was faced with

 household debt growth that had continued for several years in the low

 interest rate environment and with real estate price hikes in some regions.

 Finally, the member noted that, although there was not much likelihood of

 financial instability in some EMEs spreading to other EMEs, close

 examination of international financial market developments should be

 maintained, while considering the continued rate hikes by the US Federal

 Reserve and the possibility of the US strengthening its trade protectionist

 measures, for example through its dispute with China.

 One member, meanwhile, expressed the view that it would be

 appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level and take more time to

 observe future changes in domestic and external economic conditions.

 The member’s assessment was that the global economy had maintained

 strong growth and the trade volume had remained large overall despite the

 rise of trade protectionism and financial instability in vulnerable EMEs,

 and that upside and downside risks to the future growth path had balanced

 out each other. The member evaluated that tighter credit conditions had

 been seen mostly in EMEs whose current accounts had shifted to deficits,

 and EMEs, unlike the US and some other advanced countries, had seen

 slower growth, but the member added that it was good to see countries

 with favorable external soundness announcing modest stimulus measures.

 The member assessed that the domestic economy had maintained

 growth consistent with the potential growth rate in the first half of this

 year, but the gap between exports and domestic demand had been

9


-----

###### widening and uncertainty surrounding the future growth path had increased

 somewhat. The member estimated that exports had been maintaining strong

 growth overall. More specifically, the member added that the outlook for

 robust export volume growth was supported by its month-on-month

 rebound as well as by the partial spread of export improvement, which

 had been concentrated in the IT sector, to non-IT sectors. The member’s

 judgment was that the total value of customs-cleared exports had exhibited

 slower growth, but this had been due mainly to semiconductor prices

 entering a correction phase, and the member added that, considering past

 examples and the global trade and demand conditions, customs-cleared

 export growth was highly likely to gradually stabilize.

 In terms of domestic demand, meanwhile, the member assessed that its

 correction phase had been lengthened and major indicators related to the

 growth path for the second half of the year had been falling short of

 original forecasts, and went on to point out that employment had remained

 sluggish since the end of last year owing to structural, policy and cyclical

 factors. The member estimated that households’ consumption capacities had

 been gradually improving, with total wages maintaining a sharp increase

 and with household income growth exceeding its average for the past two

 to three years, but corporate and consumer sentiment indexes had been

 declining. And thus the member mentioned that considerable attention

 should be paid to assessing the degree to which labor market policy was

 affecting consumption and to judging whether incomes were continuing to

 improve. Meanwhile, the member’s evaluation was that the details of

 measures to revitalize domestic demand, including temporary individual

 consumption tax cuts, were still in a state of flux, but they were a

 positive factor for the domestic demand outlook.

 With regard to inflation, the member noted that consumer price

 inflation had maintained growth at around the mid-1 percent level and

 core inflation had slowed to the 1 percent level, both coming in slightly

 below the original forecasts, but if irregular factors, policy effects, and

10


-----

###### base effects were counted out, it would be difficult to rule out the

 possibility of inflationary pressures remaining higher than what had been

 suggested by the headline indexes. The member went on to state that

 attention should be paid to the possibility of consumer price inflation

 approaching its target more rapidly if cost factors, such as administered

 prices, that had limited inflation for several years became neutral or

 shifted to an increase and if the output gap remained positive. The

 member also expressed the view that constant monitoring and estimation of

 the underlying trend of inflationary pressures were important considerations

 in determining the level of the Base Rate that would be consistent with

 the medium-term inflation trend.

 Finally, as to financial stability, the member mentioned that attention

 was being paid to the fact that household lending had been growing at a

 slower pace, but risk factors remained and loans to sole proprietors with

 relatively short maturities had continued to grow rapidly. Looking at the

 financial markets, the member took the view that, as the US was expected

 to continue its rate hikes, and trade conflicts among major countries and

 financial conditions in EMEs had been working to destabilize the financial

 markets, it would be necessary to continuously monitor the possibility of a

 spread of related risks.

 Another member took the view that it would be desirable to hold the

 Base Rate at its current level this time.

 On the external front, the member noted that the possibility that

 US-China trade dispute would protract could not be ruled out, and

 concerns about real economic slowdown in China had been spreading, with

 its industrial production growth rate for July lower than usual amid

 heightened yuan volatility and declines in investment and consumption

 indicators. Looking at the US economy, meanwhile, the member’s

 evaluation was that, with consumption, investment and exports all showing

 buoyancy, the US seemed to be enjoying a booming economy─the growth

 rate had stood at 4.2 percent in the second quarter of this year and

11


-----

###### consumer price inflation had risen to 2.9 percent in July, and thanks to all

 this the global economy and trade were not showing any signs of

 slowdown.

 On the domestic front, the member judged that there had been

 negative indicators, with construction and facilities investment continuing to

 go through corrections and consumer sentiment worsening, but private

 consumption had maintained modest growth, sustaining domestic demand.

 The member also mentioned that employment sluggishness had been

 worsening since the end of last year, with change in the number of

 persons employed falling to 5,000 in July due to the accelerating decline

 in employment in traditional services industries, including wholesale &

 retail and lodging & restaurants, and to the continued sharp reduction in

 employment in some manufacturing industries. The member added that

 wages, meanwhile, had sustained robust growth, accelerating month on

 month in May. The member added that the income distribution among

 households based on their participation in the labor market might

 experience negative effects from the conflicting trends of employment

 sluggishness and wage improvement, but as they offset each other, there

 remained uncertainties in terms of total household consumption. The

 member stated that thus it was difficult to conclude that future household

 consumption growth would be negatively impacted.

 The member, meanwhile, noted that in July consumer price inflation

 had remained unchanged from the second quarter at 1.5 percent and core

 inflation had fallen to 1 percent compared to the second quarter. And the

 member evaluated that, despite the sustained positive output gap and the

 accelerating wage growth, inflation had not been showing a clear upward

 trend. The member expressed the view that this low inflation trend had

 been attributable not only to the two factors pointed out at the previous

 meeting─domestic demand growth had been modest, and not strong

 enough to build up underlying inflationary pressures, and inflation

 expectations might have declined somewhat in line with the low inflation

12


-----

###### that had persisted for a considerable period of time since 2012─but also

 to other complementary factors. In line with this, the member pointed out

 that theoretically the US rate hikes would be expected to trigger normal

 capital outflows, depreciate the Korean won and give rise to inflationary

 pressures, but thanks to Korea’s heightened international credit standing,

 the US rate hikes and financial instability in some EMEs had encouraged

 foreign capital to flow into the Korean bond market. The member also

 argued that any adjustments to the Base Rate going forward should be in

 the upward direction, considering the fact that a small but positive output

 gap had been sustained and that the neutral interest rate had risen since

 the second half of last year, as the decline in export demand in

 accordance with the sharp decrease in global trade between 2012 and 2015

 had been substantially resolved and the decline in consumption demand

 caused by shocks from the weakening of households’ propensities to

 consume had somewhat eased. However, the member’s evaluation was that

 the timing of a Base Rate hike should be determined while monitoring the

 pace of growth in inflation in order to be true to the purpose of inflation

 targeting─controlling inflation expectations─since inflation had remained

 low and there remained large uncertainties, despite the real economy

 growing at or slightly above its potential.

 One other member expressed the view that it would be desirable to

 hold the Base Rate at its current level to serve as a buffer against the

 gradually increasing downside risks to the macroeconomy.

 The member’s assessment was that the Korean economy had been

 sustaining growth at around its potential rate until the second quarter,

 boosted by the global economic boom and increased semiconductor

 demand, but the economy was expected to face gradually increasing

 downside risks from the second half of this year. The member mentioned

 that exports had remained relatively favorable in July and August, but the

 possibility could not be ruled out of the growth gradually slowing down

 going forward in line chiefly with the strengthening of trade protectionism,

13


-----

###### the possibility of a Chinese economic slowdown and the easing of the

 sharp increase in global semiconductor demand that had led export growth.

 The member pointed out that the economy had also been burdened by a 

 rapid deterioration of the terms of trade, and noted that added value

 created through trade had been decreasing, with growth in import prices

 outpacing that in export prices, implying that, despite favorable export

 growth, the national purchasing power that could sustain consumption and

 investment had not been growing as rapidly as GDP. The member went

 on to state that this slowing growth in purchasing power in line with the

 worsening terms of trade suggested increasing downside risks to domestic

 demand. The member expressed the view that construction investment had

 already entered a correction phase in trend, that facilities investment,

 having shifted to a sharp decline in the second quarter, was unlikely to

 rebound soon, and that it would be difficult to expect private consumption,

 having contributed significantly to supporting domestic demand for the past

 year, to grow more rapidly from the second half of the year. The member

 assessed that, considering the rapid slowdown in change in the number of

 persons employed while wages had increased at a faster pace than usual,

 as well as the worsening sluggishness of self-employed businesses, it

 would be difficult to expect overall household income, including business

 income, to help accelerate private consumption growth enough to expand

 domestic demand as a whole. The member also commented that the recent

 and relatively rapid decline in the consumer sentiment index could be

 understood as representing changed conditions, making it hard to stay

 optimistic about the prospects for private consumption from the second

 half of this year.

 The member, meanwhile, presented the opinion that, despite cost-side

 inflationary pressures, such as higher oil prices and a sharp increase in the

 minimum wage, consumer price inflation had remained in the mid-1

 percent range and core inflation had fallen to 1.0 percent, in contrast to

 the global reflation trend, and went on to state that this implied that the

14


-----

###### aggregate demand of the Korean economy was sluggish. The member also

 argued that inflation was unlikely to rebound quickly given the limited

 prospects for an expansion of domestic demand going forward. 

 In this regard, the member argued that it would be desirable to keep

 the Base Rate at its current level this time to serve as a buffer against

 downside risks to economic activities and inflation. The member also

 expressed the view that the widening gap between US and Korean interest

 rates that might arise as a result, as well as the consequent capital flows

 and exchange rate fluctuations, should be understood as natural

 consequences reflecting the gap between the US and Korean

 macroeconomic situations.

##### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled reflecting the views of the majority.

 However, Mr. Lee, Il Houng expressed clear opposition to the idea of

 keeping the Base Rate at its current level, and argued for a 0.25

 percentage point raise.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

 leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Board considers that the

 global economy has continued its robust growth. In the global financial

 markets, some emerging market economies with weak external

 soundness have seen unease again, including capital outflows and sharp

 depreciations of their currencies. Looking ahead the Board sees global

 economic growth as likely to be affected by factors such as the

 movements toward spreading trade protectionism, the paces of monetary

 policy normalization in major countries, and the directions of the US

 government's economic policies.

 □ The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth

 has continued, as consumption and exports have shown favorable

 movements although the adjustments in facilities and construction

 investment have persisted. Employment conditions have become more

 sluggish, with the extent of increase in the number of persons

16


-----

###### employed having lessened significantly. Going forward the Board

 expects domestic economic growth to be generally consistent with the

 path projected in July and sustain a rate at its potential level. It

 anticipates that investment will slow but that the trend of steady

 increase in consumption will continue, and that exports will also

 sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global

 economy.

 □ Consumer price inflation has remained at the mid-1% level as the

 increases in service fees and agricultural product prices have slowed,

 despite the accelerating pace of increase in the prices of petroleum

 products. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded

 from the CPI) has fallen to the 1% level, and the rate of inflation

 expected by the general public has been in the mid- to upper-2%

 range. Looking ahead it is forecast that consumer price inflation, after

 remaining in the mid-1% range for some time, will pick up and

 gradually approach the target level. Core inflation will also gradually

 rise.

 □ The domestic financial markets have been generally stable. Long-term

 market interest rates have fallen, affected by the financial unease in

 some emerging market economies and the sluggishness of employment.

 Stock prices had declined, due mainly to concerns about the US-China

 trade dispute, but have since rebounded as these concerns have eased

 somewhat. The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fluctuated in

 line with changes in the value of the dollar globally. Household

 lending has sustained its higher rate of expansion than in past years,

 although the amount of its expansion has lessened somewhat. Housing

 sales prices have remained steady overall, but have risen rapidly in

 some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas.

17


-----

###### □ Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure

 that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price

 inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon,

 while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast that

 inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time

 being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid

 growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.

 In this process it will judge carefully whether it is necessary to adjust its

 accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking

 future economic growth and inflation trends. It will also carefully monitor

 conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the

 monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions in

 emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and

 geopolitical risks.
