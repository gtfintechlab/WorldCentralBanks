Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation

```
After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook (February 2021),[2)]_ _FX and_

_International Finance Trends, and_ _Financial Market Trends, the discussions of the_

Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

Members evaluated that the domestic economy was forecast to maintain its gradual

recovery but uncertainties surrounding the future growth path remained high. Looking at

each sector, members expected exports and facilities investment to maintain their strong

recoveries, thanks to the global economic recovery and improvement in the IT industry,

although private consumption would recover slowly due to the worsening of household

income conditions. Some members, however, presented the view that it would be

necessary to pay attention to the possibility that worsening growth imbalances between

consumption and exports/investment could widen the gaps between income groups and

between industries.

Members also pointed out that employment sluggishness had worsened, particularly

in face-to-face services industries hit hard by the COVID-19 shock, and expressed

concerns that it could take a considerable period of time for employment to get back

on track. Regarding inflation, members forecast that consumer price inflation would rise

slightly, owing primarily to supply-side factors including growth in food and

international commodity prices, while core inflation would remain low.

Members, meanwhile, emphasized that it would be necessary to pay continued

attention to financial stability risks such as rising financial market volatility at home and

abroad and increased leverage in the private sector. In line with this, some members

noted the increased sensitivity of financial markets to changes in global financial and

economic conditions and expressed the view that the possibility of sudden asset price

adjustments could not be ruled out.

Members also expressed the opinion that a careful watch was needed on medium
and long-term monetary policy conditions, including whether the potential growth rate

would decline due to the COVID-19 shock and when the output gap would be resolved,

as well as changes in the inflation environment at home and abroad. Members also

stressed that it would be necessary to thoroughly analyze the background behind the

recent hike in long-term market interest rates and its impact on the real economy and

cope with it in an appropriate manner.

Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

```
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the

Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

All members shared the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and

international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the

Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.

One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate

at the current level of 0.50%.

The member assessed that the global economic recovery had been weakening

somewhat due to the resurgence of COVID-19, but unlike during the early days of the

pandemic, goods trade and corporate investment continued to grow and demand had

been shifting relatively quickly to non-face-to-face consumption, which had been easing

the economic shock from the contraction of face-to-face consumption. The member also

evaluated that expectations of an economic recovery over a medium-term horizon had

been growing, boosted by increasing vaccine distribution and stimulus package

implementation in major countries.

The member mentioned that, while the domestic economy had been showing a

similar trend to those of major countries, the gap in economic activity between

industries and between sectors had been widening further than originally expected, and

caution was required in this regard with respect to its economic and social impacts. The

member’s assessment was that attention should be paid to the rapid worsening of

employment sluggishness, as shown in the employment rate sliding to a record low

since the global financial crisis in January this year. The member argued that such

sluggishness of employment seemed to have been caused by the negative spillover

effects of the pandemic being concentrated in face-to-face service industries with higher

employment inducement coefficients, rather than being felt more broadly across the

macroeconomy as a whole, and went on to point out that these industries would likely

see growing cases of temporary and permanent closures and downsizing of workers due

to prolonged social-distancing measures, and that employment sluggishness would be felt

more severely by low-income groups with higher marginal propensity to consume, which

would likely limit the recovery of consumption for a considerable period of time. The

member in this regard emphasized that it would be necessary to continue focusing

policy on selective support for vulnerable groups while maintaining a monetary easing

stance.


-----

The member meanwhile noted that there was recently growing interest in the

coordination of monetary and fiscal policies, and the Bank of Korea’s outright purchases

of Treasury bonds in particular. The member expressed the opinion that yields on

Treasury bonds, and long-term ones in particular, had been recently rising significantly

at home and abroad, and given that an increase in Treasury bond issuance following the

expansion of fiscal expenditure could increase financial market volatility, aggressive

policy responses might be needed to stabilize the markets. The member however

emphasized that attention should be paid to the fact that, since the structure and

conditions of domestic capital markets were far different from those in major countries,

the central bank’s intervention might not help ease the burden of funding costs on the

government and businesses at the same time. The member also mentioned that, with the

Base Rate remaining above 0%, unintended policy costs might be incurred while

absorbing increased liquidity as a result of Treasury bond purchases. The member took

the view that further monetary easing could be considered to solve this problem, but

would not be appropriate given recent economic and financial conditions. The member

went on to note that the output gap of the domestic economy was expected to narrow

gradually, despite high uncertainty surrounding the future recovery path, and that the

real policy rate was expected to decline further, considering the trends of consumer

price inflation and inflation expectations. Above all, the member’s judgment was that

continued caution about possible accumulation of financial imbalances was required since

financial conditions had become much more accommodative and leverage in the private

sector continued to increase.

Taking all this into consideration, the member judged that it would be appropriate

to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50% this time and to closely monitor

changes in domestic and international financial and economic conditions.

Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base

Rate unchanged from the current level of 0.50%.

The member evaluated that, despite the pandemic, the domestic economy had

outperformed major advanced economies last year, boosted by effective measures to

combat COVID-19 and the boom in the semiconductor industry. By sector, the member

noted that investment and net exports had exhibited more favorable movements than

expected while private consumption had been sluggish. The member assessed that,

although social controversy over fiscal space had limited fiscal expansion, increased

government spending and transfer payments had served as a buffer against a decline in

aggregate demand.

The member forecast that the domestic economy would recover centering around


-----

exports and investment, driven by the government’s expansionary fiscal policy and the

global economic recovery. The member however took the view that the pace of

recovery would depend on the recovery of private consumption and employment. The

member stated that households’ surplus income, in particular, had increased significantly

last year, due mainly to government aid, and forecast that how much of this surplus

would be allocated for spending would determine the momentum of the consumption

recovery. The member meanwhile expected that employment conditions would improve

compared with last year, but looking back at previous experiences, such improvement

was unlikely to outpace the recovery of economic growth. The member mentioned that,

since growth in non-face-to-face economic activities had become a trend and

labor-saving technological advances had been speeding up since the outbreak of

COVID-19, the possibility could not be ruled out of an economic structure with

ever-present labor slack becoming firmly entrenched. The member in this regard pointed

to the need to make up for worsening unemployment through the government’s job

creation project for the time being, even if those jobs are not of high quality, and went

on to argue that it would be necessary to patiently maintain accommodative monetary

policy and support measures for households and SMEs until the economy shows a

marked trend of recovery.

The member took the view that the current pandemic had reconfirmed which social

groups are most vulnerable to economic shocks. The member expressed the concern

that, as seen from past experiences, shocks to vulnerable groups could linger for quite

some time even following an export-driven economic recovery. The member emphasized

that, as it had been reconfirmed that an economic crisis worsens inequality and

polarization, it would be necessary to strengthen inclusiveness when implementing

financial and monetary policies as well as tax and fiscal policies.

The member expressed the opinion that it was too early for now to talk about

normalizing monetary policy out of concerns about inflationary pressures and a further

rise in asset prices, and that macroprudential regulations and financial supervision would

be of fundamental importance to financial stability. The member added that, amid

disinflationary pressures, the Phillips curve had flattened in Korea over the past decade,

and that, under these conditions, monetary policy should be implemented flexibly with

its focus placed on stabilizing the real economy and employment. The member’s

judgment was that, due to the inevitable fiscal expansion to support economic recovery

and vulnerable groups for the time being and also to structural factors such as

population aging, government spending would increase even further and the

government’s funding costs would become an important economic issue.

Taking all this into comprehensive consideration, the member argued that it would


-----

be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level and promote stabilization of

long-term market interest rates by making use of instruments such as Treasury bond

purchases.

One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate

unchanged from the current level.

The member assessed that the domestic economy had been sustaining a modest

recovery recently. The member forecast the domestic economy to sustain its recovery,

led by continued export growth and improvement in facilities investment, which would

more than offset a slower-than-expected recovery of private consumption. The member’s

evaluation was that, although the Bank of Korea’s economic outlook this time put the

growth forecast for this year at 3%, the same figure as in November last year,

uncertainties surrounding the future growth path remained high due to pandemic-related

developments. The member pointed out that vaccinations and increased fiscal stimulus

measures in Korea and other countries around the world were expected to have positive

impacts on the domestic economy, but the possibility of a domestic spread of virus

variants could not be ruled out.

The member pointed out that the employment situation remained sluggish with the

number of persons employed continuing to decline significantly in January, and forecast

that employment would exhibit a slower-than-expected recovery. With regard to inflation,

the member expected consumer price inflation to rise to the lower- to mid-1% level and

core inflation to the 1% level this year, due to the gradual reflection of the effects of

economic recovery in these indexes, combined with supply-side upward pressures such

as hikes in international oil prices and agricultural, livestock and fisheries product

prices. The member stated that inflation expectations among the general public had

recently increased to the 2% level, and went on to argue that it would be necessary to

closely monitor future trends of inflation expectations and their impacts, since inflation

expectations are one of the major factors determining the medium-term inflation trend.

Concerning the financial markets, meanwhile, the member mentioned that, amid the

continued preference for risk assets, major price variables had fluctuated under the

influence of international financial market movements. The member took the view that

the recent financial market movements reflected expectations of future economic

recovery, but on the other hand, they also included factors increasing financial stability

risks. The member noted that the uptrend in long-term market interest rates since the

second half of last year could be seen as a process ofeconomic recovery and resolution

of low inflation. The member assessed that the sustained asset price rises and household

debt growth despite the substantial increase in long-term market interest rates were


-----

attributable mainly to interest rates remaining accommodative and to expectations of

major countries’ accommodative monetary policy stances continuing for the time being.

The member however expressed the view that it should be noted that some global

financial market movements reflected the possibility of the US Federal Reserve’s early

monetary policy normalization and that there were growing concerns about the

possibility of drastic asset price adjustments in the event of changes in global financial

and economic conditions.

In conclusion, the member judged that, although the domestic economy was forecast

to maintain a modest recovery, it would be necessary to maintain the monetary easing

stance for the time being, considering the continued high macroeconomic uncertainties

concerning pandemic-related developments and the continued sluggishness of the

employment situation. The member added that in doing so it would be important to

continue closely monitoring changes in financial stability risks.

The member in this regard argued that it would be appropriate to hold the Base

Rate at its current level of 0.50%.

Meanwhile, another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep

the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.

The member noted that domestic exports and investment had improved since the

previous meeting thanks to economic recovery in major countries, but private

consumption had weakened more than expected, influenced by the resurgence of

COVID-19. The member’s evaluation was that, although the Bank of Korea had kept its

economic growth outlook for 2021 unchanged this time, growth imbalances had

deepened, as seen in the gap between exports and domestic demand, the polarization of

exports and investment among industries, and the differentiation in private consumption

by income group and age. Above all, the member raised the concern that the gap

between growth and employment had expanded to an unprecedented degree due to

worsened employment conditions, particularly among self-employed and temporary

workers, with the decline in the number of persons employed reaching 980,000 in

January. The member pointed out that these growth imbalances were highly likely to

continue even after the COVID-19 pandemic ends. The member thus presented the

opinion that it would be necessary to maintain the current accommodative stance for

some time.

Looking at prices, the member stated that, although the outlook for consumer price

inflation for this year had been revised slightly upward, that for core inflation was at

1%, well below the target. The member noted that, despite lackluster domestic demand,

household and corporate lending had actually grown, on the back of expectations for


-----

rising asset prices and continuing demand for living expenses, showing a so-called

counter-cyclical trend. The member thus assessed the risk in terms of financial

imbalances to have increased.

The member noted that the situations in the real economy and financial stability

were serving as conflicting factors for monetary policy decisions, but found it

appropriate to maintain the current level of the Base Rate and focus more on domestic

demand and price conditions at this juncture. The member, however, emphasized that

the Bank of Korea should examine overall risk factors through cooperation with the

government and the supervisory authorities to prevent the risk of financial imbalances

from excessively heightening, and consistently push for macroprudential policy measures.

The member also added that it would be necessary to pay attention to and analyze the

possibility of a decline in the potential growth rate of the domestic economy in line

with the COVID-19 shock and natural population decline, and the consequent changes in

trends in the output gap.

Meanwhile, the member stated that there was an increasing need for fiscal policy to

take on an expanded role, and for it to be supported through cooperation with monetary

policy, given economic conditions of late. The member also noted the growing

importance of the Bank of Korea’s role in stabilizing market interest rates. The member,

however, saw that the recent rise in long-term market interest rates had been affected

by rising US Treasury bond yields which had preemptively reflected expectations for

economic recovery in the US, and the upward pressures were highly likely to continue

in the future. The member thus presented the opinion that it would be appropriate to

devote efforts to curb excessive volatility of market interest rates, instead of directly

addressing demand and supply conditions. The member added that the feasibility of

funding plans stemming from expanded government spending should be discussed, in

consideration of the “fiscal trilemma,” i.e. the difficulty of simultaneously achieving the

three goals of fiscal expansion, fiscal soundness, and tax reduction.

One member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at

its current level.

The member assessed that, as the resurgence of COVID-19 weakened somewhat, the

global economy was showing a moderate trend of recovery, bolstered by ongoing fiscal

stimulus by major advanced economies, and the domestic economy was also maintaining

a trend of recovery, albeit modest. The member saw that, by sector, private

consumption had contracted more deeply than expected due to the ongoing spread of

coronavirus in winter, particularly in the Seoul metropolitan area where economic

activities were concentrated. The member also expected the future recovery path to be


-----

gradual due to constraints including delayed improvement in income conditions.

Meanwhile, the member saw that economic recovery would expand gradually in the

future as exports, in the semiconductor industry in particular, appeared set to maintain

robust growth, facilities investment showed favorable movements, and the slump in

construction investment eased. The member projected that consumer price inflation would

rise to the mid-1% level, as rising international oil and grain prices would have an

impact with some time lag going forward and economic normalization would lead to an

increase in demand-side pressures.

Meanwhile, the member’s assessment was that the sluggishness in employment had

deepened with the amount of decrease in the number of persons employed rising greatly

in January, against the backdrop of growth in both the number of the unemployed and

the number of persons on temporary leave due to the prolongation of the pandemic.

The member noted that the number of persons employed had declined drastically in the

face-to-face service industries in particular, due for instance to stronger social-distancing

measures, and there were increased closures of self-employed businesses of late. The

member thus raised the concern that the pace of recovery in employment could be

constrained even after the pandemic eases. The member, however, presented the opinion

that dealing with this issue by selectively supporting damaged sectors through fiscal

policy would be more effective than using monetary policy, the effects of which would

be indiscriminate across all sectors.

The member stated that there remained considerable uncertainties surrounding the

recovery path of the domestic economy, such as delayed improvements of household

consumption conditions following worsened employment conditions, as well as

pandemic-related developments such as vaccine supply, innoculations, and coronavirus

variants. The member thus saw that it would be necessary to maintain the current

accommodative monetary policy stance until the economy exhibits a more clearly

marked recovery, and in this regard it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate

unchanged for the intermeeting period.

However, the member stressed the need to continually pay attention to the

accumulation of potential factors threatening financial stability in the future including

rapid growth in household debt, expansion in corporate credit, and a sustained rise in

real estate prices resulting from the continuation of accommodative financial conditions.

The member added that, if the domestic economy enters a full-fledged recovery phase

in the future, the implementation of monetary policy should be reviewed with greater

focus on financial stability.

Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base


-----

Rate unchanged from the current level.

Looking at economic developments since the January MPB meeting, the member

assessed that growth in major countries was gradually improving, thanks for instance to

fiscal stimulus packages and the rollout of vaccines in major countries. Concerning

global trade, the member expected trade in goods to steadily improve, despite the

prospect for sustained sluggishness in trade in services.

The member’s assessment was that the domestic real economy was moving in

conjunction with the developments of COVID-19. Looking at sectors, the member saw

that, concerning private consumption, consumption of face-to-face services had been

sluggish due mainly to containment measures, and overseas spending was unlikely to

reverse course for a considerable time. Meanwhile, the member projected that facilities

investment in the IT sector would be solid, and that in the non-IT sector would grow

moderately, led by investment in maintenance and repair, while construction investment

would reverse to an increase this year from the current decrease. The member also

forecast that exports would remain favorable going forward, thanks to a gradual global

economic upturn and significant improvement in the semiconductor industry. Meanwhile,

looking at employment, the member stated that the number of persons employed had

decreased greatly following the resurgence of COVID-19. The member raised the

concern that the employment slump in self-employed businesses focused on face-to-face

services would deepen, which was highly likely to have negative impacts over a long

period of time, although employment in the manufacturing sector was likely to increase,

led by an upturn in the IT industry. The member expected consumer price inflation to

increase this year due to rising international oil prices and agricultural product prices.

The member presented the opinion that, since uncertainties surrounding the domestic

economy were very high, it would be necessary to thoroughly monitor potential upside

and downside risk factors. Since there was a growing possibility of a supplementary

budget being compiled in the future, the member stressed the need to analyze the extent

to which it would contribute to the recovery of the real economy.

The member also noticed that consumer price inflation was still running below the

inflation target despite an upward revision this time and the outlook for core inflation

remained unchanged at the 1.0% level. The member thus stated that considerable time

was likely needed before the negative output gap turned positive, even if the domestic

economy showed a moderate recovery. The member judged that it would be necessary

to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance going forward.

The member’s evaluation was that the international financial markets were showing

stability, and the domestic financial and FX markets were also stable, but volatility had

increased of late. The member stressed the need for thorough monitoring, since market


-----

participants had become much more sensitive to the outlooks for the US economy and

inflation and the related direction of the US Fed’s monetary policy.

Taking all this into consideration, the member assessed that it would be desirable to

keep the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50%.

```
  Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

```
Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy

Decision statement was compiled. All MPB members supported the decision

unanimously.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the

 Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period.

 □ Currently available information suggests that the recovery of the global

 economy has remained slow due to the ongoing influence of the movement

 restrictions following the resurgence of COVID-19. In global financial

 markets, stock prices and government bond yields in major countries have

 increased, mainly driven by the expectations for economic recovery following

 the expansion of vaccinations and the prospect of a further fiscal stimulus

 package by the new US administration. Looking ahead, the Board sees global

 economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely

 by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine

 distribution, as well as by national policy responses and their effects.

 □ The Korean economy has continued to recover modestly. Although private

 consumption has remained weak as social distancing has been prolonged,

 exports have sustained their buoyancy led by the IT sector and facilities

 investment has continued to recover. Labor market conditions have remained

 weak, as the number of persons employed declined sharply compared to the

 corresponding period last year. Going forward, the economy is likely to

 continue its recovery, led by exports and investment. However, uncertainties

 surrounding the pace of recovery are judged to remain elevated. GDP growth

 this year is projected to be around 3.0%, generally consistent with the

 November forecast.

 □ Consumer price inflation has remained at the mid-0% level as the surging


-----

###### prices of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products were offset by factors

 such as the decreasing prices of public services. Core inflation (excluding

 changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has also remained at the

 mid-0% level. The inflation expectations of the general public have risen to

 2%. It is forecast that consumer price inflation will run at the low- to

 mid-1% level this year, exceeding the November forecast of 1.0%, largely

 reflecting the increase in global oil prices and gradual improvement in

 economic activity. Core inflation is forecast to run at around 1%.

 □ In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates and the Korean

 won to US dollar exchange rate have risen, mainly driven by global financial

 market movements. Stock prices have fluctuated considerably, affected by

 both expectations for economic recovery and caution about the recent rally.

 Household loan growth has accelerated, and housing prices have continued to

 increase rapidly in all parts of the country.

 □ The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the economy

 and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon,

 while paying attention to financial stability. As the recovery in the Korean economy

 is expected to be modest and inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast

 to remain weak, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.

 In this process the Board will thoroughly assess developments related to COVID-19

 as well as the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic,

 while paying attention to changes in financial stability conditions such as fund flows

 to asset markets and household debt growth.
