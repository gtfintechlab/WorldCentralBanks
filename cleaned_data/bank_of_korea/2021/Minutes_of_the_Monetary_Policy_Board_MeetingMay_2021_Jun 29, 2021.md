Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation

```
After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook,[2)]_ _FX and International Finance_

_Trends, and_ _Financial Market Trends, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board_

(MPB) members covered the following areas:

Members assessed that the domestic economic recovery had been accelerating

significantly, with exports and facilities investment showing favorable movements and

private consumption improving gradually. Members projected that upside risks would

predominate over downside risks in the growth path going forward, and as a result, the

negative output gap would narrow at a faster-than-expected pace. However, some

members expressed the view that, considering the slow pace of improvement in

face-to-face services industries, it was a bit too early to conclude that domestic demand

had started to show a full-fledged recovery.

In terms of inflation, members mentioned that consumer price inflation had been

rising significantly owing primarily to supply-side factors, and expected underlying

inflation pressures to build up; for example, core inflation was projected to increase

steadily with the economic recovery.

Members, meanwhile, expressed concerns that financial imbalances had been

worsening, with private-sector credit increasing and economic agents’ risk preferences

strengthening amid the continued accommodative financial conditions. Some members

pointed out that household-sector leverage, in conjunction with prices of assets such as

real estate, stocks, and crypto assets, had been expanding even further, and emphasized

the need for attention to the possibility that widening financial imbalances could weaken

financial market resilience significantly, making the domestic economy vulnerable to

internal and external shocks. One member, however, noted that various indicators

suggested that financial imbalances might start to ease gradually, and took the view that

significant caution was needed when assessing financial imbalances in connection with

monetary policy.

Members also noted that it would be necessary to pay more attention to and

conduct in-depth research on structural problems of the Korean economy, such as

employment by small business owners, from medium- and long-term perspectives.

 Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

```
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the

Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

All members shared the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and

international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the

Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.

One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate

at the current level of 0.50%.

The member mentioned that, according to the latest _Economic Outlook, the domestic_

economy would grow by 4% this year and 3% next year, led by exports and facilities

investment, and the output gap would shift to positive within one year. The member

found it encouraging that private consumption growth was forecast to rebound to 2.5%

this year and 3.5% next year. The member took the view that this was attributable

substantially to base-period effects and government support measures, but the

trickle-down effects of wide-ranging export strength and the wealth effects of asset price

rises were also responsible. The member, however, pointed out that it was difficult to

conclude that domestic demand had started to show a full-fledged recovery, given that it

would likely take more than a year for private consumption to return to its

pre-COVID-19 level, that household income continued to decrease when the

government’s transfer payments were excluded, and that the number of persons

employed was growing slowly when government-supported employment was counted out.

Concerning inflation, the member mentioned that attention should be paid to the

fact that core inflation with regulated prices excluded was projected at around 2% for

the second half of this year and the first half of next year. The member added that this

suggested inflation pressures were increasing due to demand-side factors as well as

supply-side ones.

Regarding the financial markets, meanwhile, the member pointed out that asset

prices continued to rise and risk preferences continued to strengthen in the

accommodative monetary policy environment since the initial phase of the COVID-19

shock. The member went on to state that, with the increasing leveraged investment in

real estate, stocks and crypto assets and the expanding borrowings by financially

vulnerable economic agents, vulnerability to an asset price crash and default risk had

been building up. The member expressed concerns that, if the current accommodative


-----

financial conditions continue, consumption could be restricted by the buildup of debt

and the efficiency of resource allocation could be reduced, ultimately having negative

impacts on growth that would overwhelm the short-term stimulus effects. In this regard,

the member argued that, considering the recent real economic and financial conditions

and the trends of economic activity and inflation, it was time to consider adjusting the

accommodative monetary policy stance slightly.

The member, however, noted that it was necessary to closely monitor economic and

financial developments while holding the Base Rate at its current level for the time

being, given the ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19, insufficient recovery in

private consumption and employment despite quantitative improvements in

macroeconomic indicators, and low likelihood of the current financial imbalances leading

to instability of the entire financial system. The member added that it would be

important to think about when to normalize monetary policy and how to communicate

appropriately in order to maintain the momentum of economic recovery and at the same

time prevent financial imbalances from worsening excessively. The member also

emphasized that economic agents should prepare for increased borrowing costs to avoid

becoming more vulnerable to them.

The member, meanwhile, stated that the weak income conditions of vulnerable

households, sluggish employment conditions at marginal firms, and restructuring of small

business owners were structural problems that were unlikely to be solved even when the

pandemic is over and unlikely to be tackled effectively with monetary policy alone, and

went on to argue that in this regard it would be necessary to pursue fiscal expenditure

in a more targeted way and seek institutional improvement.

Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base

Rate unchanged from its current level of 0.50%.

The member mentioned that the recovery of the Korean economy had been

expanding rapidly, with private consumption gradually emerging from its slump recently

while exports and facilities investment maintained strong growth, and forecast that the

domestic economic recovery was likely to strengthen going forward. The member stated

that the Bank of Korea had raised the growth forecast for this year significantly as the

upside risks mentioned in the previous forecast, such as a stronger global economic

recovery, improved consumer confidence following vaccinations, and additional

government support measures, had materialized substantially, and went on to argue that,

although uncertainties related to the outlook for the recovery of the Korean economy

had decreased significantly, uncertainties surrounding the path of COVID-19 and the

status of vaccinations remained. Concerning inflation, the member noted that the growth


-----

in service charges had been accelerating, coupled with upward pressures on the supply

side. The member forecast consumer price inflation to remain at the mid-2% level for

the time being and then decline somewhat to fluctuate at around 2%, and core inflation

to rise gradually to the mid- to upper-1% level affected by increased upward pressures

on the demand side in line with the economic recovery.

Looking at the financial markets, the member’s assessment was that preference for

high-risk assets had been strengthening based on the accommodative financial conditions

and expectations of domestic and overseas economic recoveries. More specifically, the

member noted that the recent acceleration in M2 growth in contrast to the slowdown in

M1 growth implied that the additional liquidity that had been supplied was being used

by economic agents in strengthening their yield-seeking behavior, for example by

investing in performance-based dividend products and marketable instruments.

The member expressed concerns that financial imbalances had been worsening, as

the continued risk-taking tendencies and yield-seeking behavior of economic agents had

caused household debt to build up and asset prices to rise significantly. The member

noted that various forms of factors causing market instability, such as surges in

long-term market interest rates, herd behavior of individual investors, and plunges in

crypto asset prices, had been witnessed in the domestic and overseas financial markets

since the second half of last year, and went on to state that some were sounding

warnings that the prolongation of the current ultra-accommodative financial conditions

could lead to investments based on excessive optimism and ultimately to drastic market

corrections. The member pointed out that the widening of financial imbalances would

work to weaken financial market resilience significantly and make the Korean economy

vulnerable to internal and external shocks, and presented the view that attention should

be paid to the fact that the accommodative financial conditions introduced last year to

cope with the COVID-19 crisis were now also working to increase financial market

unrest.

In conclusion, the member argued that, given the forecast of a stronger domestic

economic recovery and growing risks to financial stability, there was a need to consider

partially adjusting the current stance of monetary policy that had been eased to an

unprecedented extent in response to the COVID-19 crisis, but considering underlying

uncertainties surrounding the path of COVID-19, it would be necessary to communicate

closely with economic agents about recognition of the changes in economic and

financial conditions and the direction of policy in consideration of such changes, while

maintaining the current monetary easing stance for the time being. The member in this

regard judged that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of

0.50% for the intermeeting period.


-----

One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate

unchanged from the current level.

Looking at the changes in domestic and external conditions since the previous MPB

meeting, the member assessed the recovery of the global economy as strengthening

gradually, boosted by expansion of vaccine distribution and reopening the economy as

well as the economic stimulus in major countries. The member, however, mentioned that

caution was needed in forecasting the medium- and long-term growth path of the global

economy, since the gap in economic activity between countries remained wide and the

evolution of the current health crisis, including the spread of variants, remained

uncertain. The member’s evaluation was that, boosted by the faster-than-expected

recovery of the domestic economy, real GDP had returned to its pre-COVID-19 level in

the first quarter and the gap in economic activity between industries and sectors had

been narrowing gradually. The member, however, judged that uncertainty surrounding the

recovery path had not yet been eased substantially. More specifically, the member

pointed out that demand in face-to-face industries remained sluggish compared with the

pre-COVID-19 period and, considering the pace of the recent COVID-19 spread and the

trend of vaccinations in Korea, it would be difficult to expect such demand to return to

normal soon. The member stressed that attention should be paid to the possibility of the

overall consumption recovery path being constrained by the sluggishness of employment

of vulnerable groups, if improvement in face-to-face industries is delayed for a long

time. The member presented the view that in this regard it would be advisable to

maintain the current degree of monetary easing for the time being to help private

consumption and the employment situation show more robust improvement.

The member noted that attention should be paid to the significant acceleration in

consumer price inflation and the sustained strong growth in private-sector credit that had

occurred in the meantime. First, in terms of consumer price inflation, the member

forecast that, considering that the recent increase in consumer price inflation had been

attributable mainly to supply-side inflation pressures and one-off factors, this trend

would not continue past the second half of this year. The member, however, expressed

the opinion that the possibility should not be ruled out of the upward pressures on

underlying inflation growing to a larger extent than expected, since inflation caused by

supply-side factors had lasted for longer than usual and inflation expectations were

likely to increase further as economic activity normalized.

Next, the member emphasized the need to keep an eye on the negative effects of

strong growth in private-sector credit amid the accommodative financial conditions. The

member pointed out that an appropriate degree of credit expansion works to enhance

6


-----

economic recovery by acting in a virtuous circle with the real economy, but excessive

interactions between credit expansion and asset price rises can lead to the risk of an

accumulation of financial imbalances, undermining the sustainability of future financial

stability and economic growth. The member’s judgment was that, despite various

macroprudential policy measures in place to cope with the risk, households’

yield-seeking behavior using leverage had been strengthening amid the sustained

expectations of a continued accommodative monetary policy stance, while the recent

economic recoveries at home and abroad and inflation expectations could act to further

increase leverage, and thus there was a growing need to consider related risks when

making monetary policy decisions.

Taking all this into consideration, the member took the view that at this point it

was necessary to keep the Base Rate at its current level, while keeping a close watch

on whether the real economy expands further, the trend of the price path, and the

possibility of a worsening of financial imbalances, and gradually adjust the degree of

monetary easing at the appropriate time.

Meanwhile, another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep

the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.

The member assessed that the domestic economy was sustaining a trend of

export-driven recovery since the second half of last year. The member noted that the

relatively small contraction in global goods consumption despite the pandemic, and

aggressive stimulus measures by major countries, had been positive factors for the

recovery of the domestic economy, which is heavily dependent upon manufacturing

industries. The member saw that domestic goods exports were likely to maintain strong

growth in the future as well.

The member’s evaluation was that, although private consumption was emerging from

its sluggishness, the pace of recovery was slow due to the modest pace of vaccination

and remaining uncertainties about the resurgence of the pandemic. The member raised

concern that, with continued sluggishness in self-employed businesses that are largely

dependent upon face-to-face services, the trend of decline in owners of self-employed

businesses with employees, in particular, did not halt, despite improvements in

employment conditions in both manufacturing and services industries, and high rates of

growth in working hours. Meanwhile, the member pointed out that indicators were

unclear as to whether household income was recovering, which implied that it would

likely to take a substantial time for economic recovery to lead to improved household

income, even if the economy recovers rapidly, led by exports and facilities investment.

Meanwhile, the member noted that the rising prices accompanying economic

7


-----

recovery were mainly due to base effects, but were also a sign that consumption had

begun to emerge from its extreme sluggishness. The member expected consumer price

movements to be affected by base effects and supply-side factors, but to be partially

influenced by the pace of recovery in employment and household income as well.

However, the member added that price inflation would fall short of the inflation target

for the year as a whole, and inflation would slow next year due to the disappearance

of base effects.

The member presented the opinion that it should be remembered that inflation had

remained below the target for nine years since 2012 and had run in the 0% range for

two years in a row, despite upward pressures on prices stemming from the economic

recovery. The member noted that, unlike exports and manufacturing industries,

consumption and services industries were still at the initial stage of recovery. The

member thus added that a change in the current monetary policy stance could constrain

domestic demand and the pace at which price movements normalize.

The member noted that it was true that household lending had soared, the gap

between the real economy and housing prices had widened, and financial imbalances

had built up over the past year. The member particularly saw that housing prices in

Seoul and its surrounding areas had risen excessively compared with the income level.

The member went on to assess that this was attributable to concerns about a shortage

of housing and to expectations that low interest rates would persist for a long time.

However, the member noted that, despite the unprecedentedly low Base Rate, mortgage

lending rates had already risen above the pre-pandemic level, and the housing

transaction volume and new lending related to housing sales had been gradually

declining of late. The member thus stressed that potential home buyers that depend

heavily on loans should pay attention to the facts that the gap between the real

economy and housing prices would not persist for a long time, and the current

accommodative monetary policy stance would not last forever. The member added that

it would be desirable for the overshooting in housing prices to be resolved gradually

through the adjustment of home buying sentiment.

Taking these points into overall consideration, the member saw that, although the

domestic economy was sustaining a trend of recovery, led by exports and investment,

and had emerged from downward inflationary pressures, it would take considerable time

for the domestic economy to return to growth at its pre-pandemic potential level. The

member also projected that it would take substantial time for GDP growth to lead to

expansion in household income, wages, employment and consumption. The member

expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current

level, as inflation was still well below the target and there was no clear reason to

8


-----

preemptively hold back the momentum of economic expansion.

One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate

unchanged from its current level.

The member assessed that, since the April MPB meeting, the global economy was

showing a trend of expanded recovery, and this was contributing to buoyancy in the

domestic economy, driven by exports and facilities investment. The member noted that

exports and investment in the non-IT sector, as well as the IT sector including the

semiconductor industry, had been showing growth. The member’s assessment was that

private consumption was gradually improving thanks to the government’s support

measures and the easing of social distancing rules, and it was encouraging that the

trend in face-to-face services industries was showing a reversal from the significant

contraction seen so far. The member commented that the easing of sluggish demand in

face-to-face services was leading to improvements in employment conditions, and

expected employment in services industries to show modest growth overall. The member

noted that consumer price inflation was showing a high uptrend in the second quarter,

and saw that core inflation would gradually rise, backed by a trend of economic

growth.

The member mentioned that, according to the latest _Economic Outlook, the growth_

rate for this year was being revised upward to 4.0%, and expressed the opinion that,

although this figure exceeded the financial market’s expectations, it did not appear to be

excessively optimistic, given the recent trend of faster global economic recovery. The

member added that upside risks to the outlook could materialize if the government came

up with additional aggressive economic recovery policy measures. The member judged

that, despite such favorable real economic conditions of late, the current accommodative

monetary policy stance should be kept unchanged due to remaining uncertainties

surrounding the pandemic and vaccine rollouts. The member thus argued that it would

be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50% and continue to

observe future real economic developments and financial market conditions.

The member noted that it was necessary to focus on a few points before making

monetary policy decisions going forward. Most importantly, the member presented the

view that there was a need to continuously examine the possibility that the current

negative GDP gap would disappear sooner than expected. The member commented that

the materialization of upside risks to the outlook would bring forward the timing of the

disappearance of the negative GDP gap to the fourth quarter of this year. However, the

member saw that pandemic-related developments still remained uncertain and that it

would take more time before employment and economic conditions felt by ordinary

9


-----

people and self-employed businesses would recover, and thus consideration should be

given to this point as well. Next, the member noted the importance of monitoring US

monetary policy and the trends of market interest rates, as higher and persistent global

inflation would affect not only the monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve, but also

policy decisions of the Bank of Korea. Finally, the member stressed that attention

should be paid to the possible worsening of financial imbalances, as leverage was

increasing further due to the interaction of ongoing growth in household debt with asset

prices, such as real estate, stock and virtual asset prices.

The member commented that market volatility could heighten in line with future

trends of global inflation and the consequent changes in the monetary policy directions

of major countries. The member thus presented the opinion that it would be necessary

to closely analyze and bring attention to this point to ensure that each economic agent

could prepare against such a risk.

Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base

Rate at its current level.

The member saw that the world economy was generally maintaining its recovery,

and expected global GDP to return to the pre-crisis level in the second quarter of this

year. The member also noted that global trade had been sustaining a trend of recovery

since the second half of last year.

The member’s assessment was that the recovery was spreading more noticeably, and

the positive sentiment of economic agents and the outlook for economic recovery had

strengthened further since the April MPB meeting. The member pointed out that

concerns about COVID-19 infection had lessened following the higher vaccination rate

among senior citizens, and economic activity had been gradually increasing with the

Google Mobility Index rising above the pre-pandemic level, although the coronavirus

pandemic was still ongoing.

The member noted that, in terms of sectors, manufacturing production remained

solid, bolstered by expanded exports, and services production was also gradually

emerging from its sluggishness, particularly in face-to-face services production. The

member added that retail sales and construction investment were improving, facilities

investment was sustaining a strong recovery, and export growth was increasing. The

member saw that, in reflection of these movements, growth for this year would likely

reach about 4%, much higher than the April forecast, and the negative GDP gap would

likely shrink more rapidly than expected. The member presented the view that, looking

at risk factors surrounding the latest forecasts, the upside risks were more likely to

materialize than the downside risks.

10


-----

Meanwhile, the member saw that consumer price inflation was likely to run above

the 2% range for some time, largely affected by temporary factors such as sustained

upward trends in agricultural, livestock, and fisheries product prices, rising international

commodity prices, and global supply difficulties. However, the member noted that it

would be necessary to pay close attention to price trends, as the global supply

difficulties could persist or underlying factors, such as expanded domestic demand or

wage growth, could come into play.

The member judged that the financial market remained accommodative, with

household lending growing rapidly and corporate credit expanding greatly, even as

various macroprudential surveillance regulations were put in place or even reinforced.

The member’s assessment was that the unusually accommodative monetary policy,

which had been ongoing for over one year after being adopted in the face of an

unprecedented crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, had contributed to the return to

economic recovery, by preventing excessive economic contraction and the undermining

of future growth potential, and by ensuring stability in the financial market. However,

the member pointed out that, in this process, leverage had increased substantially, as

private sector credit grew very rapidly, and the risk appetite of economic agents

strengthened. The member raised concerns that, if these conditions persisted for a long

time, the buildup in financial imbalances would deepen, rapid debt growth would act to

constrain consumption and investment in the medium to long term, and an external

shock could cause financial instability.

The member expressed the opinion that gradual normalization of the interest rate

level would be needed to curb the deepening of financial imbalances and reduce any

possibility of future financial instability. The member saw that adjusting the degree of

monetary policy accommodation could somewhat negatively affect the trend of economic

recovery, but the negative impacts could be buffered considerably, given the strong

recoveries in major countries and the stability in the international financial market.

Meanwhile, the member pointed out that the prolongation of the current unprecedentedly

accommodative monetary policy stance could further increase costs in the future course

of interest rate normalization. The member also noted that there would be a need to

ensure space for monetary policy to some extent to prepare for a possibility of

underlying low economic growth and the future economic cycle. The member thus

presented the view that normalization of the current unprecedented monetary

accommodation should not be put off for too long.

The member saw that there still were considerable uncertainties related to the

solidity of future recovery, although economic recoveries at home and abroad were

expanding gradually. The member also judged that the Board should fully communicate

11


-----

with the market in advance, even if the degree of monetary policy accommodation were

to be adjusted. The member took the opinion that, from this perspective, it would be

desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level this time, to monitor the progress of

the economic recovery for the coming months, and to begin to adjust the degree of

monetary policy accommodation in a timely manner, in overall consideration of

employment and price trends, and financial market conditions. The member added that

this would be helpful to lay a foundation for stable and sustainable economic growth in

the medium to long term. The member noted that the Board should not delay adjusting

the degree of accommodation for too long, and stressed that the Board should take the

ensuing steps in a gradual manner, while cautiously monitoring market reactions and

economic conditions.

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

###### Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary

 Policy Decision statement was compiled. All MPB members supported the

 decision unanimously.

 Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the

 Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period.

 □ Currently available information suggests that the recovery of the global

 economy has strengthened, supported by the economic stimulus in major

 countries, accelerated vaccinations, and the relaxation of restrictions on

 economic activity. In global financial markets, the rise in stock prices in

 major countries has moderated as risk-taking tendencies were offset by factors

 such as inflation concerns. Government bond yields have fluctuated within a

 relatively narrow range. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic

 growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the

 severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine

 distribution, as well as by national policy responses and their effects.

 □ The recovery of the Korean economy has strengthened. Exports have

 sustained their buoyancy and facilities investment has continued to recover

 robustly, while private consumption has gradually emerged from its slump.

 Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with the year-on-year

 increase in the number of persons employed having risen. Going forward, the

 recovery of the Korean economy is likely to strengthen thanks to the

 buoyancy of exports and investment as well as the improvement in private

 consumption. GDP growth this year is projected to be around 4%,

 significantly above the February forecast of 3.0%.

 □ Consumer price inflation has risen markedly to the lower-2% level due to the

 rising prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock, and fisheries

```
13


-----

###### products as well as the accelerating increase in service prices. Core inflation

 (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has moved up

 considerably to the lower-1% level. The inflation expectations of the general

 public have risen slightly within the lower-2% range. It is forecast that

 consumer price inflation will run at the upper-1% range this year,

 considerably exceeding the February forecast of 1.3%. Core inflation is

 forecast to run at the lower-1% range.

 □ In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates have risen,

 affected mainly by strengthened economic recoveries at home and abroad.

 Stock prices continued to increase before declining moderately due to global

 financial market movements. The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has

 fluctuated slightly. Household loan growth has remained high, and housing

 prices have continued to increase rapidly in all parts of the country.

 □ The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the

 economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a

 medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. While the

 Korean economic recovery is expected to strengthen and inflation to remain

 at a high level for some time, there are underlying uncertainties surrounding

 the path of COVID-19 and inflationary pressures on the demand side are

 forecast to be modest. Thus, the Board will maintain its accommodative

 monetary policy stance. In this process the Board will assess developments

 related to COVID-19 and economic developments in major countries, while

 paying closer attention to the buildup of financial imbalances such as fund

 flows concentrated in asset markets and household debt growth.
