###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

  After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea',

 'FX and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following

 areas:

  With regard to the global economy, many members’ assessment was

 that, while the US economic recovery had continued, the recovery in the

 euro area had been sluggish. Members also noted that the international

 financial markets had shown increasing volatility, due mainly to concerns

 about an early policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, to geopolitical

 risks, and to worries about the economic slowdowns in China and the euro

 area.

 As to the domestic economy, many members’ appraisal was that, while

 consumption had increased and exports had sustained a favorable pattern,

 the economic recovery was insufficient, with facilities investment declining

 for example.

 Concerning the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members noted

 that long-term interest rates had declined, the KRW/USD exchange rate

 had risen, and stock prices had fallen significantly.

 With regard to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation stood

 at 1.1%, lower than in the previous month, and forecast that the possibility

 was also high that it would be below the inflation target for the time

 being.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Most members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 domestic and international economic environments and their future

 outlooks, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points

 from its current level for the intermeeting period.

 One member advanced the opinion that the Base Rate should be cut

 by 0.25 of a percentage point because, if the changes in domestic and

 international financial and economic conditions during the previous month

 were considered comprehensively, the growth path of the Korean economy

 appeared to have shifted slightly downward, on a contraction in

 consumption and the sluggishness in facilities investment for example,

 while the situation of low inflation was expected to persist longer than in

 the previous forecast.

 Another member expressed the view that, although determining the

 direction of the Base Rate was very difficult, cutting it by 0.25 of a

 percentage point would be desirable in view of the following points:

 firstly, that the time when the negative GDP gap would disappear was

 highly likely to be delayed beyond that originally anticipated, given the

 downward adjustment of the economic growth rate forecast; secondly, that

 the lower-than-expected inflationary pressures provided scope to support

 growth further in terms of monetary policy, and thirdly, that the

 contraction in economic agents’ sentiment was remaining a downside risk

 to future growth.

 One other member stated his opinion that it would be necessary to

 reduce the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point this month because

 the potential risks of keeping it unchanged were judged to outweigh the

###### side effects of its being cut. He argued in justification that the forecast

 growth path had been adjusted downward and the time of negative GDP

 gap resolution might be delayed even longer, that due to the continuation

 of low inflation the confidence in price stability might weaken and

 deflation expectations might form, and that some scope for an additional

 Base Rate cut had arisen since the appropriate Base Rate level in

 consideration of the real neutral rate was analyzed to have declined owing

 to the prolongation of the negative GDP and price gaps, while the real

 interest rate was rising due to the slowdown in inflation. Apart from this,

 the household credit cycle was not considered to currently be in an

 overheating phase where excessive household credit expansion cause

 systemic risk, while the outflows of foreign investment funds following a

 Base Rate cut were judged unlikely to lead to fundamental market

 disturbances.

 Another member mentioned that the recovery of the overall global

 economy had weakened, that amid the continuing trend of low inflation

 uncertainties about the domestic economic recovery were persisting, and

 that price variable volatility in the financial and foreign exchange markets

 was rising as anticipations for and concerns about changes in domestic and

 foreign economies and policies were intersecting. He went on to state that

 it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage

 point for the month.

 One other member, after expressing the view that it would be

 appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 0.25 percentage point, noted that this

 would strengthen the public signalling of the monetary authorities’ policy

 intention, and at the same time was expected to contribute to boosting the

 capacity for adapting to the recent changes in the external environment, to

 the revival of the sluggish domestic demand, and to controlling the

 prolongation of the low inflation trend.

###### Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to

 leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.25 percent for the intermeeting period,

 commenting then that the Korean economy’s recovery being a little weaker

 than expected was due to exports having been more sluggish than

 originally forecast and so, since exports were contributing more to Korean

 economic growth than consumption, solid export growth was an essential

 precondition for a rapid economic recovery. With regard to concerns about

 disinflation the member also noted that, unlike disinflation caused by an

 aggregate demand shortage, disinflation attributable mainly to fiercer

 corporate competition triggered by innovations in distribution and an

 expansion in imports could be considered a positive phenomenon for the

 Korean economy. He went on to state that, given that core inflation

 excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products had been

 continually rising since passing through its trough in December 2012, and

 that the low inflation was expected to last until the second half of 2015

 when the output gap was forecast to disappear, it was difficult to consider

 any shortfall in demand as being the main cause behind the recent low

 inflation phenomenon. The member added that the recent low inflation

 seemed attributable largely to distribution innovations following the

 increased numbers of megastores and online stores, as well as to growth

 in imports including through the expansion of trade with China, and

 considering that the downward pressures on inflation would grow further,

 due for example to the Korea-China FTA expected to be concluded in the

 future, Korea’s current inflation target of 2.5∼3.5 percent was judged to

 be at a higher than appropriate level and, rather than responding to the

 recent low inflation through a policy of expanding demand, priority thus

 needed to be placed upon resetting the appropriate level of inflation target.

###### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

 Incorporating the outcome of the discussions held earlier, a statement

 was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.

 However, Mr. Moon, Woosik expressed clear opposition to the idea of

 lowering the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point, and argued for

 holding it at its current level.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 2.25% to

 2.00%.

 □ Based on currently available information the Committee considers

 that, although the trend of economic recovery in the US has been

 sustained, the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area

 has continued while trends of economic growth in emerging market

 countries have differed from country to country. The Committee

 forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery

 going forward, centering around the US, but judges that the

 possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global

 financial market conditions stemming from the shift in the US

 Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance, by the prolongation of

 economic sluggishness in the euro area, by the weakening of

 economic growth in some emerging market countries, and by

 geopolitical risks.

###### □ In Korea, while exports have sustained a favorable pattern and

 consumption has improved somewhat, the Committee judges that

 facilities investment remains sluggish and that economic agents’

 sentiment has only partially recovered. On the employment front,

 the number of persons employed has expanded steadily, led by

 increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector.

 The Committee expects that the negative output gap in the

 domestic economy will gradually narrow going forward, although

 the time of its disappearance will be somewhat later than

 previously forecast.

 □ Consumer price inflation fell from 1.4% the month before to 1.1%

 in September, due mainly to an increase in the extent of decline in

 petroleum product prices and to slowdowns in the rates of

 industrial product price increase. Core inflation excluding

 agricultural and petroleum product prices fell to 1.9%, from 2.4%

 in August. The Committee forecasts that, after remaining low due

 primarily to the stability of agricultural and international oil prices,

 inflation will gradually rise next year; it judges, however, that

 inflationary pressures will be somewhat weaker than previously

 expected. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales prices

 in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country

 accelerated. As to leasehold deposit prices, the scale of their

 increase widened somewhat in Seoul and its surrounding areas,

 while their uptrend in the rest of the country exhibited a pace

 similar to that in the preceding month.

 □ In the domestic financial markets, amid heightened international

 financial market volatility, stock prices have fallen significantly,

 influenced for example by a shift to net selling of stocks by

 foreign investors. The Korean won has depreciated rapidly, and

###### long-term interest rates have fallen substantially.

 □ Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth,

 the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price

 stability over a medium-term horizon and pay greater attention to

 financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor external

 risk factors such as the shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary

 policy stance, as well as the trends of household debt and of

 capital flows.
