###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

  After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea',

 'FX and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of

 the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas:

  With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the

 US and euro area economies had maintained their trends of economic

 recovery but Chinese economic growth had slowed. Members also noted

 that, while the international financial markets had generally shown stable

 movements, global interest rates had declined, stock prices had risen, and

 global capital had shown inflows to emerging market countries.

 As to the domestic economy, most members assessed the economic

 recovery to have continued, with indicators related to exports and domestic

 demand showing favorable movements. However, they expressed concerns

 about the negative effects on domestic demand of the Sewol ferry

 accident, and one member mentioned that the momentum of economic

 recovery was not evident, with domestic demand indicators having declined

 quarter-on-quarter for example.

 In the domestic financial markets, members noted that stock prices had

 fallen, the Korean won had appreciated due mainly to the continuation of

 the current account surplus and to inflows of foreigners’ securities

 investment funds, and interest rates had moved within a narrow range.

 As to prices, members mentioned that both consumer price inflation

 and core inflation had risen month-on-month. Many members anticipated

 that consumer price inflation would gradually rise going forward, as the

 downward pressures on demand eased.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 domestic and international economic environments and their future

 outlooks, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level

 for the intermeeting period.

 One member noted that there was a possibility that the current account

 surplus and the expansion in foreign capital inflows would increase

 exchange rate volatility and cause excessive movement of the exchange

 rate in one direction. He then pointed out the need for paying close

 attention to residents’ foreign currency deposits, which had expanded

 recently, since should they decline all at once the unidirectional movement

 of exchange rates could intensify.

 One other member argued that, as downside risks to the growth paths

 of both the domestic and the international economies remained, there was

 a need to conduct monetary policy so as to minimize the effects of

 factors limiting growth in the financial and real sectors, while working to

 steady economic agents’ expectations.

 One other member pointed out that there had been a wide divergence

 appearing between the rates of increase in the index of industrial production

 and in GDP of late, a divergence considered to be attributable to

 non-temporary factors such as the rapid growth of the IT sector. He went

 on to express the opinion that it was thus necessary to make improvements

 to the index of industrial production and to strengthen communication with

 the market for explaining the difference between the two statistics.

###### Another member meanwhile noted the need for cautions concerning the

 influence of the contraction in economic agents’ sentiment following the

 Sewol ferry accident on the trend of economic recovery, and about the

 future path of the USD/KRW rate. 

 Lastly, one member forecast that the trend of improvement in

 economic activities would continue and that consumer price inflation would

 gradually rise to its target level going forward, but commented that there

 were still concerns about a slowdown in domestic demand due to external

 uncertainties and to the Sewol ferry accident, and that any excessive

 appreciation of the won could work as a downside risk to growth and

 prices.

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation of Monetary Policy Directions

 Incorporating the outcome of these discussions, the following statement

 was prepared with the unanimous consent of all members:

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the

 intermeeting period.

 - Based on currently available information the Committee considers

###### that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained

 and the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears

 to have continued to ease, while economic growth trends in some

 emerging market countries have weakened somewhat. The

 Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest

 recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies, but

 judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the

 changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the

 shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance, by the

 weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries,

 and by geopolitical risks in Eastern Europe.

 - In Korea, the Committee appraises the economic recovery to have

###### continued in line with the trend of growth, as exports have

 sustained their buoyancy. On the employment front, the number of

 persons employed has continued its substantial uptrend, led by

 increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector.

 The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a

 negative output gap for the time being going forward, although it

 forecasts that the gap will gradually narrow.

 - Consumer price inflation rose from 1.3% the previous month to

###### 1.5% in April, due mainly to expansions in the extent of increase

###### in service fees and in industrial product prices. Core inflation

 excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products also rose

 from 2.1% to 2.3%. The Committee forecasts that inflation will

 gradually rise, although it will remain low for the time being due

 largely to the stability of agricultural product prices. Regarding the

 housing market, the uptrends of sales and leasehold deposit prices

 in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and in the rest of the

 country slowed.

- In the domestic financial markets, after having risen owing chiefly

###### to net stock purchases by foreigners, stock prices have since fallen

 considerably under the influence for example of geopolitical risks in

 Eastern Europe. The Korean won has appreciated substantially, due

 mainly to the continuation of the current account surplus and to

 inflows of foreigners’ securities investment funds. Long-term market

 interest rates have meanwhile moved within a narrow range.

- Looking ahead, while paying close attention to external risk factors

###### such as shifts in major countries’ monetary policies, and closely

 monitoring the movements in domestic demand following the Sewol

 ferry accident, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to

 keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over

 a medium-term horizon while supporting the continued recovery of

 economic growth.
