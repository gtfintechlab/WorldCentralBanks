###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

  After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea',

 'FX and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of

 the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas:

  With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the

 trends of economic recovery in the US and other advanced countries had

 been sustained and the Chinese economy had been exhibiting improvements

 in major real economic indicators. Members also noted that, with the

 international financial markets showing generally favorable movements,

 global interest rates had declined and stock prices had risen.

 As to the domestic economy, members judged that the economic

 recovery had shown signs of weakening as domestic demand-related

 indicators had become subdued. Most members expressed concerns about

 issues such as the contractions in consumer and investor confidence and

 the weakening of consumption due to structural factors, while some noted

 the possibility of a further delay in the economic recovery going forward.

 One member however mentioned that there was also a possibility of the

 domestic economy returning quickly to its originally forecast growth path,

 since the effects of the Sewol ferry accident were judged to be limited to

 only temporary shocks

 In the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members noted that

 long-term interest rates and exchange rates had fallen and that the credit

 differentiation (where only companies with high credit ratings have access

 to credit) in the corporate bond market was persisting.

 With regard to prices, members mentioned that consumer price inflation

 stood at 1.7%, as in the previous month. Several members anticipated that

###### consumer price inflation would gradually rise but that inflationary pressures

 would be weaker than initially expected – due chiefly to downward

 pressures on inflation from the supply side, resulting largely from the

 decline in import prices with the appreciation of the Korean won and from

 the continuing weakness in agricultural product prices, as well as to the

 sluggishness of aggregate demand owing to the domestic demand slowdown.

 Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Most members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 domestic and international economic environments and their future

 outlooks, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level

 for the intermeeting period.

 One of them noted that, although the world economy had been

 gradually improving, the downside risks to growth had been mounting

 again of late, and although the Korean economy was also continuing its

 trend of growth, centering around exports, it was unclear whether this

 trend would remain firmly on track going forward. He went on to express

 the view that, as the contraction in domestic demand since the Sewol

 ferry accident had been accelerating, while inflation also remained at an

 unprecedentedly low level, close monitoring by the policy authorities was

 necessary.

 Another member offered the opinion that, inasmuch as the trends of

 economic recovery at home and abroad had not been solid, monetary

 policy should be conducted so that the effects of factors constraining the

 growth of and causing imbalances between the financial and the real

 sectors could be minimized and the momentum for economic recovery

###### found, while economic agents’ sentiments were managed stably so as to

 avoid their falling into a low expectation trap.

 One other member noted that, although the downward revision of the

 economic growth forecast for Korea in 2014, compared to the original

 forecast, appeared attributable not just to temporary shocks but also to

 structural factors causing sluggishness in domestic demand, neither the

 future direction of the growth path nor the trend of narrowing of the

 output gap were judged to have reversed. This member went on to note

 that, while the trend of a narrowing of the price gap itself had not

 changed, there was a possibility that its pace would be quite moderate. He

 also stated the opinion that, although the current credit cycle was judged

 to not be in a phase of overheating, the effects that any adjustment to the

 Base Rate might bring about should be considered with great caution,

 given the high level of leverage and the structural vulnerabilities of

 household debt, the polarization of the corporate credit market, and the

 signs of a contraction in direct financing.

 Another member commented that, although judging from economic

 conditions and prospects at home and abroad some scope seemed to have

 arisen for more accommodative monetary policy, it was necessary to

 further observe and examine the impacts of the Sewol ferry accident and

 risk factors such as the appreciation of the Korean won, since the overall

 trend of macroeconomic variables remained unchanged even in the revised

 economic outlook.

 One other member noted that the Korean won had appreciated by

 more than 6% against the US dollar since March of this year, having at

 one point in July reached 1,008 won to the dollar, and that it was even

 appreciating against the currencies of Japan and the euro area, with which

 Korea runs bilateral current account deficits, as Korea’s trade surplus with

 China, which accounts for 70 to 80% of Korea’s current account surplus,

 The member then expressed the opinion that, as the recently agreed upon

 establishment of markets for direct trade between the won and the yuan

 was expected to mitigate this excessive appreciation of the won, efforts to

 facilitate these markets were necessary.

 Another member observed meanwhile that the uncertainties concerning

 the future growth path of and the downside risks to the economy were

 judged to have increased, while prices were seen likely to continue

 showing a rate of growth below the inflation target. He went on to argue

 that, although predicting in advance whether the impact of the Sewol ferry

 accident would be long-term or only temporary was difficult, the Base

 Rate should be adjusted downward from its current level this month, since

 a preemptive response was judged necessary at this juncture owing to

 concerns about the decline in economic agents’ confidence becoming

 prolonged.

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation of Monetary Policy Directions

 Taking into consideration the results of their earlier discussions,

 members compiled a statement reflecting the views of the majority.

 However, Mr. Chung, Hae-Bang expressed clear opposition to the idea

 of holding the Base Rate at its current level, and argued for a rate cut.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Committee considers

 that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained

 and the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears

 to have continued to ease, while trends of economic growth in

 emerging market countries have differed from country to country.

 The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its

 modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced

 economies, but judges that the possibility exists of its being

 affected by the changes in global financial market conditions

 stemming from the shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary

 policy stance and by the weakening of economic growth in some

 emerging market countries.

 □ In Korea, despite exports having maintained their buoyancy the

 Committee appraises economic growth to have slowed somewhat, as

 domestic demand has slackened due largely to the impacts of the

 Sewol ferry accident. On the employment front, the number of

 persons employed has shown an uptrend similar to its level of

 recent years, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and in

 the service sector. The Committee expects that the negative output

 gap in the domestic economy will gradually narrow going forward,

 although its pace of narrowing will be moderate.

 □ Consumer price inflation registered 1.7% in June, as in May, even

 despite a narrowing of the extent of decline in agricultural product

###### prices as the decline in petroleum product prices accelerated. Core

 inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products

 fell slightly, from 2.2% to 2.1%. The Committee forecasts that

 inflation will gradually rise, although inflationary pressures appear

 to be somewhat weaker than previously expected. Housing prices in

 the country excluding Seoul and its surrounding areas showed a

 slight upward movement, while leasehold-deposit prices both in

 Seoul and its surrounding areas and in the rest of the country

 continued their modest uptrends.

 □ In the domestic financial markets, influenced by improvements in

 economic indicators in and the accommodative monetary policy

 stances of major countries, as well as by inflows of foreigners’

 securities investment funds, stock prices have risen, long-term

 market interest rates have fallen, and the Korean won has

 appreciated.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as

 to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range

 over a medium-term horizon while supporting the recovery of

 economic growth. In this process it will closely monitor external

 risk factors such as shifts in major countries’ monetary policies, as

 well as the possibility of a delay in the domestic demand recovery

 influenced for example by the Sewol ferry accident.
