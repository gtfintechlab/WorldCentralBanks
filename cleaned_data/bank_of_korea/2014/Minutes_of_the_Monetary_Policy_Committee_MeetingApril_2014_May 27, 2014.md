###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

  After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea',

 'FX and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following

 areas:

  With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that,

 while the trend of economic recovery in the US had been sustained and

 the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area had eased,

 economic growth in China had slowed with production, consumption and

 domestic demand showing sluggishness. Members meanwhile assessed the

 international financial markets as having remained stable overall, despite a

 temporary contraction due mainly to risks related to the Ukraine and to

 worries about an economic slowdown in China. Some members noted that

 risk factors did still remain, however, including the additional reductions in

 scale of asset purchases by the US Fed and the possibility of expansions

 in financial unrest in emerging market countries.

 As to the domestic economy, members’ assessment was that, although

 indicators related to domestic demand had slumped temporarily, the

 economic recovery was continuing as exports had shown buoyancy. Most

 members forecast that the domestic economy would maintain its upward

 trend, driven largely by the economic recoveries in advanced countries and

 the improvements in domestic demand conditions. Some members however

 observed that certainty as to the recovery’s sustainability was lacking, due

 to destabilizing factors at home and abroad.

 In the domestic financial markets, members noted that stock prices had

 risen, the Korean won had appreciated and interest rates had moved within

 a narrow range. Some members meanwhile mentioned the need for

###### keeping a close watch on household debt, which had been maintaining a

 trend of high growth.

 With regard to prices, noting that consumer price inflation and core

 inflation had both risen from the previous month, members forecast that

 inflation would gradually rise going forward, although it would remain low

 for the time being. Some members added that close attention should be

 kept on the possibility of changes in the expected inflation rate, since

 consumer price inflation had been running below the lower bound of the

 inflation target for a long period of time.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 domestic and international economic environments and their future

 outlooks, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level

 for the intermeeting period.

 One member expressed the need for reviewing measures to boost the

 corporate dividend yield ratio so that corporate earnings could flow into

 households, and for facilitating firms’ purchases of real estate and their

 rental to employees.

 Another member noted that the pace of growth in household lending

 was continuing, and particularly that non-bank financial institution and

 high-interest rate household loans were increasing, and stated his opinion

 that monitoring related to this should be strengthened.

 One other member expressed the opinion that it was necessary to

 prepare for the possibility of negative impacts on the domestic economy of

 any change in the US monetary policy stance and of the possible renewal

 of unrest in emerging markets.

 One member mentioned that, if interest rates were to remain low for a

 long period of time, negative effects - such as the weakening of savings

 incentives, delays in restructuring and increases in household debt - could

 be greater than the positive effects in stimulating the economy. He then

 presented the view that the normalization of interest rates should be

 considered at an appropriate time, when the economic recovery had

 become evident.

###### Another member expressed the view that, since both the upside and

 downside risks were present in domestic and overseas financial markets, while there had been no significant change in the pace of domestic

 economic recovery and prices were stable, it would be appropriate to

 maintain the current degree of monetary easing for the time being.

 Lastly, one other member put forward the opinion that it would be

 advisable to carefully monitor the progress of overseas risk factors and

 monetary policy operations of major advanced countries, and to closely examine their effects on domestic business activities, prices and financial

 market conditions.

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

 Incorporating the outcome of these discussions, the following statement

 was prepared with the unanimous consent of all members:

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Committee considers

 that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained

 and the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears

 to have continued to ease, while economic growth trends in some

 emerging market countries have weakened somewhat. The

 Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest

 recovery going forward, but judges that the possibility exists of its

 being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions

 stemming from the shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary

 policy stance and by the weakening of economic growth in

 emerging market countries.

 □ In Korea indicators related to domestic demand have slumped

 temporarily, but as exports have shown buoyancy the Committee

 appraises the economic recovery to have continued in line with the

 trend of growth. On the employment front, the number of persons

 employed has continued its substantial uptrend, led by increases in

 the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The

 Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a

 negative output gap for the time being going forward, although it

 forecasts that the gap will gradually narrow.

 □ Consumer price inflation rose from 1.0% the previous month to

 1.3% in March, due mainly to expansions in the extents of increase

###### in service fees and livestock product prices. Core inflation excluding

 the prices of agricultural and petroleum products also rose from

 1.7% to 2.1%. The Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually

 rise, although it will remain low for the time being due largely to

 a bountiful agricultural harvest. Regarding the housing market, the

 uptrends of sales and leasehold deposit prices in both Seoul and its

 surrounding areas and in the rest of the country increased slightly,

 due in part to the influence of the spring moving season.

 □ In the domestic financial markets, stock prices had fallen, due

 mainly to concerns about an economic slowdown in China, but

 have since then shifted to a rise in line chiefly with the

 continuation of improvements in US economic activity. The Korean

 won had weakened against the US dollar but has since appreciated

 considerably, influenced mainly by in- and outflows of foreigners’

 portfolio investment funds. Long-term market interest rates have

 meanwhile moved within a relatively narrow range.

 □ Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and

 the influences of external risk factors such as shifts in major

 countries’ monetary policies, the weakening of economic growth

 trends in some emerging market countries and geopolitical risks in

 Eastern Europe, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as

 to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range

 over a medium-term horizon while supporting the continued

 recovery of economic growth.
