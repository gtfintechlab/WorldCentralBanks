###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

  After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea',

 'FX and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following

 areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the

 trend of economic recovery had continued led by advanced countries such

 as the US, the euro area countries and Japan. However, some members

 noted that there were also destabilizing factors such as the possibility of a

 slowdown in Chinese economic growth. While the majority of members

 generally assessed the international financial markets as having maintained

 stable movements, many members also mentioned destabilizing factors in

 financial markets, including the intensification of the Japanese yen’s

 weakening trend and financial unrest in some emerging market countries.

  As to the domestic economy, most members’ assessment was that,

 based on improvements in various indexes, it was maintaining its recovery.

 They forecast that the economy would continue to grow at its potential

 growth rate, driven largely by improved domestic demand including

 consumption and investment and uptrends in exports.

  With regard to domestic financial markets, members pointed out that

 long-term market rates had declined due mainly to foreigners’ net buying

 of Treasury bond futures and stock prices had also fallen affected by

 outflows of foreign investment funds driven largely by the weakening yen

 and concerns about a slowdown in Chinese economic growth. One member

 argued that effective measures needed to be developed in advance against

 market destabilizing factors such as the expanded scale of in- and outflows

 of foreign investment funds, the spread of the restructuring at some ailing

###### large corporations and the exacerbation of household debt problems caused

 by higher market interest rates.

 As to prices, most members observed that consumer price inflation had

 registered a low level of just above 1 percent, due mainly to a fall in

 agricultural product prices. They forecast though that downward pressures

 on the demand side would gradually weaken and that the movements of

 agricultural product prices, house rents and public utility fees would act as

 upward pressures.

 Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, taking overall account economic

 conditions at home and abroad and the future outlook, it would be

 desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting

 period.

  One member, while noting that there still was a possibility of

 international financial market volatility heightening with monetary policies

 in major advanced countries diverging, expressed the opinion that it would

 be better to keep a close watch on the monetary policy implementation by

 major advanced countries and the movements of international financial

 market price variables going forward, while closely monitoring their

 influence on the domestic economy.

 Another member, meanwhile, expressed the opinion that going forward

 every effort should be made to achieve in a balanced manner policy goals

###### such as supporting the recovery of growth trend, achieving the

 medium-term inflation target and promoting financial stability, as set out in

 the Monetary Policy Direction for 2014 released at the end of 2013.

 One other member took the view that it was time to take active policy

 measures since it is possible that domestic long-term market interest rates

 could exhibit an upward trend as it synchronize with US long-term

 Treasury bond yields, and since interest rate and exchange rate volatility

 were expected to intensify in line with the heightened volatility of capital

 in- and outflows. He went on to comment that, since there was concern

 that the trend of the yen’s depreciation might continue for a considerable

 time going forward and thus have a negative impact on Japan’s

 neighboring countries, measures through international cooperation would be

 necessary so that the yen’s depreciation did not become excessive.

 While calling for a close watch to be kept on the continued weakness

 of yen and the spreading out of the its effects, the concerns about slowing

 Chinese growth, increased financial market volatility and the likelihood of a

 tapering off of the US Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing, one member

 expressed the opinion that the effects of monetary and fiscal policies be

 examined so as to ensure that the trends of low growth and low inflation

 did not become entrenched while the monitoring of destabilizing factors in

 the foreign exchange market should be strengthened. He added that

 attention should be paid to financial system disrupting factors including the

 possibility of a deterioration in fund-raising conditions for vulnerable

 sectors, the sector-specific debt situation including the household debt

 problem, and financial market unrest arising largely from the steepening of

 the yield curve.

 In addition, one member called for the close monitoring of future

 developments in financial market conditions at home and abroad and 

 develop appropriate measures to various scenarios, since the heightened

###### possibility that the intensification of yen’s weakening trend would have a

 major negative impact on the stability and growth of the Korean economy

 going forward and since contrasting policy stances in the US and Japan

 are especially expected to greatly increase the volatility in highly open

 Korean financial markets.

 Last, another member noted the need to look into the possibility of

 further weakening of the yen and the influences of its intensified

 depreciation on the Korean won, and expressed the opinion that it is time

 to focus policy capacity on revitalizing corporate sector investment as a

 growth engine that would allow the Korean economy to emerge from its

 low growth trend. He went on to express the view that, with regard to

 steady rising overseas investment, it was essential to evaluate in detail the

 future influence of overseas corporate investment on the dynamism of

 domestic demand, and that attention should be paid to the declining share

 of fixed-rate lending in overall household debt.

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation of Monetary Policy Directions

 Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Committee considers

 that the trend of economic recovery in the US has become more

 evident and that the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro

 area appears to have continued to ease, while economic growth

 trends in emerging market countries, above all China, have been

 maintained. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will

 sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the

 possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global

 financial market conditions stemming from the US Federal Reserve’s

 QE tapering.

 □ In Korea, the Committee appraises the economic recovery to be

 continuing in line with the trend of growth, while exports and

 consumption have continued their uptrends. On the employment

 front, the scale of increase in the number of persons employed has

 expanded substantially in line with increases in the 50-and-above

 age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that

 the domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for the

 time being going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will

 gradually narrow.

 □ Consumer price inflation fell slightly from 1.2% the previous month

 to 1.1% in December, due mainly to a larger extent of decline in

 the prices of agricultural products and to slowing of the uptrends in

 prices of industrial products other than petroleum. Core inflation

###### excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also fell slightly,

 from 2.0% to 1.9%. The Committee forecasts that inflation will

 gradually rise, although it will remain low for the time being due

 largely to the stability of international agricultural prices. As for the

 housing market, sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas

 maintained their level of the previous month while the uptrend of

 those in the rest of the country continued. The rise in

 leasehold-deposit prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas slowed

 slightly, while in the rest of the country the same trends of

 increase as in the previous month were seen.

 □ In the domestic financial markets, stock prices have fallen

 substantially, due mainly to concerns about worsening corporate

 performances in line with the weakness of the Japanese yen and to

 outflows of foreigner stock investment funds. Long-term market

 interest rates have fallen considerably, under the influence of

 foreigners’ investment in bond futures. The Korean won has

 weakened slightly, as the influences of the continued current

 account surplus and the outflows of foreigners’ securities investment

 funds have overlapped.

 □ Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and

 the influences of external risk factors arising from shifts in major

 countries’ monetary policies, the Committee will conduct monetary

 policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation

 target range over a medium-term horizon while supporting the

 continued recovery of economic growth.
