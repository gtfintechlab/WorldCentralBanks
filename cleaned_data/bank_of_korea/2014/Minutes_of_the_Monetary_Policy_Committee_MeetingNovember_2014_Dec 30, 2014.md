###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

  After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea',

 'FX and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following

 areas:

  With regard to the global economy, many members’ assessment was

 that, while the US Federal Reserve had decided to conclude its asset

 purchase program as the trend of US economic recovery continued, the

 recovery in the euro area had been sluggish. Members also noted that, after

 having shown an increase until the middle of the preceding month, risk

 aversion in the international financial market had eased, on the robustness

 of major countries’ economic indicators, the carrying out of additional

 quantitative easing by the Bank of Japan.

 Related to the domestic economy, many members appraised the

 momentum of economic recovery as having not been strong, with

 indicators of domestic demand appearing to be sluggish, and forecast that

 going forward the economic recovery would be modest.

 Concerning the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members noted

 that the KRW/USD exchange rate had risen significantly, on the trend of

 US dollar strength globally and the Bank of Japan’s implementation of

 additional quantitative easing, while long-term interest rates had fallen.

 Many members mentioned that it would be necessary to closely monitor

 the future trends of household debt, which had recently increased sharply

 centering around home mortgage lending.

 With regard to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had

###### sustained a low rate of 1.1%, and some mentioned the need to keep in

 mind that the inflation expectations of the general public now stood at

 2.7%, the lowest since they were first surveyed in 2002.

 Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 domestic and international economic environments and their future

 outlooks, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level

 for the intermeeting period.

 One member argued that, while maintaining the Base Rate at its

 current level for the intermeeting period, it would be necessary to more

 closely analyze the trends of global risks and uncertainties that had

 recently grown more pronounced, while priority should at the same time

 be placed on examining the effects on the Korean economy of the Base

 Rate cuts in August and October. He went on to state the views that, as

 the appreciation of the US dollar was forecast to continue in the future,

 and the depreciations of the yen and the euro to intensify, measures

 should be developed to stabilize any excessive exchange rate fluctuations,

 and that, as the negative effects of the continued situation of low inflation

 might gradually increase, coping with this low inflation had to be

 considered as one of the most important policy tasks.

 Another member noted that the trends of improvements in economic

 activities in major countries other than the US were weak overall, that the

 momentum of the domestic economic recovery was not strong, that

 uncertainties in the domestic financial and foreign exchange markets were

 mounting, and that the downside risks to growth perceived by economic

###### agents were rising. He then expressed the view that, although the Base

 Rate should be kept at its current level this month, there was a need to

 manage financial and foreign exchange market volatilities so as to prevent

 their growing excessive, while strengthening communication with the aim

 of easing the uncertainties due to changes in economic conditions and

 restoring economic agents’ confidence.

 One other member stated his opinion that the benefits of an additional

 Base Rate adjustment were not large compared to the potential risks,

 considering the points that, with the effects of the Base Rate cuts and

 domestic and foreign downside risks coexisting uncertainties as to the size

 of the negative output gap and the speed of its closure were high, while

 there was also a high degree of uncertainty as to the future path of the

 price gap as the directions of changes in the CPI and in core inflation

 were showing different pictures, that considering the monetary policy time

 lag there was a need to closely monitor the influence of the two recent

 Base Rate cuts, that the current credit cycle was being judged as not in a

 phase of overheating in which systemic risk had increased due to an

 excessive expansion in debt, and that outflows of foreign investment funds

 due to narrowing of the spread between foreign and domestic interest rates

 following the Base Rate cuts were still not large, and so it would be

 desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting

 period.

 Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to

 hold the Base Rate at its current level for the month while keeping close

 watch on the effects of the Base Rate cuts made until now and on

 changes in the macroeconomy and in risks to financial stability. He went

 on to note then that, since the degrees of concern voiced by some related

 to the recent weakening of the yen and to the possibility of deflation

 exceeded the realities, active communication with market participants and

 the general public was necessary, based upon the results of objective and

4

###### neutral analyses regarding these risk factors.

 One other member put forward the view that, in overall consideration

 of economic conditions at home and abroad, it would be desirable to hold

 the Base Rate at its current level for the month. He then noted that the

 depreciation of the yen had been accelerating of late and that some

 forecasters expected the Japanese yen/US dollar exchange rate to reach the

 120 yen range in 2015, and expressed the view that, if the pace of yen

 depreciation accelerates as it was now doing, the negative effects on

 Korean firms’ competitiveness could increase to a level that could scarcely

 be ignored, and vigilance in this regard should thus not be relaxed.  

 Another member expressed the opinion that, although signs of

 improvement in domestic economic and price conditions were not clear,

 while uncertainties had increased due mainly to the contraction in

 economic sentiment and the intensification of Japanese yen weakening, it

 would be better to maintain the Base Rate at its present level for the

 month since the effects of the government’s economic measures and the

 Base Rate cuts had not been fully reflected in the real economy, due

 mainly to the related time lags, and there was thus a need to monitor

 future developments a bit more.

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

 Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all members.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 - The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

###### today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.00% for the

 intermeeting period.

 - Based on currently available information the Committee considers

###### that, although the trend of economic recovery in the US has been

 sustained, the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area

 has continued while trends of economic growth in emerging market

 countries have differed from country to country. The Committee

 forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery

 going forward, centering around the US, but judges that the

 possibility exists of its being affected by changes in the monetary

 policies of major countries, by the prolongation of economic

 sluggishness in the euro area, by the weakening of economic

 growth in some emerging market countries, and by geopolitical

 risks.

 - In Korea, the Committee judges that exports have sustained a

###### favorable pattern, that indicators of domestic demand have been

 alternating between improvements and worsening, and that economic

 agents’ sentiments have been sluggish. On the employment front,

 the number of persons employed has expanded steadily, led by

 increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector.

 The Committee expects that the negative output gap in the domestic

 economy will gradually narrow going forward, albeit at a moderate

 pace.

- Consumer price inflation rose from 1.1% the month before to 1.2%

###### in October, due mainly to a narrowing of the extent of decline in

 agricultural product prices. Core inflation excluding agricultural and

 petroleum product prices fell to 1.8%, from 1.9% in September,

 owing primarily to slowdowns in the rates of industrial product

 price increase. The Committee forecasts that, after remaining low

 for the time being, inflation will gradually rise next year. In the

 housing market, sales and leasehold deposit prices in both Seoul

 and its surrounding areas and in the rest of the country continued

 their uptrends.

- In the domestic financial markets, the Korean won has depreciated

###### considerably against the US dollar but appreciated significantly

 against the Japanese yen, in line with the US dollar’s strength

 globally and with the Japanese yen’s weakness due mainly to the

 expansion of the Bank of Japan’s quantitative and qualitative

 monetary easing. Stock prices have rebounded, after having fallen

 significantly due for example to concerns about the slowdown of

 the global economy and to outflows of foreigners’ securities

 investment funds. Long-term interest rates have declined.

- Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth,

###### the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price

 stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial

 stability. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors

 such as shifts in major countries’ monetary policies, as well as the

 trends of household debt and of capital flows.
