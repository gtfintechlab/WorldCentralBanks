###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

  After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea',

 'FX and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following

 areas:

  With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that,

 while the US economy was sustaining its favorable growth, the recovery in

 Japan and the euro area had been feeble and economic growth in China

 had slowed somewhat. Members also judged that, in the international

 markets, the US dollar had strengthened, interest rates had generally

 declined, and stock prices had risen centering around advanced countries.

 Related to the domestic economy, many members appraised the

 momentum of economic recovery as having lacked strength, with domestic

 demand-related indicators appearing subdued, and also noted that sentiment

 indices had been sluggish.

 As to the domestic financial markets, members noted that volatility had

 increased, with long-term interest rates falling and then rebounding sharply,

 and that the won/dollar exchange rate had continued on an upward trend.

 With regard to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation stood

 at 1.0%, lower than in the previous month, and forecast that it would

 remain at a low level for a considerable time, influenced for instance by

 the fall in international oil prices.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 domestic and international economic environments and their future

 outlooks, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level

 for the intermeeting period.

 One member argued that, amid the continued weak momentum of the

 economic recovery, the downside risks to prices appeared to have become

 greater due to the decline in oil prices for example, and financial market

 participants’ anticipations of a further Base Rate cut seemed to have

 grown somewhat compared to November, but that it would be desirable to

 maintain the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period,

 since the trends of economic activities and consumer price inflation needed

 to be monitored a little while longer, considering that the effects of the

 Base Rate cuts had not been fully reflected in the real economy and that

 the government planned to front load its budgetary expenditure as much as

 possible in 2015.

 Another member stated the opinion that it would be desirable to hold

 the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period. With regard

 to the recent sharp drop in international oil prices, to the 70 dollars per

 barrel level, he argued that, since a decline in oil prices caused by

 supply-side factors would lead to increases in net incomes and

 consumption and ultimately boost the economic growth rate, excessive

 concern about the oil price decline was uncalled for, before going on to

 state that attention should be paid to the possibility of a drop in oil

 import costs in line with that in international oil prices, causing the

 current account surplus to widen and in consequence exerting substantial

###### upward pressures on the Korean won. The member also noted that

 government fiscal expenditures had fallen short of the original budgets in

 2013 and 2014, and advocated that, in order for fiscal policy to support

 economic recovery through synergy effects with monetary policy, the

 government must devote every effort to carrying out fiscal spending as

 planned or to improve the flow of funds, by for example the accurate

 forecast of tax revenues and the drawing up of a formal schedule for

 Treasury bond issuance.

 One other member commented that, while holding the Base Rate at its

 current level for the intermeeting period, it would be desirable to closely

 examine the effects of the Base Rate cuts so far, the movements of

 international oil prices, changes in monetary policy in major countries and

 their influences, and the domestic household debt trend. He went on to

 note that, although there was little likelihood of the fears recently raised

 in some quarters concerning deflation being realized, the spread itself of

 these apprehensions might dampen consumption and investment through a

 self-fulfilling process, and it was thus necessary to communicate actively 

 with market participants and the general public based upon accurate and

 objective analysis and assessment of the current economic situation. The

 member also mentioned that, in response to the trends of persistent slow

 growth and low inflation, and of the weakening of potential growth, the

 major factors underlying the deflation concerns, it was essential to carry

 out research on the possibility of employing policy tools other than the

 Base Rate.

 Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to

 hold the Base Rate at its current level for the month, while closely

 examining domestic and international risk factors and the channels of Base

 Rate cut transmission, as the expected benefits of a Base Rate adjustment

 did not greatly outweigh its potential risks in a situation of persistent

 uncertainties related to the future growth and price paths, for example of

###### an increase in exchange rate volatility and sharp fall in oil prices

 continuing on from the previous month. He went on to note that the

 stability of inflation expectations had eroded due to the coexistence of

 conflicting market expectations as to the direction of monetary policy

 operation given the growing contradictions between the price stability and

 the financial stability targets in line with the persistent low inflation and

 the sharp increase in household debt. He added then that, in future

 monetary policy operations, greater emphasis should be placed on the

 formation of inflation expectations consistent with an appropriate price

 target.

 One other member mentioned that, amid weak paces of improvement

 in economic activities in major countries apart from the US, there was no

 clearly pronounced momentum of economic recovery in Korea as domestic

 real economic indicators were also generally poor, that business conditions

 and policy directions had diverged in major countries, and that a risk

 existed of the volatility in the international financial markets increasing. 

 The member went on to advance a view that the Base Rate should be

 kept at its current level for the month, while on the one hand support

 should be provided to ensure that the economic stimulation and monetary

 easing measures could actually take effect amid the uncertainties caused by

 changes in global conditions, and on the other hand efforts should be 

 made to create a stable base of macroeconomic fundamentals through for

 example stepping up the monitoring of potential risk factors at home and

 abroad.

 Another member expressed the opinion that, amid the recently

 increased downside risks to and volatility in the global economy, domestic

 demand and price conditions in the Korean economy were also still weak

 and showing uncertain movements. He went on to argue that it would be

 appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged for the month, and

 presented the view that the foreign exchange authorities should concentrate

###### more of their policy capacity on stabilization of the Korean won exchange

 rate since, although the synchronization of the Korean won with the

 Japanese yen had progressed to a certain extent due to the Korean won’s

 depreciation until that time, its degree might weaken and exchange rate

 volatility increase in the future. The member went on to state that the

 policy authorities should carefully analyze the fundamental background

 behind the low inflation, that had now persisted for more than two and

 one-half years, and take measures to prevent its negative effects from

 intensifying. 

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

 Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all members.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.00% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Committee considers

 that, although the trend of economic recovery in the US has

 become more evident, the sluggishness of economic activities in the

 euro area has continued while trends of economic growth in

 emerging market countries have differed from country to country.

 The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its

 modest recovery going forward, centering around the US, but

 judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by changes in

 the monetary policies of major countries, by the prolongation of

 economic sluggishness in the euro area, by the weakening of

 economic growth in some emerging market countries, and by

 geopolitical risks.

 □ In Korea, while exports have maintained generally favorable

 movements the Committee judges that the recoveries of

 consumption and facilities investment have been inadequate and that

 the sentiments of economic agents remain weak. On the

 employment front, the number of persons employed has expanded

 steadily, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the

 service sector. The Committee expects that the negative output gap

 in the domestic economy will gradually narrow going forward,

 albeit at a moderate pace.

 □ Consumer price inflation fell from 1.2% the month before to 1.0%

 in November, due mainly to declines in petroleum product prices

###### and to slowdowns in the rates of industrial product price increase.

 Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices

 fell to 1.6%, from 1.8% in October. Looking ahead, the Committee

 forecasts that inflation will gradually rise, after remaining at a low

 level for a considerable time influenced for example by declines in

 international oil prices. In the housing market the uptrend of sales

 prices has slowed, centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas,

 while leasehold deposit prices have continued to rise at a pace

 similar to that in October.

 □ In the domestic financial markets, the Korean won has continued its

 depreciation against the US dollar and its appreciation against the

 Japanese yen, in line with the strength of the dollar globally and

 the weakness of the yen. Stock prices, after having fluctuated

 within a relatively narrow range, have fallen to a considerable

 extent. Long-term market interest rates had shown a decline, in

 reflection mainly of expectations related to the monetary policies of

 major countries, but have rebounded.

 □ Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth,

 the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price

 stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial

 stability. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors

 such as shifts in major countries’ monetary policies, as well as the

 trends of household debt and of capital flows.
