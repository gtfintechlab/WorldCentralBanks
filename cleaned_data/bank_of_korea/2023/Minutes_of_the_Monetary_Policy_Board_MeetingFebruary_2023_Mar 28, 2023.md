###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation

After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook_ (February 2023),[2)] _FX and_

_International Finance Trends, and_ _Financial Market Trends, the discussions of the_
Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas.

Members assessed that despite eased concern about a global recession, domestic

economic growth continued to slow due to a slump in exports driven by a severe
contraction in the IT business and to weakened momentum for private consumption
caused by the increase in the household debt servicing burden. Meanwhile, some
members stated that while the economy was expected to recover gradually some time in
the second half of this year as the slump in exports eases in line with the improvement
in the overseas economic environment, uncertainties still remained over the growth path
surrounding external conditions, such as conditions in the semiconductor business and
the recovery in China.

In terms of inflation, members noted that consumer price inflation had risen to the

lower-5% level during January, driven by an increase in processed food prices and hikes
in public utility fees. However, they predicted consumer price inflation and core
inflation excluding food and energy to slow gradually this year to 3.50% and 3.0%,
respectively, led mainly by declines in petroleum product prices, the base effect, and
weakening demand pressure going forward. Meanwhile, some members assessed that
there were still some upside risks to inflation, given the continued rise in core inflation,
the second-round effects of non-core on core inflation, and economic recoveries at home
and abroad.

Members also assessed that domestic financial market conditions had remained stable

with risk aversion weakened in general, though they were somewhat accommodative
given the tigthening stance. Meanwhile, some members stressed that, concerning the
financial stability, attention must be paid to the risk to overall financial market stability
arising from a sharp leverage adjustment in the process of easing financial imbalances,
as well as to the differentiation in risks across credit ratings.

###### Ⅲ. Summary of Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision

The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the

Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows.

The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

domestic and international financial and economic environment, it would be desirable to

keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% for the intermeeting period, while

one member argued for raising it by 25 basis points.

One member expressed the view that it would be desirable to maintain the Base

Rate at the current 3.50% at this meeting.

The member projected that the global economy would recover gradually after

bottoming out in the first quarter, backed by favorable employment conditions in the

US, the easing of the energy crisis in Europe, and the reopening in China, although

sluggish demand had been ongoing since the second half of last year. The member saw

that exports would likely improve gradually as external conditions surrounding our

economy improve. However, the member anticipated that the growth rate for this year

would run at the mid-1% level due to sluggish domestic demand stemming, for

instance, from decreases in consumption and investment capacity following an increased

debt burden.

The member saw that inflation rose again to 5.2% in January, affected by rises in

public utility fees, but expected price inflation for this year to run somewhat below the

previous forecast, influenced by a decline in international oil prices and sluggish

domestic demand. The member projected that the uptrend in prices would weaken

steadily to 4% in the first half of this year and to around 3% in the second half,

influenced by the easing of demand-side inflationary pressures and the base effect on

the supply side. The member saw that core inflation would fall to the lower-2% level

at the year-end, from the current lower-4% level. The member forecast that core goods

inflation would slow, as a decline in import prices would be reflected after a time gap,

and upward pressure on core service inflation would weaken further, influenced by a

sluggish housing market and households’ increased debt servicing burdens in line with

rate hikes. The member stated that, contrary to the US, which saw heightened upward

pressure on wages and prices, particularly in the service sector, due to reduced labor

supply, Korea witnessed an ongoing increase in the involuntary labor supply of the


-----

elderly, which was acting as an underlying downside factor for service prices. The

member thus saw the need to pay attention to this point.

The member commented that, in the financial markets, long-term market interest

rates rose again and the Korean won shifted to depreciation again as US Treasury

yields rose and the US dollar strengthened again due to expectations of a higher level

of the terminal federal funds rate in the US. The member presented the view that,

although funding conditions in the market and foreign currency liquidity remained

relatively favorable, the number of potential risks did not appear to be small, with the

delinquency rate for financial institutions rising, associated in particular with lending to

the real estate sector, and the credit spread on low-rated bonds remaining high. The

member stated that, in the midst of a sustained decline in housing prices, deleveraging

of household debt was ongoing, as housing-related loans at financial institutions shifted

to a decline for the first time in 10 years.

The member judged that, in view of the changes in economic conditions, the effects

of the rate hikes so far appeared to be shown across the entire economy, including in

growth, prices, and finance, and expressed the opinion that these effects could amplify

in the future, given that interest rate policy would be transmitted to the economy after

a time lag of several quarters. The member judged that it would be possible to keep

the Base Rate unchanged from the current level at this meeting, while assessing the

effects of the rate hikes so far and examining future developments in domestic and overseas

economic conditions, particularly since the recovery of domestic economic growth and a

slowdown in inflation were projected to strengthen toward the second half of this year.

However, the member stressed that keeping the Base Rate unchanged at this

meeting would not necessarily mean an easing of the monetary policy tightening stance,

and that the Board would put a priority on price stability in future Base Rate

operations. The member projected that inflation would continue to slow moderately, but

that it would still be necessary to keep a close eye on it, given the spread of inflation

expectations, the second round of spillover effects from increases in public utility fees,

and the prospect of a resurgence in international oil prices and in the Korean won to

US dollar exchange rate. The member also presented the opinion that, if the rate

differentials between Korea and the US widened further than expected due to any

further rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, there could be possibility of heavier

depreciation pressure on the won, which could act as a negative factor on domestic

prices and growth. The member thus saw the need to take active policy measures to

deal with this issue. Accordingly, the member argued that the Board should leave open

the possibility of a further rate hike, while examining developments of domestic and

international economic conditions, and prices in particular, going forward.


-----

Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base

Rate unchanged from the current 3.50% at this meeting.

The member mentioned that, although the domestic economy was showing weaker

growth, the trend of growth was more robust than feared. The member stated that

exports had been sluggish, affected by a global economic slowdown, and the momentum

of private consumption had also weakened lately, while facilities investment had

maintained its trend of improvement. Concerning employment conditions, the member

added that, with the number of persons employed showing a larger increase compared

to past years, and labor supply and demand conditions remaining tight, wages were

maintaining a high uptrend.

The member projected that, while the domestic economy would maintain a slowing

trend for some time, it would gradually recover in the second half of this year. The

member expected that, given the earlier-than-expected reopening and economic stimulus

measures in China, and stronger-than-expected economic conditions in the US and

Europe, external economic conditions would improve from what was witnessed at the

previous meeting. The member commented that, taking this into account, the Research

Department of the Bank of Korea projected that the domestic economy would grow at

its potential level after the second half while revising slightly downward the growth

outlook for the first half of this year. However, the member presented the view that,

since there were high uncertainties surrounding the future growth path, associated with a

recovery in the Chinese economy, the pace of monetary tightening in major economies,

and the degree of the slump in the domestic housing market, it would be necessary to

exercise caution concerning the relevant downside risks.

The member stated that, with respect to prices, as consumer price inflation had

risen to the lower-5% range in January, the ongoing decline trend in the inflation rate

since July last year has slowed. The member added that, while an uptrend in petroleum

product prices slowed, sharp price rises in processed food and personal services

continued, and the effects of increases in electricity fees created upward pressure on

prices.

The member projected that the rise in consumer price would be decelerated for

some time, given the base effect from the steep rise in the first half of last year.

However, the member judged that it would be difficult to say with confidence that

underlying inflation had stabilized downward, as core inflation remained elevated, led by

highly persistent personal service charges, inflation expectations became unstable again,


-----

and a rise in international commodity prices stemming from the resumption of economic

activity in China, hikes in public utility fees, and the relevant second-round spillover

effects would highly likely to serve as factors making for price instability going

forward.

Looking at financial conditions, the member stated that, in the domestic and

international financial markets, interest rates tumbled, stock prices soared, and the US

dollar weakened substantially on the back of spreading expectations of an

earlier-than-expected ending of monetary tightening by the US Federal Reserve since the

end of last year. The member commented that such a strong financial market partially

arises from the resolution of excessive stress conditions stemming from the faster pace

of tightening by the US Federal Reserve in the second half of last year, but it was

greatly diverging from tightening monetary policy stances at home and abroad. The

member thus saw that a sustained strong financial market could undermine the

downward stabilization of inflation.

From the perspective of financial stability, the member assessed that liquidity

indicators, including M2, continued to contract due to a decline in household lending in

the midst of a continued downward trend in housing prices. The member saw that a

trend of decline in credit supply would likely continue going forward due to more

cautious lending attitudes at financial institutions in the midst of ongoing credit risk

aversion toward the real estate sector and non-investment grade companies. The member

went on to assert that an excessively fast pace of these leverage adjustments could

cause instability across the entire financial market and thus it would be necessary to

keep a close watch on relevant developments.

Concerning future monetary policy, the member stated that, in overall consideration

of these points, it would be necessary to firmly anchor a tighter policy stance with an

emphasis on ensuring price stability until the Board was confident that the inflation

trend had converged to the target. The member stressed that if the downward

stabilization of inflation did not materialize, the Board should actively deal with

inflation by additionally hiking the Base Rate.

One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate

unchanged from the current 3.50% at this meeting.

The member assessed that the global economic slowdown had become evident since

the fourth quarter last year due to the contraction in the IT industry and the monetary

tightening of major countries, and argued that this trend would continue at least until


-----

the first half of the year. The member mentioned that toward the second half of the

year, however, the economy would recover gradually, boosted by China’s reopening, a

recovery in the IT industry, and a slowdown in supply-side inflation. The member

forecast that services trade might recover sooner than expected, led by China’s

resumption of overseas travel, while goods trade would remain sluggish for the time

being, affected by the overall economic slowdown.

The member’s evaluation was that the domestic economy had also remained

sluggish since the fourth quarter last year, influenced by the global trade slowdown. The

member noted that semiconductor production and exports had recently declined

significantly and that the manufacturing sector excluding semiconductors had also been

sluggish owing to slowing external demand. The member mentioned that facilities

investment would shrink due to external uncertainties and that construction investment

would remain sluggish affected by a slowdown in the housing market and a reduction

in the SOC budget. The member expressed concern that private consumption growth had

been slowing due to a growing debt repayment burden and a slowdown in the housing

market. The member presented the view that it would be difficult to expect private

consumption to drive growth since, despite an accumulation of excess savings during the

pandemic, incentives for precautionary savings amid economic uncertainties were highly

likely to limit consumption growth, and overall leverage adjustments had been underway.

Concerning consumer price inflation, the member noted that uncertainties remained

with regard to the pace of future slowdown, but there was a lack of grounds to support

the view that demand-side pressures would decelerate the pace of slowdown given the

current sluggish real economic trend and tight financial conditions. The member added

that, with all other factors held constant, consumer price inflation(year-on-year) would

fall to the 4% level in March, affected heavily by the base-period effect from last

year’s surge in international oil prices, which could trigger a decline in inflation

expectations. The member expressed the opinion that weaker demand-side inflationary

pressure and lower inflation expectations would lead to a fall in actual inflation.

The member assessed that monetary tightening had started to take evident effect,

given the continued decline in housing prices, slower household credit growth, sluggish

real investment, and a slowdown in employment and wage growth. The member stated

that further tightening might be considered to stabilize inflation at the target level

quickly, but given the 300 basis point Base Rate hike over the past year and a half,

additional benefits would be very small or uncertain at this stage, and went on to stress

that attention should be paid rather to the possibility of excessively dampening the

economic recovery or increasing risks to financial stability. The member added that it

would be necessary to bear in mind that distribution indicators had worsened over the


-----

course of overcoming previous foreign exchange and financial crises.

Meanwhile, another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to leave

the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% at this meeting.

The member stated that although global economic growth was somewhat slowing,

the degree was more moderate than initially expected. The member assessed that in the

U.S. employment conditions remained solid and that even though the rate of increase in

inflation has started to decline, the pace appeared to be slowing more than anticipated.

Accordingly, there was a higher chance that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle

would be lengthened and the terminal rate would exceed the previous forecast, the

member added. The member expected the euro area to witness a somewhat modest

slowdown in real economic growth thanks to the easing of energy supply disruptions.

The member presented the view that China’s economy was expected to recover

modestly on the back of its reopening as the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, but

uncertainties surrounding the extent of recovery were high.

With regard to the domestic economy, the member stated that the slowdown in

growth continued as a trend, affected by external conditions and interest rate hikes, but

some indicators were showing a slight upturn this year. The member said that the

domestic economy would be sluggish in the first half owing to domestic and overseas

conditions, such as the global economic slowdown and rising interest rates, but would

recover gradually as the slump in exports ease after the second half, and that the

Research Department forecast the economy to grow 1.6%, falling slightly below the

November projection (1.7%). However, the member assessed that the timing and pace of

the recovery were highly uncertain, depending on the recovery trajectory of the

semiconductor industry and the degree of impact of China’s reopening.

Turning to inflation, the member evaluated that while consumer price inflation and

core inflation both remained elevated, inflation was projected to abate gradually in line

with downward pressure on economic activity, but uncertainties over the future path

were heightened, as inflation(month-on-month) in January was greater than the previous

month. In addition, the member assessed that we can’t afford to be complacent, as

developments in global energy prices related to China’s reopening and the rise in public

utility bills could work as restraints on the downward stabilization of consumer price

inflation. With regard to employment, the member noted that amid the decline in the

growth of the number of persons employed, the rate of increase in fixed wages

remained high and there were no signs of decreases.


-----

The member assessed that as risk aversion eased, financial markets remained stable

with short-term interest rates falling and corporate credit spreads narrowing. As for

household debt, the member stated that as the decline in household debt has continued

since last year, the leverage that had been excessive has seemingly begun undergoing

corrections. The member noted, however, that a sharp correction in housing prices amid

rising delinquencies in loans to the real estate sector could lead to an increase in credit

risks and to financial market instability. The member therefore said that caution is

needed. The member added that it was hard to rule out the possiblity of additional falls

in housing sales prices, given that leasehold _(jeonse) deposit prices were declining faster_

than sales prices, and that the ratio of leasehold deposit prices to sales prices tends to

rise during slumps in the real estate market. The member presented the view that

Korean won to US dollar exchange rate volatility expanded somewhat in the foreign

exchange market, but the foreign currency money market in Korea has been generally

stable until now.

Considering the above mentioned economic conditions at home and abroad, the

member judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current 3.50%

at this meeting and monitor the effects of the previous tightening on the real economy

and inflation. The member expected that the effects of the widening of interest rate

differentials caused by further tightening in major economies on the Korean won to US

dollar exchange rate would be limited. The member expressed the view that it would be

desirable to decide whether to raise the Base Rate further by examining the future

inflation and growth trend and financial market conditions.

One member expressed the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate

at the current 3.50% at this meeting.

The member mentioned that, after being raised by 300 basis points on 10

occasions, the Base Rate has for the first time since the Global Financial Crisis reached

a tight level that exceeds the estimated range of the nominal neutral rate. The member

thus judged the current stage as a time to first examine the transmission of monetary

policy and monitor developments concerning uncertainties around inflation and external

and internal factors, before considering the need for further rate increases.

The member assessed that the rate increases have been producing effects that are

generally in line with the policy intentions, with prominent effects identified in financial

markets and effects seen in the real economy, as well. The member added that a

contraction in market liquidity is easing financial imbalances, represented by a housing


-----

market bubble and excessive leverage.

Given, however, that the financial conditions index posted its highest figure during

the current rate increase cycle compared to other increase cycles since 2000, the

member saw that some of the conditions that are emerging in the process of monetary

tightening calls for the need to pay attention to a decline in the real economy and to

any instability in the financial sector.

The member stated that the average capacity utilization gap in the manufacturing

sector has been exhibiting negative figures since mid-2022, while the margin of growth in

the number of employed persons began narrowing. The member also added that the pace

of recovery in private consumption has been slowing due to an aggravating burden for

households to make principal and interest repayments, while inflation appears to have

been slowing, as well.

With respect to financial instability, the member viewed that the drivers of market

disruptions have been significantly addressed thanks to the policy interventions made by

the government and the Bank of Korea in October last year, but with seemingly

differentiation by credit rating. Low-credit PF-ABCP borrowers continue to struggle with

financing, while loan delinquency has been occuring mainly in the non-metropolitan

area, in the real estate sector and among mid- to low-credit borrowers. The member

suggested the need to monitor the situation surrounding financial stability, while paying

attention to the channels through which financial conditions and regional factors, which

differ depending on credit rating and exposure, could trigger a systemic risk. The

member stressed the importance of keeping in mind that the recent financial and

economic conditions have factors that could either amplify or curtail the effects of a

tight monetary policy relative to average levels in the past.

The member commented that an important variable in relation to the decision

whether or not to further raise the Base Rate was inflation. The member stated that,

although consumer price inflation and core inflation rates are projected to stand at 3.5%

and 3.0%, respectively, this year, uncertainties surrounding the inflation path are very

high in terms of the degree of economic recovery at home and abroad, international oil

prices, and exchange rates. The member thus saw the need to pay close attention to

developments concerning core inflation for the time being due to the following two

reasons. First, the member stated that the role of core inflation would be important in

order for consumer price inflation to diminish in the future. Consumer price inflation

consists of non-core components, such as energy and food, and of core components. The

member saw that non-core component prices are not likely to exhibit a sharp drop going

forward, considering geopolitical conflicts, the recovery in global demand, and the

possible rise in production costs due to fragmentation. The member thus argued that only


-----

when core inflation declines would the possibility of meeting the medium-term inflation

target heighten. Second, the member noted that there is a possibility of non-core inflation

transmitting to core inflation, as the rise in international oil prices and public fees are

reflected in the prices of other goods and services. The member saw that the recent

inflation in private services being significantly high relative to labor market tightness

(unemployment to job-vacancy ratio) could be interpreted as a kick-in of the second

round transmission effect. The member added that the diffusion index of core

components and the trimmed-mean inflation rate are also showing signs of core inflation

either rising or persisting for a longer period than previously expected. The member

mentioned the need to respond with monetary policy if core inflation, which primarily

reflects demand side factors, does not either turn around or appears to be highly likely

to persist, due, for example, to second round transmission effects.

The member added the need to closely monitor exchange rate developments that

follow changes in surrounding conditions, including the monetary policy of the US

Federal Reserve. The member stated that, although the interest rate differentials between

Korea and the US do not work mechanically, it could induce rapid changes in market

expectations in tandem with developments in the current account balance and the flows

of foreign investment funds. The member thus stressed that, under the circumstances

that Korea is facing, it is important to remain cautious of the possibility of exchange

rate volatility affecting inflation and financial stability.

Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base

Rate at this meeting by 25 basis points to 3.75% from the current 3.50% at this

meeting.

The member assessed that the global economy had continued to decelerate, but had

been showing a more favorable trend than originally expected. The member forecast

GDP growth for this year at 1.6%, somewhat higher than the level forecast at the

January meeting.

With regard to inflation, the member mentioned that inflation was likely to slow

substantially from March onward due to the base-period effect from last year’s spike in

the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war. The member forecast that the slowdown would be

gradual toward the second half of the year, however, affected by hikes in public utility

charges and their spillover effects, as well as downward rigidity of personal services

charges. The member also presented the view that on the forecast path existed

substantial uncertainties, including the impacts of a rebound in Chinese demand on oil


-----

and other import prices. The member added that inflation expectations among the

general public also remained high, rising slightly to 4.0%.

The member assessed that financial market conditions appeared to be accommodative

given the previous tightening measures by the Bank of Korea. The member noted that,

looking at proxy rates, estimated by reflecting overall financial market conditions in the

policy rate through movements of price variables, such as market and lending rates, the

proxy Fed funds rate recently stood at around 6%, far above the U.S. policy rate, while

Korea’s proxy rate had dropped rapidly since November last year to fall below the

current Base Rate. The member stated that household debt had been declining, led by

credit loans, while corporate debt maintained strong growth on the back of increased

lending by financial institutions and a recovery of demand in the bond market. The

member added that the won-dollar exchage rate had rapidly increased recently, as

expectations of future U.S. monetary policy had been adjusted.

The member noted that the Bank of Korea had been raising its Base Rate to the

level slightly above the range of neutral interest rate estimates to tackle last year’s spike

in inflation. The member argued that the following should be considered at this month’s

meeting. First, financial markets had formed more accommodative expectations than the

Bank of Korea had intended with its policy measures, which was already reflected in

the current financial market conditions. Second, although inflation is expected to decline

gradually, there is high uncertainty surrounding the current inflation path, owing to the

potential impact of China’s economic recovery, and the central bank should respond to

this conservatively — it should raise the Base Rate to a level somewhat higher than the

estimated level of the Base Rate corresponding to the path of consumer price inflation,

which is forecast to decline to the lower 3% level until the end of this year and to the

2% level next year in the current macroeconomic model. This would reduce the

possibility of the inflation path being disturbed by the current uncertainty associated

with it, which could prolong high inflation, and would also help to anchor inflation

sooner at the target level. Third, it is necessary to prepare for how future foreign

exchange flows and the stability of exchange rates will be affected by the recently

adjusted market expectations of how high the federal funds rate will go and for how

long they will stay there.

Taking the above discussions into overall consideration, the member saw that it

would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points at this meeting to

3.75% from the current 3.50%. The member also took the view that the rate hike could

cause the economy to contract somewhat, but only to a tolerable extent thanks to the

improvement in external conditions. The member went on to argue that the rate hike

this time could support sustainable deleveraging of household debt and, above all, help


-----

cope aggressively with the current uncertainty surrounding the path of price stability, the

top priority for the central bank, ultimately lowering any possibility of a prolongation of

inflation and reducing the cost of future policy responses.

The member mentioned that the central bank should assess the effects of previous

rate hikes, the inflation path, risks to economic and financial stability, and monetary

policy changes in major countries before deciding whether to make further adjustments

to the Base Rate.

###### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy

Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.

However, Dr. Cho Yoon-Je expressed clear opposition to keeping the Base Rate at

the current level, and argued for raising it by 0.25 percentage points.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base

Rate unchanged at 3.50% for the intermeeting period. It is forecast that inflation

will continue to be above the target level throughout the year, although it is

projected to gradually decrease, and uncertainties surrounding the policy decision are

also judged to be high. The Board, therefore, sees that it is appropriate to judge

whether the Base Rate needs to rise further while assessing the pace of inflation

slowdown and developments in the uncertainties.

- Currently available information suggests that the slowdown of global economic

growth and inflation has continued. However, concerns about a recession in major

countries have somewhat decreased due to the easing of concerns over energy

supply and demand, as well as labor market conditions continuing to be favorable,

and the pace of inflation slowdown in the U.S. has been modest. In global financial


-----

markets, volatility in major price variables has increased. The U.S. dollar has shifted

to a rapid strengthening after continuing to weaken, and long-term market interest

rates have rebounded considerably, led by expectations that the U.S. Federal

Reserve’s terminal rate will be higher than previously expected after the

announcement of U.S. labor market and price indicators exceeding market

expectations. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global

financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the pace of global inflation

slowdown, monetary policy changes in major countries and U.S. dollar trends, the

recovery in the Chinese economy after the easing of its COVID-19 restrictions, and

geopolitical risks.

- Although concerns about a recession in major countries have eased, domestic

economic growth has continued to slow, with the recovery in private consumption

weakening and exports continuing to decrease due to deepened sluggishness in the

IT industry. Labor market conditions have generally continued to be favorable, but

the decline in the increase in the number of persons employed has continued due to

the economic slowdown. Going forward, domestic economic growth is expected to

remain weak, affected by the global economic slowdown and the increase in interest

rates. Domestic economic growth is expected to improve gradually from the second

half of this year with a recovery in the Chinese economy and in the IT industry.

However, uncertainties regarding the outlook are judged to be high. GDP growth for

this year is projected to be 1.6%, slightly lower than the November forecast of 1.7%.

- Consumer price inflation has run at 5.2% in January, which has been higher than

the 5.0% in December, due to increases in electricity fees as well as rising prices

of processed food products, although increases in the price of petroleum products

have moderated. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from

the CPI) has run at 4.1% in January. Short-term inflation expectations among the

general public have run at 4.0% in February. Looking ahead, it is forecast that

consumer price inflation will remain around 5% in February, but will gradually

decrease owing to the base effect from the sharp rises in global oil prices last year

and weakening pressure from the demand side. However, the pace of slowdown is

expected to be more modest than in major countries due to the effects of the

increases in public utility fees. Consumer price inflation for this year is projected to

be 3.5%, slightly lower than the November forecast of 3.6%. Uncertainty

surrounding inflation forecasts is judged to be high, regarding movements of global

oil prices and exchange rates, the degree of economic slowdown at home and


-----

abroad, and the size and effects of the increases in public utility fees.

- In financial and foreign exchange markets, volatility has increased in February with

a considerable rebound in the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate and in

market interest rates, which have shown a decrease since last November due to the

possibility of further tightening of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy stance. The

decrease in household loans has widened, and housing prices have continued to

decline across all parts of the country.

- The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to stabilize consumer

price inflation at the target level over the medium-term horizon as it monitors

economic growth, while paying attention to financial stability. Inflation is projected

to remain high above the target level although the domestic economic growth rate

has slowed, and uncertainties surrounding the policy decision are high. The Board,

therefore, deems it warranted to judge whether the Base Rate needs to rise further

while maintaining the restrictive policy stance for a considerable time with an

emphasis on ensuring price stability. In this process, the Board will thoroughly

assess the pace of inflation slowdown, the economic downside risks and financial

stability risks, the effects of the Base Rate raises, and monetary policy changes in

major countries.
