##### Ⅰ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision

At the July 13 Monetary Policy Board meeting, each member expressed their

opinions on the Bank of Korea’s Base Rate decision.

All members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic

and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to

leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% level for the intermeeting

period.

One member judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base

Rate at 3.50% at the meeting.

The member stated that the global economy had continued to grow

moderately. The member noted that the U.S. was showing a more favorable
growth trend than initially expected, as its growth rate forecast for this year had
been adjusted upward despite the steep policy rate hikes so far. The member
commented that the euro area, overall, showed a sluggish recovery trend, albeit
differentiated from country to country, and maintained high inflation. The
member noted that the U.S. Federal Reserve would likely raise its policy rate
somewhat from the current level, and that the ECB signaled that there would be
additional rate hikes. The member added that major advanced countries, such as
the U.K., Canada, and Australia, had continued to raise policy rates. The
member mentioned that China had continued to recover since the reopening, led
by the face-to-face service industry, but that its recovery trend had been more
sluggish than originally forecast.

The member noted that the domestic economy had continued to slow in

line with the original forecast path, but that consumption had shown a continued
recovery, and that the sluggishness in exports had eased somewhat. The member
added that on the employment front, the unemployment rate declined and the
employment to population ratio rose, with the increase in the number of persons
employed showing a more favorable trend than expected. The member stated
that, as for private consumption, retail sales increased, mainly on automobiles
and clothing, and credit card usage increased in June, on the back of excess
savings and favorable employment conditions, despite reduced consumption
capacity stemming from high interest rates and high inflation. The member


-----

commented that the sluggishness in facilities investment eased somewhat as it
had rebounded slightly after plunging early this year, led by machinery. On the
other hand, the member indicated that, concerning construction investment, the
negative impacts of the decline in new construction persisted. The member
pointed out that, regarding exports, the trade balance shifted to a surplus as the
sluggishness that had continued so far eased somewhat. The member projected
that expectations for a recovery in exports, such as in the semiconductor
industry, were heightening, but that uncertainties seemed to still be high.

The member noted that consumer price inflation had slowed considerably,

recording 2.7% last month year-on-year, due to the slowdown in the upward
trend of housing rents and personal service prices, and to the base effect from
the international oil price spike last year, and that it would likely remain at
around 3% until the end of this year. The member stated that consumer price
inflation would not deviate greatly from the previous forecast of 3.5% on an
annual basis this year, but that core inflation could be slightly above the
previous forecast of 3.3% as its pace of slowdown decelerated due to favorable
employment conditions and a continued consumption recovery.

The member stated that, as for financial and FX markets, bond market

yields at home and abroad rose somewhat as major country central banks
stepped up tightening, and that foreign exchange supply and demand conditions
and exchange rates remained generally stable. The member noted that the asset
insolvency of some non-bank financial institutions with high exposure to the real
estate sector had drawn attention in the market as financial imbalances
accumulated so far had worsened further during the pandemic. The member
judged that this insolvency was already undergoing an expected adjustment
process along with interest rate hikes and declines in the real estate market, but
that a cautious response is needed. In the meantime, the member commented that
housing prices and transactions rebounded in Seoul and its metropolitan area due
to the easing of real estate lending regulations and mortgage loan interest rates
that had fallen since October last year. The member added that the household
loan balance in the banking sector showed acceleration in its growth in May and
June after having shifted from a downward trend to an increase in April. The
member pointed out the need to remain vigilant that a high household debt ratio
and the default issue of real estate PF loans could limit future policy options
and dampen consumption, the economic recovery, and market sentiment.

The member stated that, considering all these, it would be appropriate to


-----

maintain the Base Rate at 3.50% at this meeting. The member mentioned that
this decision was based on the projection that core inflation, which still remained
at high levels, would slow gradually, and on the fact that instability factors
surrounding non-bank financial institutions persisted, and that business,

employment, and external sector trends were not overly fragile. The member
pointed out the need to maintain a restrictive stance for longer and to consider
the possibility of a further rate hike if needed, given the possibility of additional
rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, uncertainty over the pace of slowdown
in core inflation, and the need to rein in household debt to ensure future
financial stability.

Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to keep

the Base Rate at its current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.

The member assessed that it would be necessary to examine whether the

sustained monetary tightening was fully achieving the intended effects, while
closely monitoring real economic indicators, such as the inflation rate and
financial stability conditions. With regard to recent external conditions, the
member commented that, while countries had been showing differentiated growth
at their own paces, the lagged effect of monetary tightening was expected to
cause global economic growth to slow gradually. The member noted that global
inflation had passed its peak and was declining, driven by the stability of energy
and commodity prices, while core inflation remained high in most countries. The
member added that, in this regard, even central banks that had kept interest rates
unchanged either resumed interest rate hikes or left open the possibility of
further rate increases.

Looking at the domestic economy, the member mentioned that the growth

rate was lower than initially forecast, while the number of persons employed
remained higher than the previous forecasts. The member judged that consumer
price inflation had entered the 2% range for the first time in two years, driven
by the strong base-period effects from last year’s surge in international oil
prices, but was likely to climb back to around 3% by the end of the year. The
member argued that, since uncertainties surrounding the growth and price paths
remained high, it would be necessary to keep a close eye on changes in external
conditions, such as economic conditions in major countries and energy prices.

The member assessed that financial markets had been stabilizing despite


-----

demand for deposit withdrawals from the Korean Federation of Community
Credit Cooperatives (KFCC). However, the member expressed concern that, as
the sluggishness in the housing market had been relieved somewhat, affected by
eased real estate and lending regulations, household lending growth had
accelerated substantially. The member pointed out the possibility that there could
be a rapid increase in household lending in the event of stronger expectations of
a rise in housing prices amid eased lending attitudes.

The member stated that financial policy is represented by interest rate

policy, which affects the macroeconomy as a whole, and macroprudential policy,
which controls systematic risk through regulations. The member commented that
rate hikes help households and businesses reduce their debt and refrain from
reckless investment and that capacities for consumption and investment, created
in the course of deleveraging, would provide a basis for a strong economic
recovery and solid growth. The member stated that interest rate policy achieves
maximum effects when conducted in harmony with macroprudential policy. The
member also argued that, even if liquidity were provided to vulnerable sectors
by easing regulations, if needed, it would be desirable to do so while making
efforts to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio.

Another member took the view that it would be appropriate to hold the

Base Rate at its current level of 3.50%.

The member projected that world economic growth would slow going

forward, affected by a tightening monetary policy stance and China's sluggish
recovery, although the global economy showed more favorable growth than
originally forecast in the first half of this year. The member assessed that the
U.S. exhibited strong growth driven by solid employment conditions and
consumption, while inflation had decelerated. The member expected the real
economy to gradually contract going forward, due to the impact of the ongoing
tightening stance of financial conditions. The member evaluated that, in China,
while consumption was recovering, mainly in the face-to-face service sector,
downward pressure on the future growth path was increasing somewhat, as the
recovery in trade and investment was weakening due to sluggish global demand.
The member projected that global economic growth would gradually slow,
particularly in major countries, as the accumulated effects of tightening policies
would become evident after the end of this year. However, the member added
that the extent of economic slowdown would vary depending on developments of


-----

various risk factors, such as trends in the U.S. economy, the spillover effects of
China's reopening, global business conditions in the IT industry, rising

commodity prices stemming from climate change, and geopolitical issues.

The member noted that the domestic economy was showing a moderate

recovery as a slump in investment and exports had partially eased. The member
judged that, despite a slight adjustment in consumption in the second quarter, the
recovery continued as the slump in investment and exports had somewhat
improved, thanks to favorable growth in major economies. The member expected
the domestic economy to recover gradually after the second half of this year, as
private consumption would continue to recover, owing to improved consumer
sentiment and favorable employment conditions, and as exports would improve,
bolstered by improved business conditions in the IT industry. However, the
member anticipated that the pace of domestic economic recovery would be more
moderate than initially expected, influenced by external conditions. Consequently,
the member saw that economic growth for this year would be generally
consistent with the initial projection. The member saw that there was significant
uncertainty surrounding the future growth path in both domestic and external
conditions, including the possibility of a delayed recovery in the Chinese
economy and a potential decline in the contribution of fiscal policy to growth.
The member assessed that the downside risks to the growth trajectory were
increasing slightly.

Concerning inflation, the member judged that consumer price inflation

had slowed markedly, affected heavily by the base-period effect, and core
inflation had also slowed further, driven chiefly by a gradual slowing trend in
rents and a deceleration in the growth of charges for personal services. Going
forward, the member assessed that both consumer price inflation and core
inflation would continue to slow, but uncertainties as to the inflation outlook
path were high, owing to international oil price trends, domestic and overseas
economic trends, fuel tax and public utility tariff policies, and the impacts of
climate change.

Regarding financial markets, the member assessed that government bond

yields, after having declined excessively, had risen in synchronization with
Treasury bond yields in major countries, and consequently the financial
conditions had tightened again. The member judged that, amid such

circumstances, anxiety had persisted particularly in vulnerable sectors, with
delinquency rates at both banks and non-bank financial institutions continuing to


-----

rise and risks temporarily materializing at some institutions. The member argued
that, despite little likelihood of these risks spreading to the financial system as a
whole, it would be necessary to be fully prepared to face the possibility of
liquidity and credit risks in vulnerable sectors increasing financial market
volatility. The member also presented the view that attention should be paid to
the fact that, as housing transactions had been showing some recovery and as
household loans had been shifting back to an increase, this could delay or
undermine the deleveraging of long-standing household debt accumulation.
Looking at the domestic FX market, the member stated that the FX market had
been stable overall and that the won-dollar exchange rate had fallen significantly,
due to the U.S. dollar’s depreciation and due to increased foreign portfolio
investment fund inflows, and then rebounded on the back of stronger
expectations of monetary tightening in major countries. The member anticipated
that the won-dollar exchange rate could rise slightly in the event of a further
widening of the interest rate differential between Korea and the U.S., but the
that impact would be limited.

Considering these economic and financial conditions at home and abroad,

the member judged that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged
at the current 3.50% for the intermeeting period. The member expressed the
view that it would be appropriate to monitor the growth and inflation paths, as
well as domestic and overseas financial market conditions, before deciding
whether further tightening would be necessary.

Meanwhile, Another member presented the view that it would be

desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 3.50%.

The member stated that the global economy maintained relatively robust

growth in the first half of this year, despite high inflation. However, the member
saw that the growth varied from country to country. The member noted that, in
the U.S., the growth rate in the first quarter significantly exceeded expectations,
and with the Beveridge curve shifted left and downward, expectations of an
economic soft landing increased. Nevertheless, the member commented that the
prevailing view was that a gradual economic slowdown would be inevitable due
to prolonged inflation and rising interest rates. The member saw that, in China,
the structural weakening of the recovery was witnessed due to the impacts of
U.S.-China trade tensions, government regulations on online companies, and a
sluggish real estate market.


-----

The member expected our economy to show higher growth in the latter

half of this year compared to the first half thanks to the continued recovery in
service sector consumption and to the improvement in the IT business cycle.
However, the member presented the opinion that there were significant downside
risks, including a reduction in incentives for a consumption shift from excess
savings caused by the population aging, a contraction in import demand from
China, and a stagnation in the number of tourists coming to Korea.

The member noted that, with respect to prices, both consumer price

inflation and core inflation had exhibited increased volatility due to base effects
and seasonal factors. However, the member expected them to broadly continue to
slow and gradually stabilize at around 3% in the latter half of this year and
around the lower to mid-2% range in the first half of next year. The member
commented that, on the other hand, household loans, which had been on a
decline since the latter half of last year, had expanded again in the second
quarter. The member saw that this expansion was attributed to policy factors,
such as eased regulations on housing loans and an increased supply of policy
loans, combined with expectations of a housing price recovery. The member
added that, going forward, the continued increase in household loans would very
likely act as a factor intensifying financial imbalances. The member presented the
opinion that, although the fund withdrawal issue from the Korean Federation of
Community Credit Cooperatives (KFCC) at the end of June had been gradually
resolved as of late, it would be necessary to continue monitoring delinquency
rates and liquidity conditions, especially in vulnerable sectors, such as real estate
and construction, and the impacts on other non-bank financial institutions.

The member saw that, considering the recent overall economic and

financial conditions, there were both upside and downside risk factors associated
with the policy rate in terms of inflation, growth, and financial stability.
Therefore, the member judged that it would be necessary to maintain the Base
Rate at the current level at this meeting, while closely monitoring future
developments. The member noted, however, that inflation expectations still
remained elevated in the mid-3% range, and that there also was the potential
risk of a re-expansion of financial imbalances and increased volatility in the
foreign exchange market due to the widening interest rate differential. The
member thus suggested that the possibility of a further Base Rate hike in the
future should be kept open.

Meanwhile, the member expected structural changes, such as population


-----

aging, declining labor productivity, fragmentation of global supply chains, and
accumulation of private debt, to have a greater impact on monetary and credit
policies, as the volatility in domestic and global growth and inflation, which had
been heightened by the pandemic crisis and the Russia-Ukraine war, would
gradually diminish after next year. The member thus saw the need to continue to
monitor related issues and be prepared through a mix of monetary, fiscal,
macroprudential, and structural adjustment policies.

Another member presented the view that maintaining the Base Rate at

the current level of 3.50% would be appropriate for this meeting.

The member noted that the domestic economic slowdown had eased

slightly, led mainly by the improvement in exports of non-IT products, with
stronger-than-expected growth in major countries, while private consumption had
continued its recovery, supported by a solid labor market. However, the member
observed that facilities investment remained sluggish owing to a shrinkage in the
global IT business. The member projected that the domestic economy would
gradually recover its growth momentum, as exports continue to improve in line
with the easing of the IT slump, and as consumption sustains its moderate
growth mainly in services. The member viewed, however, that considerable
uncertainties remained over the growth path, concerning the timing of the IT
business rebound, the pace of any Chinese recovery, major countries’ further
tightening, and the extent of the consequent economic slowdown.

The member noted that inflation still remained high. The member

projected that inflation would rise to around 3% in the second half, although it
had fallen to the upper-2% range in June due to the base-period effect from last
year’s international oil price surge. The member added that core inflation,
reflecting the underlying trend of inflation, was in the mid-3% range,
significantly above the target level. The member cited continuing demand-side
pressures from strong service consumption and the pass through of accumulated
cost increases to prices as the main drivers behind the high increase in personal
service prices at 5%. The member judged that the uncertainties related to the
pace of decline in the underlying inflation trend remained high, although inflation
was likely to slow gradually going forward. In view of the elevated personal
service prices and their persistent nature, the member expected that core inflation
was likely to come down rather slowly, and that it would take considerable time
to be anchored at the target level. In addition, the member noted a concern that


-----

cost side shocks could exert further pressure on core inflation, given the high
uncertainties over international oil price movements and the extent and timing of
public utility fee hikes.

On the financial stability front, the member remarked the need to pay

attention to the potential increase in financial imbalances in the housing market
and household debt. The member pointed out that Korea’s private credit,
including household debt, had continued to grow without undergoing significant
deleveraging, unlike in other major countries, and that its pandemic response
focusing on providing aggressive financial support on top of monetary and fiscal
policy measures, contrary to that seen in other countries, had accelerated private
credit growth. The member viewed that the consequent asset price hikes and
rapid private debt growth had increased financial sector instability and

undermined price stability, which led the BOK to shift its monetary policy stance
toward tightening in 2021. However, the member noted that housing prices had
recently shown signs of a rebound and that household debt had shifted to
positive growth due to deregulation in the real estate sector and due to the drop
in interest rates for home loans, all of which risk ruining the policy
achievements made so far. The member suggested that developments in
household debt growth be monitored closely, given that it could be accelerated
once expectations of a housing price increase are revived.

The member stated that financial markets had been instable with deposits

at the Korea Federation of Community Credit Cooperatives being reduced as
insolvency had partially materialized among real estate financing. The member
noted, however, that strains were easing thanks to favorable soundness of the
overall financial sector, except for some institutions, and to active responses by
the government. The member judged that any spillover effects onto other
institutions or the market would be limited. The member added that the
emergence and resolution of insolvency inherent in the financial markets as the
tightening policy stance continued was a normal adjustment process of the
financial system, and that it was inevitable to maintain system resilience and to
recover the financial intermediary function. The member commented that this
process should be done in an orderly manner so that it would not develop into
a systematic risk.

The member remarked that the rise in inflation was slowing, starting

from this year, but that this was due mainly to the base-period effect, and that
it was still difficult to be confident that the underlying inflation trend would


-----

anchor at the target level. The member also stressed the need to prevent the
rebound in some housing prices and relevant increases in household loans from
once again leading to the expansion of financial imbalances. In conclusion, the
member stated that, in consideration of the above mentioned elements, it would
be necessary to maintain the Base Rate at the current 3.50% at this meeting and
to induce the Korean economy to stabilize macroeconomically as soon as
possible. The member judged that it would be necessary to maintain the current
tightening stance for a considerable time in the conduct of monetary policy,
since more time would still be needed to confirm any downward stability of the
underlying inflation and since the need to respond to any financial imbalances
increased. The member added that in the case of any destabilizing factors to
inflation materializing or of any financial imbalance risks expanding, it would be
necessary to respond actively by raising interest rates further.

Another member also presented the view that it would be appropriate to

keep the Base Rate at its current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.

With regard to the global economy, the member stated that the U.S. had

maintained favorable growth, supported by strong employment and consumption
expenditures based on excess household savings, while China had been losing
momentum across all sectors, from production to consumption, due to the
weaker-than-expected effects of its reopening. The member also commented that
the euro economy had been growing weakly, affected by high inflation and high
interest rates, while Japan had been showing signs of emerging from its
sluggishness that had lasted for the past three decades, boosted by pent-up
consumption and facilities investment growth. The member expected that the
domestic economy would improve in the second half of the year, with the
sluggishness of the semiconductor industry easing somewhat.

Looking at external conditions, the member noted that Korea’s trade

account had shifted to a slight surplus in June for the first time in 16 months,
driven by an increase in exports of automobiles and secondary batteries and a
decrease in imports resulting from a fall in oil prices. The member forecast that,
if the effect of semiconductor cuts starts to show in earnest and if the
semiconductor industry recovers, the decline in exports would slow and external
conditions would improve. The member added that the current account had
shifted to a surplus in May and, based on the BOK’s forecast, it would record a
surplus of 24 billion dollars for the year, led by goods and primary income


-----

account surpluses.

The member noted that private consumption had continued to recover at

a modest pace, led by a favorable employment trend and improved consumer
confidence. The member commented that consumer price inflation had recorded
2.7% in June, entering the 2% range for the first time in 21 months, due to the
base-period effects from last year’s surge in international oil prices, and that core
inflation excluding food and energy had declined to the mid-3% range to stand
at 3.5%, in line with slower growth in personal service charges, but still
remained high. The member stated that uncertainties remained on the future price
path, such as domestic and overseas economic trends, international oil prices, the
won-dollar exchange rate, and adjustments to public utility charges. In terms of
the employment situation, the member mentioned that employment had continued
to slow at a more modest pace than expected, with the number of persons
employed in June increasing by 333,000 year-on-year. The member added that
the number of persons employed in the manufacturing sector had continued to
decline for the sixth consecutive month due to the sluggishness of the
manufacturing industry. Moreover, the number of employed youth aged 15-29 had
also decreased for an eighth consecutive month, while employment of women
and those aged 60 or older had increased, particularly in the services sector.
More specifically, the member pointed out that the number of women employed
increased by 332,000 as of June, accounting for an absolute majority among the
total growth figure of 333,000. The member went on to state that employment
of those aged 60 or higher increased by 343,000, offsetting the decline in youth
employment.

The member noted that the financial market remained generally stable

despite the withdrawal of deposits at the Korean Federation of Community Credit
Cooperatives (KFCC). The member assessed that household debt deleveraging
could be put in jeopardy, given recent data from the Korea Real Estate Board
showing a shift in apartment prices toward an upward trend, and a rise in home
mortgage loans that has led to a shift in bank household lending toward an
increase since April. In particular, the member saw the need for scrupulous
management to prevent market expectations of any DSR deregulation, although
the temporary loosening of DSRs for loans taken out to repay leasehold deposits
was regarded as necessary to stabilize the leasehold deposit market. Given that
the delinquency rate for the banking sector had risen to 0.37% in April, and that
that for real estate project financing (PF) at securities firms and savings banks
had recorded 15.88% and 4.07% as of end-March, respectively, the member


-----

believed that more thorough risk management was needed. The member added
that special attention was required for the Community Credit Cooperatives, which
had recently experienced a bank run, as their delinquency rate had stood at
6.18% on June 29, nearly double their last year-end rate of 3.59%, and whose
internal supervision had been found to be problematic. The member observed
that the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had generally remained stable
at a relatively high level, fluctuating at around 1,300 won per dollar. The
member added that careful management was needed to prevent any rise in
volatility, considering that the all-time high interest rate differential between
Korea and the U.S. could potentially destabilize the exchange rate.

Overall, the member stated that inflation was on a downtrend, but was

expected to remain above the target level for a considerable period of time, and
that the economic slump had been easing somewhat, but had not entered the
recovery phase. The member added that risk still remained in some weak areas,
such as real estate PF, affected by the interest rate hikes enacted so far. The
member presented the view that, in consideration of the above mentioned
economic and financial conditions at home and abroad, it would be necessary to
keep the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.
The member added that the Board should judge whether or not there would be
any need for further rate hikes, while maintaining a tightening stance until it is
fully confident about price stability and while monitoring core inflation trends,
the economic growth path, household debt growth, and monetary policy decisions
in major countries.
