Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation

```
After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments,[2)]_ _FX and International_

_Finance Trends, and_ _Financial Market Trends, the discussions of the Monetary Policy_

Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

Members’ evaluation was that the global economy had started to rebound

moderately from its sluggishness, as economic activity had resumed in major economies.

Members, however, diagnosed uncertainties surrounding the outlook for recovery as

remaining high, as the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19 or a protracted

pandemic had increased. Members assessed that the international financial markets

remained stable overall, influenced for instance by bold responses by individual

countries.

With respect to the domestic economy, members saw that downside risks to growth

had grown compared to the May forecast, as exports and the capacity utilization ratio

still remained sluggish, despite moderate improvements in demand-side conditions, such

as private consumption and facilities investment. One member, in particular, expressed

concern that there was a repeated pattern in which the domestic economy was

excessively reliant on the semiconductor industry. Concerning employment, members’

assessment was that there still was no clear sign of recovery in terms of either quality

or quantity.

Members saw that the low demand-side inflationary pressures stemming from a

continued real economic downturn were ongoing. Members noted that inflation would

remain down in the lower-0% range for some time due to a continued decline of public

service prices amid weakened demand-side inflationary pressures.

Finally, members evaluated that domestic financial markets were gradually

stabilizing, thanks for example to policy rate cuts and various market stabilization

measures. Members, however, pointed out that concerns about financial imbalances had

heightened, as prices of assets such as housing and stocks had risen rapidly of late and

household lending growth had accelerated. Members went on to emphasize the need to

bear in mind the fact that rising asset prices divorced from economic fundamentals

could work to destabilize markets in the future.

Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

```
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the

Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

All members shared the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and

international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the

Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.

One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate

at the current level of 0.50%.

The member assessed that, although lockdown measures had been eased, the

prospects for a bottoming out of the global economy still remained uncertain as the

spread of COVID-19 gathered pace. With respect to the domestic economy, the member

saw that private demand was sluggish despite the expansion of government spending.

The member especially noted that negative growth would be deeper than expected due

to a significant decline in exports. The member assessed that exports in Korea had been

hit hard as the coronavirus shock to global trade was larger than originally forecast,

with geopolitical conflicts also playing a role. Concerning employment, the member’s

evaluation was that, although the number of persons employed had declined by a

smaller margin, the situation remained serious given the number of persons on

temporary leave and the broader unemployment rates. The member also pointed out that,

with consumer price inflation remaining around the 0% range, various underlying price

indicators such as “core inflation excluding administered prices” and “cyclically sensitive

inflation” all remained unusually low in the 0% range.

The member noted that economic and social concerns about overheating asset prices

had increased, as prices of assets such as stocks and housing had risen more rapidly

while the real economy was more sluggish than expected. The member added that as

increased liquidity was allocated to sectors less likely to stimulate production, such as

real estate and leasing, there was concern that the productivity of finance was

decreasing. Against this backdrop, the member saw that there remained aversion to

credit risk in the corporate lending and bond markets, and differentiation based on the

financial situations and credit risks of corporations was continuing. The member’s

assessment was that, contrary to past crises triggered by financial system shocks, the

recent economic conditions caused by COVID-19 were by nature a real economic crisis.

The member thus commented that, even with monetary policy on an accommodative

footing, a significant time gap before the real economy recovered would be unavoidable,

3


-----

and in this process, financial imbalances, including concentration of capital into specific

sectors and build up of debt, were inevitable to some extent.

The member expressed the opinion that, overall, monetary policy should maintain its

current accommodative stance, prioritizing improvements in macro indicators such as

growth, inflation and employment, in response to the wider-than-expected spread of

COVID-19 and domestic and international economic sluggishness. The member added

that it was necessary to use supplementary monetary policy instruments for a more

seamless functioning of financial intermediation, and to make better use of

macroprudential policy related to asset prices. The member thus judged that it was

appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level this month.

Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base

Rate at the current level of 0.50%.

The member noted that contrary to expectations that the COVID-19 pandemic would

ease in the US and other major economies, and their real economies would recover

from the third quarter, new confirmed cases across the world had reached a record high

while lockdowns had not been lifted much. The member voiced concern that, given the

current low global trade growth, it would be hard to expect a rapid recovery of the

global economy, and this would negatively affect the domestic economy. The member

thus saw that the pace of recovery in domestic private consumption and exports would

slow after the second half of this year. The member noted in particular that, since the

expectation for improvements in exports was mainly dependent upon IT sectors

including semiconductors, the past pattern in which economic growth was excessively

reliant on growth in the semiconductor industry was being seen again. The member’s

evaluation was that downside risks to growth in both exports and domestic demand had

increased from the May forecasts, since facilities investment was also mainly dependent

upon investment in the IT sector, and construction investment would likely to continue

to go through its ongoing adjustment for some time. Concerning employment, the

member expressed the view that, although the negative impacts of COVID-19 had been

partially eased, employment had not yet recovered from its sluggishness. The member

noted that, although the government and the Bank of Korea had been taking various

measures to ensure the recovery of the real economy, a failure to properly and swiftly

deal with the liquidity issue in the corporate sector could lead to the more serious

problem of insolvency. The member thus emphasized the need to continue policy efforts

to deal with this in the future as well.

Looking at prices, the member’s assessment was that the sluggishness in the real

economy so far had increased downside pressures on inflation. In other words, the

4


-----

member was of the view that low demand-side inflationary pressures stemming from the

continuation of the negative output gap had been leading to the widening of the

negative inflation gap. The member expected that inflation could remain well below the

target for a considerable time going forward.

The member, meanwhile, evaluated that the domestic and international financial and

foreign exchange markets were gradually regaining stability. The member, however,

emphasized that it was necessary to keep in mind that the financial market trends,

which had been moving apart from the real economy, could actually work to cause

instability if the markets’ positive expectations about the real economy were to shift

rapidly.

The member noted that accommodative financial conditions were having an effect

with respect to rising prices in asset markets, such as stock and real estate markets. The

member, however, presented the opinion that the continuation of the accommodative

monetary policy stance was inevitable in consideration of real economic conditions,

which would remain sluggish for a considerable time. The member noted that issues in

some asset markets should be addressed through bold policy responses by the

government. The member added that the Bank of Korea, together with the government,

had many issues to consider to ensure stability in the financial and foreign exchange

markets. The member saw that, taking all those points into consideration, it was

desirable to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50% this time.

One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate

at the current level of 0.50%.

The member’s assessment was that, looking at recent domestic economic conditions,

even though private consumption was rebounding, a significant decline in exports was

continuing and thus the outlook for the domestic economy was more sluggish than the

May forecast. The member, however, expected that the domestic economy would recover

gradually, as exports would shift to an increase in line with a recovery in the global

economy, although there still were high uncertainties related for example to the

evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic at home and abroad. The member added that the

recovery could be constrained by the risk of structurally lower growth affected by

COVID-19 and by several geopolitical risks such as a rekindling of the US-China trade

dispute. The member also forecast that inflation would likely remain in the lower-0%

range for some time due to a continued decline of public service prices in line with,

for example, the expanded provision of free education, as well as to economic

sluggishness.

The member noted that, right after the COVID-19 pandemic began, the Bank of

5


-----

Korea had actively expanded the degree of monetary accommodation to deal with the

real economic slump and financial market unrest, by making large cuts in the Base Rate

and increasing the supply of liquidity. The member evaluated that, as a result, financial

conditions had improved greatly. The member saw that market interest rates, as well as

deposit and lending rates in the banking sector, had fallen to historic lows; growth in

private-sector credit and market liquidity had sharply accelerated; and stock prices had

recovered to the level seen before the COVID-19 outbreak. The member expected the

transmission of these monetary policy measures to the financial markets to have positive

effects on the real economy after a time gap. The member, however, pointed out that

concern about financial imbalances was increasing with housing prices rising rapidly and

household lending growth expanding again. The member voiced concern that amid the

current ongoing economic sluggishness, if asset prices were overvalued or debt

excessively increased regardless of economic fundamentals, the risk of a sudden

adjustment would increase by the same degree.

The member noted that, in consideration of these economic and financial conditions,

it would be best to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50% this time. The

member saw the need to maintain an accommodative monetary policy since there still

were high uncertainties surrounding the future growth path and downside risks also

existed. The member, however, commented that it was necessary to exercise caution

with respect to any further easing, considering that recent financial conditions marked by

low interest rates and ample liquidity appeared to be sufficient to support the recovery

of the real economy. The member also saw that, given recent housing price increases

and household debt growth, more consideration should be given to financial stability

than in the past in the conduct of monetary policy. The member, meanwhile,

emphasized that the role of the government and the supervisory authorities was very

important for market liquidity to flow into productive sectors and thereby support the

real economic recovery more effectively, in a situation in which maintaining the

accommodative monetary policy stance was unavoidable.

One member meanwhile presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the

Base Rate unchanged from the current level.

The member evaluated that there was ample liquidity in the market as a result of

two Base Rate cuts and various measures to increase liquidity supply since March. The

member’s assessment was that financial markets had generally stabilized, although

sustained demand contractions at home and abroad due to the COVID-19 outbreak had

led to concerns about continued deterioration of corporate profitability and to a delay in

improvement in funding conditions of sub-par companies. The member assessed that the

6


-----

international financial markets had also generally stabilized, in terms for example of

foreign exchange supply and demand conditions. On the other hand, the member argued

that attention should be paid to the increasing factors likely to undermine financial

stability, with household and other private sector credit recently growing rapidly and a

larger amount of floating money continuing to flow into asset markets.

The member stated that the global economy remained highly uncertain with

COVID-19 resuming its rapid spread in major countries, and in this regard, the member

forecast that the sluggishness of Korea’s exports and uncertainty of its real economy

would continue for the time being. The member’s assessment was that consumption and

facilities investment had been recently showing gradual recovery, while exports had

remained lackluster, the manufacturing capacity utilization ratio had remained low and

employment had not shown any clearly marked recovery yet. With these taken into

account, the member mentioned that the growth rate was highly likely to be lower than

the May forecast. The member also anticipated that any substantial inflation pressures

would not be seen for some time.

Taking all this into consideration, the member expressed the view that it would be

appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50% for the intermeeting

period to maintain the accommodative monetary policy stance. The member also argued

that it would be necessary to closely examine the ripple effects of the policy measures

implemented so far while monitoring financial market conditions and the real economic

trend.

Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base

Rate unchanged from the current 0.50%.

Looking at the economic conditions at home and abroad since the previous

monetary policy decision meeting, the member evaluated that the economic shocks from

COVID-19 appeared to have somewhat passed their peak, but uncertainties surrounding

the recovery path seemed to remain high. The member stated that real economic

sluggishness in some major countries including the US, euro-area countries and China

had been somewhat easing recently, but this was a result of the combined effect of a

technical rally in line with a phased resumption of economic activity, recovery of

pent-up demand, and various policy support measures, and it was therefore uncertain

whether this would lead to a substantial economic recovery in the second half. The

member noted that vigilance was needed most of all against the fact that COVID-19,

the main cause of the current global economic slump, was likely to abate later than

originally forecast. The member argued that, although strong lockdown measures were

unlikely to be implemented again, sustained pandemic-related uncertainties and social

7


-----

distancing could limit the degree of consumption recovery considerably, and some

companies might go out of business permanently with structural changes caused by the

pandemic becoming firmly entrenched.

With regard to the domestic economy, the member mentioned that, although real

GDP had recorded further negative growth in the second quarter, demand-side conditions

such as private consumption and facilities investment had been improving gradually,

which provided relatively strong support for expectations of economic recovery in the

second half. However, the member assessed that, considering the fading effects of

income growth from the emergency rescue package and the downward trend of

semiconductor prices, there was a growing probability of economic recovery falling short

of the May forecast in the second half. The member also pointed out that this could

weaken demand-side inflation pressures and increase downside risks to the price path.

As to financial conditions, the member’s evaluation was that, driven mainly by the

Base Rate cuts and various market stabilization measures, financial conditions had

improved significantly, with price variable volatility decreasing and credit risk aversion

easing gradually in capital markets. The member mentioned, however, that the possibility

could not be ruled out of market interest rates rising again or volatility increasing

further, as demand for non-prime corporate bonds was sluggish, credit supply to SMEs

remained lackluster and a crowding-out effect might occur in the course of Treasury

bond issuance to finance the supplementary budget.

The member also noted that the continuing trend of low interest rates at home and

abroad had been strengthening the yield-seeking behavior of economic agents, and in

this regard, the member was alert to the possibility of increased risk of a buildup of

financial imbalances due to the liquidity that had been supplied to support the real

economy. More specifically, the member argued that attention should be paid to possible

excessive flows of market liquidity into high-risk financial assets or real estate in a

domestic financial environment that lacked moderate-risk financial products. The member

noted that, despite a possible virtuous circle of stock or housing price increases leading

to real economic growth through the wealth effect, if the gap between the asset markets

and the real economy widened too much or asset price increases triggered household

debt, this could increase financial vulnerabilities and limit the medium- to long-term

growth path.

In summary, the member stated that it was necessary to maintain accommodative

monetary policy to support the real economy and stabilize inflation expectations, while

market liquidity was concentrating in the short-term end of the market. The member

thus argued that it would be desirable to maintain rather than expand the current degree

of monetary easing and use various policy measures to promote a more effective

8


-----

transmission of financial market liquidity to the real economy. The member also argued

that it would be necessary to remain flexible and balanced in deciding on policy

options, while preparing for a possible prolongation of the pandemic and keeping in

mind that the expansion of the liquidity supply from policy responses to the crisis could

act as a financial vulnerability factor.

One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base

Rate at its current level of 0.50% for the intermeeting period.

The member’s assessment was that, although financial markets had been stabilizing

and the worst had passed for economic indicators thanks to the aggressive responses to

COVID-19 around the world, global economic recovery remained uncertain in line with

the growing possibility of a second wave of the pandemic and its prolongation. The

member also forecast that, due to the delay in the recovery of global trade, the negative

impacts of the pandemic on the domestic economy would last for longer than expected

at the initial stage of the pandemic.

Concerning the domestic economy, the member forecast that the cyclical component

of leading indexes and various sentiment indexes had been showing signs of recovery,

but the economic recovery would be very moderate owing to the sustained emphasis on

social distancing amid concerns about a second wave of the pandemic. In this regard,

the member pointed to the need to maintain the current trend of low interest rates until

the real economy showed a clearly marked recovery.

The member meanwhile expressed the view that the Bank of Korea, which was

maintaining an inflation targeting regime, should keep a close eye on the impacts of

COVID-19 on inflation. More specifically, the member mentioned that the central bank

should note that a slowdown in inflation was more evident outside of the Seoul

metropolitan area than in Seoul and its surrounding areas, suggesting that COVID-19

shocks had differed from region to region. The member pointed out that, although the

growth and employment slumps in regions other than the Seoul metropolitan area had

built up over a long period of time, the COVID-19 pandemic had clearly revealed how

serious these problems were. The member also expressed concerns that the pandemic

was likely to accelerate the trend of the outflow of population from provincial areas

and the inflow of population into Seoul and its surrounding areas, which had slowed

for some time.

In addition, the member presented the view that attention should be paid to the gap

between general inflation and housing prices. The member’s assessment was that the gap

was based on economic agents’ expectations of the trend of low interest rates becoming

firmly entrenched, but was also related with the issue of regional imbalances. The

9


-----

member added that the recent acceleration of growth in apartment sales prices and

leasehold deposit prices was more evident in Seoul and its surrounding areas than the

rest of the country, which implied that housing prices, as well as business conditions

and consumer price inflation, were showing different movements from region to region.

The member expressed the opinion that COVID-19, having broken out in the course

of the domestic economy’s gradual shift to a low-growth environment in line with

demographic changes, was highly likely to strengthen the concentration of population in

the Seoul metropolitan area. In this regard, the member stressed that the possibility of a

worsening of regional imbalances should be taken into consideration in deciding on the

direction of macroeconomic policies and their priorities, and went on to emphasize that

the central bank and other financial authorities should work hard to develop ways to

provide financial support to revitalize regional economies.

The member assessed that since the March interim meeting the domestic financial

and FX markets had stabilized somewhat in the accommodative monetary policy

environment as seen in the two Base Rate cuts and the raised ceiling for the Bank

Intermediated Lending Support Facility. The member took the view that the monetary

easing stance should be maintained for the time being to meet market expectations,

while keeping a careful watch on the effect of the expansionary fiscal policy being

carried out by the government. The member added that in this regard it would be

advisable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current meeting, and if needed, to

increase Treasury bond purchases to promote the stability of overall market interest

rates.

  Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

```
Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy

Decision statement was compiled. All MPB members supported the decision

unanimously.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the

 Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period.

 □ Currently available information suggests that the global economy has started to

 rebound moderately from the sharp contraction, as economic activity gradually

 resumes despite the ongoing spread of COVID-19. In global financial markets,

 risk aversion has subsided on hopes of economic recovery. Stock prices in major

 countries have risen and the US dollar has weakened, while government bond

 yields have fluctuated slightly. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic

 growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the

 evolution of the pandemic, as well as by the effects of national policy responses.

 □ Economic growth in Korea has remained sluggish. Although consumption has

 rebounded with the relaxation of some pandemic-related restrictions on economic

 activity and the government’s stimulus package, exports have continued to

 decline. While the recovery in facilities investment has been subdued, the

 correction in construction investment has continued. Labor market conditions have

 remained weak, with the number of persons employed continuing to decline

 sharply. Looking forward, facilities and construction investment are expected to

 grow at a moderate pace; however, the paces of recovery in consumption and

 exports will be slower than previously forecast. Accordingly, GDP growth this

 year is likely to be lower than the May forecast of -0.2%.

 □ Consumer price inflation recorded around 0%, held down by declining prices of

 petroleum products and public services. Core inflation (excluding changes in food

 and energy prices from the CPI) has also remained at the lower-0% range, and

 the inflation expectations of the general public have stayed at the mid-1% level.

 It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run at the

11


-----

###### lower-0% level this year, reflecting prolonged effects from the drop in global oil

 prices and weak demand-side inflationary pressures.

 □ Domestic financial markets have been generally stable owing to decreased

 volatility in global financial markets. Stock prices have risen and the Korean

 won to US dollar exchange rate has fallen considerably, while long-term market

 interest rates have fluctuated within a narrow range. The increase in household

 loans has expanded materially, and housing prices have generally accelerated in

 all parts of the country.

 □ The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the

 economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a

 medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As economic

 growth is expected to be sluggish and inflationary pressures on the demand-side

 are forecast to remain weak due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board will

 maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will

 thoroughly assess developments related to the pandemic, the impact on the

 economy and financial markets here and abroad, changes in financial stability,

 and the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic.
