Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation

```
After briefings by staff on Recent Economic Developments,[2)] FX and International Finance

Trends, and Financial Market Trends, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members

covered the following areas:

Looking at the global economy, members assessed that due to the continued worldwide spread

of COVID-19, economic activity had contracted significantly and a global economic downturn was

materializing, particularly in major advanced economies. Members saw that the international financial

markets continued to show instability, with volatility in price variables remaining high, although risk

aversion had eased somewhat, thanks to active policy responses of individual countries.

Members pointed out that, due to the influence of COVID-19, private consumption had declined

significantly and difficulties in the service sector were increasing, led by the accommodation & food

service sector and leisure-related industries. Members diagnosed that a continued slowdown in the

production of corporations have been causing a delay in facilities investment, and a contraction in

exports would be unavoidable. Members emphasized that it should be kept in mind that if the

spread of COVID-19 continued for a prolonged period of time, thus causing a sharp decline in the

sales of domestic corporations, financial unrest could intensify and real economic resilience could be

undermined.

With regard to prices, members assessed that consumer price inflation had slowed again after

rebounding early this year, similar to the movement seen in core inflation. Members saw that, going

forward, downside risks to prices would increase further, due to a plunge in international oil prices

and the effects from the government’s measures to stabilize people’s livelihoods.

Finally, in the domestic financial markets, members’ evaluation was that price variables had

become much more volatile, influenced by the worldwide spread of COVID-19 and heightened

volatility in the international financial markets, while the corporate bond market in particular

remained highly averse to credit risk. Members noted that market unrest had recently eased

somewhat, thanks to active response measures by the government and the BOK. Members, however,

emphasized that monitoring of vulnerable sectors should be strengthened further, since there were

high uncertainties related to the future developments of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

```
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea

Base Rate were as follows:

The majority of members presented the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and

international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at

its current level of 0.75%, while two members called for lowering it by 25 basis points.

One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its

current level of 0.75%.

The member evaluated that financial market unrest, stemming from the influence of a financial

shock originating in the US and from a contraction in domestic consumption, was easing to some

extent, thanks to a series of policy measures by the government and the BOK. The member thus

expressed the opinion that it was desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current meeting

and closely watch the effects of the recent 50 basis point Base Rate cut and of the government’s

mix of various policies. The member emphasized the need to prepare for a possible sharp expansion

of a shock originating in the real economy whereby worsened global trade leads to a drop in the

sales of domestic corporations.

Looking at the domestic financial markets, the member’s assessment was that uncertainties had

eased and liquidity had been kept at an appropriate level. The member added that risk-based

differentiation was properly taking place overall, and the credit channel had been operating without

any serious crunch. The member, however, presented the opinion that, since the world economy

could contract significantly until the second half of this year, additional response measures were

needed. The member noted that, if corporate sales declined steeply due to sluggish exports, financial

unrest could expand greatly. The member thus emphasized the need for the BOK to prepare

response measures. The member, however, saw that, unlike during the global financial crisis period,

the current shock had emerged in the real economy and thus it could be difficult to distinguish

liquidity risks from solvency risks. The member thus expressed the opinion that the government

should provide guarantees for solvency risks in advance to allow the central bank to preemptively

respond.

The member noted that, if the contraction in economic activity was expected to spread more

deeply to the entire economy despite various measures by the policy authorities, the policy rate

should be reduced to the lower bound to minimize the debt burden across the entire economy and

to provide funds as needed. Finally, the member emphasized that the best policy to achieve the

inflation target under the current economic conditions was to minimize production capacity losses.

3


-----

The member added that, to this end, every effort should be made to prevent permanent losses in

labor and production capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic period, and consideration should also

be given to the exit strategy based on the experience of advanced economies.

Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its

current 0.75% level at the current meeting.

The member noted that the continued worldwide spread of COVID-19 had significantly

weakened economic activity and severely affected financial conditions. The member saw that risk

aversion in the financial markets had eased somewhat, thanks to recent active policy responses by

individual countries, but the shock to the real economy was increasing further, due to the

implementation of strong quarantine measures, such as lockdowns or business suspensions in major

countries, including the US. Considering the proportion in the world economy of these countries,

the member saw that the global economy was highly likely to have already entered a downturn

phase, and anxiety among economic agents could continue for a considerable time. The member

thus judged uncertainties surrounding the medium- to long-term growth path to be very high.

The member noted that, on the domestic economic front, service and manufacturing production

had decreased sharply in February, and domestic demand, such as consumption and investment, had

also contracted. The member saw that, although exports had shown a relatively gentle correction,

this was mainly due to a time lag between export orders and shipments. The member went on to

expect that the negative impacts on global trade and domestic exports would be amplified greatly in

the second quarter, given that major economies had seen simultaneous downturns since early March.

Accordingly, the member forecast that economic growth for this year would run well below the

February forecast and the inflation gap would widen more than expected.

The member noted that, in the domestic financial markets, the rapid simultaneous weakening of

stock prices, interest rates and exchange rates had eased thanks to various market stabilization

measures, but credit risk aversion in the capital markets continued to be heightened, with CP rates

rising greatly and credit spreads of corporate bonds widening amid a contraction in funding

conditions of the non-banking sector. Meanwhile, with respect to the indirect financial markets

which accounted for a large share of domestic corporate financing, the member assessed that credit

was being supplied smoothly, with bank lending rates falling and interest spreads for lending

remaining stable. The member noted that this market pattern differed somewhat from what was seen

in the US and other major advanced economies. The member, however, commented that prolonged

real economic sluggishness at home and abroad would increase the debt-servicing risk of

corporations, thus leading to worsened asset soundness in the banking sector, and such a risk could

even evolve into systemic risk, depending on the situation. The member thus emphasized the need

to pay attention to this issue.

The member expressed the opinion that the main worry at this point was that it still remained

4


-----

uncertain when the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic would slow significantly. The member

expressed concern that, if the COVID-19 situation continued for a prolonged period of time, and

the consequent contraction in demand at home and abroad lasted even after the first half of this

year, deterioration in corporate profits and cash flows would lead to employment and investment

corrections, closures, and bankruptcies in major industries, thus severely harming the medium- to

long-term growth potential. The member was also concerned that the possibility could not be ruled

out that this would work to cause serious financial instability through a vicious cycle with financial

conditions. The member thus emphasized the need to pursue comprehensive response measures to

deal with various risk factors that could be triggered by a prolongation of the COVID-19 pandemic,

through close coordination with fiscal and financial policy measures, while carrying out monetary

policy flexibly by preparing response measures for various scenarios. The member, however,

expressed the view that, given the large Base Rate cut at the interim Monetary Policy Board

meeting in March and the implementation of several stabilization measures, it would be appropriate

to keep the Base Rate at the current 0.75% at the current meeting and closely monitor changes in

domestic and international economic and financial conditions, as well as the effects of policy

responses so far.

One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current

0.75% level at the current meeting.

The member raised the concern that, although the Base Rate had been cut by 50 basis points

at the March 16 interim meeting to deal with the worldwide spread of COVID-19 earlier in the

month, it later became difficult to identify the severity of the relevant shock, due to a mix of a

real economic crisis and a financial market crisis resulting from the accelerated spread of

COVID-19. The member noted that, with major global institutions and investment banks adjusting

their world economic growth outlooks for this year sharply downward, the real economy and

financial markets in Korea would be inevitably hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. The member

thus judged that there were large downside risks to the BOK’s forecasts for economic growth and

consumer price inflation.

Concerning the domestic economy, the member’s evaluation was that private consumption had

already been declining significantly, and difficulties in service industries, such as the accommodation

& food service sector and leisure-related industries in particular, were increasing. The member added

that a slowdown in the production of domestic corporations was continuing in the manufacturing

sector, while sluggishness in facilities investment and a contraction in the export sector would be

unavoidable.

The member assessed that uncertainties in the international financial markets had heightened

substantially, and in the domestic financial markets, stock prices had fallen sharply and difficulties

had emerged in some short-term financial markets. The member emphasized that, since the credit

5


-----

spreads of corporate bonds had widened due to aversion to credit risk, it was necessary to closely

monitor the relevant developments.

The member noted that, given the continued spread of COVID-19 across the globe, preparations

should be made to deal with a possible prolongation and deepening of difficulties in several

industries, including the airline industry. The member saw that, if the worldwide spread of

COVID-19 slowed and economic activity started to normalize, a rebound in the real economy and

stability in the financial markets would be expected, but it would be difficult to expect a rapid

recovery at an early stage. The member judged that it was important to carry out an active

monetary policy in the current crisis situation, but for now it was also necessary to observe for a

little while longer the effects of the measures taken so far. The member thus expressed the opinion

that it was desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level at this meeting and closely monitor

real economic conditions and financial market trends in the future.

Meanwhile, the member noted that, since the recent credit crunch in some financial markets

looked to be a liquidity supply issue, rather than an interest level issue, responses were urgently

required. The member also added that, given that the Base Rate was already approaching the

effective lower bound, preparations to use non-traditional monetary policy tools should be made

without delay. Finally, the member emphasized that, since difficulties in the real economy and the

financial markets were expected for a considerable time, the BOK should continue to play an active

role in preventing financial market unrest from spreading, by ensuring proper functioning of

financial intermediation, while maintaining stability in the foreign exchange markets.

One member expressed the opinion that it was appropriate to lower the Base Rate from the

current 0.75% to 0.50%.

The member’s assessment was that, due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak, economic activities

had contracted drastically and financial market volatility had increased significantly, and there was

high uncertainty as to the future trajectory of the pandemic. The member mentioned that, if the

current situation continued longer than expected, the resilience of the real economy could be

undermined and Korea’s already low underlying inflation could decline even further, raising

concerns about deflation risk. The member argued that the current situation in this regard required

aggressive measures by the monetary and fiscal authorities and that monetary policy, which is more

flexible than fiscal policy, should be operated in a more prompt manner to cope with the

emergency.

The member noted that, given that the central bank’s monetary policy is aimed at seeking

stability of the market as a whole, rather than supporting troubled financial institutions or businesses

on an individual basis, a rate cut would be the necessary policy measure under the current situation

to stimulate the economy comprehensively and expand the supply of liquidity. The member

evaluated that, unlike most advanced countries whose policy rates had been already lowered to the

6


-----

0 to 0.25% range, Korea still had the capacity for further rate cuts. The member also emphasized

that a Base Rate cut would reduce incentives for massive liquidity, currently remaining within the

banking sector due to investors’ excessive risk aversion and strong preference for cash, to flow

back to the BOK, serving as a starting point to ease the credit crunch in the financial markets and

help the impacts of monetary policy spread to the real economy. The member added that sufficient

Base Rate cuts were a precondition for quantitative easing policy.

The member mentioned that, given the recent uncertain economic conditions, it was important

to prepare for a situation where credit market instability undermines effective monetary policy

transmission and triggers financial market unrest. In this regard, the member expressed the view that

it would be desirable to expand the central bank’s recent decision to buy short-term bonds in repo

auctions in an unlimited amount. The member also pointed to the need to positively consider

buying prime corporate bonds and CP to prepare against the possibility of an excessive financial

market crunch due to the real economic slump. In this case, however, the member argued that

applying relevant credit spreads is essential in order to prevent moral hazard and minimize the risk

of losses by the note-issuing authority, and to this end, the government’s cooperation and the

National Assembly’s approval were important when the BOK took on credit risks. Finally, the

member took the view that the BOK’s loans to for-profit businesses should be limited to

exceptional cases based on the MPB’s judgment that the crisis faced by these businesses was not a

solvency crisis but rather a temporary liquidity crisis, which would not be resolved for the entire

financial markets as well as for the businesses concerned unless lending occurred. The member

added that the MPB does not appear authorized to determine whether to support specific for-profit

businesses with uncertain medium- to long-term debt servicing capacities.

Considering the above-mentioned matters, the member argued that it would be appropriate to

lower the Base Rate to 0.50% this time. The member added that in the event of a further

economic slump the logically consistent policy mix would be, in order: further reducing the Base

Rate, ensuring market interest rate stability through government bond purchases, and buying

corporate bonds.

Another member stated that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of

0.75% for the intermeeting period.

The member assessed that, with the recent global spread of COVID-19, a global economic

slump was becoming apparent, particularly in major advanced countries. The member noted that,

although countries were strengthening their disease-control efforts and taking strong economic

stimulus measures in terms of fiscal, monetary and financial policies, the potential economic

recession was said to be more serious than during the global financial crisis.

The member forecast that domestic economic growth would be dampened significantly by

COVID-19, with production and retail sales declining and facilities investment delayed. The member

7


-----

however expressed the view that, considering that the number of confirmed cases in Korea had

been growing at a slower pace recently and that the services sector, hit hard by the virus outbreak,

accounted for a smaller part of the domestic economy than in major advanced countries, the

economic slump would be less serious in Korea than in other countries. The member nonetheless

expressed concerns that a prolongation of major countries’ economic slumps could affect Korea

significantly, considering the high uncertainty about the future trajectory of the virus outbreak and

Korea’s high dependence on external trade.

As to inflation, meanwhile, the member forecast that downward inflation pressures would

increase further, due to sluggish demand, international oil price declines and the effects of the

government measures to promote the stability of people’s livelihoods. The member noted that, in the

domestic and overseas financial markets, the volatility of price variables had increased significantly

owing to the virus outbreak, while risk-off sentiment had strengthened in line with heightened credit

risk aversion. The member added that, although market instability had been somewhat easing

recently, substantial risk factors remained, particularly in the credit markets.

The member mentioned that, considering these growth, inflation and financial conditions, it

would be necessary to expand the degree of monetary easing in order to reduce downside risks to

the macroeconomy and promote financial market stability. The member added however that the

BOK had lowered the Base Rate by 50 basis points to a record low level of 0.75% at the interim

meeting in March and following this had been providing a massive amount of liquidity by

conducting repo auctions to supply an unlimited amount of liquidity at set interest rates. The

member added that it should be taken into consideration that the current level of the Base Rate left

only limited room for further rate cuts. The member expressed the view that, in this regard, it

would be advisable to keep the Base Rate unchanged for the intermeeting period and monitor the

ripple effects of the various fiscal, monetary and financial policy measures implemented so far, and

to carefully consider the timing of an additional rate cut to maximize its effectiveness. The member

emphasized, however, that the central bank should consider all possible monetary policy tools and

seek appropriate measures within the range of authority delegated to it, if needed to ensure stability

of the macroeconomy and financial system in line with future changes in domestic and external

conditions.

Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to adjust the Base Rate

downward by 25 basis points to 0.50%.

The member’s assessment was that the global economy was on an unprecedented path, as

COVID-19 had recently worsened to become a global pandemic. The member evaluated that the

domestic economy was affected significantly through two channels: shrinking domestic demand

resulting from social distancing, and the negative shock from the de facto suspension of economic

activity in major advanced countries. The member stated that it was the first time in the history of

8


-----

the market economy for a natural disaster to have an impact on countries around the globe all at

the same time, and went on to express concerns about the high uncertainties regarding the depth of

the shock and future path of the global economy.

The member noted that two main scenarios could be mapped out concerning the future path of

the domestic economy: a positive scenario in which the spread of the virus was contained not only

in Korea but also in major advanced countries from the second quarter, and the global economy

consequently rebounded rapidly in the second half of the year; and a scenario in which the spread

of the virus was not curbed as soon as originally expected, causing an increase in the cost of

coping with the crisis, leading to a structural weakening of major economies and pulling down the

potential global economic growth rate. The member evaluated that it would be proper to expect the

global economy to rebound from the second half of the year, given that natural disasters had

usually developed in line with the positive scenario. The member however expressed concerns that

the possibility of the second scenario could not be ruled out, considering that the current virus

outbreak affected the whole world and advanced countries in particular, and that it was the first

virus pandemic. The member in this regard emphasized that, in addition to normal monetary policy

responses in pursuit of price and macroeconomic stability, the central bank should also draw up

response plans for crisis management to keep the financial system functioning in case of emergency.

The member expected that, looking at the real economy prior to determining the direction of

monetary policy, the domestic economy would exhibit much slower growth of 0% at the highest

this year, even under the positive scenario forecasting a rebound in the second half. The member

stated that Korea’s output gap had been substantially negative last year due to the sluggishness of

global trade, and went on to forecast that this year the domestic economy would see the largest

negative output gap since 2000. The member’s assessment was that, considering the domestic

economic growth trend, from a historical perspective the current real economic sluggishness could

be seen as an economic crisis, and expressed concerns that aggregate demand might show an

unusual decrease and a substantial number of businesses and small business owners might be

exposed to a liquidity crisis owing to a drastic sales plunge.

Looking at inflation, the member noted that consumer price inflation had rebounded in January

this year and then had been slowing again, and expected that both annual consumer price inflation

and core inflation would be unlikely to exceed the lower-0% level, with the output gap forecast to

be substantially negative this year. The member pointed out that the problem was that core inflation

would continue to decline for a long period of time and that inflation expectations were highly

likely to decline accordingly this year. The member mentioned that past declines in inflation had

been mainly attributable to goods prices while service charges had shown relatively modest

decreases, but this year service charges had been leading the decline in inflation. In this regard, the

member expressed concerns that the fall in service charges, which was closely related with the

livelihood of economic agents, could act as a larger shock causing inflation expectations to decline.

9


-----

The member added that if an economic emergency led to a wage decrease, there was no small

likelihood of downward wage rigidity weakening and the inflation trend entering a new phase.

In summary, the member stated that there was a risk of a temporary liquidity crisis due to an

excessive economic slump and, in terms of inflation, there were concerns about inflation

expectations declining and the inflation trend entering a new phase, and went on to argue that it

would be appropriate in this regard to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 0.50%.

Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

```
Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision

statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.

However, Dr. Cho and Dr. Shin expressed clear opposition to keeping the Base Rate at the

current level of 0.75% and argued for cutting it by 0.25 percentage points.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate

 unchanged at 0.75% for the intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economy has

 contracted significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Volatility in global financial

 markets has increased sharply. Stock prices in major countries have fallen considerably

 while government bond yields and exchange rates have fluctuated widely, due to concerns

 of a recession and the sharp drop in global oil prices. Looking ahead, the Board sees

 global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the

 pathway of the pandemic, as well as by national policy responses and their effects.

 □ The Board judges that economic growth in Korea has slowed considerably. Consumption has

 decreased substantially and the recovery in facilities investment has been subdued. The

 correction in construction investment has continued while exports have declined slightly. As

 for employment, the number of persons employed had continued to rise at a high rate until

 February, but the number of persons on temporary leave has increased due to the

 contraction in economic activity. GDP growth is projected to fall considerably below the

 February forecast of 2.1%, and uncertainties around the future path of GDP growth are also

 judged to be very high.

 □ Consumer price inflation has slowed to the 1% level due to slower growth in the prices of

 industrial products. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the

 CPI) has moved down slightly within the mid-0% range, and the inflation expectations of

 the general public have remained at the upper-1% level. It is forecast that consumer price

11


-----

###### inflation and core inflation will run considerably below the February projection (1.0% and

 0.7%, respectively) due to the drop in global oil prices and weakening demand-side

 inflationary pressure.

 □ In domestic financial markets, stock prices have fallen sharply due to the spread of

 COVID-19 and heightened volatility in global financial markets. The Korean won to US

 dollar exchange rate rose steeply but then decreased after the establishment of a currency

 swap arrangement with the Federal Reserve, while long-term market interest rates have

 fluctuated around the lower-1% level. The rate of household loan growth has risen, while

 the rate of increase in housing prices has moderated since mid-March.

 □ The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of

 economic growth is sustained and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target

 level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. In view of

 the mounting economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board will conduct monetary

 policy in an accommodative manner in order to mitigate downside risks to the economy and

 ease volatility in financial markets. In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree

 of monetary policy accommodation, while thoroughly assessing the severity of the COVID-19

 outbreak, its impact on the domestic economy and financial markets, and changes in

 financial stability.
