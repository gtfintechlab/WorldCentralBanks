Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation

After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook (August 2020),[2)]_ _FX and International_

_Finance Trends, and_ _Financial Market Trends, the discussions of the Monetary Policy_

Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

Members agreed that, since economic recovery is forecast to be delayed due to the

resurgence of COVID-19 at home and abroad, it would be necessary to maintain the

current accommodative monetary policy to support the real economy and help stabilize

inflation expectations.

With respect to the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that the growth

rate was highly likely to decline significantly this year due to the resurgence of

COVID-19, while downside risks to the growth path were high. By sector, members

forecast private consumption to remain sluggish, affected mainly by a strengthening of

social-distancing measures, and exports to exhibit a more modest recovery than

originally expected due to the resurgence of COVID-19 in major countries and a delay

in the recovery of the semiconductor industry. Members also expressed concerns that the

structural vulnerabilities of the domestic economy could deteriorate with human capital

being undermined by the prolonged employment sluggishness and income distribution

worsening.

Members saw that, despite the rebound in global oil prices and the rise in

agricultural product prices, inflation would remain low for the time being owing to the

weakening of demand-side inflationary pressures. One member pointed to the possibility

that inflationary pressures were being underestimated, since housing price rises and

imputed rents were not properly reflected in consumer price inflation.

Members meanwhile pointed out that, although domestic and overseas financial and

FX markets remained stable overall, it would be necessary to remain on the alert

against the possibility of the accumulation of financial imbalances. Members expressed

particular concerns about the possibility of the recent rapid increase in household

unsecured loans leading to growth in leveraged investment in asset markets. In this

regard, some members pointed to the need to examine the effectiveness of unsecured

loan regulations. Some other members argued that it would be necessary to pay

attention to the sustained strong M2 growth, particularly in the corporate sector, and

closely monitor its relationship with the housing market. Finally, most members

emphasized that attention should be paid to the possibility of a sudden worsening of

funding conditions for SMEs if the pandemic persisted for a long time.

Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the

Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

All members shared the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and

international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the

Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.

One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate

at the current level of 0.50%.

The member forecast that, with the strengthening of social-distancing measures

following the resurgence of COVID-19, economic recovery would slow and consumption

in particular would shrink. The member also expected that, although the sluggishness of

exports had been easing from the second half of this year, the pace of improvement in

exports would be modest due to the continued spread of the virus in major countries.

The member above all pointed out that demand for semiconductors, one of Korea’s

major export items, had been slowing recently. The member however forecast that

facilities investment and intellectual property product investment would remain relatively

favorable.

The member expressed concerns that the recent resurgence of COVID-19 would

have negative impacts on labor demand. The member mentioned that, despite the

gradual decline in the number of workers on temporary leave, the possibility could not

be ruled out of a reversal in this trend. In particular, the member’s evaluation was that

the COVID-19 outbreak had led to a slump in low- and middle-skilled face-to-face

services industries, accelerating structural changes in income distribution and the labor

market. The member went on to state that this could be supported by the sharp

year-on-year decline in earned income and the worsening of earned income inequality

seen in Statistics Korea’s household income and expenditure survey for the second

quarter of 2020. The member expressed the view that in light of this it would be

appropriate to maintain and extend government policy measures to ensure employment

retention and income compensation, even if additional fiscal expenditure was required.

The member meanwhile noted that the business climate for SMEs had not shown

substantial improvement. The member assessed that their production and capacity

utilization ratio seemed to have been recovering since June and July, but due to the

resurgence of COVID-19 they were unlikely to emerge from their sluggishness. The

member stressed that, since a prolonged spread of COVID-19 increased the possibility

4


-----

of SMEs showing poorer performances and having more difficulty in raising funds, it

would be desirable for the Korean government and the Bank of Korea to maintain and

extend the current financial support measures.

Taking all this into consideration, the member took the view that, since anxiety and

contracted market confidence were likely to continue negatively affecting the domestic

economy for a considerable period of time, it would be appropriate to keep the Base

Rate at its current level while using monetary policy tools other than rate decisions to

respond to the possible cycle of contraction in the overall economy in which a decrease

in one sector leads to a decline in another.

Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base

Rate at the current level of 0.50%.

The member evaluated that the domestic economy had exhibited a

slower-than-expected recovery since the July meeting as recoveries in private

consumption and facilities investment had been delayed, due mainly to the weakening of

the effects of government policy measures and to limited economic activities during the

rainy season. The member expected that, in the event of expanded and continued social

distancing in line with the rapid resurgence of COVID-19 at home and abroad since

mid-August, Korea’s exports and consumption would suffer large negative impacts. With

regard to inflation, the member’s anticipation was that, although demand-side inflation

pressures would be weak, consumer price inflation would slightly exceed the Bank of

Korea’s previous projection this year, with agricultural product prices rising following

heavy rains.

The member assessed the financial and FX markets as having remained stable

overall, despite the sluggish economic trend and the resurgence of COVID-19. The

member also mentioned that corporate financing had been generally favorable and

growth in household loans, particularly unsecured ones, had accelerated again. The

member took the view that the recent stable trends of the financial and FX markets had

been attributable substantially to the Bank of Korea’s aggressive use of various policy

tools, such as reducing the Base Rate significantly, expanding the liquidity supply, and

concluding a currency swap agreement with the US Federal Reserve, to respond to the

spread of COVID-19. The member’s evaluation was that, although this had led to

growing concerns about the accumulation of financial imbalances such as the rapid

growth in household debt and the over-concentration of capital in the housing market, it

also had undoubtedly helped improve the funding conditions of economic agents and

facilitate credit flows in general to prevent the real economy from contracting

excessively during the COVID-19 crisis.

The member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the Base

Rate at its current level at this meeting and take more time to observe future

developments of COVID-19 and economic trends. The member went on to state that

this was because the financial and FX markets were relatively stable, credit flows were

favorable overall, and the sluggishness of the domestic economy was expected to ease

at a modest pace going forward. The member emphasized that, considering the extreme

uncertainty concerning the future growth path in line with pandemic-related

developments, it would be necessary to monitor more closely changes in financial and

economic conditions and conduct monetary policy prudently.

The member argued that it would be desirable to maintain the accommodative

monetary policy stance until it appeared that the impacts of COVID-19 were weakening

and the domestic economic recovery was back on track. The member however added

that particular attention should be paid to the risk of financial imbalances that might

occur due to the prolongation of the accommodative policy stance. The member

meanwhile argued that, if COVID-19 spread more excessively than expected, this could

lead to an increase in credit risks for SMEs and to a recurrence of financial and FX

market instability, and went on to stress the need to further strengthen related

monitoring and adjust emergency measures.

One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate

at the current level of 0.50%.

The member’s evaluation was that the global economy, and the US and Chinese

economies in particular, had been exhibiting a modest recovery since the July meeting,

but the European and Japanese economies had continued to undergo difficulties. The

member expressed concerns, in particular, that signs of a resurgence of COVID-19 in

European and other major countries might delay global economic recovery.

Looking at the domestic economy, the sluggishness of exports and consumption

seemed to have been easing somewhat since the second quarter, but their outlooks had

become substantially uncertain. More specifically, the member forecast that private

consumption, which had been picking up since the second quarter, was likely to be

more sluggish than expected, despite the government’s various support measures, due

mainly to delayed improvement in household income and consumer sentiment following

the resurgence of COVID-19. With regard to exports, the member pointed out that

exports were unlikely to achieve recovery as originally forecast, affected largely by the

resurgence of COVID-19 in major countries and a delay in the recovery of the

semiconductor industry. The member, however, evaluated that facilities investment was

favorable, boosted by strong IT-sector investment which more than offset a correction in

6


-----

non-IT sector investment, and that construction investment, although currently going

through a correction, was also likely to face upside risk to growth, following repairs of

damages from heavy rainfalls.

In terms of employment, the member noted that, although the decline in the number

of the employed had been slowing gradually, employment remained sluggish in the

manufacturing and construction industries. The member argued that it would take time

for workers on temporary leave, whose number had increased dramatically since the

COVID-19 outbreak, to return to their jobs, and a substantial part of these workers

were likely to fall into a state of unemployment. The member thus stated that related

monitoring was required in this regard. Concerning inflation, the member expected

consumer price inflation to remain within the lower-0% range and core inflation also to

remain low, even when inflation pressures following heavy rains were counted in.

The member mentioned that, as shown by the fact that the Research Department

suggested both positive and negative scenarios in addition to the basic one when

making a large downward adjustment to the original domestic economic growth forecast

for this year, future economic conditions would vary depending on the severity of the

COVID-19 resurgence. The member expressed the view that, with the negative output

gap widening and the large inflation gap continuing, the current accommodative

monetary policy stance should be maintained to support a swift recovery of the real

economy.

The member meanwhile expressed concerns that, although the global financial

markets and the domestic FX and financial markets had been stable, the

over-concentration of capital in asset markets had been witnessed in Korea as well as

the US and other major countries. More specifically, the member argued that attention

should be paid to the fact that household debt had continued to grow despite the

government’s stronger macroprudential policy, and that growth in household unsecured

debt in particular had been recently leading to leveraged investment in the stock and

real estate markets. The member emphasized that in this regard it would be necessary

to keep a close watch on asset market trends and steadily draw up measures for

encouraging capital flows into productive sectors so that accommodative monetary policy

could support real economic recovery.

The member saw that, taking all those points into consideration, it was desirable to

maintain the Base Rate at the current level this time.

Meanwhile, one member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the

Base Rate unchanged from the current 0.50%.

Looking at economic conditions since the Monetary Policy Board meeting on July

16, the member noted that the world economy was emerging from a severe economic

7


-----

downturn, thanks to eased sluggishness particularly in the consumption of major

countries. The member, however, added that uncertainties surrounding the future

recovery path remained high, due to the ongoing global spread of COVID-19 and the

continued trade-off between economic activity and the degree of disease control. The

member noted that, concerning the domestic economy, expectations for economic

recovery had increased, as domestic and international demand conditions showed signs

of improvement. The member, however, assessed that the growth trend in the second

half of this year was being significantly constrained by the rapid resurgence of

COVID-19 recently and the increased negative impacts of natural disasters. The member

presented the opinion that, although the Bank of Korea Research Department had

revised the economic outlook downward in reflection of those points, there could be

additional downside risks due to high uncertainties. The member thus added that there

would be a need to support the real economy and stabilize inflation expectations by

implementing an accommodative monetary policy for some time.

Meanwhile, with respect to the need for additional policy responses, the member

noted that the following points were being considered. The member stated that, despite

concern about the resurgence of COVID-19, the degree of financial easing was steadily

expanding thanks to improvement in domestic and international financial conditions,

which stood in clear contrast with what had been seen during the first wave of the

virus. The member judged that, looking at recent movements of major liquidity indices

and credit growth for reference, liquidity in the financial market was sufficient to

support the real economy. The member, however, commented that volatility in the bond

market could become greater due to a crowding-out effect stemming from increased

government bond issuance, and domestic and international financial conditions could

tighten again owing to a broad resurgence of COVID-19. The member thus pointed out

the need for ongoing monitoring.

Next, the member expected domestic consumption and services industries to contract

sharply for some time, due to stronger disease control measures. The member, however,

saw that, judging from external economic conditions, exports and the manufacturing

sector would show a trend of improvement, albeit a moderate one. The member

expressed the opinion that the economic shock stemming from the resurgence of

COVID-19 might be concentrated mainly on consumption related to face-to-face services

rather than the entire macroeconomy, given that facilities investment was usually closely

related to the trend of exports, not consumption.

Finally, the member noted that a major cause of the contraction in consumption

stemming from the resurgence of COVID-19 lay in stronger disease control measures

such as social distancing. The member thus presented the opinion that it would be

8


-----

desirable to place the focus of monetary policy on minimizing the worsening of cash

flows of corporations and households that have suffered damage, not on boosting

consumption. The member also pointed out the need to consider the possibility that the

liquidity problems of afflicted corporations could gradually develop into solvency risks

due to the prolongation of the pandemic. The member thus took the view that a more

effective way to buffer against downside risks to the growth path in the medium to

long term would be utilizing policy programs that can directly and selectively support

specific sectors, rather than expanding the degree of monetary policy accommodation

through Base Rate adjustments.

The member saw that, taking all those points into consideration, it would be

appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50% this time.

Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base

Rate at the current level of 0.50%.

The member’s evaluation was that domestic and international economic conditions

had shown signs of improvement since the Monetary Policy Board meeting on July 16

but were worsening again. The member assessed that, although the degree of global

economic slowdown was improving somewhat, thanks to the easing of restrictions on

economic activity, uncertainties and downside risks had become even greater on

expectations of a further prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. The member also saw that

contrary to original expectations that the domestic economy would not contract to a

large degree, bolstered by relatively successful initial disease control and the Chinese

economic recovery, the negative shocks would expand due to

more-sluggish-than-expected global growth and the domestic resurgence of COVID-19.

More importantly, the member assessed that the global trade slump’s direct impacts on

our exports were unavoidable, that private consumption was continuing to decline

significantly, and that recovery momentum in the investment sector was weak.

The member forecast that the growth rate for this year would be below –1% for

the third time, following the oil shock in 1980 and the Asian currency crisis in 1998,

as the domestic economy recorded sharply negative growth in the second quarter and

the future growth path had been adjusted downward. The member raised the concern

that, against this backdrop, there was a greater risk of the economic structure becoming

more vulnerable, due for example to the worsening of income distribution and erosion

of human capital following a significant decline in employment. The member pointed

out that, on the inflation side, demand-side pressures still remained weak, although the

decline in inflation expectations had fortunately moderated.

The member’s assessment was that, while the downside risks to the real economy

9


-----

had increased, the domestic financial market remained stable overall, and upside risks to

some asset prices remained. The member noted that market interest rates and the

exchange rate had fluctuated within a narrow range and foreign currency funding

conditions also remained stable, thanks to the bold policy responses so far, despite the

resurgence of COVID-19 of late. The member, however, saw that capital continued to

flow into asset markets, such as the stock and real estate markets, and asset prices were

still rising rapidly. The member thus pointed out that there remained economic and

social concerns in this regard.

The member voiced concern that, as both corporate and household sector debt

increased rapidly, the risk of default in some vulnerable sectors could emerge and the

increased debt servicing burden could weigh on the economic recovery with a time gap.

The member, meanwhile, noted that there would be a need to expand selective financial

support, since vigilance against low-credit companies still remained and economic

activity could worsen further, despite growth in market liquidity.

The member expressed the opinion that, although further worsening of the real

economy was expected, monetary policy should maintain the current accommodative

level, while strengthening its cooperative relationship with various policy instruments, in

overall consideration of the continued gap between the real economy and financial

conditions, and significant deviations even within financial sectors. The member

emphasized that it was important to stabilize the expectations for asset prices by making

better use of related macroprudential policy measures and inducing the expansion of the

supply base in the long term. At the same time, the member presented the view that it

would also be necessary to actively utilize supplementary monetary policy instruments to

ensure a more seamless functioning of financial intermediation. The member also added

that, on the fiscal side, the Bank should actively set forth its views to ensure that the

expansion of the fiscal burden would dynamically lead to a virtuous cycle of growth

and distribution, while creating a favorable environment for fiscal expansion through low

interest rates and purchases of Treasury bonds.

One other member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base

Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.

The member evaluated that manufacturing production and the capacity utilization

rate had increased, due to partial recovery in the world economy and a narrowing of

the export decline, while services production had also sustained a modest recovery. The

member, however, assessed that the recovery in private consumption had been sluggish

since the beginning of July, due mainly to the rainy season and the scaled back

individual consumption tax cut, as well as to the effect of reduced household transfer

10


-----

income. The member’s assessment was that inflation had somewhat increased of late,

due to rising agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices stemming from the rainy

season and heavy rainfall, while inflationary pressures still appeared low.

The member, meanwhile, assessed that the domestic and international financial

markets remained stable thanks to the various measures taken by the authorities of

major countries and the Bank of Korea to date to increase the supply of liquidity. The

member saw that foreign exchange supply and demand conditions also maintained stable

movements. The member noted that the funding of domestic corporations was smooth,

and corporate and household lending were continuing to increase substantially overall.

The member, however, added that there was concern about inflows of abundant market

liquidity into asset markets and the subsequent ongoing rises in stock and real estate

prices.

The member’s evaluation was that there remained high uncertainties surrounding the

future domestic and international growth paths due to the ongoing global spread of

COVID-19, despite partial recoveries in economic conditions at home and in major

countries of late. The member voiced particular concern about an increased possibility

that consumption, production and investment could contract again and the economic

recovery could be delayed, following the recent accelerated spread of COVID-19 and

stronger social distancing rules.

Taking all this into consideration, the member expressed the view that it would be

necessary to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy stance and it would

be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.

The member noted that, under the current domestic and international economic

conditions, maintaining the current accommodative stance was inevitable, and this stance

would have to be sustained for some time. The member, however, emphasized that it

would be necessary to keep a close and careful watch on the potential for this stance

to undermine financial stability in the future, as well as on the effects of sustained

accommodative monetary policy on domestic asset markets.

Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy

Decision statement was compiled. All MPB members supported the decision

unanimously.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the

 Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period.

 □ Currently available information suggests that the global economy has continued

 to rebound from the severe contraction, but the pace of recovery has somewhat

 slowed due to the ongoing spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). In global

 financial markets, stock prices in major countries have risen amid continuing

 hopes for economic recovery, while the US dollar has weakened and government

 bond yields have moved up slightly. Looking ahead, the Board sees global

 economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by

 the evolution of the pandemic, as well as by the effects of national policy

 responses.

 □ Economic growth in Korea has remained sluggish. Although the decline in

 exports has moderated a bit, the improvement in private consumption has

 weakened. The recovery in facilities investment has been subdued, and the

 correction in construction investment has continued. Labor market conditions

 have remained weak, with the number of persons employed continuing to

 decline sharply. Looking forward, the recovery of domestic economic growth is

 likely to be slower than previously forecast, largely due to the domestic

 resurgence of COVID-19. In the Board’s central projection, GDP growth falls to

 slightly below -1% this year, considerably lower than the May forecast of

 -0.2%. Uncertainties around the future path of GDP growth are also judged to

 be very high.

 □ Consumer price inflation has risen to the lower-0% level, due to a larger

 increase in the prices of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products and to a

 reduced decline in petroleum product prices. Core inflation (excluding changes in

 food and energy prices from the CPI) has also increased to the mid-0% level,

12


-----

###### and the inflation expectations of the general public have risen to the upper-1%

 range. It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run at

 the mid-0% level this year, reflecting prolonged effects from the drop in global

 oil prices and weak demand-side inflationary pressures.

 □ Domestic financial markets have been generally stable owing to decreased

 volatility in global financial markets. The Korean won to US dollar exchange

 rate has fallen, while long-term market interest rates have fluctuated within a

 narrow range. Stock prices rose sharply but then reversed some of the earlier

 gains, mainly due to concerns about the coronavirus resurgence since

 mid-August. The rate of household loan growth has risen, and housing prices

 have continued to increase in all parts of the country.

 □ The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the

 economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a

 medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As economic

 growth is expected to be sluggish and inflationary pressures on the demand side

 are forecast to remain weak due to the COVID19 pandemic, the Board will

 maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will

 thoroughly assess the severity of the coronavirus resurgence and its impact on

 the economy and financial markets, changes in financial stability, and the effects

 of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic.
