Ⅱ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

```
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea

Base Rate were as follows:

The majority of members presented the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and

international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate by

50 basis points, while one member argued for a 25 basis point cut.

One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to lower the Base Rate from the

current 1.25% to 0.75%.

The member evaluated that there had been a significant change in the domestic and

international financial and economic environments since the February meeting. The member pointed

out that the rapid nationwide and international spread of COVID-19 had contracted economic

activities tremendously and heightened volatility in the financial and commodity markets. The

member expressed concerns that the possibility could not be ruled out of an extreme situation

where the contraction in economic sentiment led to a vicious circle between the real economy and

financial markets, undermining financial system stability just as during the global financial crisis.

The member noted that this perception of the current situation was a reason for holding today’s

interim meeting and argued that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate from the current 1.25%

to 0.75%.

The member stated that major central banks had recently been strengthening their

accommodative monetary policy stances through rate cuts and quantitative easing policies, while the

Korean government and the National Assembly were also compiling a supplementary budget. In this

regard, the member went on to assess that the central bank’s Base Rate cut would be significant in

terms of international monetary policy cooperation and also in terms of the coordination of

monetary and fiscal policy. The member mentioned that, if the central bank lowered the Base Rate

to a record-low in the 0% range, this would have the positive impact of boosting the real economy,

including growth and inflation, by reducing borrowing costs for households and businesses. The

member went on to state that, at the same time, however, this could add to the negative side

effects of low interest rates in financial stability terms, such as an over-concentration of capital in

the housing market or a possible outflow of foreigners’ investment funds, which had been of

concern to the MPB. The member took the view that, in light of this, it was essential to have a

mix of macroprudential and tax policies that would more firmly ensure stability of the housing

market and foreigners’ capital flows.

Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate by 50

basis points from the current 1.25% to 0.75%.

The member assessed that COVID-19 was spreading worldwide at a faster-than-expected pace

and its future trajectory had become extremely uncertain. The member pointed out that the priority

should be placed upon aggressive disease control and sufficient financial support for the sudden

surge in disease control activities. The member added that aggressive financial support was also

needed for businesses and vulnerable groups experiencing a temporary crisis triggered by an

unexpected shock.

On the other hand, the member evaluated the current real economic and financial market

conditions as indicating that problems were spreading beyond the sectors directly exposed to

COVID-19 to the entire economy. The member expressed concerns that global mobility restriction,

as long as it continued, would inevitably exert a negative supply-side shock and that the global

economic downturn was causing export demand to decline. The member went on to state that a

vicious circle had been created in which worsening economic sentiment had been triggering

instability in the financial markets as a whole, again contracting domestic demand and leading to a

real economic slump. In other words, the member’s assessment was that COVID-19 was not only

having impacts at the micro and sectoral levels but also developing into macroeconomic and

aggregate demand shocks. The member also pointed out that, if this contraction in aggregate

demand lasted for a longer period of time, Korea’s already low underlying inflation would decline

even further and add to concerns about deflation risk.

The member argued in this regard that an aggressive response was required through the

concerted efforts of both the financial authorities taking microeconomic measures and the monetary

authorities responsible for macroeconomic policies. The member expected that, although a Base Rate

cut was unlikely to ease mobility restriction and thus boost consumption and investment directly, it

would help reduce the burden of troubled households and businesses and curb the spread of

financial market unrest, consequently easing the vicious circle of economic downturn through the

aggregate demand channel.

With all this taken into consideration, the member took the view that it would be appropriate

to lower the Base Rate by 50 basis points and continue to operate monetary policy flexibly going

forward.

Another member presented the view that it would be advisable to cut the Base Rate by 25

basis points from the current 1.25% to 1.00%.

The member evaluated that COVID-19 had been spreading more quickly and extensively than

expected over the past couple of weeks since the previous monetary policy decision meeting, and

that as a result domestic and external economic conditions had been changing dramatically. The

member expressed concerns that the outbreak of the virus, initially concentrated in Northeast Asia,

had become a pandemic, and that this was heightening global economic uncertainty and greatly

3

aggravating domestic and overseas financial instability.

The member mentioned that what should be noted in discussing the necessary policy responses

to deal with this situation was that, amid an increasing possibility of the demand contraction

continuing longer than expected, the cash flows of goods and services suppliers were worsening.

The member expressed the opinion that this liquidity issue was as of now limited to small business

owners and SMEs and thus direct and selective liquidity support for damaged sectors still seemed

more effective, but considering the following matters, it would be desirable to implement a rate cut

as well at this meeting.

First, the member noted that, looking at the recent trend of credit spreads in major countries

and international financial markets, the possibility could not be ruled out that Korean companies’

liquidity issue could become more and more serious or develop into a more extensive credit crunch

issue amid increasing risk aversion in the financial markets.

Next, the member pointed out that, although it was difficult to predict the medium- and

long-term impacts of the virus outbreak on the economy, its negative impacts were highly likely to

last longer than usual, since social distancing and mobility restriction were regarded as the best

available measures to control the disease in most countries. Accordingly, the member’s assessment

was that, even if the spread of the virus outbreak eased, the economic rebound in the course of

recovery could be only modest compared with the past, and in this regard, downward pressures on

the medium-term growth path and inflation were actually growing.

Finally, the member evaluated that a more accommodative monetary policy stance would be

needed, given that financial conditions were estimated to become less easy with the sharp drop in

risky asset prices and the rise in their volatility in the financial markets, and assessed that a

crowding-out effect might occur due to increased bond issuance to finance the supplementary

budget.

Meanwhile, concerning the degree of Base Rate adjustment, the member took the view that,

although the US Federal Reserve’s rate cuts had led to an increase in policy flexibility for non-key

currency countries, attention should be paid to heightening volatility and credit risk aversion in the

global financial markets. The member added that if concerns about global economic recession

mounted, this could lead to heightening volatility in the domestic FX market. For this reason, the

member stated that it would be appropriate to gradually adjust the degree of monetary easing while

closely monitoring changes in the domestic and international financial and economic environments,

rather than using up traditional monetary policy space within a short time, and suggested a 25 basis

point rate cut in this regard.

Another member expressed the opinion that it was desirable to lower the Base Rate by 50

basis points from the current 1.25% to 0.75%.

The member expected that the economic spillover effects of COVID-19, which had been

4

spreading rapidly since the February MPB meeting, would be greater and last longer than previously

forecast. The member thus judged that, since the likelihood had increased that the contraction of

economic activity would lead to permanent losses in production capacity and labor, it was desirable

to cut the Base Rate by 50 basis points.

The member expected international financial markets to stabilize to some extent, thanks to

various monetary policy measures taken by the US Federal Reserve on March 15, and to global

measures to support the provision of US dollar liquidity in line with consultations among major

central banks. On the domestic front, the member judged that at this time it was of utmost

importance not only to strengthen the policy efforts to expand social safety nets and provide

financial support for small business owners, but also to secure as much as possible the conditions

for domestic firms to overcome the current situation while minimizing production capacity losses.

The member thus took the view that the adoption of several additional measures should be

considered again, depending on how relevant conditions develop.

The member, however, added that, in order to enhance the efficiency of this highly

expansionary monetary policy and curb financial imbalances, it was urgently needed to supplement

the system which might induce concentration in the credit channel.

One member expressed the opinion that it was appropriate to lower the Base Rate by 50 basis

points from the current 1.25% to 0.75%.

The member’s evaluation was that, since the spread of COVID-19 had gathered pace across the

globe since the previous MPB meeting, the negative impacts on the economy were rapidly

increasing. The member saw that, particularly since the spread had started in the US and the EU,

pillars of the global economy and finance, the situation was no longer a regional shock but had

evolved into a global economic shock. The member added that, since uncertainties related to the

coronavirus itself remained high, global financial market unrest had intensified and the global

financial system had become more unstable.

The member’s assessment was that, although the domestic spread of COVID-19 was showing

signs of slowing somewhat, the negative impacts on the domestic economy were increasing as the

COVID-19 pandemic intensified into a global economic shock. The member also pointed out that

heightened asset price volatility due to the increased global financial market unrest was also

negatively affecting the domestic financial markets.

The member saw that it was necessary to prepare for large declines in the growth and price

paths this year, and in the short term actively cope with the heightened liquidity risk for all

economic agents. The member thus expressed the opinion that bold monetary policy measures

should be implemented, going beyond increased liquidity support for vulnerable sectors. The member

thus argued for cutting the Base Rate by 50 basis points.

Another member stated that it would be desirable to revise the Base Rate downward from the

current 1.25% to 0.75%.

The member noted that the aftershocks of COVID-19 had appeared to be confined to China

and Korea at the time of the February MPB meeting. The member, however, evaluated that the

subsequent spread of the virus to the rest of the world, including the US and Europe, had

developed into a crisis situation that raised concerns about shocks to global economic activity and

global financial markets. The member saw that, with the real economy including growth and prices

worsening more severely compared to the February forecast, the domestic financial and foreign

exchange markets had been seriously affected due to heightened volatility in the international

financial markets.

The member expressed the opinion that a relatively significant cut in the Base Rate was

unavoidable to respond to downside risks to the real economy and to ease volatility in the financial

markets. The member declared that the most important responsibility for financial stability under the

current conditions was stability in the financial markets. The member, however, emphasized that

monitoring of the real estate market and the household debt issue should also continue in the future

as well.

The member saw that, taking all those points into consideration, it was desirable to revise the

Base Rate downward from the current 1.25% to 0.75% at this meeting. The member added that

measures deemed necessary for financial market stability should continue to be actively reviewed.

Ⅲ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

```
Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision

statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.

However, Dr. Lim, Jiwon expressed clear opposition to lowering the Base Rate by 0.50

percentage points and argued for cutting it by 0.25 percentage points.

**Monetary Policy Decision**

`□` The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 50

basis points, from 1.25% to 0.75%, effective March 17, 2020.

`□` Since the last Monetary Policy Board meeting, concerns about global economic slowdown have

deepened with COVID-19 spreading globally. The spread of the outbreak has also resulted in a

significant increase in the volatility of major price variables, including stock prices and

exchange rates, in domestic and global financial markets and a sharp fall in international oil

prices. The Board, therefore, judged that further monetary policy accommodation is called for in

order to ease volatility in the financial markets and reduce the effects on future economic

growth and inflation.

`□` Considering the high level of uncertainties regarding financial and economic conditions at home

and abroad, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance going forward so

as to reduce the downside risks to the real economy and ease volatility in the financial markets.
