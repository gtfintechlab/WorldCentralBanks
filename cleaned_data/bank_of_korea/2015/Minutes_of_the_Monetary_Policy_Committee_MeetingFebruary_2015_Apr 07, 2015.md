###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

 After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’,

 ‘FX and International Finance’ and the ‘Financial Markets’, the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following

 areas:

 With regard to the global economy, many members’ assessment was

 that the U.S. had maintained favorable growth and the euro area and

 Japan had shown trends of modest recovery, while economic growth in

 China had slowed. Members also judged that, in the international financial

 markets, asset prices had shown high volatility and the strengthening of

 the U.S. dollar had continued.

 As to the domestic economy, members noted that the trend of recovery

 had been weak, as indicators of domestic demand such as consumption

 and facilities investment, which had risen in December 2014, were

 estimated based on January monitoring to have declined.

 Concerning the domestic financial markets meanwhile, members pointed

 out that stock prices had risen, long-term market interest rates had

 rebounded after having fallen, and household lending had shown a much

 faster pace of increase than in the preceding few years.

 With regard to prices, members noted that, despite a hike in cigarette

 prices, consumer price inflation was just 0.8% in January, the same as in

 December due mainly to declines in petroleum product prices. Some

 members voiced concerns that, although inflation expectations had registered

 2.6% in January, just as in December, the proportion of responses

 expecting inflation of 2% or lower had steadily increased, the consumer

###### sentiments on prospective prices was on a downward path, the inflation

 rate expected among experts was at around the mid-1% level, and the

 break-even inflation rate had fallen to a little above 1%. One member on

 the other hand noted that the concerns about deflation voiced in some

 quarters were overdone, since prices were expected to shift to an upward

 trend in the first half of 2015.

 Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 domestic and international economic environment and the future outlooks

 for both, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level

 for the intermeeting period.

 One member noted that prices were likely to sustain a very low rate

 of increase for the time being, influenced by the declines in international

 oil prices, and that the economy had shown no clear signs of recovery.

 He went on to argue that it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate

 at its current level for the intermeeting period since, due mainly to

 seasonal factors, there was not enough data to judge the strength of the

 economic recovery, and there was also a need to further observe the

 effects of the government’s front-loading of its budget implementation and

 of the BOK’s Base Rate cuts.

 Another member, after agreeing on the desirability of leaving the Base

 Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, observed that Korean

 exports to Japan and the EU had declined significantly in the fourth

 quarter of 2014, in line with the quantitative easing by the Bank of Japan

###### and the ECB. It was now time, he suggested, to work actively to

 minimize the negative spillover effects of the yen‘s and the euro‘s

 depreciations on the Korean economy. The member added that the abrupt

 exchange rate fluctuations in the US dollar, the yen and the euro,

 stemming from policy divergences among major advanced country central

 banks, signified that the promises made at the Seoul G20 Summit in 2010

 were no longer being followed, and expressed the view that, against this

 backdrop, Korea should not only seek actively to reduce exchange rate

 volatility, but also devote efforts to securing various possible policy tools.

 One other member, while expressing the opinion that it would be

 better to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting

 period, noted the need for paying close attention when adjusting the Base

 Rate, given that it was difficult to accurately grasp the underlying

 macroeconomic trends since major real economic indicators had recently

 been substantially influenced by irregular and seasonal factors, and it

 remained unclear how shifts in major countries’ monetary policies and the

 movements of international oil prices would affect domestic and overseas

 economic conditions. The member went on to state that effective measures

 should be sought to improve the quality of the household debt structure

 and curb growth in overall household debt outstanding, and that proposals

 for supporting the recovery of growth and expansion of the growth

 potential should be explored, depending on the situation, through the

 employment of policy instruments other than policy rate adjustment, such

 as the bank intermediation support facility.

 Another member meanwhile presented the view that, although in the

 present situation there was some scope for additional Base Rate adjustment

 given that the negative output and inflation gaps, which had widened in

 the fourth quarter of 2014, had not narrowed to any significant extent and

 that substantial spare capacities remained at firms and in the labor market,

###### it would still be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged for the

 month, considering that the uncertainties about the effects of and potential

 risks related to Base Rate adjustment remained considerable. The member

 also noted that the fall in international oil prices and the spread of

 accommodative monetary policy stances would aggravate the downward

 pressures on prices, but on the other hand also have the effect of

 stimulating total demand. He added that the channels for revival of the

 Korean economic growth potential and for returning to the appropriate

 price level needed to be examined closely, while also strengthening the

 macroprudential supervisory framework through cooperation among the

 related authorities with regard to financial stability risks including the

 increase in household debt. He at the same time stated that the economy’s

 resilience must be heightened through efforts to increase the efficiency of

 resource allocation, by for example enlarging the corporate restructuring

 functions of creditor financial institutions.

 Another member stated, taking domestic and overseas financial and

 economic conditions into overall consideration, that on the overseas side

 the paces of improvement in economic activities were weak in major

 countries apart from the U.S., and future economic uncertainties had

 increased due mainly to expectations of a U.S. policy rate hike, to the

 expansions in major countries’ monetary policy accommodativeness, to

 political instability in Greece and to the shock of low oil prices, while on

 the domestic side exports were somewhat feeble, the recovery of domestic

 demand was sluggish and the pace of improvement in economic agents’

 sentiment was weak. After advocating that the Base Rate be held at its

 current level for the inter-meeting period, he added his view that attention

 needed to be paid to changes in global conditions, while growth- and

 price-related macroeconomic risks should be considered together with the

 risks to financial stability, in a balanced manner, to ensure that

 vulnerabilities related to the growth path did not materialize.

###### One other member assessed the recent changes in the economic

 environments at home and abroad as calling for comprehensive

 examination of the appropriateness of the current Base Rate level, and

 added that, while holding the rate at its current level for the intermeeting

 period, the Committee should keep close watch on the future impacts of

 the accommodative monetary policies in major countries, the downside

 risks to exports and domestic demand, the trend of increasing household

 debt, the development of the low inflation situation, in/outflows of foreign

 capital and foreign exchange market trends, in order to seek the optimal

 policy response. He went on to note that, as the Korean economy was

 vulnerable to external sector disturbances owing to its high degree of

 market openness and external dependency, the possibility was high of the

 recent monetary policy easing by major countries causing substantial

 volatility in the Korean economy, and the policy authorities should

 therefore prepare against such shocks in advance. The member then added

 that it was necessary to strengthen measures for countering the excessive

 growth of household debt, to carry out structural innovation of the

 economy and to construct new engines of growth. 

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

 Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all members.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.00% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Committee considers

 that, although the trend of a solid economic recovery in the US has

 been sustained and the euro area has also shown signs of

 improvement, albeit weak, economic growth in emerging market

 countries including China has slowed. The Committee forecasts that

 the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward,

 centering around major advanced economies such as the US, but

 judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by changes in

 the monetary policies of major countries, by the weakening of

 economic growth in emerging market countries, by geopolitical

 risks, and by the uncertainties over the restructuring of Greek debt.

 □ Looking at the Korean economy, while exports have decreased, due

 mainly to declines in the unit prices for example of petroleum

 products, the Committee judges that the recovery of domestic

 demand has not been strong and that the sentiments of economic

 agents remain weak. On the employment front, the number of

 persons employed has expanded steadily, led by increases in the

 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee

 expects that the domestic economy will show a modest trend of

 recovery going forward, but that the negative output gap will persist

 for a considerable time.

 □ Despite increases in the extents of decline in petroleum product

 prices, consumer price inflation registered 0.8% in January, the

###### same as in December, due mainly to an expansion in the scale of

 increase in prices of industrial products other than petroleum. Core

 inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices rose

 sharply from 1.6% the month before to 2.4% in January. Looking

 ahead, the Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise

 from the second half of this year, after remaining at a low level.

 In the housing market, the upward trends of sales prices slowed

 somewhat, while leasehold deposit prices continued their uptrend

 centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas.

 □ In the domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates,

 after having fallen in line mainly with monetary policy easing by

 major countries, have rebounded in response to the improvements in

 US economic indicators. Stock prices have risen. The Korean won,

 which had appreciated against the US dollar, has depreciated as the

 effects of the sustained current account surplus and the dollar’s

 strength globally have intersected. The recent trend of won

 appreciation against the Japanese yen has meanwhile weakened amid

 increased demand for safe-haven assets. Bank household lending has

 sustained its trend of increase at a level greatly exceeding that of

 recent years, led by mortgage loans.

 □ Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth

 the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price

 stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial

 stability. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors

 such as international oil prices and shifts in major countries’

 monetary policies, as well as developments related to the spare

 capacity in the domestic economy and the trends of household debt

 and capital flows.
