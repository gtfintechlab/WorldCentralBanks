###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

 After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’,

 ‘FX and International Finance’ and the ‘Financial Markets’, the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following

 areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the

 U.S. had maintained favorable growth with its employment situation

 improving, while economic growth in China had slowed due mainly to its

 sluggish real estate market. Members also judged risk aversion in the

 international financial markets to have eased, owing chiefly to the

 proliferation of accommodative monetary policy stances and to reduced

 concerns about Greece.

 As to the domestic economy, members appraised the trend of recovery

 as having been weak, with domestic demand such as consumption and

 facilities investment sluggish and exports declining. Some members noted

 the possibilities of GDP for the first quarter this year and for the year as

 a whole coming in below the January forecasts.

 Concerning the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members

 pointed out that stock prices had risen, long-term market interest rates had

 declined, and the Korean won’s real effective exchange rate had

 maintained a trend of appreciation.

 With regard to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had

 recorded 0.5%, lower than during the month before. Some members

 commented that the future price path would remain at a level below that

 forecast in January.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Most members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 domestic and international economic environments and the future outlooks

 for both, it would be desirable this month to cut the Base Rate by 0.25

 of a percentage point from its current level for the intermeeting period.

 One of these members noted that, with the exception of the household

 lending trend, all economic developments at home and abroad since the

 month previous indicated heightened necessity of an additional Base Rate

 cut. He went on to argue that, in contrast to previous periods of real

 estate bubble formation, the recent expansion in household debt was

 attributable mainly to an increased volume of transactions and to a rise in

 leasehold deposit prices. And considering moreover that it would be

 appropriate to cope initially with the risks posed by excessive household

 debt through macroprudential policy measures, it was undesirable at this

 time for the monetary authorities to hesitate in taking timely measures in

 response to changes in global economic conditions and to new downside

 risks to prices and growth. It would therefore be appropriate to cut the

 Base Rate this month, from its current 2.0% to 1.75%.

 Another member noted, in view of overall financial and economic

 conditions domestically and overseas, the possibility that the negative

 output gap might continue for a longer period of time than had been

 expected. He pointed out that, on the external side, the trends of

 improvement in economic activities in major countries apart from the U.S.

 were unclear, the uncertainties about the future direction of the global

 economy had not disappeared, due chiefly to the expectations of a U.S.

 policy rate hike, to the continuation of monetary policy accommodativeness

###### in major countries, and to the reemergence of the Greek issue. On the

 domestic front, although economic agent sentiments had shown some signs

 of improvement the domestic demand recovery remained weak and exports

 were sluggish. The member went on to advocate the necessity of adjusting

 the Base Rate downward to 1.75%, to dispel the vulnerabilities in the

 growth path and prevent materialization of the downside risks to the

 economy.

 One other member noted that, in view of the weaker than expected

 January and February indicators, it was difficult to say that the growth

 shock in the fourth quarter of 2014 had been due only to one-off factors

 including a shortfall in tax revenues. He added that downward adjustment

 of the forecast price path was unavoidable with the negative output gap

 widening due to the rapid decline in consumer price inflation, and that,

 despite the two Base Rate cuts last year, real interest rates were rising

 again due to declines in consumer price inflation and in inflation

 expectations, while the real neutral rate was on the other hand showing a

 gradual trend of decrease due mainly to demographic structural changes.

 The real effective Korean won exchange rate was meanwhile on the rise,

 in line with the spread of accommodative monetary policy stances

 globally. In consideration of all of these points, the member then stated

 his opinion that it would be necessary to lower the Base Rate to 1.75%

 this month, to support the economy’s return to its potential growth path

 by narrowing the negative output and negative price gaps, and to respond

 preemptively to the possibilities of a future drop in expected inflation and

 of a spread of deflationary sentiments.

 Another member meanwhile presented the views that, with the GDP

 gap negative there was a possibility of future real economic growth not

 reaching the potential growth rate, and that the low inflation was expected

 to persist for a considerable time as well. It was thus necessary to

 continuously support the recovery of Korean economic growth and

###### expansion of the growth potential, by lowering the Base Rate by 25bp this

 month while raising the ceiling on the Financial Intermediation Support

 Facility and adjusting the scope of its coverage. He added that, while still

 greater attention should be paid to household debt, which was a potential

 risk to financial stability, improvements in the household debt structure

 should be pursued effectively through cooperation among the institutions

 concerned, and macroprudential measures should if necessary also be

 devised to curb the increase in the total lending amount.

 One other member expressed the opinion that holding the Base Rate at

 its current level for the intermeeting period would be desirable,

 commenting that, rather than bringing about the promotion of corporate

 investment or an increase in household consumption, a further Base Rate

 cut could result instead in actually hindering firms’ structural reforms and

 causing long-term financial instability to intensify by increasing household

 debt. This member continued by noting that if the Bank Intermediation

 Support Facility, a non interest-rate policy tool, were utilized, it could

 minimize the growth of household debt and have an economic stimulus

 effect by channeling credit into corporate lending only, with household

 lending excluded. To this end, he remarked, the Bank Intermediation

 Support Facility should be redesigned to allow counter-cyclical operation

 and, if necessary, the scope of coverage of its support should be expanded

 from small and medium-size enterprises at present to also include leading

 medium-size firms. The member went on to point out that Korea’s fiscal

 spending since the global financial crisis had been inadequate to support

 economic recovery, and its management had also not been sufficiently

 counter-cyclical, adding that exerting a direct influence on private

 investment and consumption through government fiscal policy could be an

 effective plan.

 Another member expressed his own opinion of the desirability of

 maintaining the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.

###### He reasoned, firstly, that although the pace of the domestic economic

 recovery was somewhat weak compared with that forecast in January,

 under the recent domestic and international conditions it was necessary to

 pay greater attention to the employment situation than to economic growth,

 and it was not desirable to resort to use of the Base Rate only out of

 concerns about a drop in the growth rate. Secondly, considering the

 maneuvering room for monetary policy, it was necessary to exercise

 greater caution in deciding on a Base Rate level that had never been

 experienced before, and under the current overall accommodative financial

 conditions a Base Rate cut would have only limited effect. Thirdly, he

 said, when the price-related data were looked at comprehensively the fears

 about deflation that had emerged as an issue recently seemed somewhat

 excessive, while account should also be taken of the concerns about the

 increase in household debt.

###### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

  Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the members

 compiled a statement that reflected the views of the majority.

  However, Mr. Chung, Hae-Bang and Mr. Moon, Woosik expressed

 clear opposition to the idea of lowering the Base Rate by 0.25 of a

 percentage point, and argued for holding it unchanged at its current level.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 2.00% to

 1.75%.

 □ Based on currently available information the Committee considers

 that, although the trend of a solid economic recovery in the US has

 been sustained and improvements, albeit modest, have also

 continued in the euro area, economic growth in emerging market

 countries including China has slowed. The Committee forecasts that

 the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward,

 centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges

 that the possibility exists of its being affected by changes in the

 monetary policies of major countries, by the weakening of economic

 growth in emerging market countries, and by geopolitical risks.

 □ Looking at the Korean economy, the Committee notes that exports

 have decreased, due mostly to declines in the unit prices for

 example of petroleum products, that domestic demand activities such

 as private consumption and facilities investment have exhibited

7

###### sluggish movements, and that the sentiments of economic agents

 have also not clearly recovered. On the employment front, the

 number of persons employed has expanded steadily, led by

 increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector.

 The Committee expects that the domestic economy will show a

 modest trend of recovery going forward, although falling short of

 the originally forecast growth path. The period of continuation of

 the negative output gap will as a result also be longer than had

 been anticipated.

 □ Consumer price inflation fell from 0.8% the month before to 0.5%

 in February, owing mainly to increases in the extents of decline in

 petroleum product prices and to the slower paces of increase in

 prices of industrial products other than petroleum. Core inflation

 excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices fell slightly to

 2.3%, from 2.4% in January. Looking ahead, the Committee

 forecasts that, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices,

 inflation will continue at a level lower than originally expected. In

 the housing market, the upward trends of sales prices accelerated

 slightly, while leasehold deposit prices continued their uptrend

 centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas.

 □ In the domestic financial markets, after having risen on foreigners’

 net buying of domestic stocks for example, stock prices have

 recently fallen under the influence mostly of declines in stock

 prices in major countries. The Korean won has depreciated against

 the US dollar, affected by the dollar’s strength globally and by the

 synchronization between movements of the won and the Japanese

 yen following the yen’s weakening, while it has fluctuated within a

 certain range against the yen. Long-term market interest rates had

8

###### risen, but have since declined. Bank household lending has

 sustained its trend of increase at a level greatly exceeding that of

 recent years, led by mortgage loans.

 □ Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth

 the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price

 stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial

 stability. In this process, it will closely monitor external risk factors

 such as international oil prices and shifts in major countries’

 monetary policies, as well as developments related to the spare

 capacity in the domestic economy and the trends of household debt

 and capital flows.
