###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

 After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’,

 ‘FX and International Finance’ and the ‘Financial Markets’, the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following

 areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the

 pace of recovery in the US had slowed somewhat, influenced for instance

 by an unusually severe cold spell and by the US dollar’s strength, and

 that the euro area had sustained its modest recovery, while economic

 growth in China had continued to slow due mainly to the slump in its

 real estate market and to adjustments of its excess capacity. Members

 judged the international financial markets to be stable overall, owing

 chiefly to the maintenance of accommodative policy stances by central

 banks in major countries.

 As to the domestic economy, many members noted that exports had

 continued their trend of decline and judged that, although domestic-demand

 related indicators had improved compared to the previous month, the trend

 of economic recovery was weak.

 Concerning the domestic financial markets meanwhile, members

 observed that long-term market interest rates had fallen, stock prices had

 risen, and the won, after having depreciated against the US dollar, had

 again appreciated. A number of members noted that housing transactions

 had become more active and the trends of increase in housing sales and

 leasehold deposit prices had accelerated, owing mainly to shifts from

 deposit-based tenancies to outright sales or monthly payment-based rentals,

 while bank household lending had sustained its trend of increase centering

###### around mortgage loans.

 With regard to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation was

0.4%, lower than during the month before due in large part to declines in

###### agricultural, livestock and marine product prices. They commented that core

 inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products was

 also below than in the preceding month, at 2.1%.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall

 consideration of the domestic and international economic environment and

 the future outlooks for both, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate

 at its current level for the intermeeting period.

 One of these members argued that, while consumer prices were likely

 to sustain a low rate of increase of below 1% for the time being, owing

 mainly to the continued downward pressures on the demand side and to

 the effects of the low oil prices, the economic recovery’s momentum was

 still being maintained despite a downward shift in the Korean economy’s

 growth path. This member went on to express the opinion that, since the

 Base Rate had been reduced the previous month in consideration of these

 downward shifts in the growth and price paths, there was a need to

 observe the effects of this cut and it would thus be desirable to maintain

 the Base Rate at its present level for the current month.

 Another member then also put forward a view that maintaining the

 Base Rate at its present level for this month would be appropriate.

 Concerning the recent downward revisions of the forecasts for economic

 growth and consumer price inflation, compared to those in January, this

 member noted that it was natural to revise economic outlooks, which are

 based upon assumptions about future economic conditions at home and

 abroad at the time of they are made, in line with changes that could not

 have been foreseen at that time. He went on to express his opinion that,

 rather than expecting the Bank of Korea’s economic forecasts to be

 realized exactly, economic agents should consider them as references for

 future economic forecasts, and should bear in mind the fact that, when the

4

###### assumptions underlying them are changing, forecasts can also be revised.

 One other member then stated his opinion that, despite the downward

 revision of the central bank’s forecasts for growth and consumer price

 inflation, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level

 for the intermeeting period. He cited as reasons the facts that these

 revisions had been anticipated and preemptively responded to by cutting

 the Base Rate by 25 basis points and raising the ceiling of the Bank

 Intermediated Lending Support Facility substantially the previous month,

 that, since Korean GDP growth was forecast to be at around its potential

 level from the second quarter of this year, it would be desirable from the

 standpoints of securing policy-making capacity, the intensity of the policy

 response and monetary policy credibility to wait and observe the effects of

 the monetary easing measures implemented to this time, rather than

 lowering the Base Rate further, and that since household debt was

 sustaining a high rate of increase there was a need to devote greater

 attention to financial stability.

 Another member meanwhile pointed out several aspects of growth and

 price conditions that could be seen as indicating a need for Base Rate

 adjustment. First, the Korean economy’s negative output gap had widened

 due to the growth rate shock in the fourth quarter of last year, and

 growth during the first quarter of this year had been somewhat insufficient

 to narrow the output gap to any noticeable extent. Second, it was difficult

 to identify any signs in demand-side price indicators of the inflation gap

 narrowing significantly. Third, the instability of inflation expectations had

 risen: the March price outlook CSI and expected inflation among members

 of the general public had declined slightly, while the share of respondents

 in the survey choosing expected inflation below 2 percent had increased.

 Fourth, there was still substantial spare capacity in both production and

 employment, with the manufacturing operation ratio remaining at a low

 level and broad labour underutilization indicator unemployment rate

###### increasing. Despite all of this, however, he argued that it would be

 appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting

 period, since these factors had already been taken into account to a

 substantial extent in the Base Rate cut the month previous, and there was

 a need to observe the effects of the three recent cuts in the Base Rate

 and the positive knock-on effects of the declines in oil prices a little

 longer.

 Another member noted that, on the overseas front, there were both

 positive factors, with the US economic recovery continuing and

 improvements in the euro area, and negative ones, such as the weakening

 of economic growth in emerging market countries including China. On the

 domestic front, meanwhile, the pace of improvement in economic activities

 was not rapid enough to indicate entry into a phase of sustained growth.

 He went on to state that, amid the uncertainties over external conditions,

 the spillovers to other economic sectors such as consumption from firms’

 planned implementations of facilities investments and revitalization of the

 real estate market would be important driving forces for future economic

 recovery. The member also expressed the opinion that the Base Rate

 should be held at its current level for the intermeeting period, and efforts

 should be made to return the Korean economy onto a stable path of

 growth as early as possible, by considering in a balanced manner the

 macro-economic risks to growth and prices together with risks to financial

 stability, while at the same time taking note of any changes in global

 financial and economic conditions.

 Another member stated his opinion that a small downward adjustment

 of the Base Rate from its current level of 1.75% would be advisable

 since, with the exception of the trend of changes in household lending

 other recent policy conditions were all indicating a need for further

 monetary policy easing. As some examples he pointed out that domestic

 demand had not improved sufficiently this year and was unlikely to show

###### a solid improvement in the near future, that downside risks to exports had

 been emerging in the medium- and long-term, in view of the trend of

 won appreciation against the currencies of Korea‘s export rivals and the

 delays in economic recoveries of its major export partners, and that the

 downside risks to prices had recently grown even further. The member

 added that it should be borne in mind that, although an additional Base

 Rate cut might entail potential risks, the possibilities of abrupt surges in

 inflation and capital outflows were not great at present, while the more

 important reason for the recent sharp increase in household lending, rather

 than the cuts in the Base Rate, had been the going ahead by households

 with housing purchases that they had deferred until now, as well as the

 shifts from leasehold-deposit tenancies to outright housing purchases.

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

 Taking into consideration the results of the discussions earlier, members
 compiled a statement that specifically reflected the majority opinion.

 Mr. Ha, Seong Geun however dissented, expressing clear opposition to

 holding the Base Rate at its current level and arguing for a small downward adjustment.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Committee considers

 that, although the trend of economic recovery in the US has been

 sustained and improvements have also continued in the euro area,

 economic growth in emerging market countries including China has

 slowed. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will

 sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around

 advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibility

 exists of its being affected by changes in the monetary policies of

 major countries, by the weakening of economic growth in emerging

 market countries, and by geopolitical risks.

 □ Looking at the Korean economy, the Committee judges that

 domestic demand activities such as consumption and investment

 appear to have improved, although exports have continued their

 trend of decline due mostly to decreases in the unit prices for

 example of petroleum products, while the sentiments of economic

 agents have not clearly recovered. On the employment front, the

 unemployment rate has risen somewhat, due mainly to an expansion

 in job search activities, but the employment-to-population ratio has

 also increased as the number of persons employed has steadily

 grown. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will

 show a modest trend of recovery going forward, although the

 negative output gap will persist for a considerable time.

###### □ Despite a narrowing of the extent of decline in petroleum product

 prices, consumer price inflation fell from 0.5% the month before to

 0.4% in March, due mainly to decreases in prices of agricultural,

 livestock and fisheries products. Core inflation excluding agricultural

 and petroleum product prices fell to 2.1%, from 2.3% in February,

 owing to a slowdown in the rate of industrial product price

 increase. Looking ahead the Committee forecasts that inflation will

 continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects of the low oil

 prices. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and

 leasehold deposit prices have accelerated in both Seoul and its

 surrounding areas and the rest of the country.

 □ In the domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates

 have fallen while stock prices have risen, due largely to the Base

 Rate cut, to the easing of concerns about an early policy rate hike

 by the US Federal Reserve, and to inflows of foreigners’ securities

 investment funds. The Korean won had depreciated against the US

 dollar but has since appreciated, affected by changes in expectations

 related to the monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve. After

 depreciating, the won has also appreciated against the Japanese yen.

 Bank household lending has sustained its trend of increase at a

 level greatly exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans.

 □ Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth

 the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price

 stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial

 stability. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors

 such as international oil prices and shifts in major countries’

 monetary policies, as well as developments related to the spare

 capacity in the domestic economy and the trends of household debt

 and capital flows.
