###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

 After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’,

 ‘FX and International Finance’ and the ‘Financial Markets’, the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following

 areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the

 trend of economic growth in the US had been higher than expected, and

 that the moderate recovery in the euro area had continued. Meanwhile,

 economic uncertainty in China had remained high with growth continuing

 to slow. Members judged that volatility in international financial markets

 had heightened greatly, owing chiefly to growing concerns about the US

 Fed’s policy rate hike and to the unrest in the Chinese equity markets.

 As to the domestic economy, members noted that, while consumption

 and services production had shown trends of improvement as the negative

 effects of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak

 subsided, the trend of declining exports had accelerated.

 Concerning the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members

 observed that stock prices had fallen and the Korean won had depreciated

 against the US dollar due to outflows of foreigners’ portfolio investment

 funds. They also noted that long-term interest rates had fallen, affected by

 stronger preferences for safe assets.

 With regard to prices, members observed that, despite declines in

 petroleum product prices, consumer price inflation had still come in at

 0.7%, the same as that of the previous month, owing, for example, to rises

 in the prices of other industrial products. Inflation expectations declined

 slightly from the previous month, but remained generally stable.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 domestic and international economic environments and the future outlook

 for them both, it would be desirable this month to hold the Base Rate at

 its current level for the intermeeting period.

 Among them, one member assessed that, although consumption and

 investment in the Korean economy had been showing trends of modest

 improvement, exports had exhibited a larger-than-expected trend of decline,

 downside risks to domestic growth and prices had become greater due to

 the emergence of external uncertainties in line with the global economic

 slowdown, household debt had maintained strong growth, and volatility and

 unrest in the foreign exchange market had heightened. The member then

 argued that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current

 level of 1.50% for the intermeeting period, while more closely monitoring

 major factors affecting the growth and stability of the Korean economy.

 The member also expressed the opinion that, since the won/dollar

 exchange rate was expected to fluctuate greatly going forward due to a

 possible shift in the direction of the US Fed’s monetary policy, the

 potential expansion of competitive exchange rate policies in major

 countries, and a trend of large-scale widening of Korea’s current account

 surplus, the authorities concerned should perform precautionary checks on

 potential risks, monitor market sentiment, and prepare to implement market

 stabilization measures without delay. The member then put forward the

 view that the policy authorities should analyze the negative effects on

 corporations of the export decline, which would have significant

 repercussions on the growth path of the Korean economy, and pursue

 policy measures to mitigate these effects.

###### Another member stated the view that it would be desirable to hold the

 Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period. The member

 then expressed the opinion that, while bearing in mind the heightening of

 uncertainties in the global economy and finance, there was a need to

 observe the effects of, for instance, an accommodative policy stance and

 measures to facilitate consumption. The member also noted the need to

 strengthen the monitoring of developments related to financial stability,

 such as household debt and flows of foreign portfolio investment funds.

 The member then went on to present the opinion that, since some have

 raised a view with respect to the checks on and preparations against

 external shocks that the crisis in the Chinese economy had broken out in

 the course of an economic rebalancing from manufacturing to services,

 there was no need for excessive concerns, but there still was a need to

 examine the influences of the weakening of China’s role as a consumer in

 the world economy and as a shock absorber, and that the Bank of Korea

 should pay attention to the possibility that global interest rates would rise

 more than originally anticipated in the event of a US Fed rate hike. The

 member also requested that the Bank prepare against the possibility that

 there could be several sources of tension in the domestic financial

 markets, even though they appeared superficially calm, and that the Bank

 should deliberate on the operation of policy instruments other than interest

 rate policy, and consider a mix of monetary policy and macroprudential

 policy. The member also stressed that, since the effects of policy

 responses focusing on demand stimulation had so far been limited, the

 Bank should take interest in the search for a driver of economic recovery

 from the perspectives of strengthening supply-side capacities and of

 enhancing competitiveness.

 One other member argued that downside risks to the future growth and

 price paths were high, taking into account that although economic activity

 was expected to follow the path forecast in July, downside risks to the

4


-----

###### growth path for the second half had increased due to a prolonged slump

 in exports and the manufacturing industry, and considering that although

 consumer price inflation was judged to be falling somewhat short of the

 path forecast in July due mainly to the decline in international oil prices,

 core inflation was holding to the original forecast path, and keeping in

 mind that the slack in the production sector and the overall spare capacity

 in the labor market had expanded somewhat. However, the member stated

 the view that it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at its

 present level, citing in support that it was uncertain whether the changes

 in these paths had been significant enough to support further a easing of

 monetary policy, and that the risks involved in an additional Base Rate

 adjustment had expanded, owing primarily to the sustained trend of foreign

 investment fund outflows and to a rapid rise in household debt. The

 member then added that a close watch should be kept on the possibility

 that an expansion of economic unrest in emerging market economies

 (EMEs) would be transmitted to the Korean economy through the capital

 and trade channels, on the possibility of heightened financial market

 volatility in line with foreign portfolio investment fund outflows, on

 movements of the real effective exchange rate of the Korean won in line

 with the changes in Korea’s major trading partners’ exchange rates, as

 well as the effects of such movements, and on the possibility that the

 credit cycle would shift rapidly, due to, for instance, its excessive

 decoupling with the real business cycle.

 Meanwhile, one member commented that, while uncertainties about

 future growth and price movements had expanded, they were judged to

 have not strayed far from the path forecast in July, financial stability risks

 were considered to have grown, since there was a possibility of increased

 domestic and overseas financial market volatility triggered by external

 shocks, and strong growth in household lending was expected to continue.

 The member stated the opinion that the Bank of Korea should explain to

 economic agents that it was important to enhance growth potential by

5


-----

###### pursuing effective structural reforms, since expansionary macroeconomic

 policies alone could provide only limited support to economic recovery

 because the recent lower-than-expected economic growth was attributable

 more to structural factors in the Korean economy and to shrinking global

 demand than to cyclical factors. The member also noted that, to prevent

 excessive anxiety stemming from the recent heightened volatility in global

 financial markets, the Bank should assure economic agents that Korea’s

 capacity to respond to external shocks was relatively sound, thanks to its

 large current account surplus, abundant holdings of official foreign

 reserves, and banks’ safe external debt structures.

 Another member noted that some had leveled the criticism that

 monetary policy had not been sufficiently accommodative, as consumer

 price inflation had continued to decline since 2012, running below the

 inflation target. The member stated that this criticism seemed to overlook

 the fact that prices had been unrelated to economic activity, with the

 economic growth rate increasing despite a decline in prices. The member

 then expressed the view that, to enhance the effectiveness of monetary

 policy in line with the current economic environment, with its weakened

 link between prices and economic activity, the Bank of Korea needed to

 think carefully about ways to improve inflation targeting and other aspects

 of the existing monetary policy operation framework. The member also

 presented the view that insufficient economic growth despite

 accommodative monetary policy was a counterexample suggesting that in

 addition to cyclical factors, structural factors, including a decline in

 potential growth, had played a significant role in determining the economic

 growth rate, and thus there was a need to perform separate analyses of

 the extents to which these kinds of factors are responsible for low

 economic growth, and to deeply reflect on appropriate monetary policy

 directions and structural reforms that could raise the potential growth rate.

 One other member assessed that, if the changes in domestic and

6


-----

###### international financial and economic conditions during the previous month

 were considered, the future growth and price paths of the Korean economy

 appeared to have shifted slightly downward in comparison with the July

 forecast, influenced for instance by the sustained sluggishness of exports

 and by the decline in international oil prices. However, the member argued

 that, since this downward shift in the growth and price paths was mainly

 attributable to changes in external conditions, including economic

 uncertainties surrounding China and the sluggishness of world trade, there

 was a need to further observe their developments going forward, and thus

 the Board should hold the Base Rate at its current level for the

 intermeeting period. The member also expressed the view that, despite

 heightened international financial market volatility, financial instability

 seemed unlikely to spread to Korea, thanks largely to Korea’s sustained

 current account surplus and to sound financial conditions at Korean

 financial institutions. However, the member then went on to express the

 view that the Bank of Korea should keep a close eye on the possible

 spread of external uncertainties in order to prepare for all eventualities,

 and that the Bank should do all it can to manage external sector risk by

 refining and updating its contingency plans.

###### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

 Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all members.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

 leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting

 period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Board considers that

 the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, and

 that the improvements in the euro area have continued as well.

 Economic growth in emerging market countries including China has

 meanwhile continued to slow. The Board forecasts that the global

 economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a

 moderate pace, centering around advanced economies such as the

 US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by

 heightened international financial market volatility, due to the

 instabilities in the Chinese financial and foreign exchange markets

 and to a shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, and by

 the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries.

 □ Looking at the Korean economy, although the recovery in domestic

 demand activities such as consumption and investment has

 continued, the trend of declining exports has persisted while the

 improvement in economic agents’ sentiments has been inadequate.

8


-----

###### On the employment front, as the trend of increase in the number of

 persons employed slowed in August, owing mainly to a base effect,

 the employment-to-population ratio decreased while the

 unemployment rate rose compared to those in August of last year.

 The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will show a trend

 of recovery going forward, but in view of external economic

 conditions judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to

 have increased.

 □ Despite declines in petroleum product prices, consumer price

 inflation registered 0.7% in August, the same as in July, in line

 mainly with expansions in the extents of increase in prices of other

 industrial products. Core inflation excluding agricultural and

 petroleum product prices rose slightly to 2.1%, from 2.0% in July.

 Looking ahead the Board forecasts that inflation will continue at a

 low level, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices. In the

 housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit

 prices have continued in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and

 the rest of the country.

 □ In the domestic financial markets, stock prices have fallen and the

 Korean won has depreciated against both the US dollar and the

 Japanese yen, as portfolio investment funds of foreigners have

 flowed out due to factors such as the instabilities in the Chinese

 financial and foreign exchange markets. Long-term market interest

 rates have fallen, influenced mainly by investor preference for safe

 assets. Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at

 a level substantially exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage

 loans.

 □ Looking ahead, while working to sustain the recovery of economic

9

###### growth, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain

 price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to

 financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor the trend

 of increase in household debt and external risk factors such as any

 shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and the financial

 instabilities in emerging market countries including China, as well

 as the trends of capital flows.
