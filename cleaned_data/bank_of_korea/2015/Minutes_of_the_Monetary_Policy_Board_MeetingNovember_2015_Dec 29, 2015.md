###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

 After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’,

 ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Markets’, the discussions of

 the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that
 Chinese economic growth was continuing to slow down, with the nation’s exports declining, while the US economy was maintaining its recovery, with consumption, facilities investment and the housing market continuing to improve and employment growth accelerating, and the euro area was showing a modest recovery. Members also judged that international financial markets had responded sensitively for example to the diverging policy stances of major countries.

 As to the domestic economy, members assessed that exports had
 continued to decline, while the economy showed modest recovery, led by domestic demand including consumption and investment.

 Concerning the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, most members

 noted that long-term interest rates had risen substantially, owing mainly to

 improvements in domestic economic indicators and the greater likelihood

 of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, and that there was a

 shift to a net inflow of foreigners’ portfolio investment funds. They also

 mentioned that bank lending to the household sector had increased

 significantly, led by mortgage lending, with October recording the strongest

 growth since the statistics had been first compiled.

 With regard to prices, most members observed that consumer price
 inflation had stood at 0.9 percent, up from the previous month, due mainly to greater increases in agricultural product prices and services fees, and that core inflation had also increased slightly from the preceding month.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the
 domestic and international economic environments and the future outlook for them both, it would be desirable this month to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.

 Among them, one member assessed that, amid the accelerating growth
 in household loans driven chiefly by increased group loans in line with buoyant sales of new apartments, group loans were expected to work to increase household loans for the time being, which might limit the effects of the comprehensive household debt management measure that aims to slow down growth in household debt from next year, and that it would be therefore necessary to develop ways to prepare against the possibility of household debt emerging as a huge burden on the Korean economy. The member also mentioned that, because the traditional channels of interest rate policy transmission to the real and financial sectors were likely to weaken greatly due to the possibility of the trends of slow growth and slow price increases continuing for a considerable period of time, and also because interest rate policy alone could not cope effectively with conflicts among various policy objectives, efforts were urgently needed to develop various monetary policy instruments other than policy rate adjustment and use them in combination. In line with this, the member expressed the opinion that the framework of existing policy instruments, such as open market operations and the bank intermediary support facility, needed urgent improvement to adjust to the changing environment.

 Another member stated the view that a little more time would be
 needed before making an optimistic forecast for future economic activity, as the G2 risks remained on the external side ─ expectations of a US Fed policy rate hike within the year and concerns about China and EMEs ─ and as the domestic side has seen a revival of expectations regarding improvements in economic activity but also continuing downside risks,

###### including sluggish exports. The member noted that it would be important to promote positive views of business conditions and encourage economic agents to carry out economic activities, so that briskness in some parts of domestic demand could lead to growth in terms of overall production capacity. The member also called for diagnoses of and prescriptions for sluggish exports from various perspectives, analyses of the effects of China’s five-year plan, and research into current demographic issues in an effort to prepare against highly probable shocks related to growth. The member went on to argue that preparations should be made against the possibility of interest rates showing greater volatility than foreign exchange rates, since there were only slight differences among the fundamentals of advanced economies. The member also presented the view that the existing tools for managing exchange rate volatility should be reexamined in preparation for Korea’s joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and that overseas markets for direct won trading needed to be gradually adjusted in ways that encourage private sector participation. The member also noted that it should be examined whether shrinking capital markets and the growing dependence on banks undermined balanced development of the financial industry, and that preparations should be made to deal flexibly with herd behavior in the bond market. The member stressed that economic agents had not recovered from damage from the Asian Currency and Global Financial Crises, and since their tendencies and behavior generally suggested their preference for stability rather than growth, active communications with them would be important to prevent worsening of their sentiment.   

 One other member stated the opinion that it would be desirable to

 keep the Base Rate at its current level, given that, although the trend of

 growth in the fourth quarter was holding to the existing forecast overall,

 uncertainties at home and abroad surrounding future economic trends had

 grown further; given that, although consumer price movements were

 generally holding to the growth path forecast in October and the upward

 trend of consumer prices was expected to pick up, albeit at a modest

 pace, no small number of upside and downside risks were lurking and the

 movements of core inflation indicators were not well-balanced; and given

###### that, although the slack in the production sector saw slight improvement

 and labor market conditions showed overall improvement, labor force slack

 was not low, particularly with respect to youth. The member then argued

 that, since shocks from the decoupling of the real and financial business

 cycles between advanced and emerging economies had produced a risk of

 greater instability in the credit market centered around non-blue-chip

 companies in weakened industries, monitoring of crisis transmission

 channels should be strengthened and emergency preparedness should be

 modified, and increasing leverage in the private sector should be

 preemptively managed at the macroprudential level. The member also put

 forward the view that, since harmony between macroprudential and

 structural reform policies had become more important, it was necessary to

 further strengthen cooperation and coordination among policy institutions to

 seek an optimal mix of those two policies.

 Meanwhile, one member mentioned that, taking into overall

 consideration domestic and overseas economic conditions, while growth and

 prices remained generally on the path forecast last October, albeit subject

 to great uncertainty, financial stability risks had grown as the possibility of

 increased domestic and overseas financial market volatility had increased in

 line with a possible Fed rate hike in December, and as household lending

 was expected to continually show heightened growth, due mainly to

 increased housing sales prices and higher leasehold deposit prices, and to

 growth in group loans in line with the rise in the stock of new

 apartments available for sale. The member then argued that, while holding

 the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, it would be

 necessary to scrutinize the way macroeconomic and financial stability risks

 were likely to evolve in line with changes in domestic and overseas

 conditions, and in particular to keep a close watch on the US Fed’s

 monetary policy, and on changes in financial and economic conditions in

 China and other EMEs and their influences on the Korean finance sector

 and economy.

###### Another member set out the view that, while holding the Base Rate at

 the current level for the intermeeting period, going forward it was

 necessary to closely monitor the evolution of downside risks to the global

 economy, shifts in major countries’ monetary policies, trends of exports

 and domestic demand, and trends of fluctuation in Korea’s foreign

 exchange and financial markets, while seeking appropriate policy measures

 related to the above. After noting that the Bank of Korea should be on

 the alert to the possibility that credit risk aversion, which had increased in

 certain industries of late, may rapidly spread to other industries, the

 member argued that, while carrying out corporate restructuring without

 delay, the relevant policy authorities should make preemptive efforts to

 prevent the spread of funding difficulties of blue-chip companies and avert

 an excessive expansion of financial market volatility. The member noted

 that volatility in the domestic foreign exchange market had been relatively

 high compared with other countries, and the high volatility was likely to

 continue going forward due to the co-existence of factors causing the

 depreciation of the won, such as a US policy rate hike and the deepening

 economic slowdown in China, and factors causing the appreciation of the

 won, including a trend of surplus in the Korean current account and the

 expansion of monetary easing in major countries. The member went on to

 present the opinion that the foreign exchange policy authorities should

 therefore scrupulously and preemptively examine potential risk factors,

 while developing appropriate measures to bring about market stability

 under different possible scenarios.

 One other member noted, in view of overall financial and economic

 conditions domestically and overseas during the past month, domestic

 economic activity and price movements were judged to have not strayed

 far from the path forecast in October, but the uncertainties surrounding

 external conditions, such as a possible policy rate hike by the Fed and the

 Chinese economic slowdown, had increased. The member then set out the

###### view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged this

 month while further strengthening the monitoring of growth in household

 debt, including group loans, and of corporate restructuring conditions. The

 member commented that, although employment presented a favorable

 picture, with the number of persons employed increasing and the

 employment-to-population ratio rising, youth employment remained weak as

 the educated unemployment problem deepened, and thus policy efforts

 should be strengthened to address this problem.

 Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

 Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all members.

< Ref >

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

 leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting

 period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Board considers that

 the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, and

 that the modest improvements in the euro area have continued.

 Economic growth in emerging market countries including China has

 meanwhile continued to slow. The Board forecasts that the global

 economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a

 moderate pace, centering around advanced economies such as the

 US, but judges that the possibilities exist of its being affected by

 heightened international financial market volatility due for example

 to a shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, and by the

 weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries.

 □ Looking at the Korean economy, although domestic demand

 activities such as consumption and investment have sustained their

 paces of recovery, while economic agents’ sentiments have

 improved somewhat, the trend of declining exports has persisted.

 On the employment front, the number of persons employed has

 increased steadily, and in October the unemployment rate fell

 compared to that in October of last year while the

 employment-to-population ratio maintained the same level. The

 Board forecasts that the domestic economy will continue its

 recovery going forward, centering around domestic demand

 activities, but in view of external economic conditions judges the

 uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high.

###### □ Consumer price inflation rose from 0.6% the month before to 0.9%

 in October, due mainly to expansions in the extents of increase in

 agricultural product prices and in service fees. Core inflation

 excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also rose to

 2.3%, from 2.1% in September. Looking ahead the Board forecasts

 that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects

 of the low oil prices. In the housing market, the upward trends of

 sales and leasehold deposit prices have persisted in both Seoul and

 its surrounding areas and the rest of the country.

 □ In the domestic financial markets, stock prices, after having risen in

 line mostly with increases in stock prices in major countries and

 with net inflows of securities investment funds of foreigners, have

 fallen back as the likelihood of a policy rate hike by the US

 Federal Reserve has grown. After having appreciated, the Korean

 won has depreciated against both the US dollar and the Japanese

 yen. Long-term market interest rates have risen, in response mainly

 to increases in interest rates in major countries and the

 improvements in domestic economic indicators. Bank household

 lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level substantially

 exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans.

 □ Looking ahead, while working to sustain the recovery of economic

 growth, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain

 price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to

 financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor the trend

 of increase in household debt and external risk factors such as any

 changes in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy or in

 economic conditions in emerging market countries including China,

 as well as the trends of capital flows.
