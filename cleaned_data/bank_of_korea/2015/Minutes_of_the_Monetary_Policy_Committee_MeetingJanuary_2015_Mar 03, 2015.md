###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

 After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’,

 ‘FX and International Finance’ and the ‘Financial Markets’, the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following

 areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that,
 although the U.S. had maintained favorable growth, the trends of recovery in the euro area and Japan had been weak and economic growth in China had continued to slow. Members also judged that risk aversion in the international financial markets had heightened, and that the U.S. dollar had continued to strengthen.

 As to the domestic economy, many members noted that growth in the
 fourth quarter of 2014 had not been strong, due mainly to contractions in consumption and construction investment. Some members asserted that the trend of future economic recovery was being maintained, even though the growth forecast for 2015 had been adjusted downward due to the sluggishness during Q4 2014.

 Concerning the domestic financial markets meanwhile, members pointed
 out that stock prices had declined, long-term market interest rates had fallen back after having risen, and household lending had increased considerably for the third consecutive month.

 With regard to prices, members mentioned that the rate of consumer
 price inflation was 0.8%, lower than in the preceding month, affected chiefly by the fall in international oil prices. Some members called for attention to be paid going forward to the trend of inflation expectations, which was on a downward path.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 domestic and international economic environments and their future

 outlooks, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level

 for the intermeeting period.

 One member observed that it would be desirable to keep the Base

 Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, and added that careful

 watch should be kept on the future trends of changes in downside risks to

 the global economy, on the trends of exports and domestic demand, on

 the possibility of entrenchment of low inflation, on changes in international

 oil prices and their effects, on both qualitative and quantitative household

 debt trends, and on fluctuations in the Korean won exchange rate and in

 foreign capital flows.

 Another member stated that, when financial and economic conditions at

 home and abroad were looked at comprehensively, on the external front

 the paces of economic improvement were weak in major countries apart

 from the U.S., and risk aversion related to the sharp fall in international

 oil prices was rising, while domestically the economy was showing signs

 of a slowdown in the pace of improvement in economic activity due to

 somewhat lackluster real economic indicators. He went on to express his

 opinion that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current

 level for the intermeeting period, and added that, while trying to take into

 account growth and price-related risks along with risks to financial stability

 in a balanced way, amid the uncertainties stemming from changes in

 global conditions, preparations should be made to enable a timely future

 policy response.

###### One other member commented that, while the negative output gap was

 now expected to widen, and the time of its closing to also be delayed as

 the fourth quarter 2014 GDP growth rate had been below expectations, the

 negative inflation gap was widening and the downside risks to the price

 path were high as well since international oil prices were expected to

 remain at a low level for some time following their sharp decline. He

 went on to express his view that it was necessary to hold the Base Rate

 at its current level for the intermeeting period while carefully observing

 the future trends of all related indicators and information variables, since,

 although the widening negative inflation and output gaps could be

 interpreted as offering room for further Base Rate adjustments, the

 uncertainties accompanying rate adjustments were also not small.

 One member meanwhile noted, in support of his agreement that it

 would be best to maintain the Base Rate at its current level for the

 intermeeting period, the points that the 3.4% economic growth projection

 for 2015, although lower than the previous forecast, did not differ greatly

 from the Korean economy’s potential growth rate, while the

 quarter-on-quarter growth rate of 1% was comparatively favourable, that

 the downward adjustment of the consumer price inflation outlook had been

 due mainly to the supply-side factor of declining international oil prices

 rather than to any contraction in demand, and that further care needed be

 devoted to ensuring financial stability, since household lending had been

 showing heightened growth recently and there were several factors causing

 instability in the international financial markets.

 Another member, after also expressing the view that it would be

 desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting

 period. He went on to note that if non-customs cleared exports were

 included in Korean exports then the situation would be more problematic

 than with exports calculated on a customs clearance basis alone, and that

 this needed to be borne in mind. He proceeded to argue that, since

###### negative effects on Korean exports due to the Japanese yen’s weakening

 seemed to be gradually appearing, efforts should be made to strengthen

 the monitoring of the movements in the won/yen exchange rate and to

 reduce its volatility. He pointed out further, concerning the government

 moves to improve the household debt structure, that the plan to convert

 short-term variable-rate loans held by banks to long-term fixed-rate loans,

 and have the Korea Housing Finance Corporation then acquire and

 securitize them, could actually increase household debt by enlarging banks’

 lending capacities. He then suggested that the government’s measure to

 foster a corporate-style housing rental business was deemed a more

 effective plan for reducing household debt, and that the Bank of Korea

 should thus also take an interest in it by for instance devising methods to

 support it.

 One other member mentioned that, in view of overall domestic and

 international financial and economic conditions, prices were likely to

 maintain a very low rate of increase for a considerable time, influenced

 by the sharp decline in international oil prices, while the path of growth

 of the Korean economy appeared to have shifted downward a bit due

 mainly to the slowdown in the global economy and the prolongation of

 weak sentiments. He then disclosed his opinion that, considering that the

 trend of recovery in the Korean economy was being maintained, even if it

 had weakened, while the effects of the government’s fiscal expenditure

 expansion and the recent Base Rate cuts needed to be closely watched for

 the time being, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current

 level for the intermeeting period.

###### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

 Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all members:

 Monetary Policy Decision

 - The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

###### today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.00% for the

 intermeeting period.

 - Based on currently available information the Committee considers

###### that, although the trend of a solid economic recovery in the US has

 been sustained, the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro

 area has continued while economic growth in emerging market

 countries such as China has slowed somewhat. The Committee

 forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery

 going forward, centering around the US, but judges that the

 possibility exists of its being affected by changes in the monetary

 policies of major countries, by the weakening of economic growth

 in the euro area and China, by financial and economic unrest in the

 oil-producing countries, and by geopolitical risks.

 - Looking at the Korean economy, while export growth has slowed

###### somewhat the Committee judges that the recovery of domestic

 demand has not been strong and the sentiments of economic agents

 remain weak. On the employment front, the number of persons

 employed has expanded steadily, led by increases in the

 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee

 expects that the domestic economy will show a modest trend of

 recovery going forward, but that the negative output gap will persist

 for a considerable time.

- Consumer price inflation fell from 1.0% the month before to 0.8%

###### in December, due mainly to an increase in the scale of decline in

 petroleum product prices. Core inflation excluding agricultural and

 petroleum product prices registered 1.6%, as in November. Looking

 ahead the Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise from

 the second half of this year, after remaining at a low level despite

 the hike in cigarette prices under the influence for example of

 international oil price movements. In the housing market, leasehold

 deposit and sales prices continued their uptrends—centering around

 Seoul and its surrounding areas in the former case and around the

 rest of the country in the latter.

- In the domestic financial markets, stock prices have fallen due for

###### example to stock price declines in other major countries and to the

 net selling of domestic stocks by foreigners. After rising, long-term

 market interest rates have fallen back. The Korean won has

 appreciated against the US dollar, due mainly to the widening of

 the current account surplus and to a slowdown in Japanese yen

 depreciation, while appreciating against the yen as the

 synchronization between movements of the won and the yen has

 weakened. Bank household lending has sustained its substantial

 uptrend, led by mortgage loans.

- Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth

###### the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price

 stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial

 stability. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors

 such as international oil prices and shifts in major countries’

 monetary policies, as well as developments related to the spare

 capacity in the domestic economy and the trends of household debt

 and capital flows.
