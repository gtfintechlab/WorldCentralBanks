###### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussions on the Current Economic Situation2)

 After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’,

 ‘FX and International Finance’ and the ‘Financial Markets’, the discussions

 of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following

 areas:

 With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the

 trend of economic growth in the US had been sustained, driven by

 consumption and exports, and that the pattern of mild improvement in the

 euro area and Japan had continued. Meanwhile, economic uncertainty in

 China had increased with growth continuing to slow. Members judged that

 investor sentiment concerning emerging market economies had contracted

 greatly in international financial markets, owing chiefly to expectations of

 the US Fed’s policy rate hike and to the unrest in the Chinese equity

 markets.

 As to the domestic economy, members noted that, while the economy

 showed modest economic recovery due to the waning of the effects of the

 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak, exports had

 continued to decline.

 Concerning the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members

 observed that stock prices had fallen and the Korean won had depreciated

 against the US dollar, chiefly under the influence of outflows of

 foreigners’ portfolio investment funds. They also noted that foreign

 exchange market volatility had risen greatly, affected by the devaluation of

 the Chinese yuan.

 With regard to prices, members observed that, despite the reduction in

###### electricity tariffs, consumer price inflation had still come in at 0.7%, the

 same as that of the month previous, owing, for example, to hikes in public

 transport fares. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product

 prices was 2.0%, also the same as that of the preceding month.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

 domestic and international economic environments and the future outlook

 for them both, it would be desirable this month to hold the Base Rate at

 its current level for the intermeeting period.

 Among them, one member assessed that, although domestic economic

 activity and price movements had evidenced some heightening of

 uncertainty due to increasing volatility in the external sector, they were

 judged to have not strayed far from the path forecast in July. The

 member then went on to state his view that the Board should hold the

 Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period. He argued,

 however, that a close watch should be kept on spillover effects from the

 devaluation of the yuan in the future, since volatility had been mounting

 with outflows of foreign portfolio investment funds, and stock prices and

 the exchange rate fluctuating greatly, influenced by the international

 financial market unrest. The member also argued that the Board should do

 all it could to manage external sector risk by refining and updating its

 contingency plans in readiness for any sudden reversal of capital flows. 

 Another member stated his view that it would be desirable to hold the

 Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period. He pointed out

 that, although foreign portfolio investment funds had experienced large

 outflows in July and the won had depreciated against the dollar, this was

 attributable to a weakening of the won in line with the global strength of

 the US dollar, and to some EMEs’ need to secure foreign currency

 liquidity, rather than to changes in Korea’s economic fundamentals. He

 then went on to express the view that, since Korea was running a large

4

###### current account surplus, provided domestic real economic and international

 economic conditions did not deviate greatly from their expected trajectory,

 the possibilities of massive foreign portfolio investment fund outflows and

 a consequent rapid weakening of the Korean won could be largely

 discounted. He went on to argue that, given these circumstances, the sharp

 depreciation of the Korean won, prompted by the abrupt devaluation of

 the Chinese yuan, appeared to be attributable to excessive herd behavior

 on the part of economic agents. Appropriate management of this state of

 affairs was thus called for and there should be unflagging efforts to lessen

 exchange rate volatility.

 One other member took the view that while, despite the high degree

 of uncertainty, growth and consumer prices were not seen to be deviating

 far from the path forecast last July, risks in terms of financial stability

 were considered to have grown, with household lending maintaining strong

 growth and stock prices and exchange rates showing heightened volatility

 due mainly to outflows of foreigners’ securities investment funds, affected

 chiefly by expectations of the US Fed’s policy rate hike and financial and

 economic instability in vulnerable emerging market countries. The member

 elaborated this by stating that in his opinion while keeping the Base Rate

 at its current level for the intermeeting period, the Bank should redouble

 its focus on the US Fed’s monetary policy normalization process and the

 movements of the Chinese yuan’s exchange rate, and the likely

 reverberations these two factors would have for the Korean financial and

 real economic sectors － in/outflows of foreign investment funds and

 movements of price variables such as interest and exchange rates.

 Meanwhile, one member stated his belief that it would be appropriate

 to leave the Base Rate unchanged this month. He argued that although the

 growth path for the second half was expected to remain as originally

 forecast, the upward and downward uncertainties surrounding the growth

 path were growing even further due to domestic and external factors.

###### Meanwhile, the significant month-on-month increase in core inflation and

 the gradual easing of instability in inflation expectations were attributable

 more to supply-side factors than demand-side ones. A careful watch was

 therefore needed on the underlying trend of demand-side inflation

 pressures. Apart from this, the slack in the production sector showed little

 sign of improvement and that in the employment sector was widening

 somewhat. The member added that more attention needed to be paid to

 risk factors, including the possibility of capital outflows, shrugging off

 Korean economic fundamentals, accelerating to a greater extent than

 expected in line with changes in global risk conditions, the possibility of a

 further Chinese economic slowdown and additional yuan depreciation, and

 the burgeoning household indebtedness showing strong pro-cyclicality to

 the accelerating upward momentum of the housing market. 

 Another member stated his view that financial stability risks including

 household debt should be monitored closely, holding the Base Rate at its

 current level for the intermeeting period, keeping a close watch on the

 effects of monetary easing policies and expansion of fiscal expenditure,

 and paying attention to changes in global financial and economic

 conditions, the extent of their spillover effects on the Korean financial

 markets and economy and whether economic agents were regaining their

 confidence. The member argued that, in order for the Korean economy to

 shift toward one based on innovation, it would be necessary to break with

 the incrementalist approach and address future tasks on the basis of clear

 perspectives and groundbreaking measures. The member went on to present

 as immediate challenges the examination of emerging market economy

 risks and pursuit of measures to counter them, the stable management of

 long-term interest rates and exchange rates, and the in-depth analysis of

 the Chinese economy, and stressed the necessity of promoting the

 upgrading of the monetary policy framework to effectively handle the

 changes in domestic and external conditions, developing new

 employment-related statistics while constructing a framework for the

6

###### assessment of employment indicators-based economic trends, and

 conducting research on the effects of the spread of electronic payment

 services and the entry of specialist Internet banks and make preparations

 in readiness.

 One other member also set out his views as to the desirability of

 holding the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period. The

 member assessed the four Base Rate cuts since the second half of last

 year as having contributed to enhancing the vigor of the Korean economy

 by improving corporate and households’ access to loans and lessening the

 lending rate burden. He mentioned that, although in the course of this the

 excessive growth of household debt had imposed a burden on the

 operation of the easing policy, it would be advisable to address this

 through macro-prudential rather than monetary policy. The member also

 expressed the opinion that while the comprehensive household debt

 management measure that the government had recently announced was

 expected to have some limited effect, more aggressive measures should be

 taken additionally without hesitation as and when they were called for.

 The member also stressed that the monetary authority should examine

 all possible policy measures and consider how to implement them in

 response to the slow growth and low inflation dragging on.

 Meanwhile, the member emphasized that, as volatility would very

 likely increase in the financial and foreign exchange markets given the

 gathering expectations of the US Fed’s hike of interest rates at an early

 stage, the dollars’ global strength, the possibility of major countries’

 competitive currency devaluations and the prospects for the Korean

 economy’s huge current account surplus, the financial authorities should

 keep a close watch on financial and foreign exchange market trends and if

 and when needed employ policy measures to ensure orderly market in a

 timely manner.

###### Ⅳ. Results of Deliberation on Monetary Policy Directions

 Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was

 compiled with the unanimous consent of all members.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to

 leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting

 period.

 □ Based on currently available information the Board considers that

 the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, and

 that the improvements in the euro area have continued as well.

 Economic growth in emerging market countries including China has

 meanwhile continued to slow. The Board forecasts that the global

 economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering

 around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the

 possibility exists of its being affected by heightened international

 financial market volatility due to a shift in the US Federal

 Reserve’s monetary policy and to the devaluation of the Chinese

 yuan, and by the weakening of economic growth in emerging

 market countries.

 □ Looking at the Korean economy, exports have continued their trend

 of decline but consumption and the sentiments of economic agents,

 after having contracted due mainly to the shock from the Middle

 East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak, appear to have

 improved. On the employment front, the employment-to-population

 ratio in July maintained the same level as that during July of last

 year, but the trend of increase in the number of persons employed

 slowed and, due mainly to an expansion in job search activities, the

 unemployment rate rose compared to that in July last year. The

 Board forecasts that the domestic economy will show a trend of

 recovery going forward, owing chiefly to the expansionary

###### macroeconomic policies and to the ending of the MERS outbreak,

 but judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high.

 □ Despite cuts in electricity charges, consumer price inflation

 registered 0.7% in July, the same as in June, in line mainly with

 the expansion in the extent of increases in service prices. Core

 inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices was

 2.0% in July, the same as in June. Looking ahead the Board

 forecasts that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to

 the effects of low oil prices. In the housing market, the upward

 trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have continued in both

 Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country.

 □ In the domestic financial markets, influenced mostly by expectations

 of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and by the

 devaluation of the Chinese yuan, stock prices have fallen and the

 Korean won has depreciated sharply against both the US dollar and

 the Japanese yen. Long-term market interest rates have fallen

 slightly, in response mainly to interest rate movements in major

 countries. Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase

 at a level substantially exceeding that of recent years, led by

 mortgage loans.

 □ Looking ahead, while working to sustain the recovery of economic

 growth, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain

 price stability over the medium-term horizon and pay attention to

 financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor the trend

 of increase in household debt and external risk factors such as a

 possible shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and

 financial instability in some emerging economies, as well as the

 trend of capital flows.
