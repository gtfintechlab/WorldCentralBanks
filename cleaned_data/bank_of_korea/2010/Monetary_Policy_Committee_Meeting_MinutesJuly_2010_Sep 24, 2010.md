###### Ⅱ. Discussion of Economic Situation (Summary)2)

After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Domestic and Overseas Economic

Developments' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions among members

of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas:

With regard to the global economy, most members agreed that emerging

markets maintained favorable movements and advanced economies including

the US continued to recover, although their paces of growth had slowed

somewhat. However, some members assessed global economic uncertainty

to be increasing further, given the instability of certain economic indicators in

advanced countries and their moves toward fiscal policy tightening.

As for recent domestic economic developments, most members'

assessment was that the domestic economy remained on a steady upward

path, led by stronger exports and improved domestic demand. One member

expressed the view that, with the GDP gap turning positive, the economy had

entered a fully-fledged expansionary phase.

In this connection, most members noted that manufacturing production

continued to rise and that exports maintained solidly-based growth with the

turn for the better in external economic conditions.

They also evaluated the recovery in the private sector, such as in facilities

investment and consumption, as becoming more pronounced.

However, some members commented that, taking into account the fact

that services production had shifted to a decrease and that the index of

leading economic indicators had posted a decline for the fifth consecutive

month, economic uncertainties still existed, as before, and this needed to be

monitored more cautiously.

Regarding the future outlook, most members forecasted that the economy

would remain on the rise and that the trend of sound growth would continue.

One member, meanwhile, anticipated that the growth rate would fall somewhat

in the second half of the year, in reaction to the strong growth during the

first half.

With respect to employment, members considered the employment situation

markedly improved, as shown by the sharp increase in the number of persons

employed, particularly in the private sector. One member, however, pointed to

the possibility of the trend of improvement being restricted from the second

half onward, owing to restructuring in some industries and the termination of

the government's public sector 'Hope and Work Project' job-creation program.

As to the domestic financial markets, some members pointed out that

long-term market interest rates had risen considerably, reflecting the improved

economic situation, although stock price and foreign exchange rate volatility

had increased under the influence of destabilizing external factors.

With regard to consumer price inflation, many members forecast that,

although having remained in the mid-2% range during the first half, it would

accelerate further, as demand-pull pressures would mount in accordance with

the faster-than-expected economic recovery and rising cost-push pressures

due to hikes in import prices and public utility charges. In particular, one

member pointed out that attention needed to be paid to the fact that it

usually took a long period of time for inflation expectations to stabilize once

they had risen, due to their trait of persistence.

In connection with the real estate market, some members mentioned that

it remained sluggish, with housing sales prices falling at a faster pace in

Seoul and its surrounding areas. One member meanwhile argued that the

depressed real estate market in the Seoul metropolitan area had significantly

raised delinquency rates at savings banks which had heavy exposure to

project financing loans, that might damage their asset quality.

###### Ⅲ. Discussion Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in the

Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

Many members agreed that a change in the monetary policy stance could

not be postponed any longer, given the current situation in which the

domestic economy continued on an upward track and inflationary pressures

were mounting. Some pointed out the possibility that maintaining the Base

Rate at its current level, set under the assumption of zero growth, could give

rise, in a situation in which GDP was expected to grow at around 6%

annually, to a number of economic distortions such as rises in asset prices

and increases in leverage, along with delays in household and corporate

restructuring and a consequent weakening of potential growth.

Some members spoke of the need to secure the policy capacity to

respond to a new economic shock, if the downside risks to growth should

become acute.

Some other members noted in addition that, given the time lag before

interest rate policy had an effect, it was necessary to take preemptive

monetary policy measures, as there was a possibility of consumer price

inflation exceeding the 3% midpoint of the inflation target from the second half

of the year. In particular, some among them pointed out that if the central

bank missed the right timing, overheating of the economy and higher prices

could appear, and this might increase the costs of raising interest rates, such

as by requiring an expanded degree of policy rate adjustment. Other than

that, an opinion was expressed that raising the Base Rate meant adjusting

the degree of the accommodative policy stance step by step to bring it back

to a neutral level, and would not mean a shifting of the monetary policy

stance toward tightening. The opinion was also raised that the shock from

the policy rate adjustment was unlikely to be grave, as market expectations of

a policy rate increase had already formed to some degree.

Another member, on the other hand, expressed the view that it was

desirable to keep the accommodative monetary policy stance in place for the

time being, given that prices were currently relatively stable, the real estate

market was depressed, and the uncertainties surrounding the domestic and

foreign economies were deepening.

###### Ⅳ. Remarks by Government Representative

Prior to the members' arguments regarding the Base Rate, the Chairman

gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance present at the

meeting, who explained the government's position on and assessment of the

current economic situation and its view on mutual savings banks' handling of

PF loans and corporate restructuring. After his explanation, he left the

meeting.

Monetary Policy Decision

 - The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today

to raise the Base Rate from 2.00% of its current level to 2.25%.

 - In the global economy, emerging market economies have sustained

their favorable performance, while the economies of major advanced
countries such as the US have largely continued their recovery trend.
The risks that international financial market unrest due to the
government debt problems in some European countries and heightened
volatility of growth in economic activity in major countries recur at any
time cannot be ruled out.

 - The upward trend of domestic economic activity has been maintained.
Exports have held to their strong upward track, domestic demand such
as consumption and investment has steadily increased and, led by the
private sector, labor market conditions have shown an improving trend.

Domestic economic activity is expected to continue on an upward
track, even with the presence of overseas risk factors.

 - Consumer price inflation has so far remained in a range of somewhat
above 2% but a little below 3%, but in the future, upward pressures
are expected to build continuously owing to the increase in
demand-pull pressures associated with the continued upturn in
economic activity. In the real estate market, housing sales prices
have declined in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while those in other
areas have sustained a highly upward trend.

 - In the financial markets, long term market interest rates have
increased, reflecting domestic economic conditions and, stock prices
and exchange rates have exhibited high volatility due to the influence
of overseas risk factors. The scale of the growth in mortgage lending
has widened in response chiefly to low lending rates, even though
house transactions have been inactive.

- Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain the accommodative policy

stance in such a way as to help the economy sustain its sound

growth on a foundation of price stability and, in carrying out policy, it

will take overall account of financial and economic conditions at home

and abroad.

 - However, Mr. Kang, Myung Hun clearly dissented from raising the Base
Rate by 0.25%p and argued that it should be maintained at its current
level.
