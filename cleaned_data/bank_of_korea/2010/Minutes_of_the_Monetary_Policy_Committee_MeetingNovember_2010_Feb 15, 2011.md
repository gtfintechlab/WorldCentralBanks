##### Ⅱ. Discussion of Economic Situation (Summary)2)

###### After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions among members of the

 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas:

 Many members evaluated the global economy as having generally

 kept up a moderate pace of recovery, with emerging countries continuing

 to lead the recovery and advanced economies also showing some

 improvements. Members’ assessment of the future outlook diverged,

 however ― with some members expressing skeptical views citing concerns

 about fiscal crisis in European countries, the high unemployment rate in

 the US and a fall in industrial production, while others anticipating that

 the additional quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve would reduce

 the risks of a double dip recession or deflation in the US economy.

 Concerning recent domestic economic developments, most members'

 judgment was that the domestic economy remained on an upward path,

 with daily average exports hitting a record high and consumption growing,

 although certain indicators including facilities investment had temporarily

 exhibited slowing rates of increase. However, some members assessed the

 growth momentum to be weakening to some extent, in light for example

 of the declines in the leading/coincident composite indexes.

 Regarding the future outlook, many members anticipated that the

 domestic economy would remain on an upward track, despite potential

 downside risk factors on the external front including the reemergence of

 fiscal problems in some European countries and the run-ups in global

 commodity prices.

###### With respect to employment, some members mentioned that the

 number of persons employed in the private sector had continued to

 increase in October as well, and that nominal wages had also been on the

 rise.

 Some members assessed the domestic financial markets as having

 remained stable overall, with foreign currency funding conditions appearing

 generally smooth, amid a declining exchange rate and rising stock prices

 due mostly to the sustained inflows of foreign investment funds. Some

 members pointed out that long-term market rates had rebounded sharply,

 however, affected by the high rate of increase in the CPI and by

 expectations of hikes in the Bank of Korea Base Rate since mid-October.

 Members noted that consumer price inflation had risen to 4.1% in

 October, influenced by the soaring agricultural product prices. Many

 forecasted inflationary pressures to continue, given the persistence of the

 upward economic trend, the rises in global commodity prices, the surges

 in agricultural product prices and the strong inflation expectations.

 However, they saw consumer price inflation as likely to fall somewhat as

 vegetable prices stabilize in the coming months.

 As to the real estate market, members noted that, as in the previous

 month, leasehold deposits had remained on the rise, whereas housing

 prices had maintained their contrasting trends ― falling in Seoul and its

 surrounding areas while increasing in other parts of the country. One

 member commented that, with real interest rates having fallen to negative

 levels, if the inflows of foreign capital continued, housing prices could

 register higher-than-expected rates of increase in the future.

##### Ⅲ. Remarks by Government Representative

###### Prior to the members' discussion regarding the Base Rate, the

 Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance,

 who explained the government's assessment of the current economic

 situation, the trend of prices and the policy direction in response, the

 progress made on measures to mitigate capital flow volatility, and then left

 the meeting.

 With regard to the recent economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister

 mentioned that, although the pace of economic recovery had slowed in the

 second half, GDP growth for the year was expected to slightly surpass the

 5.8% government forecast, as the trends of recovery in growth and

 employment had generally been sustained.

 As to prices, the 1st Vice Minister disclosed that the government

 saw prices as the most essential element for stability in the lives of

 ordinary people, and was consequently concentrating its efforts to contain

 concerns over price instability, by monitoring prices and improving its

 response systems, while focusing on early stabilization of the prices of

 agricultural, livestock and fisheries products including vegetables.

 The 1st Vice Minister also revealed that active efforts were being

 made to formulate pre-emptive measures for coping with external factors

 causing uncertainty, including excessive capital inflows and offshore

 speculative transactions.

##### Ⅳ. Discussion Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in

 the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

###### Most members agreed that it was necessary to raise the Base Rate,

 since the sustained economic upturn had caused a build-up of demand-pull

 pressures, while upside risk to the price path had expanded greatly with

 the run-up in commodity prices, the high price and wage growth in China,

 and the continuing expansion in global liquidity. One member pointed out

 that, as interest rates had remained low for a long time, there was a risk

 of their adverse side effects increasing. Another member expressed the

 opinion that, taking into account the widespread expectations of a Base

 Rate hike among general economic agents, the rate should be raised.

 After the discussions detailed above, members agreed unanimously to

 raise the Base Rate by 0.25%p.

###### < Ref > Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to raise the Base Rate from 2.25% of its current level to

 2.50%.

 □ In the global economy, emerging market economies have sustained

 their favorable performance, and the economies of major advanced countries have largely continued their moderate recovery trend.

 Looking ahead, the possibility of the heightened volatility of

 economic activity and exchange rates in major countries acting as a

 risk factor for the global economy cannot be ruled out.

 □ The underlying upward trend of domestic business activity has been

 maintained. Even though facilities investment has faltered, exports

 have sustained their buoyancy and consumption has increased. And,

 led by the private sector, labor market conditions have shown an improving trend.

 The domestic economy is expected to continue on an underlying

 upward track, even in the presence of external risk.

 □ Consumer price inflation has increased further, driven mainly by

 farm product prices. Going forwards, inflation is expected to

 decrease somewhat due to the renewed stability of vegetable prices;

 however, upward pressures are expected to continue, being associated with the continued upswing in activity and the run-up in

 international raw material prices. In the real estate market, the

 scale of the decrease in housing sales prices in Seoul and its

 surrounding areas has narrowed, with the upward trend of housing

 sales prices in other areas being maintained.

###### □ In the financial markets, amid continued inflows of foreign portfolio

 investment funds, stock prices have risen, the Korean won has

 appreciated, and in response chiefly to the high inflation rates, long

 term market interest rates have rebounded from their deep decline.

 Mortgage lending has continued to increase on a relatively large

 scale, even though house transactions have been inactive.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy in such a way as to help the economy maintain price stability, while

 sustaining sound growth. In carrying out policy, it will take overall

 account of financial and economic conditions at home and abroad.
