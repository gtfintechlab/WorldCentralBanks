##### Ⅱ. Discussion of Economic Situation (Summary)2)

After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea'

and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions among members of the Monetary

Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas:

Many members commented that, although the global economy remained

generally on a track of recovery, uncertainty about world economic conditions

was still high, as the central banks of major advanced countries were expanding

quantitative easing in response to the slowdown of economic recovery. Some

pointed out that a sharp conflict over exchange rates between major advanced

countries and emerging countries could act as a new risk factor for the global

economy.

Concerning recent domestic economic developments, most members'

assessment was that the domestic economy remained on an upward path, led by

strong exports and improvements in domestic demand including consumption and

facilities investment. However, some members assessed the growth momentum

to be weakening to some extent, as production activities in manufacturing and

service industries showed signs of flattening out and the coincident composite

index shifted to a decrease.

Regarding the future outlook, many members anticipated that the domestic

economy would remain on an upward track, while pointing out that concern still

existed that a slower recovery in the global economy, high exchange rate

volatility, and a sharp run-up in global commodity prices might act as downside

risk factors for its growth path.

With respect to employment, some members evaluated the employment

situation as continuing to improve, with the number of persons employed in the

private sector having shown a month-on-month increase of 20,000 in August.

Some members assessed the domestic financial markets as having remained

stable, with sustained inflows of foreign investment funds causing a fall in bond

rates and a rise in stock prices, while the foreign currency funding situation

appeared generally smooth.

Many members pointed out that consumer price inflation in September

stood above the midpoint of the intermediate inflation target at 3.6%, affected by

the soaring prices of vegetables and other agricultural products resulting from

unusual weather conditions. Some forecasted that, considering the likelihood of

mounting demand-pull pressures exerted by the economic upturn, and of hikes in

global commodity prices and public utility charges, consumer prices would show

a rapid rate of increase going forward. Meanwhile, other members mentioned

that, with core inflation remaining low at under 2%, if the authorities strive to

control inflation expectations from rising and to stabilize short-term supply and

demand of agricultural products, then the likelihood of an overall rise in the

price level could be minimized.

As to the real estate market, most members noted that housing prices had

continued to fall in Seoul and its surrounding areas while continuing to rise in

the provinces, and that leasehold deposits were on the rise nationwide.

##### Ⅲ. Remarks by Government Representative

Prior to the members' discussion regarding the Base Rate, the Chairman

gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, who explained

the government's assessment of the current economic situation, the trend and

outlook for prices, foreign capital investment trends and so on, and then left the

meeting.

With regard to the recent economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister

assessed the economy as basically continuing its recovery, and attributed some

poor showing of a few real economic indicators to temporary factors. He

pointed out that some new external factors making for uncertainty were

emerging, however, including the intensification of disputes among countries over

exchange rates and signs of a renewed run-up in global grain prices.

As to prices, the 1st Vice Minister disclosed that a number of short- and

long-term schemes to stabilize supply and demand would be drawn up and put

into place, given the recent rise in prices due to supply-demand factors including

the vegetable price hikes stemming from unseasonable temperatures. He

anticipated, however, that even if vegetable prices might well stabilize in a short

time, the general price level was expected to be somewhat high in the coming

months, influenced by a base period effect and so on.

Meanwhile, with regard to foreign investment capital, the 1st Vice Minister

said that, since inflows of foreign capital might accelerate in the event of

additional liquidity supply by major advanced countries, their trends should be

closely monitored and countermeasures against them would be taken if needed.

##### Ⅳ. Discussion Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in the

Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

Most members agreed that, although the Base Rate needed to be restored

to a normal level before long, in view of the high economic growth and

inflation rates, it should be left at its current level this month considering that

economic uncertainty at home and abroad remained high and that tension

between countries over foreign exchange rates had recently been escalating

further. In particular, one member expressed the opinion that a rise in the Base

Rate could widen the gap between domestic and overseas interest rates and

accelerate capital inflows, leading to a sharp fall in exchange rates. This might

then gravely undermine exports.

One member argued, however, in view of the abundant international

liquidity, that even keeping the Base Rate on hold might not lead to a reduction

in foreign investment fund inflows or the disappearance of downward pressure

on exchange rates. He added that, on the contrary, the danger of policy failure

might be increased because of the inadequate preemptive policy response to

inflation risks.

After the discussions detailed above, members agreed by majority vote to

hold the Bank of Korea Base Rate at its current level. However, Mr. Choi,

Dosoung clearly dissented from this decision and argued that the Base Rate should

be raised by 0.25%p.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 - The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to

maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.25%) for the intermeeting

period.

 - In the global economy, emerging market economies have sustained their

favorable performance, and the economies of major advanced countries

have largely continued their moderate recovery trend, even though the

pace of the recovery in the US economy has slowed somewhat. Looking

ahead, there exists the possibility of the heightened volatility of economic

activity and exchange rates in major countries acting as a risk factor for

the global economy.

 - The underlying upward trend of domestic business activity has been

maintained. Even though consumption has faltered, exports have sustained

their buoyancy and facilities investment has increased. And, led by the

private sector, labor market conditions have shown an improving trend.

The domestic economy is expected to continue on an underlying upward

track, even in the presence of external risk.

 - Consumer price inflation has increased due to a sudden rise in farm

product prices, and in the future, upward pressures on the demand side

are expected to continue, being associated with the continued upswing in

activity. In the real estate market, housing sales prices have continued to

decline in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while those in other areas

have maintained their increase.

 - In the financial markets, stock prices have risen, the Korean won has

appreciated, and market interest rates have declined in response chiefly to

the expanded inflow of foreign portfolio investment funds. The scale of

the growth in mortgage lending has widened due to the increase in the

numbers of newly occupied apartments, even though house transactions

have been inactive.

- Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy in such a

way as to help the economy maintain price stability, while sustaining

sound growth under the accommodative policy stance. In carrying out

policy, it will take overall account of financial and economic conditions

at home and abroad.
