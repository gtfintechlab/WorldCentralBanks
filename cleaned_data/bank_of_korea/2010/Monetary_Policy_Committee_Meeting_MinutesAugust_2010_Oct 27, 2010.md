###### Ⅱ. Discussion of Economic Situation (Summary)2)

After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Domestic and Overseas Economic

Developments' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions among members

of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas:

Many members commented that, although the global economy continued

to recover, economic uncertainty in major countries was increasing with the

growing possibility of an economic slowdown in the US and liquidity

management tightening in China.

As for recent domestic economic developments, most members'

assessment was that the domestic economy remained on an upward path,

led by favorable movements in exports and domestic demand. Some

members expressed the view that the economy had already passed beyond

the recovery phase and had entered an expansionary phase.

In this connection, most members evaluated growth in the private sector,

such as facilities investment and consumption, as expanding. One member,

in particular, forecasted that the trend of growth in facilities investment would

continue, citing that the average manufacturing operation ratio had recorded

its highest level since October 1987.

Some members, however, pointed out that the effects of the economic

recovery had not been spreading to the entire economy, with service sector

output still remaining sluggish.

Many members anticipated that the domestic economy would continue on

an upward track, led by improved domestic demand, even in the presence of

external risks.

With regard to employment, members' assessment was that the overall

employment situation had maintained a trend of improvement, as shown by a

sharp increase in the number of persons employed in the private sector,

notwithstanding the slight increase in the unemployment rate in July. One

member, meanwhile, pointed to the repeated wide fluctuations in the number

of persons employed in traditional service sectors.

Members assessed the domestic financial markets as having remained

stable since the preceding month. Many members commented that

short-term market interest rates and bank deposit and loan rates had risen,

under the influence of the previous month's hike in the Base Rate, and that

stock prices had increased with the expansion in foreign portfolio investment

fund inflows.

With regard to consumer price inflation, many members forecasted that it

would accelerate gradually, due to mounting demand-pull pressures and to

hikes in global raw material prices and some public utility charges. One

member among them commented that downside risks to the inflation outlook

had also become greater than the previous month, owing to the stable

downward trend of import prices influenced by a rise in the exchange value

of the won and the persistence of low prices in the US and Japan.

As to the real estate market, most members mentioned that housing

prices remained weak, particularly in Seoul and its surrounding areas, due to

the sluggishness of house sales. Meanwhile, regarding the downward trend

seen in housing prices despite the economy's entry to an expansionary

phase, one member pointed to the possibility that housing price fluctuations

might depend upon non-economic factors.

###### Ⅲ. Discussion Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in the

Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

Most members agreed that, although the extent of monetary easing should

be reduced further given the upward price pressures exerted by the

consistently robust domestic economy, the pace and degree of interest rate

normalization needed to be calibrated appropriately, given the heightened

uncertainties compared to the previous month surrounding major economies

including the U.S. and China and the future path of growth of the Korean

economy.

Some members pointed out that the previous month's upward adjustment

had been the first in 17 months, and that if a further rise were made the

following month in succession, this fast pace of increase might shock the

market, regardless of the size of adjustment. In particular, one member

suggested that attention needed to be paid to the possibility that consecutive

upward adjustments might lead to unexpected side effects, sparking concerns

of a drastic correction in the housing market, which had recently shown

sustained downward movements, and dampening economic agents' sentiment

severely.

In addition, many members voiced the view that, even if the Base Rate

were maintained this month at the previous month's level, since it would be

necessary to keep adjusting the degree of easing in the future, the central

bank needed to send appropriate signals to the market, so as to maintain

market expectations of the Base Rate being raised further unless financial

and economic conditions deteriorated severely.

###### Ⅳ. Remarks by Government Representative

Prior to members' discussion regarding the Base Rate, the Chairman gave

the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance present at the

meeting, who explained the government's assessment of the current economic

situation and the implementation of important policies including the introduction

of ceilings on banks' forward exchange positions, and then left the meeting.

Monetary Policy Decision

- The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to

maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.25%) for the intermeeting

period.

- In the global economy, emerging market economies have sustained their

favorable performance, while the economies of major advanced countries
have largely continued their recovery trend. The international financial
market unrest due to the government debt problems in some European
countries has eased. The possibility, however, of the heightened volatility
of economic activity in major countries acting as a risk factor cannot be
ruled out.

- The upward trend of domestic business activity has been maintained.
Exports have sustained their buoyancy, domestic demand such as
consumption and investment has steadily increased and, led by the
private sector, labor market conditions have shown an improving trend.

The domestic economy is expected to continue on an upward track, even
in the presence of external risk.

- Consumer price inflation has so far remained within a range of somewhat
above 2% but a little below 3%, but in the future, upward pressures are
expected to build continuously owing to the increase in demand-pull
pressures associated with the continued upswing in activity. In the real
estate market, housing sales prices have declined in Seoul and its
surrounding areas, while those in other areas have sustained an upward
trend.

- In the financial markets, short term market interest rates and banks'
lending and borrowing interest rates have increased due to the hike of
the Base Rate. Stock prices have risen, with the large scale inflow of
foreign portfolio investment funds. Mortgage lending has steadily expanded
in response chiefly to low lending rates, even though house transactions
have been inactive.

- Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy in such a way

as to help the economy maintain price stability, while sustaining sound

growth under the accommodative policy stance. In carrying out policy, it

will take overall account of financial and economic conditions at home and

abroad.
