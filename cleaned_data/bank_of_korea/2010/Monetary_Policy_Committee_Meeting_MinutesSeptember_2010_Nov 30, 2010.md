###### Ⅱ. Discussion of Economic Situation (Summary)2)

After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Domestic and Overseas Economic

Developments' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions among members

of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas:

Members shared the view that, although the global economy continued

its modest but steady recovery with most emerging markets improving

markedly, uncertainties were also on the rise due to concerns about possible

slowdowns in the US and Chinese economies and the reappearance of fiscal

problems in some European countries.

Concerning recent domestic economic developments, most members'

assessment was that the domestic economy remained on an upward path,

led by strong exports and the recovery of domestic demand including

consumption and facilities investment. However, some members pointed out

that there still existed some variance across industries and sectors, with

manufacturing production continuing to rise while that of services remained

sluggish.

Regarding the future outlook, many members forecasted that the

economy would remain on an upward track without deviating significantly from

the previous forecast released in July. Some members mentioned, however,

that the growing downside risks to the global economy were causing

heightened uncertainties as to the domestic economic growth path.

With respect to employment, many members evaluated the employment

situation as continuing to improve, with the gradual increase in number of

persons employed, particularly in the private sector.

As to the domestic financial markets, members assessed them as

remaining stable overall. One member mentioned that the gap between

short- and long-term interest rates had narrowed in August, with short-term

rates increasing and long-term rates falling in response to the inflows of

foreign portfolio investment funds. Another member noted that foreign

portfolio investment funds continued to flow in and the volatility of stock

prices and foreign exchange rates had decreased somewhat, although foreign

stock investment funds had shifted to a net outflow affected by the restive

global financial markets.

With regard to consumer price inflation, many members forecasted that,

although it remained in the mid-2% range, it would accelerate from the fourth

quarter of this year to exceed 3% ― the midpoint of the midium-term inflation

target. One member argued that attention needed to be paid to the fact that

the general public's inflation expectations were on the rise.

In connection with the real estate market, most members commented

that it remained sluggish, with housing sales prices falling in Seoul and its

surrounding areas and rising in the provinces.

###### Ⅲ. Discussion Related to Monetary Policy Decision

 (Summary)

The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in the

Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows :

Many members agreed that, although the extent of monetary easing

should be reduced further given the growing upward pressures exerted by the

consistently robust domestic economy and concerns about spreading of

inflation expectations among the public, the Base Rate needed to be

maintained at its current level this month, considering that the downside risks

to major economies including the US had grown and that the effects on the

housing market of the government's August 29 real estate policy measures

needed to be closely watched.

Some members commented that, despite the consistently robust domestic

economy, overall business confidence was still low, affected by the widening

polarizations between exporters and domestic demand-oriented companies,

and between large corporations and small and medium-sized enterprises

(SMEs). In addition, one member pointed out that SMEs' fund-raising

conditions might worsen due to the conservative lending attitudes of financial

institutions and a rise in borrowing rates, and voiced the view that the Base

Rate needed to be maintained at its current level in order to press ahead in

a more stable manner with the restructuring of uncompetitive economic

sectors including marginally-viable SMEs.

Some members meanwhile advocated the necessity of moving forward

steadily with interest rate normalization to secure the capacity for preemptive

policy response and scope for future policy action, since a Base Rate of

2.25% was overly low given the current economic conditions and future

economic outlook. They in addition voiced the view that, if the Base Rate

were maintained at the previous month's level, vigilance about a rate hike

would on the one hand recede and the adverse side effects of low interest

rates expand, while on the other hand the credibility of the central bank's

monetary policy would be damaged.

One member commented that, even if the Base Rate were raised slightly

at this point, it would imply only a partial reduction in the degree of financial

easing, and that financial accommodativeness would continue on a

considerable scale as before.

After the discussions detailed above, members agreed by majority vote to

hold the Bank of Korea Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting

period. However, Mr. Kim, Dae Sik and Mr. Choi, Dosoung clearly dissented

from this decision and argued that the Base Rate should be raised by 0.25%p.

gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy of Finance who explained

the government's assessment of the current economic situation, the

background to implementation of the August 29 real estate policy measures,

and the details of financial sanctions related to the UN Security Council's

resolution sanctioning Iran, and then left the meeting.

Monetary Policy Decision

 - The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today

to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.25%) for the

intermeeting period.

 - In the global economy, emerging market economies have sustained
their favorable performance, and the economies of major advanced
countries have largely continued their recovery trend, even though the
US economy has shown signs of a slowdown. Looking ahead, there
exists the possibility of the heightened volatility of economic activity in
major countries acting as a risk factor for the global economy.

 - The upward trend of domestic business activity has been maintained.
Exports have sustained their buoyancy and consumption has steadily
increased and, led by the private sector, labor market conditions have
shown an improving trend.

The domestic economy is expected to continue on an upward track,
even in the presence of external risk.

 - Consumer price inflation has so far stayed within a range of somewhat

above 2% but a little below 3%, but in the future, upward pressures
are expected to build continuously owing to the increase in
demand-pull pressures associated with the continued upswing in
activity. In the real estate market, housing sales prices have declined
in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while those in other areas have
continued to increase.

 - In the financial markets, short term market interest rates and banks'
lending and borrowing interest rates have continued to rise. Long term
market interest rates, however, have declined in response chiefly to
the inflow of foreign portfolio investment funds. The scale of the
growth in mortgage lending has decreased somewhat, with transactions
remaining inactive.

- Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy in such a

way as to help the economy maintain price stability, while sustaining

sound growth under the accommodative policy stance. In carrying out

policy, it will take overall account of financial and economic conditions

at home and abroad.
