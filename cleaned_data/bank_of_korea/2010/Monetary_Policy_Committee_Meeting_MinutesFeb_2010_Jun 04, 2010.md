###### Ⅱ. Discussion on Economic Situation (Summary)2)

After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Domestic and Overseas Economic

Developments' and the 'Financial Market Situation', the discussions among

members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following

areas:

With regard to the global economy, most members were in agreement

that, although overall global financial market conditions were showing

improvement, there was growing uncertainty surrounding the global economy,

-due to the recent government debt crises in some European countries, the

tightening of liquidity management in China, and the strengthening of financial

regulations in the US.

As for recent domestic economic developments, members assessment

was that the Korean economy was on its recovery track as a whole, despite

some mixed indicators. One member, however, stated that economic

sentiment among the public had improved only slightly, owing to the

modestness of the economic recovery and the persistently sluggish

employment situation. Another member expressed the view that self-sustained

growth momentum in the private sector is not yet solid.

Situation' are available on the Bank of Korea web site.

Regarding the future outlook, most members raised concerns that the

re-emergence of uncertainty in external conditions might be a downside risk

factor to Korean economic growth. One member noted that attention needed

to be paid to the downside risks arising from the scaling back of the

government's support measures such as ending the tax breaks for passenger

car purchases and the capital gains tax exemption on sales of houses.

Meanwhile, there was another view that, as consumption and investment

growth were expected to exceed their original forecasts along with the

improved domestic and global conditions, the sign of self-sustained recovery

in the private sector would become more evident, unless global economic

conditions deteriorated sharply.

Concerning production activities, members noted that, as demand

recovered, manufacturing production increased at a faster pace and service

production also swung back to an increase.

With respect to employment, most members considered the Korean labor

market was likely to remain subdued. And one member, in particular, claimed

that the employment situation would stay far below the normal level for the

time being, even if the government's job creation measures were again put in

place.

Most members commented that exports would continue to increase and

facilities investment were also showing a gradual recovery. One member,

however, mentioned that there was a high likelihood of export conditions

might be significantly affected by the growing uncertainties concerning the

KRW/USD exchange rate and the future directions of the Chinese economy.

As to consumption, some members shared the view that consumption had

increased recently thanks to expansionary macro policy and the restocking of

durable goods, while anticipating that, judging from past experiences, this

upward trend was likely to continue for the time being.

As for the domestic financial markets, most members noted that the

volatility of stock prices and KRW/USD exchange rate had risen, affected by

external risk factors. One member mentioned, however, that market interest

rates had remained stable, which may be due to market participants'

weakened expectations of an upward policy rate adjustment.

Meanwhile, another member emphasized that attention should be given to

the possibility that there might arise doubts on the reliability and effectiveness

of monetary policy if the gap between short and long-term interest rates,

which had widened substantially of late, persisted for a long time.

Although members agreed that the corporate and household sectors are

financially in good shape overall, some pointed out the likelihood that the

ending of the government's financial support for small- and medium-sized

enterprises (SMEs) and banks' strengthening of risk management might

aggravate funding conditions for SMEs with poor credit ratings. Members also

mentioned the possibility that a rise in interest rates as the economy recovers

might lead to insolvencies among highly indebted households and could

constrain consumption recovery.

Most members anticipated consumer prices to remain on a stable

downward trend for the time being. Members viewed the steep rise in the

Consumer Price Index during January as a transitory phenomenon caused by

a base-period effect.

As to real estate prices, many members noted the fact that leasehold

deposits were continuing to rise while housing prices had been sluggish.

Some members shared the view that constant attention should be paid to the

fact that expectations of higher housing prices might be growing along with

the economic recovery.

###### Ⅲ. Discussions Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changing the

Bank of Korea Base Rate are summarized as follows:

The members agreed that the domestic and international economies were

still vulnerable to unexpected shocks, and that this might slow the pace of

domestic economic recovery significantly.

The members also called for close monitoring of developments of

destabilizing overseas factors and more intensive examination of weakness in

the domestic economy. One member expressed the view that, given the

possibility that factors causing volatility in the global financial markets might

persist longer than expected, and that global economic recovery could be

delayed for some time, consideration should be given to the potential of

policy implementation and latent risks from a longer-term perspective.

Meanwhile, many members expressed concerns about the real estate

market instability and delays in corporate restructuring that might be caused

by maintaining an excessively accommodative monetary policy for a long

period. One member stated that close attention should be paid to whether a

low Base Rate might lead to distorted allocations of short-term and long-term

financial capital.

After the detailed discussions summarized above, members agreed

unanimously on maintaining the Bank of Korea Base Rate at its current level

and passed a resolution to that effect[3)].

###### Ⅳ. Remarks by Government Representative

The senior vice minister of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance present
at the meeting explained the government measures taken against the recent
rise in leasehold deposits and the factors driving a rise in the unemployment
rate during January.

Monetary Policy Decision

- The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to

maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting

period.

- Domestic economic activity has continued on a recovering trend, which is

expected to be maintained. Exports and domestic demand have steadily

increased and production has advanced briskly. There still, however,

remains uncertainty as to the economic growth path due to the risk of

government debt crises in some European countries.

- Consumer price inflation has accelerated its rising pace. It is anticipated

as likely to be stable, however, in reflection of recent international raw

material price movements. The upward trend of real estate prices has

been blunted.

- Financial market price variables such as exchange rate and stock prices

have shown high volatility under the influence of international financial

market unrest. Mortgage lending has slowed due to the seasonal factors.

- Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain the accommodative policy

stance for the time being in such a way as to help sustain the trend of

recovery in economic activity.
