##### Ⅱ. Discussion of Economic Situation (Summary)2)

###### After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions among members of the

 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas:

 Members assessed the momentum of recovery in the global economy

 to be strengthening, boosted by the rapid growth of emerging market

 countries and the moderate recoveries of advanced countries. From the

 medium-term perspective, however, some members commented that risk

 factors remained, including the sluggish US labor market, China's further

 tightening, and the sovereign debt problems in the euro region.

 Concerning recent domestic economic developments, most members

 assessed the domestic economy as remaining on an upward path, led by

 strong exports, consumption growth, etc.

 Some members mentioned that consumption remained on an upward

 trend, although it had declined slightly during the month due to a

 base-period effect from the previous month, and that production in the

 manufacturing and services sectors showed improvements as in the

 previous month amid the expansions of facilities and construction

 investment and brisk exports.

 Regarding the future outlook, members anticipated that it would not

 be difficult for the domestic economy to remain on an upward track, as

 export conditions were likely to improve further, affected by the

 improvement of the US economy, and domestic demand conditions

 including employment, wages and stock prices were expected to be

 favorable. However, some members' evaluation was that uncertainties

 remained as before, pointing to the facts that facilities investment had

###### been lackluster in the fourth quarter of 2010, and that the leading and

 coincident composite indexes had continued to decline.

 With respect to employment, most members evaluated the employment

 situation as showing improvement, led by the private sector, with the

 number of persons employed having increased by 460,000 year-on-year in

 December.

 Some members appraised the domestic financial markets as having

 stabilized overall, with stock prices rising sharply and the exchange rate

 falling, while geopolitical risks had gradually eased after their increase

 following the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island by North Korea. Other

 members mentioned that long-term market rates had risen, affected by

 expectations of price increases, and by foreign bond investors' shift to a

 net selling position, and added that mortgage lending growth had

 accelerated with housing transactions expanding.

 A number of members pointed out the consumer price index's

 acceleration to 3.5% year-on-year in December, up from 3.3% in

 November, centering around petroleum and agricultural and fisheries

 products. Some members mentioned that inflation expectations had been

 on the rise, with the CPI for living necessities exhibiting a sharp increase.

 Most members forecasted an even higher rate of increase in the CPI going

 forward, owing to increased demand-pull pressures in line with the

 sustained economic upturn and to the run-up in global oil prices.

 As to the real estate market, some members noted that leasehold

 deposits had continued to rise and that housing prices were showing

 upward movements in Seoul and its surrounding areas while maintaining

 their upward trend in the provincial regions.

##### Ⅲ. Remarks by Government Representative

###### Prior to the members' discussion regarding the Base Rate, the

 Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance,

 who explained the government's assessment of the current economic

 situation and the measures to stabilize prices of items closely connected

 with the lives of the general public, and then left the meeting.

 The 1st Vice Minister mentioned that the economy remained on an

 overall course of recovery and that labor market conditions were showing

 improvement. With regard to prices, however, the 1st Vice Minister noted

 that the situation was one in which supply-side shocks had intensified and

 upward demand-side pressures were gradually materializing. There were

 thus concerns, he said, that if inflation expectations could not be dispelled

 at an early stage it could erode the basis for a stable economy and detract

 from the recovery in the public's business sentiment.

 Consequently, the 1st Vice Minister noted that the focus of policy

 would be placed on calming inflation expectations at an early stage

 through the establishment and implementation of long- and short-term

 micro-level measures in pursuit of price stability, such as steps to stabilize

 market supply and demand.

##### Ⅳ. Discussion Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in

 the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Many members agreed that liquidity should be absorbed and inflation

 be restrained by raising the Base Rate, in a bid to prevent the current

 upward trend in prices from becoming entrenched under the influence of

###### inflation expectations.

 One member commented that the possibility of a double-dip recession

 in the US economy, the sovereign debt problems in certain European

 countries and geopolitical risks on the Korean peninsula had served as

 factors limiting normalization of the Base Rate, but that uncertainties with

 regard to these factors seemed to have eased significantly of late.

 Another member voiced the opinion that, if real interest rates remained

 negative for a long time in a situation where major economic indicators in

 Korea had recovered to around or above their levels before the financial

 crisis, this might generate not only inflation but also asset market bubbles.

 Another member pointed out that the government's micro-level inflation

 policy was analyzed as likely to have only a limited impact in the

 long-term, although it might prove effective in the short-term, and added

 that it was necessary to normalize the Base Rate in order to improve the

 weak financial structure of households and to raise the household savings

 rate.

 Some members, meanwhile, took the position that, considering that

 the rise in consumer prices was driven mainly by supply-side factors, in

 conditions of high domestic and international uncertainty, it was desirable

 to maintain the current policy stance and to closely monitor changes in

 economic conditions in the months ahead.

 After the discussions detailed above, members decided by a majority

 decision to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points.

 (However, Mr. Kang, Myung Hun and Mr. Lim, Seungtae expressed

 clear opposition to this decision, and argued that the Base Rate should be

 kept at its current level.)

###### < Ref > Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 2.75%.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 emerging market economies to have sustained their favorable

 performances, while the major advanced economies have kept up their moderate paces of recovery. Going forward, the Committee

 forecasts the global economy to sustain its pace of recovery;

 nevertheless, the Committee does not rule out the possibility of

 future developments, for example international financial market

 unrest arising from the sovereign debt concerns in some euro area

 countries and the heightened volatility of international commodity

 prices, posing a risk to the global economy.

 □ For Korea, the Committee judges the domestic economy to have maintained its underlying upward trend; although facilities

 investment has declined, exports have continued their buoyancy and

 consumption has steadily increased. Labor market conditions have

 also shown ongoing improvement, led by the private sector. Going

 forward, the Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will

 keep up its underlying trend, even in the presence of external

 risks.

 □ Consumer price inflation in Korea reached the 3.5% level in December, driven mainly by rises in the prices of petroleum

 products and farm products. In the coming months, the Committee

 expects inflationary pressures to persist and inflation expectations

 to increase as the economic upswing continues and international

 commodity prices rise. In the real estate market, upward

 movements in housing prices have emerged in Seoul and its

###### surrounding areas, and those in the rest of the country have

 sustained their upward trend, while leasehold deposits have

 continued to rise.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices have risen significantly and

 the Korean won has appreciated, due mostly to the increased

 inflows of foreign stock investment funds and to expectations for

 geopolitical risks around the Korean Peninsula to ease. Long-term market interest rates have increased, in response chiefly to inflation

 expectations and to foreign investors' net sales of bonds. Mortgage

 lending has grown on a large scale, amid an increase in housing

 transactions.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy in

 such a way as to firmly anchor the basis for price stability while

 the economy continues its sound growth. In carrying out policy,

 the Committee will take overall account of financial and economic conditions both at home and abroad.
