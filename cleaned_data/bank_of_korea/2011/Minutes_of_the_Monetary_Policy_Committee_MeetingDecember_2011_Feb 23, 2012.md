##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions by members of the

 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas:

 Regarding the global economy, many members forecast that, with the

 international financial market unrest persisting due to delays in resolving

 the euro area sovereign debt crisis, the recovery of global economy would

 decelerate further in the coming months if economic growth in emerging

 market countries would slow along with the economic sluggishness in

 advanced countries.

 As to recent developments in the domestic economy, members

 assessed Korean economic growth to be gradually slowing. Some

 mentioned that, although the momentum of export growth was being

 sustained, domestic demand was contracting due mostly to sluggish

 consumption and facilities investment, and in terms of production, the

 increases in both manufacturing and services industries also slackening

 gradually.

 Meanwhile, another member’s evaluation was that, although the

 growth rate of the economy was somewhat lower than originally forecast,

 its pace could be seen as being satisfactory, considering the presence of

 numerous destabilizing external factors such as the deepening of the euro

 area sovereign debt crisis and concerns about subdued global economic

 activity.

 Regarding the domestic economic outlook, most members forecast

 that, in view of the economic conditions at home and abroad, the growth

###### rate of the Korean economy would be lower than in 2011 as its growth

 momentum weakened, and added that the downside risk to the growth

 path would be large. A few members, however, expected the domestic

 economy to recover to a level close to its long-term trend starting from

 the latter half of 2012.

 Many members pointed out, concerning the domestic financial

 markets, that price variables such as stock prices and the exchange rate

 continued to fluctuate widely due to international financial market unrest.

 One member, meanwhile, pointed out that, although there appeared to be

 no great strains in banks’ foreign currency funding owing to their

 preemptive steps to secure funds, greater attention should be paid to the

 possibility that adverse effects might emerge in line with the evolution of

 the euro area situation in the coming months.

 Regarding consumer prices, members noted that expected inflation

 continued to exceed 4%, as headline consumer price inflation had come in

 at 4.2% in November, up from 3.6% the month before due to the rising

 price trends of food grains and industrial products, and core inflation had

 also registered 3.5%, slightly up from the previous month.

 Some members anticipated that, although inflation rate was likely to

 drop due to factors such as slower growth rate and a base-period effect,

 its pace of decline would be moderate owing to the ongoing high inflation

 expectations, public utility charge hikes, etc.

 As for housing prices, one member appraised those in Seoul and its

 surrounding areas as having weakened, but those in the rest of the country

 to have maintained their trends of increase.

###### Ⅲ. Remarks by Government Representative

 Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the

 Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance,

 the government representative.

 With regard to the current economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister

 assessed concerns over future economic slowdown to be mounting due to

 the persistence of high external uncertainty, at a time when certain sectors

 of the real economy, above all manufacturing, exhibited a subdued pattern

 of activity that ran counter to the continued recovery trend in employment

 and in services.

 Concerning prices, the 1st Vice Minister remarked that consumer

 prices had risen 4.2% year-on-year in November, and predicted that they

 would show unstable movements in December, owing chiefly to possible

 adjustments of agricultural product prices and charges for services at

 year-end. Furthermore, given the recent high level of rising prices and

 inflation expectations, he forecast difficult price conditions to persist for

 some time to come.

 As to export and import trends, the 1st Vice Minister commented

 that exports had stood at around 47 billion dollars for the third

 consecutive month in November and imports at about 43 billion dollars

 for the second month in a row, both of them showing a somewhat

 subdued performance compared to that earlier in the year. The 1st Vice

 Minister remarked, however, that the current account had posted a surplus

 of 4.2 billion dollars in October, wider than that of the previous month,

 and that it was estimated to have recorded a substantial surplus in

 November as well.

###### Ⅳ. Discussions Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC members’ discussion concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Most members shared the opinion that it would be better to hold the

 Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, since there were

 high downside risks to growth from the short-term perspective, in the

 presence of the heightened mood of apprehension in the international

 financial markets following the euro area sovereign debt crisis, although it

 was appropriate, from the medium-term perspective, to maintain the stance

 of Base Rate normalization in order to curb inflation expectations and

 firmly anchor the foundation for price stability.

 One member noted that now was not the right time to hike the Base Rate, given the heightened possibility of a phase transition in the business

 cycle. He added that, with spending power having declined owing

 primarily to the growing household debt and the worsening of the income

 distribution structure, economic momentum might weaken rapidly if exports

 became less brisk in response to the world economic slowdown.

 Another member pointed out the possibility that the domestic economy might shrink to a greater extent than expected, if deleveraging

 spread worldwide.

 In addition, members expressed the opinion that efforts should be

 focused on improving the household saving ratio, on avoiding herd

 behavior of market participants and on ensuring that real interest rates and

 liquidity remained at appropriate levels, while strengthening support for

 low-income households, small self-employed businesses and promising

 SMEs, and pursuing the restructuring of marginally-viable companies.

 After the discussions detailed above, the members decided

 unanimously to keep the Base Rate at its current level.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today

 to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting

 period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers major advanced economies to have exhibited continued sluggishness

 and growth in emerging market economies to have slowed somewhat.

 Going forward the Committee expects the pace of global economic

 recovery to be very moderate, and judges that downside risks to

 growth are high, due mostly to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe

 and to the possibilities of the slumps in major country economies and the unrest in international financial markets continuing.

 □ In Korea, exports have shown a steady increase, but consumption has

 remained at a level similar to that in the previous month and

 facilities investment has decreased sharply. The trend of improvement

 in employment conditions has been sustained, led by the private

 sector. The Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will not

 deviate significantly from its long-term trend of growth going

 forward, but recognizes the situation to be one in which downside risks to growth remain high due to the impact of external risk

 factors.

 □ Consumer price inflation exceeded 4% in November, owing mainly to

 increases in prices of industrial products, and core inflation rose

 compared to the previous month as well. In the coming months,

 factors including the declines in agricultural product prices and the

 base effect from last year will work to stabilize prices, but the

 Committee expects the pace of decline in the inflation rate to be moderate given factors such as the public utility charge hikes and

 Seoul and its surrounding areas appeared to weaken, while those in

 the rest of the country kept up their rising trend. The rate of

 increase in leasehold deposits meanwhile slowed greatly in Seoul and

 its surrounding areas, but remained high in the rest of the country.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices and the exchange rate continued

 to fluctuate widely as unease concerning external risk factors persisted, and long-term market interest rates declined as in the

 previous month.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and

 economic risk factors both at home and abroad, will conduct

 monetary policy so as to firmly anchor the basis for price stability

 amid continuing sound growth of the economy.
