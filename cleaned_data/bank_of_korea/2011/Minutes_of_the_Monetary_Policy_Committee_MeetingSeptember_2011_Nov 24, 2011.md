##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions by members of the

 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas:

 Many members assessed the uncertainty in the global economy to be

 worsening further, owing mostly to the risk of a long recession in the

 U.S. and the spread of the sovereign debt problems in Europe. One

 member, however, expected the global economy to keep up its moderate

 and slow recovery as originally projected, despite a slight increase in

 downside risks to growth.

 A number of members evaluated the domestic economy as maintaining

 an underlying trend of growth above its long-term trajectory, buoyed by

 solid exports, although the economy had shown signs of faltering somewhat

 with manufacturing production having decreased in July.

 Regarding the future outlook, many members anticipated that the

 domestic economy would achieve growth at around the level of its potential

 growth rate, on the back of favorable exports, although the rate of growth

 might decline slightly due to the economic slowdowns in major advanced

 countries. One member pointed out that, if the growth momentum in major

 advanced economies weakened, a very critical touchstone in determining

 future economic trend would be whether the emerging market countries

 could successfully lead the global economy instead.

 Some members’ assessment of the domestic financial markets was

 that the volatility of price variables appeared to have decreased somewhat

 from September, but that they were still responding sensitively to changes

###### in external conditions, as seen especially in the stock market. One other

 member, however, mentioned that the negative effects had not yet

 appeared large, given the continued inflows of foreign bond investment

 funds, with the domestic economic fundamentals still remaining favorable

 despite the global financial market instability.

 As to consumer prices, most members noted that consumer price

 inflation had accelerated significantly, from 4.7% in July to 5.3% in

 August, due mainly to a rise in agricultural product prices, and that core

 and expected inflation had also posted high rates of 4.0% and 4.2%,

 respectively. Many members reasoned that, although the stabilization of

 agricultural product prices and base-period effects would serve as factors

 in blunting consumer price inflation, the upside risks could be viewed as

 still large due to factors like high expected inflation, public utility charge

 increases, the continued uptrends in leasehold deposits and monthly rents,

 and growing demand for nominal wage hikes. Therefore, they anticipated

 that prices would continue running at a high level for a considerable

 period of time.

 A few members observed that housing sales prices in Seoul and its

 surrounding areas appeared weak, while those elsewhere were sustaining

 their trend of sharp increase. One of the members pointed out that more

 carefully-crafted regionally-specific policy responses were required to

 prevent a new risk factor for the Korean economy emerging in the form

 of a real estate market showing divergent movements in different regions.

##### Ⅲ. Discussions Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPC members’ discussion concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

###### Many members expressed the opinion that, although the rate of

 inflation was still at a high level, it would be better to maintain the Base

 Rate at its current level for the ensuing month, in view of the current

 situation in which the risks of a global economic downturn and risk

 factors in the international financial markets had partially materialized.

 However, some other members voiced the view that, although

 uncertainties concerning the economic outlook had risen a bit more, the

 central bank’s resolve to pursue price stability should be clearly

 communicated to the markets, and consideration should be given to the

 fact that there was not much time left for interest rate normalization with

 business indicators weakening.

 One of these members noted that the annual rate of consumer price

 inflation was certain to exceed the original forecast and the upper bound

 of the inflation target. He then pointed out that, in a situation with

 Korea’s economic fundamentals remaining sound, unless the problem of

 price instability was resolved soon, it would detract from monetary

 policy’s capacity to deal with the real economy in the event of a further

 deterioration of external conditions.

 After the discussions detailed above, members decided by a majority

 vote to keep the Base Rate at its current level.

 (However, Mr. Kim, Dae Sik and Mr. Choi, Dosoung clearly

 dissented from this decision, and argued that the Base Rate should be

 raised by 25 basis points.)

##### Monetary Policy Decision

###### □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today

 to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting

 period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 that, while emerging market economies have shown favorable

 performances, the recoveries in major advanced economies including the US have exhibited signs of further weakening. Going forward,

 the Committee forecasts that the global economy will keep up its

 recovery albeit at a moderate pace; nevertheless, the Committee

 judges that the possibility has increased of such factors as the

 economic sluggishness in major countries, the sovereign debt

 problems in Europe, and international financial market unrest posing

 downside risks to the global economy.

 □ In Korea, exports continued to show high growth and domestic demand increased modestly. Labor market conditions also remained

 on a track of improvement, led by the private sector. The

 Committee sees the domestic economy keeping up its long-term

 trend of growth going forward, but judges uncertainty as to its

 growth path to have intensified due to the impact of external risk

 factors.

 □ Consumer price inflation rose to the 5% range in August, due mostly

 to sharp rises in the prices of agricultural products. The Committee

 expects the high rate of price increase to continue for some time,

 driven largely by inflation expectations, although factors such as the

 stabilization of agricultural product prices and the base effect from

 last year will work to bring inflation down in the coming months.

 Core inflation meanwhile increased to 4.0%, and is forecast to remain

###### elevated for the time being. As for housing prices, those in Seoul

 and its surrounding areas maintained their July levels, while prices in

 the rest of the country increased at a faster pace. The rate of

 increase in leasehold deposits rose in August compared to the

 previous month.

 □ In the financial markets, price variables including interest rates, stock

 prices and the exchange rate, which had fluctuated widely from the start of August due mainly to the impact of external risk factors,

 have shown signs of stabilizing somewhat, but the unease concerning

 changes in external conditions seems to still exist.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and

 economic risk factors both at home and abroad, will conduct

 monetary policy with a greater emphasis on ensuring that the basis

 for price stability is firmly anchored while the economy continues its

 sound growth.
