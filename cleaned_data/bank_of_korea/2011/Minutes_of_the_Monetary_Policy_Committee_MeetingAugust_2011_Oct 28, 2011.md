##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions by members of the

 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas:

 Regarding the global economy, most members assessed that the paces

 of recovery in the U.S. and other advanced economies had exhibited signs

 of weakening, while emerging market economies were showing favorable

 performances. Many members shared the opinion that there was concern

 that factors such as the economic slowdown in major advanced countries,

 the spread of sovereign debt problems in some European countries and the

 international financial market unrest could limit the recovery of the global

 economy. One member, notably, expressed the view that the economic

 situation of major advanced countries was unlikely to take a turn for the

 better within a short space of time, since some structural factors such as

 the U.S. status as a reserve currency country and the euro zone situation

 of being a single currency bloc were making exchange rate adjustments

 difficult for both.

 Meanwhile, another member evaluated the possibility of a recurrence

 of a crisis similar to that in 2008 as low, given that central banks in

 advanced countries were expected to implement additional monetary easing,

 that the recent crisis was not one of systemic risks caused by a chain of

 large financial institutions going bankrupt as in the past, and that the

 strong economic growth in emerging market countries was acting as the

 engine of world economic recovery.

 Most members evaluated the domestic economy to be sustaining its

 upward trend, with exports showing solid growth and domestic demand

###### also maintaining a mild expansion. One of them pointed out that exports

 had reached an all-time high and that employment was also improving

 steadily.

 Regarding the future outlook, the judgement of a number of members

 was that, although the growth of the domestic economy would be

 sustained, the uncertainties as to its future path seemed to have deepened

 further, due mostly to the possibility of external destabilizing factors

 persisting for a long time and to the resulting increase in financial market

 volatility.

 Most members mentioned that the domestic financial markets had

 displayed unstable movements, as exemplified by the sharp falls in share

 prices and steep rise in the Korean won/US dollar exchange rate amid

 large scale net sales of Korean stocks by foreign investors. One of them

 forecasted that price variables would show high volatility for a

 considerable length of time, since it would be difficult to address the

 structural fragilities of the European and U.S. economies that were

 generating the international financial market unrest.

 Another member assessed the financial and foreign exchange sectors

 to be very sound, with the external debt profile and the foreign currency

 situation greatly improved compared to past financial crises, and the

 capacity to withstand rapid capital outflows thus heightened.

 As to consumer prices, most members noted that consumer price

 inflation had registered 4.7% in July, higher than in the previous month,

 influenced by a sharp run-up in agricultural product prices. Many

 members anticipated that prices would remain at a high level due not only

 to the destabilizing factor remaining on the supply side, which is

 generated mostly by the torrential rainfall, but also to other factors such

 as the hikes in public utility charges and mounting inflationary

 expectations.

###### Some members assessed that housing sales prices in Seoul and its

 surrounding areas had weakened, while those in the rest of the country

 had posted rates of increase similar to those of the previous month, and

 that the rate of leasehold deposit increase had been higher than that in the

 preceding month.

 Ⅲ. Remarks by Government Representative

 Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the

 Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance,

 the government representative.

 With regard to the current economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister

 commented that, although the economy was exhibiting upward movements

 at the trend level with the manufacturing and services production showing

 continued growth, volatility in domestic and overseas financial markets was

 mounting considerably since the U.S. credit rating downgrade, and

 therefore a close watch needed to be kept on developments in the real

 economy.

 As to the recent instability in the global financial market, the 1st

 Vice Minister remarked that, although this instability was expected to have

 only a limited effect on the Korean economy at this stage, market

 stabilization measures were being actively undertaken in order to ease

 uncertainty and forestall market disturbance.

 Regarding prices, the 1st Vice Minister commented that, although

 prices were forecasted to show a slowing rate of increase from September

 in terms of their headline figures, there remained, as before, uncertainties

 as to weather conditions. He also explained that the government was

 and respond to them through its weekly meetings held to discuss price

 stabilization measures.

 Ⅳ. Discussions Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC members’ discussion concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Many members shared the opinion that, although concerns about the

 possibility of inflationary pressures becoming entrenched for some length

 of time could not be ruled out, with the increased possibility of the

 annual rate of increase in consumer prices exceeding the original forecast,

 it would be better to maintain the Base Rate at its current level this

 month, in view of the heightened anxieties among economic agents with

 the recent spread of global financial instability.

 One member noted that a policy rate hike might amplify and

 transmit the uncertainty in the global financial markets to the domestic

 markets, and that this risk could be greater than that triggered by putting

 off tightening a little longer.

 One other member took the view that, the timing of policy

 implementation should be kept flexible in line with the economic situation

 at home and abroad, thought it was necessary to maintain the current

 policy stance of Base Rate normalization, with monetary policy being

 basically directed toward defusing the upward inflation pressures and

 inflation expectations.

 Another member voiced the opinion that efforts to normalize Base

 Rate must be driven forward persistently, since the opportunity to curb

 including household debt expansion and delays in corporate restructuring

 were gradually increasing with the pause in rate normalization.

 After the discussions detailed above, members decided unanimously to

 keep the Base Rate at its current level.

###### < Ref > Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today

 to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 that, while emerging market economies have shown favorable

 performances, the recoveries in major advanced economies including

 the US have exhibited signs of weakening. Going forward, the

 Committee forecasts that the global economy will keep up its pace

 of recovery; nevertheless, the Committee recognizes the possibility of

 such factors as the potential for continuing economic slowdown in major countries, the spread of sovereign debt problems in Europe,

 and international financial market unrest posing downside risks to the

 global economy.

 □ For Korea, the Committee judges the economy to have maintained its

 underlying upward trend, given for instance that exports show robust growth and that domestic demand is increasing modestly. Labor

 market conditions have also remained on a track of improvement, led

 by the private sector. The Committee judges that the domestic

 economy will keep up this underlying trend going forward, but that

 uncertainty as to the growth path has intensified due to the impact of

 external risk factors.

 □ Consumer price inflation rose to the 4.7% level in July, due mostly

 to sharp rises in the prices of agricultural products including vegetables. The Committee expects the high level of inflation to

 continue in the coming months, driven largely by demand-side

 pressures resulting from the underlying uptrend in economic activity

 and by inflation expectations. Core inflation meanwhile increased to

 the 3.8% level, and this uptrend is seen persisting for the time being.

###### As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas

 weakened, while prices in the rest of the country posted rates of

 increase similar to those for June. The rate of leasehold deposit

 increase rose in July compared to the previous month, with

 transactions becoming more active.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices and long-term market interest

 rates have fallen sharply and the Korean won has depreciated against the US dollar since the start of August, due mainly to heightened

 external risk and international financial market instability. Mortgage

 lending posted a steady rise in July, as in the previous month.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and

 economic conditions both at home and abroad, including factors

 potentially disruptive to the financial markets, will conduct monetary

 policy with a greater emphasis on ensuring that the basis for price

 stability is firmly anchored while the economy continues its sound growth.
