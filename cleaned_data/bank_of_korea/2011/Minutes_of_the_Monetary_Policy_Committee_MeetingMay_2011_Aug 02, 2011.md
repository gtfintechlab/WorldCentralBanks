##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on Current Economic Situation2)

###### After briefings from staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions by members of the

 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas:

 Many members assessed the global economy to be sustaining its

 trend of improvement overall, as emerging market economies continued to

 show favorable performances and advanced economies also kept up their

 paces of recovery. A few members, however, pointed out that potential

 risk factors had recently been emerging, such as the slowdown in U.S.

 economic growth, the resurgence of sovereign debt problems in some euro

 area countries and the impacts of the Great East Japan Earthquake.

 Most members evaluated the domestic economy as maintaining its

 solid underlying trend of growth along the originally-projected growth path.

 Some members mentioned that manufacturing and services production

 appeared to have grown steadily, with exports reaching new record highs

 and consumption and facilities investment increasing.

 Going forward as well, many members expected the domestic

 economy to remain on an upward track, led by exports.

 Concerning the domestic financial markets, members noted that,

 while stock prices had risen and the Korean won had appreciated against

 the US dollar, in response chiefly to the sustained uptrend of economic

 activity and to inflows of foreign investment funds, long-term market

 interest rates had by and large fluctuated at around their levels of the

 previous month. One member pointed out that short-term speculative

 funds seeking foreign exchange profits in expectation of won appreciation

 were continuing to flow into the foreign exchange market. Another

###### member mentioned that household debt continued to increase, led by

 mortgage-backed loans.

 Most members noted that, even though consumer prices had posted

 a lower rate of growth at 4.2% than the previous month’s 4.7%,

 influenced by the sharp decline in vegetable prices, inflation had exceeded

 the target’s upper 4% bound for four straight months this year, from

 January through April. Many members anticipated that consumer prices

 would sustain their high rising trend in the coming months as well,

 affected for instance by the increased demand from the economic upswing

 and by the spread of inflation expectations.

 As to the real estate market, one member noted that, amid a

 sustained rise in housing leasehold deposit prices, the upward movements

 of housing sales prices had weakened in Seoul and its surrounding areas

 but continued in the rest of the country.

##### Ⅲ. Remarks by Government Representative

###### Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the

 Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance,

 the government representative.

 With regard to the current economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister

 commented that, in view of the economic indicators, the economy was

 judged to be maintaining its momentum of recovery at the level of trend

 growth.

 As to recent price trends, the 1st Vice Minister stated that, although

 the CPI growth rate had slowed in April compared with the previous

 month, destabilizing factors still lurked including the fluctuations in

###### international commodity prices and the rise in expected inflation, and that

 the government would therefore implement strong long- and short-term

 policy measures for price stability including measures to stabilize the

 supply and demand conditions related to agricultural, livestock and marine

 products, to stagger the timing of public utility fee hikes, and to

 strengthen the monitoring of service charges.

 Regarding construction business activities, the 1st Vice Minister

 commented that the government’s recent ‘Measures to Stage a Soft

 Landing of the Construction Sector and Stimulate Housing Supply’, drawn

 up in cooperation with the relevant departments, were intended to induce a

 soft landing in the construction sector through resolution of insolvent

 project financing loans and improvement in housing supply conditions, and

 to respond preemptively to housing market problems going forward. He

 then left the meeting.

##### Ⅳ. Discussion Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main contents of the MPC members’ discussion concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follow:

 Many members agreed that, in circumstances where the domestic

 economy continued to show improvement, gradual normalization of the

 Base Rate to curb the rising price trend arising from increasing demand

 pressures was desirable, but that it would be better to keep the rate at its

 current level this month, given the possibility of slowdown in the paces of

 economic recovery in major countries stemming mostly from the

 international commodity price instability and the spread of sovereign debt

 problems in some euro area countries.

###### Meanwhile, one member pointed out that the gradual Base Rate hikes

 thus far had been insufficient to calm inflation expectations and upward

 price pressures; he added that the feared side effects of the Base Rate

 hikes had not occurred, but that instead problems arising from the low

 interest rates, such as increasing household debt and a disincentive to save,

 were becoming more pronounced in several sectors.

 Another member expressed the view that, since expected inflation

 was at the moment very high, and the economic imbalances caused by

 low interest rates including increased preference for risky assets and rising

 household debt could intensify, interest rates must in this situation be

 normalized as soon as possible, so that real interest rates could move out

 of negative territory before signs of economic activity weakened due to

 heightened uncertainties surrounding the global economy.

 After the discussions detailed above, members decided by a majority

 vote to keep the Base Rate at its current level.

 (However, Mr. Kim, Dae Sik and Mr. Choi, Dosoung clearly

 dissented from this decision, and argued that the Base Rate should be

 raised by 25 basis points.)

###### < Ref > Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.00% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 emerging market economies to have continued to show favorable

 performances and the major advanced economies to have also kept

 up their paces of recovery. Going forward, the Committee forecasts

 the global economy to sustain its pace of recovery; nevertheless,

 the Committee recognizes the possibility of such factors as the

 sovereign debt concerns in some euro area countries, the political

 unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, and the impacts of the

 Great East Japan Earthquake posing downside risks to the global

 economy.

 □ For Korea, the Committee judges the economy to have maintained

 its underlying upward trend, given for instance that exports show

 continued buoyancy and that domestic demand is increasing. Labor

 market conditions have also remained on a track of improvement,

 led by the private sector. Going forward, the Committee anticipates

 that the domestic economy will keep up its underlying trend, even

 in the presence of external risks.

 □ Consumer price inflation eased in April compared to the preceding

 month, due mostly to the declines in prices of vegetables. There is

 a possibility of the high rising price trend persisting in the coming

 months, however, driven largely by increased demand pressures

 from the economic upswing, by instability of international oil

 prices, and by elevated inflation expectations. As for housing

###### prices, the upward movements in Seoul and its surrounding areas

 have faltered while the steep upward trend in the rest of the

 country has been sustained. Leasehold deposits have continued to

 rise.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices have risen and the Korean

 won appreciated against the US dollar in response chiefly to the

 sustained uptrend of economic activity and to the inflows of

 foreign investment funds. Long-term market interest rates have

 fluctuated within a narrow range. The pace of growth in mortgage

 lending has accelerated compared to last month.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee, while taking overall account of

 financial and economic conditions both at home and abroad, will

 conduct monetary policy with a greater emphasis on ensuring that

 the basis for price stability is firmly anchored while the economy

 continues its sound growth.
