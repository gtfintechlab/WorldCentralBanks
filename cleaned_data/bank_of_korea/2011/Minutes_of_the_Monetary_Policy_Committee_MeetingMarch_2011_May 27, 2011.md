##### Ⅱ. Discussion of Economic Situation (Summary)2)

###### After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions among members of the

 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas:

 Many members assessed that the global economy remained on an

 overall upward path, with emerging market economies sustaining strong

 growth and the major advanced economies keeping up their paces of

 recovery. Some members, however, pointed out that downside risks had

 increased somewhat compared to the previous month, including the

 increased volatility of international commodity prices, the spread of global

 inflation and consequent possibility of economic slowdown, and China's

 strengthened drive for price stability.

 Most members evaluated the domestic economy as sustaining its solid

 upward trend, boosted by strong export growth and the steady increase in

 domestic demand.

 Regarding the future outlook, a majority of members anticipated that

 the domestic economy would show growth slightly above its long-term

 path, unless domestic and external conditions changed considerably from

 their current pattern. However, some of the members noted that if the

 political unrest in the MENA region worsened, the run-up in oil prices

 might accelerate even further and the pace of recovery might accordingly

 slow down somewhat.

 Meanwhile, one member expressed the view that the future outlook

 had deteriorated, pointing to the declines in the composite consumer

 sentiment index and the business survey index.

###### Members appraised the domestic financial markets as having remained

 stable overall, despite some unfavorable conditions including the mounting

 geopolitical risks in the MENA region and the suspensions of business at

 some savings banks. They commented that long-term market interest rates

 had risen in response chiefly to the acceleration of price increases, that

 short-term market interest rates had also continued to rise reflecting

 expectations of a Base Rate hike, and that stock prices had rebounded

 once again since the first week of March boosted by improved domestic

 business indicators, etc. One member pointed out that foreign currency

 conditions were generally favorable thanks mostly to the current account

 surplus and increased overseas borrowings by financial institutions, but that

 the share of short-term capital in foreign currency borrowings was

 gradually rising.

 Members pointed out that the growth rate of consumer price index

 had accelerated rapidly to reach 4.1% year-on-year in January and 4.5% in

 February, as the rates of increase in the prices of petroleum products and

 agricultural, livestock and fisheries products rose, and personal service fees

 steeply increased. Most members anticipated that international oil prices

 and other commodity prices would remain high, caused by the combination

 of such factors as increased demand from emerging market countries,

 ample global liquidity and the political unrest in the MENA region, and

 that inflation expectations were very likely to rise further.

 As to the real estate market, many members noted that leasehold

 deposits remained on the rise despite the government's stabilization efforts,

 and that housing prices were also picking up further in both the Seoul

 metropolitan area and the rest of the country, owing mostly to the

 decreased stock of new homes for occupancy and to a shift in housing

 demand away from leasehold tenancies toward housing purchases.

##### Ⅲ. Remarks by Government Representative

###### Prior to the members' discussions regarding the Base Rate, the

 Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance,

 who explained the current economic situation and price trends, and then

 left the meeting.

 The 1st Vice Minister commented that the domestic economy was

 likely to maintain its robust movements for the time being, against a

 background of sustained buoyancy of domestic demand and exports and

 increased private sector employment. He added that there had been a shift

 to month-on-month increases in the coincident composite index and the

 leading composite index, both of which had until then shown somewhat

 lackluster movements.

 With regard to prices, meanwhile, the 1st Vice Minister mentioned

 that best efforts would be made to consolidate the basis for price stability,

 since difficulties were likely to persist for a time due to such factors as

 the risks in the MENA region and the possibility of unstable supply and

 demand conditions of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.

##### Ⅳ. Discussions Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in

 the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Many members agreed that, unless the recent spread of inflation

 expectations among the general public was curtailed in an appropriate

 manner, the second-round effects of supply shocks would emerge on a

4

###### large scale, giving rise to concerns over the possibility of inflation much

 higher than anticipated, and shared the view that the degree of financial

 easing consequently needed to be reduced.

 A few of them expressed the view that a hike in the Base Rate

 under the current environment where inflation was accelerating would

 represent not a shift to a tightened monetary policy stance, but a

 normalization of the Base Rate level through fine-tuning of the

 accommodative monetary policy stance.

 Another member was of the opinion that normalization of the Base

 Rate level should not be put off any longer on the grounds that if there

 were a change in direction of business activity, while the level of interest

 rates remained accommodative as it was now, a monetary policy response

 through interest rate adjustments would become difficult, and monetary

 policy effectiveness could decline as a result.

 Meanwhile, one member took the position that, considering that the

 rise in consumer prices was driven mainly by supply-side factors, in

 circumstances where uncertainties in domestic and external conditions had

 further mounted, it was desirable to maintain the current policy stance for

 the time being while closely monitoring changes in economic conditions.

 After the discussions detailed above, members decided by a majority

 decision to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points.

 (However, Mr. Kang, Myung Hun clearly dissented from this

 decision, and argued that the Base Rate should be kept at its current

 level.)

###### < Ref > Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 3.00%.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 emerging market economies to have continued to show favorable

 performances and the major advanced economies to have also kept

 up their paces of recovery. Going forward, the Committee

 recognizes the existence of downside risk factors, including political

 unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, rising oil and other

 international commodity prices, and sovereign debt concerns in

 some euro area countries; nevertheless, the Committee forecasts the

 global economy to sustain its pace of recovery.

 □ For Korea, the Committee judges the domestic economy to have

 maintained its underlying upward trend, given for instance that

 exports have continued on their strong growth track and that

 domestic demand has steadily increased. Labor market conditions

 have also shown ongoing improvement, led by the private sector.

 Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the domestic

 economy will keep up its underlying trend, even in the presence of

 external risks.

 □ Consumer price inflation in Korea rose to 4.5% in February, due

 mostly to the rises in prices of petroleum products, agricultural,

 livestock and fisheries products, and personal services. In the

 coming months, this high rising price trend may persist, driven

 largely by increased demand pressures from the economic upswing,

 by instability of international commodity prices, and by elevated

 inflation expectations. As for housing prices, the upward movements

###### in Seoul and its surrounding areas have continued and the upward

 trend in the rest of the country has accelerated, while leasehold

 deposits have continued to rise.

 □ In the financial markets, the volatilities of both stock prices and

 long-term market interest rates have increased, in response chiefly

 to external risk factors and to the steep uptrend in prices. The

 pace of growth in mortgage lending has accelerated somewhat

 compared to last month.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee, while taking overall account of

 financial and economic conditions both at home and abroad, will

 conduct monetary policy with an emphasis on ensuring that the

 basis for price stability is firmly anchored while the economy

 continues its sound growth.
