##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on the Current Economic Situation2)

###### After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', members of the Monetary Policy

 Committee (MPC) discussed as follows:

 Many members assessed the global economy to be sustaining its pace

 of recovery, despite destabilizing factors such as the Great East Japan

 Earthquake, the run-up in international oil prices, etc. A few members,

 however, pointed out that uncertainty over the future path of growth had

 increased slightly compared to that forecast in December of last year, due

 mostly to the political unrest in the MENA region, the sovereign debt

 concerns in some euro area countries and the possibility of a protracted

 fallout from the Great East Japan Earthquake.

 Most members evaluated the domestic economy as sustaining its

 upward trend, boosted by exports, which had reached an all-time monthly

 high. A few members noted, however, that some indicators related to

 domestic demand such as consumption and investment had temporarily

 shown signs of faltering, affected by the Lunar New Year holidays,

 outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, etc.

 Regarding the future outlook, many members anticipated that Korea

 would see economic growth at around the mid-4% level this year, led by

 the strength in exports coupled with the expansion in global trade volume.

 Many members appraised the domestic financial markets as having

 regained stability overall from the end of March onwards, despite the

 increased volatility arising from greater risks in the overseas sector. One

###### member noted that stock prices had reached new record highs and the

 Korean won/US dollar exchange rate had fallen below the 1,100 won

 level for the first time since the collapse of Lehman Brothers.

 Most members pointed out that the consumer price index growth rate

 had accelerated to as high as 4.7% year-on-year in March, due to

 demand-side pressures from the economic upturn, accompanied by the

 run-ups in international commodity prices and spread of foot-and-mouth

 disease, and noted that core inflation had also risen to around the mid-3%

 level. Concerning the price outlook as well, members anticipated that,

 although the CPI growth rate might slow somewhat on the back of

 government's micro-level efforts, upward pressures would remain high due

 mainly to increased inflation expectations.

 As to the real estate market, a few members noted that, amid a

 sustained rise in housing leasehold deposits, housing sales prices had

 continued their upward movements in Seoul and its surrounding areas

 while their trend of increase had accelerated in the rest of the country.

##### Ⅲ. Remarks by Government Representative

###### Prior to the members' discussions regarding the Base Rate, the

 Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance,

 who explained the current economic situation, the government's price

 measures, current real estate market conditions, and then left the meeting.

 With regard to the current economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister

 commented that, although domestic demand appeared somewhat lackluster

 in view of the economic indicators for February, the overall economy was

 judged to have remained on a course of recovery.

###### As to prices, the 1st Vice Minister pointed out that price conditions

 at home and abroad remained uncertain, and added that the government

 would therefore implement policy measures with priority placed upon

 achieving price stability.

 Regarding the real estate market, the 1st Vice Minister mentioned

 that the government would strive to implement as scheduled its measures

 for boosting housing transactions and stabilizing leasehold deposits and

 monthly rental fees. These measures are expected to help the housing

 market return to normalcy and relieve the burdens on the ordinary people.

##### Ⅳ. Discussions Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in

 the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Many members agreed that, although it would be desirable to further

 reduce the degree of monetary policy easing given that the economy

 would remain on an upward track and high level of prices would persist,

 it would be better to keep the Base Rate at its current level this month,

 considering such factors as the recent rapid pace of the won's appreciation

 against the US dollar and heightened uncertainties at home and abroad.

 Many members expressed the view, however, that while maintaining

 the Base Rate at its current level, the committee should clearly signal to

 the market that it would persistently proceed with the normalization of the

 Base Rate so as to reduce the possibility of inflation expectations

 spreading among the general public.

 Meanwhile, one member showed the concern that, if real interest

###### rates remained negative for a long time, the ample liquidity might create

 bubbles in the prices of assets, such as stocks and real estate, and

 financial institutions might then ease their lending attitudes, leading to a

 consequent further rise in household debt and worsening the

 macroeconomic imbalances.

 The member then maintained that, in the event of a business cycle

 transition amid heightened economic uncertainties, an awkward situation

 might come where the rate hike stance would have to be dropped without

 having quite tamed inflation. To prevent this situation, he added, the

 central bank needed to raise the Base Rate preemptively while there was

 still time.

 Another member expressed the opinion that rates needed to be

 normalized as soon as possible, since problems such as rising household

 debt, declining personal savings rates, soaring housing leasehold deposits as

 well as monthly rental fees and a large increase in real estate project

 financing loans were all related in considerable part to low interest rates.

 After the discussions detailed above, members decided by a majority

 vote to keep the Base Rate at its current level.

 (However, Mr. Kim, Dae Sik and Mr. Choi, Dosoung clearly

 dissented from this decision, and argued that the Base Rate should be

 raised by 25 basis points.)

###### < Ref > Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.00% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 emerging market economies to have continued to show favorable

 performances and the major advanced economies to have also kept

 up their paces of recovery. Going forward, the Committee forecasts

 the global economy to sustain its pace of recovery; nevertheless,

 the Committee recognizes the possibility of such factors as the

 political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, the sovereign

 debt concerns in some euro area countries, and the Great East

 Japan Earthquake posing downside risks to the global economy.

 □ For Korea, the Committee judges the domestic economy to have

 maintained its underlying upward trend on the strength of high

 growth shown by exports, even though consumption and facilities

 investment have faltered. Labor market conditions have also

 remained on a track of improvement, led by the private sector.

 Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the domestic

 economy will keep up its underlying trend, even in the presence of

 external risks.

 □ Consumer price inflation in Korea reached 4.7% in March, due

 mostly to the rises in prices of petroleum products and personal

 services. There is a growing possibility of this high rising price

 trend persisting in the coming months, driven largely by increased

 demand pressures from the economic upswing, by instability of

 international commodity prices, and by elevated inflation

###### expectations. As for housing prices, the upward movements in

 Seoul and its surrounding areas have continued and the upward

 trend in the rest of the country has accelerated, while leasehold

 deposits have continued to rise.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices have reached new historic

 highs and the Korean won appreciated significantly against the US

 dollar in response chiefly to the uptrend in the domestic economy,

 amid large fluctuations exhibited by price variables due to external

 risk factors. Long-term market interest rates have rebounded

 slightly, after having declined. The pace of growth in mortgage

 lending has accelerated compared to last month.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee, while taking overall account of

 financial and economic conditions both at home and abroad, will

 conduct monetary policy with a greater emphasis on ensuring that

 the basis for price stability is firmly anchored while the economy

 continues its sound growth.
