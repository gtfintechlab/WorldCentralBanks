##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on the Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions by members of the

 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas:

 Regarding the global economy, many members assessed that

 emerging market economies were maintaining steady growth momentums,

 but that advanced economies were showing signs of weakening paces of

 recovery due to the euro area sovereign debt crisis and the consequent

 spread of uncertainty. One member pointed out the possibility of a future

 slowdown of economic growth in emerging economies influenced by the

 delayed recoveries in advanced economies and persistence of international

 financial market unrest.

 Many members evaluated that, while the domestic economy was

 continuing to level off at around its long-term trend, its growth had

 recently appeared to be faltering somewhat. One of these members voiced

 concern about whether the current phase of the business cycle was

 shifting, as the cyclical component of GDP had been exhibiting a pattern

 of gradual decline.

 As to the future outlook, most members judged the downside risks to

 growth as high, given the recent signs of slowdown in some real

 economic indicators and the unstable movements of international financial

 markets. One member however forecast that Korea’s growth rate would

 not deviate greatly from its long-term trend level, unless a situation such

 as during the 2008 global financial crisis recurred.

###### Some members pointed out, regarding the domestic financial markets,

 that the volatility of stock prices and other price indicators had increased

 due to external destabilizing factors. One member assessed that, although

 domestic foreign exchange market volatility had risen considerably over the

 previous three months, it was markedly improved compared to the time of

 the global financial crisis in 2008, and attributed this mostly to the

 strengthened fundamentals of the Korean economy, to the improved

 external debt profile, and to the expanded sizes of Korea’s currency swap

 arrangements with Japan and China.

 Regarding consumer prices, most members anticipated that, although

 headline consumer price inflation had come in at 3.9% in October, down

 from 4.3% the previous month due largely to the stability of agricultural,

 livestock and fisheries product prices and the base effect from the previous

 year, it would fluctuate at a high level for the time being—owing chiefly

 to public utility charge hikes, to higher import prices, and to mounting

 pressures stemming from expected inflation.

 As to housing prices, one member appraised those in Seoul and its

 surrounding areas as having maintained their levels of the previous month,

 and those in the rest of the country to have risen at a somewhat slower

 pace.

##### Ⅲ. Remarks by Government Representative

###### Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the

 Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance,

 the government representative.

 With regard to the current economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister

 assessed that, although the economy was maintaining its trend of recovery,

###### as exemplified by increased production in the mining and manufacturing

 sector in September and improved employment conditions, there was

 mounting uncertainty about domestic economic developments as some real

 economic indicators including service sector production, retail sales and

 facilities investment were showing movements suggestive of a slight

 slowdown.

 Regarding prices, the 1st Vice Minister noted that consumer price

 inflation had dropped in October compared to the preceding month, but

 predicted that it would be somewhat higher in November due mostly to a

 base effect and to increases in import prices. He disclosed that the

 government would therefore push ahead with both short and long-term

 countermeasures for price stability going forward, as planned.

 As to export and import trends, the 1st Vice Minister remarked that

 exports had shown slower growth in October, due chiefly to the base

 effect and to decreased exports to the US and the EU in line with the

 global fiscal crisis, while imports had fallen from the preceding month

 owing largely to the depreciation of the Korean won against the US dollar

 and the decline in international commodity prices. He revealed that the

 October current account surplus was as a result estimated to be slightly

 wider than that in September.

 The 1st Vice Minister also assessed the employment situation as

 sustaining its overall buoyancy, notwithstanding the uncertainty surrounding

 external conditions.

##### Ⅳ. Discussions Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The main details of the MPC members’ discussion concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

###### Most members shared the opinion that, although it was necessary to

 press ahead with normalization of the Base Rate in order to curb inflation

 expectations and firmly anchor the basis for price stability, it would be

 better to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting

 period in view of the increasing downside risks to the domestic economy

 and the ongoing global financial market unrest.

 One member opined that attention should be paid to the fact that

 adverse effects from the persistence of low interest rates for an extended

 period were already appearing, in the form of a deepening of economic

 imbalances—with real interest rates currently remaining negative and

 household and corporate lending growth accelerating—and that the Base

 Rate hikes should consequently be resumed, once the global financial

 market unrest had eased to some extent and positive signs of changes in

 economic activity had reemerged.

 Another member expressed the view that, in circumstances like at

 present—where external destabilizing factors remained and economic

 conditions in the coming months were unclear—any sudden shift in the

 monetary policy stance might induce anxiety among economic agents and

 cause expectations for interest rate policy to be skewed, and that monetary

 policy effectiveness could thus be best secured by managing and guiding

 the formation of market expectations through announcement effects related

 to the direction of interest rate policy.

 After the discussions detailed above, the members decided

 unanimously to keep the Base Rate at its current level.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today

 to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting

 period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers that, while emerging market economies have shown favorable

 performances, major advanced economies have exhibited signs of

 sluggishness. Going forward the Committee judges that the global

 economy will show a recovery, albeit a moderate one, but that

 downside risks to growth are high, due mostly to the sovereign debt

 crisis in Europe and to the possibilities of the slumps in major country economies and the unrest in international financial markets

 continuing.

 □ In Korea, domestic demand has faltered but exports have continued

 to grow strongly. The trend of improvement in employment

 conditions has been sustained, led by the private sector. The

 Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will keep up its

 long-term trend of growth going forward, but recognizes the situation

 to be one in which downside risks to growth remain high due to the impact of external risk factors.

 □ Consumer price inflation declined to 3.9% in October owing to the

 stabilization of agricultural product prices, and core inflation recorded

 3.7%, down slightly from the previous month. In the coming months,

 factors including the declines in agricultural product prices will work

 to stabilize prices, but the Committee expects the inflation rate to

 fluctuate at a high level for the time being given factors such as the

 public utility charge hikes and stubbornly high inflation expectations. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas

###### maintained their September levels, while the upward trend in the rest

 of the country slowed somewhat from the previous month. The rate

 of increase in leasehold deposits meanwhile declined nationwide.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices and the exchange rate continued

 to fluctuate widely as unease concerning external risk factors

 persisted, and long-term market interest rates fell, affected primarily

 by foreigners' continued bond purchases.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and

 economic risk factors both at home and abroad, will conduct

 monetary policy so as to firmly anchor the basis for price stability

 amid continuing sound growth of the economy.
