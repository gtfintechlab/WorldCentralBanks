##### Ⅱ. Discussion of Economic Situation (Summary)2)

###### After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions among members of the

 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas:

 Concerning the global economy, many members assessed emerging

 market economies to be sustaining strong growth, and major advanced

 economies including the U.S. to be showing economic recoveries stronger

 than those expected at the end of last year. A few members, however,

 noted that risk factors remained, including the heightened volatility of

 international commodity prices, further tightening by China, and the

 sovereign debt problems in some European countries. One member

 meanwhile pointed out that, in the global financial markets, there were

 signs of investment funds moving from the bond markets into the stock

 markets, and from emerging market countries into advanced countries, as

 the tendency toward high-risk, high-yield investment has intensified.

 Most members evaluated the recent domestic economy as sustaining

 its solid upward path, led by strong export growth and the steady increase

 in domestic demand.

 They commented that exports showed strong growth, having hit an

 all-time monthly high in January, that facilities and construction investment

 was seen to be on the rise, and that production in both the manufacturing

 and services sectors was steadily growing.

 Regarding the future outlook, members anticipated that the domestic

 economy would remain on a solid upward track. Many members'

 evaluation was that export conditions were likely to remain favorable, on

 the back of high growth in emerging market economies and strengthened

###### momentum of recovery in the advanced economies, and that domestic

 demand was expected to rise steadily, bolstered by increased household

 purchasing power and strong corporate investment sentiment. One

 member, however, pointed out the necessity of paying attention to the

 economic situation in the coming months, in view of the declines in both

 the consumer survey index and the business survey index.

 Members appraised the domestic financial markets as having remained

 stable overall, despite the mounting geopolitical risks in the MENA region.

 They noted that long-term market rates had risen greatly, affected by the

 Base Rate hike, the expectations of rising prices, and an increase in

 Treasury bond issuance volume, and added that stock prices had recorded

 a historic high and had fallen slightly afterwards, while the Korean won

 had appreciated against the US dollar.

 Members pointed to the fast acceleration of the consumer price index

 from December last year to reach 4.1% year-on-year in January, centering

 around petroleum and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products. Most

 members anticipated that the CPI would rise above the upper bound of the

 inflation target for the time being, owing to heightened inflation pressures

 from both the demand and supply sides. They appraised the perception of

 inflation instability by the general public as being very high, since inflation

 expectations had risen sharply.

 As to the real estate market, members noted that housing leasehold

 deposits had continued to rise, and that housing sales prices showed

 upward movements in Seoul and its surrounding areas while maintaining

 their upward trend in the rest of the country. One member pointed out

 that, with housing leasehold deposits sustaining their upward track,

 leasehold demand was shifting to housing purchase demand, thus also

 affecting housing sales prices.

##### Ⅲ. Remarks by Government Representative

###### Prior to the members' discussions regarding the Base Rate, the

 Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance,

 who explained the current economic situation and price trends, and the

 directions of policies in response to these trends, and then left the

 meeting.

 The 1st Vice Minister commented that the domestic economy had

 recently remained on an overall course of recovery, boosted by the

 continued improvement of the employment market, particularly in the

 private sector, amid sustained strengths of exports and of production in the

 manufacturing and services sectors.

 With regard to prices, meanwhile, the 1st Vice Minister mentioned

 that the situation remained difficult owing to supply-side shocks including

 the outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, the severe cold weather and the

 run-up in global commodity prices, and added that external uncertainties

 appeared to be increasing somewhat due to the political unrest in the

 Middle East and widespread global inflation.

 Consequently, the 1st Vice Minister noted that, the focus of

 government policy would be placed on actively containing inflation

 expectations.

##### Ⅳ. Discussion Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

###### The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in

 the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

###### Many members agreed that, although the degree of financial easing

 needed to be gradually reduced, as concerns about rising prices were

 mounting with the CPI and expected inflation having increased

 substantially of late, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its

 current level this month, because a consecutive Base Rate hike might

 undermine the stability of price variables in the financial markets, and

 because the effects of government measures needed to be monitored.

 One of them voiced the opinion that a hike in the Base Rate in

 response to price rises of this type might have more disadvantages than

 advantages, since recent price rises were attributable mainly to supply-side

 factors.

 However, most members expressed the view that appropriate signals

 should be delivered to the markets so that inflation expectations could be

 calmed and economic agents primed for additional Base Rate hikes.

 Meanwhile, some other members commented that as the expected

 inflation in the private sector had risen sharply, and there was also a

 strong possibility of the run-up in global commodity prices leading to rises

 in wage and overall price, thus the stance of financial easing needed to be

 adjusted preemptively to soothe inflation expectations and demand-side

 pressures.

 One of them expressed concern that a belated policy response from

 the central bank would most likely be unable to stabilize prices and only

 further dampen real economic activities.

 After the discussions detailed above, members decided by a majority

 decision to keep the Base Rate at its current level.

 (However, Mr. Kim, Dae Sik and Mr. Choi, Dosoung clearly

 dissented from this decision, and advocated that the Base Rate be raised

 by 25 basis points.)

###### < Ref > Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided

 today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the

 intermeeting period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 emerging market economies to have continued to show favorable performances and the major advanced economies to have also kept

 up their paces of recovery. Going forward, the Committee forecasts

 the global economy to sustain its pace of recovery; nevertheless,

 the Committee recognizes that the possibilities of future

 developments, for example heightened volatility of international

 commodity prices and international financial market unrest arising

 from the sovereign debt concerns in some euro area countries,

 remain as risk factors.

 □ For Korea, the Committee judges the domestic economy to have

 maintained its underlying upward trend, given for instance that

 exports have continued on their strong growth track and that

 domestic demand has steadily increased. Labor market conditions

 have also shown ongoing improvement, led by the private sector.

 Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the domestic

 economy will keep up its underlying trend, even in the presence of

 external risks.

 □ Consumer price inflation in Korea has increased significantly, driven

 by the prices of petroleum products and farm produce. In the

 coming months, the Committee expects high inflation expectations

 to continue and inflationary pressures to also persist as the

 economic upswing continues. In the real estate market, leasehold

 deposits have continued to rise, while housing prices in Seoul and

###### its surrounding areas have shown upward movements and those in

 the rest of the country have sustained their upward trend.

 □ In the financial markets, long-term market interest rates have

 increased by a large margin, in response chiefly to the Base Rate

 hike in January, to inflation expectations and to the increase in

 volume of Treasury bonds issued. Stock prices, after having risen

 steeply, boosted mainly by the uptrend in economic activity, have since fallen back and the Korean won has appreciated. Mortgage

 lending has marked no more than a slight increase, due primarily

 to seasonal factors.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy in

 such a way as to firmly anchor the basis for price stability while

 the economy continues its sound growth. In carrying out policy,

 the Committee will take overall account of financial and economic

 conditions both at home and abroad.
