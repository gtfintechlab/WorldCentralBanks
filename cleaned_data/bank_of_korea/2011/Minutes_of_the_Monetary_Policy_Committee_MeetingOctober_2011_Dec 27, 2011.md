##### Ⅱ. Summary of Discussion on Current Economic Situation[2)]

###### After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in

 Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions by members of the

 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas:

 Regarding the global economy, members assessed the recoveries in

 the U.S. and other advanced economies to have exhibited signs of being

 delayed further, although emerging market economies maintained their

 growth momentums. One member, however, noted that in the event of a

 future intensification of the economic downturn in the major advanced

 countries, it was uncertain whether emerging market countries could

 continuously provide the driving force for the recovery of the world

 economy.

 Most members evaluated the domestic economy as maintaining its

 uptrend, boosted primarily by favorable exports and increases in facilities

 and construction investment, but as appearing to have gradually slackened

 in its pace of growth from the second half of this year. One member

 pointed out that the deterioration in employment conditions had persisted

 in terms of quality, because, although the number of those employed had

 increased, this was mainly concentrated on temporary and daily workers.

 On the future outlook, many members anticipated that the domestic

 economy would maintain growth at around the level of its long-term trend,

 although it would not show as good a performance as previously expected

 due to the effects of deteriorating external conditions. One member

 appraised the downside risks to growth to have become larger, however,

 due to the prospect of a slump in the world economy and to the global

###### financial market unrest.

 Some members mentioned, regarding the domestic financial markets,

 that stock prices and the exchange rate have exhibited wide fluctuations

 when external risk factors have emerged. One member pointed out that

 foreign currency borrowing conditions appeared to have deteriorated

 compared with the previous month, due mostly to a rise in the borrowing

 spread and to shortening of debt maturity.

 Regarding consumer prices, most members noted that, although

 consumer price inflation had posted a high rate in September as well, at

 4.3%, it had declined from the month before thanks to the stability of

 agricultural product prices. Some members pointed out that inflation

 would gradually slow in the future, should demand-side pressures ease as

 the economic upturn faltered, and should the base-period effect from the

 year before set in, but that there could be no relaxing of vigilance against

 the risk of the current stubbornly high level of expected inflation acting as

 a factor pressuring prices higher for a considerable time.

 As for housing sales prices, one member appraised those in Seoul

 and its surrounding areas as having maintained their levels of the previous

 month, and those in the rest of the country to have kept up their trends

 of increase.

 Ⅲ. Remarks by Government Representative

 Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the

 Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance,

 the government representative.

 With regard to the current economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister

###### commented that, although a mild pick-up in economic activity was

 continuing for the moment, bolstered by the recovery in the service sector

 and despite lackluster production in the manufacturing sector, there was

 mounting uncertainty about economic developments at home and abroad

 going forward.

 Regarding prices, the 1st Vice Minister remarked that consumer price

 inflation had posted a 4.3% rise in September, down 1.0%p from August,

 and predicted that it would remain on a downward path in October as

 well. He added, however, that if exchange rate volatility were to increase

 due to such factors as the recent euro area sovereign debt crisis and the

 prospect of a global economic slowdown, this could act as a factor

 destabilizing prices.

 As to the employment trend, the 1st Vice Minister noted that

 although the number of persons employed had shown a slower pace of

 increase in September than in the previous month—at about 260,000

 persons year-on-year—the overall labor market recovery appeared to be

 continuing. He then disclosed that the number of employed was forecast

 to remain on the rise in October, led by the service sector, with the

 easing of factors that had temporarily restricted employment such as the

 effects of the Chuseok holidays.

 Ⅳ. Discussions Related to Monetary Policy Decision (Summary)

 The main details of the MPC members’ discussion concerning a

 change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows:

 Many members shared the opinion that, considering domestic

 economic and price conditions, it was necessary to adhere to the current

 policy stance of curbing inflation expectations through normalization of the

###### Base Rate and of firmly anchoring the basis for price stability, but that it

 would be better to hold the Base Rate at its current level this month in

 view of the increasing downside risks to the world economy and the

 influence of international financial market unrest on the domestic financial

 markets.

 One member noted that, as the downside risks to the growth path

 were becoming ever more prominent at this time, financial and economic

 developments at home and abroad must be scrutinized while proceeding

 with policy adjustment at a measured pace.

 On the other hand, another member pointed out that serious

 economic imbalances might arise, such as expansion of the monetary base,

 generation of rapid inflation and formation of asset bubbles, should real

 interest rates remain negative for a long time. He then expressed the

 view that the drive to reduce the scale of monetary accommodativeness

 must be continued once the uncertainties surrounding economic activity

 had receded somewhat with the calming of international financial market

 turmoil.

 After the discussions detailed above, members decided unanimously to

 keep the Base Rate at its current level.

###### Monetary Policy Decision

 □ The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today

 to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting

 period.

 □ Based on currently available information, the Committee considers

 that, while emerging market economies have shown favorable

 performances, major advanced economies have exhibited signs of sluggishness. Going forward the Committee forecasts that the global

 economy will show a recovery, albeit a moderate one; nevertheless,

 the Committee judges that downside risks to growth have expanded
 —due mostly to the likelihood of the sovereign debt problems in
 Europe spreading, and to the possibilities of the slumps in major

 country economies and the unrest in international financial markets

 continuing.

 □ In Korea, exports have sustained their high growth and domestic demand has posted a modest rising trend. On the employment front,

 although the increase in the number of employed slowed in

 September due to temporary factors, the trend of improvement led

 by the private sector appears to be continuing. The Committee

 anticipates that the domestic economy will keep up its long-term

 trend of growth going forward, but judges the downside risks to

 growth to have increased due to the impact of external risk factors.

 □ Consumer price inflation declined to 4.3% in September, owing to the stabilization of agricultural product prices. The Committee expects

 the pace of decline in inflation to be modest in the coming months,

 given stubbornly high inflation expectations, although factors such as

 declines in agricultural product prices and the base effect from last

 year will work to bring inflation down. Core inflation meanwhile

 forecast to remain elevated for the time being. As for housing prices,

 those in Seoul and its surrounding areas maintained their August

 levels, while prices in the rest of the country continued to climb at

 a rapid pace. The rate of increase in leasehold deposits also rose

 further.

 □ In the financial markets, stock prices and the exchange rate continued to fluctuate widely, mainly reflecting unease concerning external risk

 factors. Long-term market interest rates fell somewhat, affected

 primarily by concerns over slowdowns in economic growth both at

 home and abroad and by foreigners' continued bond purchases.

 □ Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and

 economic risk factors both at home and abroad, will conduct

 monetary policy with a greater emphasis on ensuring that the basis

 for price stability is firmly anchored while the economy continues its sound growth.
