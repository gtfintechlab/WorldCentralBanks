##### Ⅱ. Discussions Concerning the Monetary Policy Decision

At the July 11, 2024, Monetary Policy Board meeting, each member

expressed their opinion on the Bank of Korea’s Base Rate decision.

All members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be
desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% level for the
intermeeting period.

One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold the

Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.5% for the intermeeting period.

The member commented that the global economy was expected to

maintain modest growth as initially projected, while economic trends would
continue to vary in major countries. Inflation continues to moderate in its
underlying trend across all major countries, but the expected point at which
inflation converges on the target level differs among countries.

Regarding the domestic economy, the member saw that the economy was

exhibiting different trends across sectors, with exports remaining strong while
domestic demand was more sluggish than expected. Private consumption showed
strong growth in the first quarter, driven by one-off factors, before correcting in
the second quarter. Construction investment remains lackluster due to the
sluggishness of construction commencements and orders received, while facilities
investment also suffers from delayed investment by some corporations. Going
forward, economic growth is expected to remain consistent with the pace
projected in May (2.5%), as exports are likely to maintain favorable growth, led
by a buoyant IT industry, and consumption is also likely to recover gradually,
affected by improvements in real income conditions and corporate performance.
Affected by sluggish domestic demand, employment is forecast to show
slower-than-expected growth, particularly in the contact-intensive services sector.

With regard to the real estate market, the volume of housing transactions

has been increasing, led by those of Seoul apartments, and housing prices have
exhibited faster growth in the Seoul metropolitan region, while remaining on the
decline in provincial areas. Concerning domestic inflation, consumer price

2

inflation as a whole has been slowing, as core inflation continues to slow and
as agricultural product price growth has recently decelerated significantly.
Considering the base effect from last year’s surge in oil and agricultural product
prices and the downward stabilization of core inflation, inflation will likely
continue to slow going forward.

Regarding international financial markets, the member noted that major

price variables fluctuated substantially, influenced largely by changing

expectations of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and political
uncertainties in the U.S. and Europe. In domestic financial markets, financial
conditions continue to ease, as seen in the declines in market and lending rates
driven by the preemptive reflection of expectations for a shift in domestic and
international monetary policy stances. Growth in household lending, and home
mortgage lending in particular, has been accelerating. The won-dollar exchange
rate has risen, affected by the strengthening dollar and the weakening yen, and
the foreign capital market remains stable. However, there are persistent
uncertainties related to project financing restructuring, which is one risk factor in
domestic financial markets, and exchange rate risks persist due to changing
expectations of a shift in the U.S. Fed’s monetary policy, in addition to recent
high exchange rate levels. In this regard, a close monitoring of relevant
developments is required.

In overall consideration of the above-mentioned economic and financial

conditions, the member believed that it was desirable to keep the Base Rate at
the current 3.5% at this meeting. Although there has been further progress in
disinflation since the previous meeting, there remain uncertainties caused by
geopolitical risks and weather conditions. Persistent expectations of high inflation
necessitate a wait-and-see approach to determine whether inflation will converge
on the target level, and it is necessary to consider financial stability aspects,
such as increasing FX volatility, a substantial uptrend in household lending, and
higher housing prices in the Seoul metropolitan area.

In future monetary policy operations, the member stated that decisions

about adjusting the monetary policy stance should be made after closely
monitoring inflation and growth paths, examining financial stability risks,
including monetary policy changes in major countries, upward pressure on
exchange rates, and household debt, and should be made in consideration of
monetary and macro-prudential policy coordination.

Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave

the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% for the intermeeting period.

The member commented that inflation is slowing in major countries and

that some central banks are changing their policy stance accordingly. In the U.S.,
the unemployment rate has risen, implying a slight sluggishness in the labor
market. However, it is uncertain when the U.S. is going to pivot, with some
voices arguing that more confidence regarding disinflation is needed.

Regarding the domestic economy, the member expected GDP growth to

be around 2.5% in 2024, in line with previous projections, due to sluggish
domestic demand with high prices and high interest rates, although exports,
including semiconductors, were strong. While aggregate labor market indicators,
such as employment and unemployment rates, show favorable trends, the number
of persons employed may increase at a slower pace due to the weak
construction sector.

The member noted that consumer price inflation and core inflation in

June stood at 2.4% and 2.2%, respectively, converging on the target level of
2%. The stabilization of prices, which is the primary objective of monetary
policy, is encouraging and this is thanks to the prolonged policy of high interest
rates. If the downward trend in inflation continues, a rate cut could be
considered, especially given the weak domestic economy.

However, the member mentioned that two conditions have to be met first

if there is to be a rate cut. First, there must be a stabilization of the foreign
exchange market. Most of the currencies are weak because of the strong dollar.
However, it is a red flag that the Korean won to U.S. dollar rate is stuck in
the upper 1,300 won range, even when the current account is in surplus. Second,
there must be economic restructuring and housing price stabilization. A possible
rate cut should not undermine efforts to restructure the economy or trigger a rise
in housing prices in some regions. It is also worrying that the increase in
household debt is accelerating slightly, with most of it concentrated in home
mortgages.

The member saw that it is very disappointing that more aggressive

deleveraging could not have been made while interest rates were high. Going
forward, this may hinder Korea’s economic growth and limit the flexibility of
monetary policy operations.

The member assessed that, for now, the Base Rate should be maintained

at the current level of 3.50%, while closely monitoring major countries’
management of their monetary policies, the process of project financing
restructuring in the real estate market, and developments in financial and foreign
exchange markets.

Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold

the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50%.

The member saw that the global economy has continued to grow at a

moderate pace. Overall growth in the U.S. is favorable, although there are signs
of a slowdown in consumption, and the eurozone economy is recovering, led by
consumption, amid political instability. China is showing signs of a recovery
with domestic stimulus measures and improved exports, although there is
weakness in the real estate market. While some central banks‘ policy rates have
started to move into less restrictive levels, expectations as to when and how
many rate cuts the U.S. Fed will make have been highly volatile following the
release of key U.S. economic data, leading to increased volatility in global
financial markets.

The member assessed that, although the domestic economy underwent a

significant adjustment following the rebound in domestic demand in the first
quarter, recovery has continued thanks to robust export growth. In terms of
employment, additional monitoring is needed as the increase in the number of
persons employed has recently slowed. Consumption adjusted in the second
quarter after the strong increase in the first quarter, but recovery is expected to
continue in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, construction investment is
expected to decline due to the effects of the contraction in housing starts to
date. Facilities investment is also expected to grow at a slower pace due to
revised investment plans at IT companies.

With regard to the domestic foreign exchange market, the member noted

that the won-dollar exchange rate remained high, slightly below the 1,400 won
level. Going forward, attention should be paid to the possibility that the
exchange rate may become highly volatile due to political conditions in major
countries, the weakening Japanese yen and Chinese yuan, and due to the
continued reversal of the Korea-U.S. interest rate differential.

As for inflation, the member stated that consumer price inflation declined

to the mid-2% range and that inflation expectations among the general public
fell to the 3% range. As inflation slows in accordance with the forecast path,
there are growing expectations that inflation will converge on its target level in
the second half of next year. However, inflation expectations remain higher than
the target level and adjustments in public utility charges are becoming more
likely. Additionally, inflation may have become more sensitive to the exchange
rate than before. In this regard, continued attention should be paid to future
upside risks to inflation.

The member commented that domestic financial conditions have eased

substantially, affected by widespread expectations of rate cuts at home and
abroad. Corporate financing and the supply-demand conditions for corporate and
other credit bonds have been favorable, while money growth has remained in the
upper 5% range. Risks related to project financing have been under control
overall, as seen in the falling interest rates on PF-ABCPs.

However, the member observed that household lending exhibited

faster-than-expected growth, boosted by falling home mortgage rates, and the
supply of government-sponsored finance, and that apartment sale prices and
leasehold deposits have continued to rise, particularly in the Seoul metropolitan
area. Looking back at patterns of the past, this trend can lead to overheating of
the entire housing market.

The member argued that particular attention should be paid to rising

housing prices, as they could cause household debt to increase and housing
expenses to rise, consequently limiting household consumption and aggravating
inflationary presssure. More specifically, there is a higher likelihood of housing
sale prices becoming more sensitive to lending rates, as household liquidity
holdings have increased and recent housing transactions have been mostly driven
by non-speculative demand. In this regard, inflows of liquidity into the housing
market need to be closely monitored, considering progress in macro-prudential
policy implementations, such as future management of policy loans and the
introduction of stress DSRs.

In summary, the member saw that, while inflation was slowing toward

its target level, upside risks still required attention, and that, given current
conditions, including exchange rate increases, household debt growth, and rising
housing prices, any monetary easing would bring about higher risks than before.

In light of this, it will be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged at 3.5%
at this time and to leave it at the current level for the time being.

The member pointed out that future monetary policy decisions should be

made in comprehensive consideration of both the benefits and risks of any Base
Rate adjustment concerning the overall economy and financial conditions,
including growth and inflation, household debt and housing prices, and debt
servicing burdens. This should include developments in external conditions and
consequent FX market changes, such as those in exchange rates, any progress
made in macro-prudential policy implementations, and the degree of convergence
of inflation toward its target level over the medium-term horizon.

Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave

the Base Rate unchanged at this meeting and to maintain it at 3.50%.

The member commented that global and domestic economic conditions

have followed a similar trend since the last meeting. Although the U.S.
economy, which has led the global economy, is now slowing slightly, the global
economy is expected to continue to expand moderately, supported by the
recovery in the euro area and in emerging countries.

The member observed that while the easing of the global contractionary

stance and improving trade conditions are putting upward pressure on the
economy, the persistence of high interest rates, never-ending regional conflicts,
the strong dollar, which has recently become even more apparent, and political
uncertainties, with elections in the U.S. and in other key countries, are all
putting downward pressure on the economy.

The member expects the Korean economy to grow at a slower pace in

the second quarter due to weak domestic demand, particularly in retail sales,
facilities investment, and construction investment, although exports were strong.
However, the economy is expected to recover starting in the second half of this
year. As we see that consumption and investment demand in major countries are
spilling over into the manufacturing sector, supported by robust employment, a
recovery in domestic demand would be crucial in order to follow the momentum
of the global economic expansion.

Though uncertainties still remain on the supply side, the member judged

7


-----

that prices are stabilizing, or at least the prices that are affected by monetary
policy operations are on a downward trend toward the target level.

The member stated that while the dollar remains strong and monetary

policies are beginning to differentiate across countries, exposure to external risks
has increased due to the restructuring of the foreign exchange market, making it
necessary to monitor exchange rate volatility.

The member saw that Korea’s financial and foreign capital markets have

been stable overall. However, as housing prices in the Seoul metropolitan region
are rising, leading to a significant increase in household lending, it is important
to monitor economic sentiment in the real estate market and to manage
household lending.

In overall consideration of the domestic and international economic

environments, the member judged that there is not much need to adjust the
current Base Rate and that it is therefore appropriate to leave it unchanged at
3.5%.

The member noted that, as countries are differentiating their monetary

policies according to their own economic contitions, Korea is also at a crucial
moment when it needs to review the benefits and costs of a policy pivot on the
real and financial sectors and the trade-offs in policy effects across sectors, and
to find the right combination of monetary and macroprudential policies to
minimize costs.

Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to

maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.

The member commented that the global economy had been on a modest

recovery lately, with a strong U.S. economy spilling over into other economies,
including Europe, Japan, and China. The U.S. economy has made some progress
on disinflation, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Personal Consumption
Expenditures (PCE) inflation declining slightly in May. However, the pace of
disinflation is expected to remain moderate as the labor market remains strong,
despite the gradual normalization of the labor market, with the June

unemployment rate slightly higher than expectations. The euro area is improving
slightly, led by exports, and the Chinese economy is showing signs of a

recovery, but the real estate sector there remains sluggish. The Japanese economy
has shown signs of a modest recovery, but it is somewhat unclear whether this
will continue.

The member pointed out that in the domestic economy exports were

performing better than expected, influenced by the global economic recovery,
whereas domestic demand, including private consumption, facilities investment,
and construction investment, remained weaker than anticipated. The contrasting
effects of external and internal demand are offsetting each other, leading to
overall economic growth that does not significantly deviate from previous
forecasts. In the labor market, the increase in the number of persons employed
remained at a low level during May and June. Meanwhile, inflation continued to
show a clear slowdown, largely in line with the forecast path, driven by falling
agricultural product prices. In addition, based on the three-month moving average
of month-on-month inflation, there has been significant progress in slowing
consumer and core inflation, suggesting that the conditions necessary for a rate
cut are largely met from an inflation perspective.

The member saw that in international financial markets political

uncertainties in Europe and in the U.S., as well as changing expectations
regarding the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate cuts, had led to significant fluctuations
and increased volatility in major countries' long-term government bond yields.
This has also caused fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). Meanwhile,
the yen has continued to weaken significantly, which appears to be due to the
prevailing expectation that Japan's policy rate and neutral rate will remain low
for an extended period, given the condition of the Japanese economy. The
Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate has risen due to increased political
uncertainty in major countries and the significant weakening of the yen, but the
possibility of a rapid change in the won/dollar exchange rate is considered
limited, as global dollar liquidity remains abundant and as the dollar remains
strong.

The member pointed out that, in domestic financial markets, overall

liquidity remained very favorable as short-term interest rates remained at low
levels and as monetary (M2) growth slightly increased. In addition, the degree of
tightening in financial conditions eased as long-term government bond yields
declined significantly compared to those in major advanced economies, due to
strengthening expectations of a pivot from a contractionary monetary policy
stance at home and abroad, as well as to large net purchases of government

bond futures by foreign investors. Meanwhile, the recent increase in housing
transactions has led to a significant increase in home mortgage lending, and
housing prices have been rising steeply, particularly in Seoul and in the greater
Seoul metropolitan area. Given the historically high correlation between housing
prices and household debt levels, it is necessary to be cautious about the
possibility of another substantial increase in household debt if the upward trend
in housing prices continues. Meanwhile, the delinquency rate on corporate loans,
especially among non-bank financial institutions, continues to rise. In the case of
real estate project financing, risks remain, particularly for some construction
companies and non-bank financial institutions with significant real estate project
financing exposure. As the net issuance of public corporation bonds is expected
to increase in the second half of the year, it is necessary to ensure financial
market stability to prevent financial market turbulence from materializing during
the restructuring process of real estate project financing.

The member presented the opinion that, taking into consideration these

domestic and international economic and financial conditions, it is deemed
appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% at this time.
While pivot risk on the inflation side has significantly decreased, pivot risk on
the financial stability side stemming from the expansion of housing price growth
has increased. It will be necessary to closely monitor future developments in
inflation and housing prices to determine the timing of a rate cut and it will be
essential to coordinate closely with macroprudential policies to ensure that a rate
cut does not amplify financial market instability.

Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave

the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% at this meeting.

The member commented that the global economy maintained modest

growth, boosted by a recovery in the global manufacturing sector. The economic
upturn is expected to continue, but its pace will depend on the timing and pace
of monetary policy shifts in major economies, alongside developments concerning
geopolitical risks and political uncertainties.

The member stated that inflation in major countries varied from country

to country, but it was continuing to slow, with the pace generally becoming
more moderate. However, after a temporary decline due to the announcement of
smaller voluntary production cuts by OPEC+, international oil prices have risen

10

again due to renewed military tensions in the Middle East and prospects of
increased crude oil demand.

The member saw that, in international financial markets, major price

variables fluctuated repeatedly, influenced by changes in expectations of the U.S.
Federal Reserve's monetary policy and by a preference for safe assets resulting
from political instability in Europe.

The member noted that, concerning the domestic economy, while exports

continued to show high growth, particularly in IT products, including

semiconductors, domestic demand remained sluggish. Moving forward, the
domestic economy is expected to show a moderate growth trend as robust export
momentum continues and as sluggishness in domestic demand gradually eases
due to slowing inflation and improving household real income conditions.

The member saw that domestic inflation continued its slowing trend. In

June, consumer price inflation eased to 2.4%, driven by a substantial deceleration
in agricultural product price increases, while core inflation remained in the low
2% range. Although this disinflation trend is expected to continue going forward,
it is important to remain vigilant about the developments and impacts of major
upside risk factors, such as international oil prices, exchange rates, and
agricultural product prices.

The member commented that, in domestic financial markets, government

bond yields declined due to expectations of a shift in domestic and international
monetary policy stances, while the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate rose
owing to increased political uncertainty in Europe, interest rate cuts in some
advanced economies, and a weaker yen.

The member stated that household loans in the financial sector were

continuing to grow at a somewhat high rate, mainly driven by home mortgage
loans. This appears to be because the expansion of government sponsored
finance and the decline in bank mortgage lending rates have improved buying
sentiment, which has led to an upward shift in apartment prices in the Seoul
metropolitan area and to increased transaction volumes. Considering this situation,
it is essential to pay close attention to the possibility of a resumption of a
buildup in financial imbalances for the time being.

Meanwhile, the member noted that the delinquency rate on corporate

11


-----

loans continued to rise, particularly in the non-banking sector. It is essential to
closely monitor business conditions and financial risks in the construction and
real estate industries, as well as the potential increase in risks within the
non-banking sector during the restructuring process of real estate project
financing.

In summary, the member saw that inflation was expected to continue to

decelerate and the domestic economy was expected to continue to show moderate
growth. However, there is a heightened need for caution regarding the potential
increase in volatility in foreign exchange markets, and the accumulation of
financial imbalances, including rising housing prices and household debt.

Taking these factors into overall consideration, the member was of the

view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate unchanged at the
current level of 3.50% at this meeting. At the same time, it should be necessary
to continue to effectively manage market expectations through appropriate
communication to prevent excessive expectations of a shift in the policy stance
that could escalate risks regarding foreign exchange markets and financial
stability.
