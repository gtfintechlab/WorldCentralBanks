##### Ⅱ. Discussions Concerning Monetary Policy Decision

At the February 22, 2024, Monetary Policy Board meeting, each member

expressed their opinion on the Bank of Korea’s Base Rate decision.

All members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the

domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be
desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% level for the
intermeeting period.

One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the

Base Rate at its current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.

The member commented on the global economy, saying that, despite the

continuing services-driven recovery in demand, inflation had slowed due to
weaker goods demand, a result of high interest rates and stabilized energy prices.
The member pointed out that there were both upside and downside pressures in
the U.S., with upside pressures being the continued fiscal expansion, inflows of
direct and indirect investment, and the increase in productivity, and the downside
pressures being the exhaustion of excess savings, slowed investment related to
industrial policy, and the drop in the labor market vacancy rate. The member,
however, saw that the dominant projection for the U.S. economy was that it
would grow at more than 2% this year. The member added that despite the
decline in goods prices, supercore inflation and housing services inflation had
remained elevated, pushing back the expected timing of the U.S. Federal
Reserve’s pivot to beyond the mid-year. The member expected that growth would
remain uneven across countries, with slowing growth in Europe and China due
to high interest rates and a real estate slump, respectively, and solid growth in
Japan and Asian emerging economies.

The member assessed that Korea’s recovery had been sustained since the
second half of 2023. The member observed that exports and facilities investment
had continued to improve driven by the semiconductor sector, while the recovery
in private consumption had weakened and construction investment had shifted to
a decline. The member thought that private consumption growth would be
unlikely to show any meaningful increase going forward, given the large debt
repayment burden and a weakening of babyboomers’ propensity to consume

following their retirement. The member analyzed that this weak domestic demand
was a key driver of disinflation in Korea, as it makes it difficult to pass on
accumulated cost pressures to the second round, even in the face of supply
shocks, such as the surge in agricultural prices since the second half of last
year.

Regarding foreign exchange markets, the member observed that, despite

the strong dollar, the Korean won had recorded a smaller depreciation than
currencies of other major trading partners, driven by the expected increase in
current account surplus and by a rise in foreign investment funds, and that FX
liquidity conditions had remained sound. About financial markets, the member
commented that despite the rise in market interest rates driven by weakened
expectations for the U.S. Fed’s early rate cuts, market sentiments had generally
remained stable, but that the potential risk associated with real estate project
financing was still high, with home mortgage loans and corporate loans
continuing to soar.

In summary, the member mentioned that exports and facilities investment
were the main drivers of growth with favorable external conditions, while private
consumption was sluggish, and inflation continued to slow moderately.

Considering the inflation outlook, the member expected that the real Base Rate
would exceed the neutral rate of interest after the second quarter, constraining
private consumption even further. The member believed, however, that it was too
early to discuss a pivot, given that inflation expectations were still high at 3%,
that consumer price inflation was expected to hover above the target level for a
considerable time, and that the upside risk from supply still existed. The member
added that caution must be taken against a premature expectation for a pivot, as
it can stimulate home buyer sentiment, which had weakened since the fourth
quarter of 2023, and push up private debt further. The member viewed, however,
that a pivot could begin when it is sufficiently clear that inflation is converging
toward the target level along the projected path. In this case, the member argued
that coordination with macroprudential policy should be carried out first to
contain any debt growth.

Another member noted that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base

Rate at the current level of 3.50% for this meeting.

The member noted that consumer prices were likely to experience

3

temporary volatility as sluggish domestic demand is expected to continue for
some time, but in the absence of unforseen external shocks on the supply side,
they appeared to have entered a phase of secular moderation. However, the
member argued that the downward trend would likely see resistance as it
approaches the target, given uncertainties such as high agricultural product prices
and instability in oil prices stemming from geopolitical risks. The member
commented that, despite the overall slowdown in inflation, it is still above the
target, and it appears that it will take some time for the gap between headline
inflation and perceived inflation among individuals to narrow due to the already
elevated level of prices.

The member noted that the global economy had been supported by
domestic demand, and mainly consumption, as trade had contracted significantly
due to the intensified bloc formation and the fragmentation of the global
economy since the pandemic, and it could be said that there had been a
divergence in growth among countries based on the size of their domestic
demand. The member commented that, currently, the growth rate was still below
the long-term average, as the high interest rate situation had been persisting
longer than expected, but it was expected to improve moderately in the second
half of the year thanks to improved financial conditions and the resumption of
global investment and trade.

The member predicted that, going forward, regional and national
economic performances would diverge depending on how swiftly and effectively
each country’s economic policy responds to the easing of global tightening and
improving trade conditions, on their ability to coordinate internationally, and on
the resilience of employment.

Meanwhile, the member saw that, in the domestic economy, the recovery
in consumption was not meeting expectations and that growth was constrained by
weak construction investment. However, the member expected growth to
gradually moderate as consumer sentiment had increased slightly of late, and as
the export sector offset weaker domestic demand, supported by improving global
trade conditions. The member pointed out that, as the government's sound fiscal
stance continued, the role and direction of monetary policy would be critical.
The member noted that financial markets were seeing increased caution toward
real estate project financing, particularly among non-bank financial institutions.
However, the member believed that the potential for any spillover into financial
system risks would likely be limited due to policy authorities' multifaceted

responses, such as workouts, as well as to substantial loan loss provisions.

The member pointed out that high household loans weigh greatly on the
economy. Although its growth had been slow recently, the member believed that
the level was too high, and thus would be a key factor along with housing
prices in determining the timing of a pivot. The member added that growing
uncertainties over the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in the second
half of this year would likely increase volatility in financial and foreign
exchange markets. In the member’s view, Korea’s high reliance on foreign trade
makes it sensitive to changes in trade conditions and exchange rates caused by
policy shifts in major countries, and thus appropriate measures should be taken
in advance.

In consideration of the above-mentioned economic and financial

conditions at home and abroad, the member assessed that the Base Rate should
be maintained at the current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period. The
member added that future responses should be made based on monitoring of
changes in the external economic environment, such as monetary policy decisions
in major countries, including the U.S., and geopolitical risks, as well as internal
factors including the extent of vulnerability amid the high interest rate
environment, the stability of the slowing trend of inflation, and developments
among household loans.

Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to
leave the Base Rate unchanged at this meeting and to maintain it at 3.50%.

The member observed that global economic growth had fallen short of
its long-term average, affected by global monetary tightening, but that growth
had been uneven across countries. The member noted the view that, in the U.S.,
the pivot could come later than expected by the market, given the U.S.’s
continuously solid labor market and strong growth.

The member expected that the domestic economy would grow at around
2.1% due to strong semicondutor exports, but that domestic demand, including
private consumption and construction investment, is weak. The member noted
that consumer price inflation, which had rebounded to 3.4% in the fourth quarter
of 2023, fell back to 2.8% in January this year driven by a weakening in
demand pressures and a decline in oil prices. The member projected, however,

5

that it would take considerable time before inflation returns to the target level of
2%, given that a narrowly defined cost-of-living index(made of 140 items),
closely related to people’s livelihood, remained at 3.4%.

The member assessed that prolonged high interest rates had accumulated
the pressure on vulnerable sectors of the economy. The member believed that
although high interest rates weighed on household consumption, the first priority
was to stabilize inflation. The member noted that households’ real purchase
power did not improve last year, as the rate of increase in total wage bill was
offset by consumer price inflation, which apparently weighed on consumption.
The member believed, therefore, that stabilizing prices would help to improve
households’ real purchasing power.

Concerning financial markets, the member saw that the market unrest
caused by Taeyoung E&C’s application for a debt workout plan had eased to
some degree. The member observed, however, that delinquency rates among real
estate-related SMEs were rising, with corporate borrowing in the real estate
sector increasing significantly. The member went on to state that the slump in
construction investment would continue for a considerable time, with the impact
of the drop in new construction being now in full swing, and that the risk
associated with real estate project financing was unlikely to be resolved in a
short period of time. The member added that this could potentially increase
market strains at any time.

The member offered the view that the Base Rate should be kept
unchanged at the current rate of 3.50%, and that any negative side effects from
high interest rates should be responded to appropriately with micro-measures. The
member added that a close monitoring of financial and economic developments
is needed to manage the real estate project financing risk and its consequent
strains at non-bank financial institutions so that problems in small and
medium-sized savings banks do not develope into a systemic risk.

Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep
the Base Rate at its current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.

The member forecast that, due to the growing likelihood of an overall

easing of monetary tightening in-line with the slowdown in inflation, the global
economy would move away from high interest rates and high inflation and show

6


-----

a gradual improvement. The member projected that global trade had been
recovering slowly and that it would expand gradually, depending on

improvements in the global economy. By country, the member mentioned that, in
the U.S., labor market-related indicators had been stronger than expected and
inflation had been decelerating at a slower-than-expected pace, with consumer
price inflation rebounding slightly and core inflation remaining unchanged. The
member, however, stated that since economic indicators were exhibiting mixed
signals, such as the more sluggish-than-expected consumption-related indicators in
January, future developments of related indicators should be continuously
monitored. The member predicted that China had been experiencing sustained
deflation caused by sluggish demand and that the growth rate there would be
slightly below 5% this year. The member, meanwhile, forecast that as global
financial market conditions were expected to remain accommodative with a
diminishing likelihood of the U.S. Federal Reserve further tightening, countries
would likely show increasingly diverging policy stances from now on depending
on their own economic conditions. The member added that some emerging
market countries had already started lowering rates in consideration of their
domestic economic conditions, such as the pace of inflation slowdown.

Regarding the domestic economy, the member noted that private

consumption and construction investment had been more lackluster than expected,
while exports had been stronger than initially projected. The member added that
this resulted in an economic growth trend consistent with the original forecast,
but that each sector of the economy exhibited differing trends. The member
commented that the labor market had been sustaining a gradual deceleration in
its underlying trend, if the unemployment rate, which had risen due to temporary
factors, is counted out. The member projected that the growth rate would
continue to improve, driven by exports, while private consumption would
continue to exhibit a slower recovery than initially forecast.

Concerning inflation, the member assessed that inflation continued to

slow as originally projected and that demand-side pressures on inflation had
weakened somewhat due to slower-than-expected private consumption. The
member argued that, in this regard, the core inflation forecast path, which
heavily relies on private consumption, could be adjusted slightly downward. The
member however pointed out that upside risks to inflation still remained,
including the pace at which the accumulated supply shocks affect inflation, as
well as geopolitical risks.

Meanwhile, the member mentioned that, since the January MPB meeting,

global market expectations regarding the timing of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s
rate cut had been adjusted following the release of U.S. employment and
inflation indicators, which had surpassed market forecasts, and added that, as a
result, long-term interest rates in major countries had risen and the U.S. dollar
had strengthened. The member went on to state that domestic long-term
government bond yields have risen as well, affected by the rise in U.S.
long-term interest rates, and financial conditions have tightened somewhat.
However, the member argued that, as overall liquidity conditions in financial
markets were favorable, with short-term interest rates remaining stable, concerns
about any spread of real estate project financing defaults have eased somewhat,
but that related risks still remained, and that delinquency rates at banks and
non-bank financial institutions have continued to rise, leading to a steady
increase in the risk of sustained monetary tightening. The member expressed the
opinion that it would be necessary to prepare against the possibility of problems
in vulnerable sectors leading to instability across the entire financial market. The
member noted that domestic FX markets remained stable thanks to favorable
global financial conditions. The member mentioned that, as major currencies
depreciated due to the global strength of the dollar, the won-dollar exchange rate
had risen accordingly, but that the extent of increase was limited relative to
other currencies. The member also assessed that the domestic FX swap market
had remained stable, with incentives for arbitrage trading decreasing and CDS
premiums remaining low.

Taking the domestic and international economic and financial

environment into overall consideration, the member judged that it would be
appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% at this
meeting. The member assessed that the risk from the easing of tightening had
been reduced somewhat as inflationary pressures had weakened slightly due
mainly to sluggish domestic demand. The member thus found it desirable to
determine the appropriate timing of any easing after monitoring future

developments in inflation and economic conditions, as well as domestic and
international financial market conditions.

Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to
leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% for the intermeeting period.

The member forecast that the global economy would continue to slow

8


-----

for the time being due to global monetary tightening, but that it would start to
improve gradually in the second half of the year, achieving more favorable
growth than originally expected. The member stated that inflation continued to
moderate in its underlying trend in the U.S. and other major advanced countries,
but that the pace of the slowdown had been more modest than initially forecast.

The member projected that the domestic economy would likely continue

to show gradual improvement, led by exports. The member expected that,
although private consumption had been recovering slowly, it would likely
maintain a modest upward trajectory going forward, depending on future
improvements in real household incomes. The member also anticipated that
export growth would accelerate, boosted by a sustained recovery in the global IT
industry and by persistent strong demand for imports in the U.S. The member
forecast that facilities investment would emerge from its sluggishness and exhibit
favorable growth led by investment related to semiconductors and related to new
industries that are engines of economic growth, but that construction investment
would likely remain more sluggish than previously expected. The member saw
that employment was favorable overall, driven by persistent solid growth in the
number of persons employed. As for domestic inflation, the member noted that
the consumer price inflation rate had declined due mainly to slower growth in
personal services and processed food prices, and that core inflation had also
continued to decelerate. Going forward, the member expected domestic inflation
to continue experiencing an underlying slowdown, but at a moderate pace due to
the effects of rises in global oil and agricultural product prices.

The member pointed out that financial and foreign exchange markets had

been generally accommodative and operating smoothly, although major price
variables had fluctuated substantially due mainly to changes in expectations of
the U.S. Federal Reserve’s early rate cut. The member stated that government
bond yields had recently risen sharply, influenced by weakening expectations of
the U.S. Federal Reserve’s early rate cut, while short-term market rates fell and
stock prices rebounded significantly. The member commented that delinquency
rates on corporate loans had continued to rise led by loans to SMEs, while
corporate financing had been proceeding smoothly overall. They went on to state
that risks related to real estate project financing persisted, but that they were not
significant enough to threaten financial system stability. The member presented
the opinion that household loans exhibited slower growth owing to a decline in
other loans, while housing-related loans sustained strong growth.

The member expressed the view that, in consideration of the

above-mentioned conditions, it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate
unchanged at 3.5% at this meeting. The member stated that while inflation was
expected to continue its underlying slowdown, it remained above the target level
and that there was substantial uncertainty surrounding the future inflation path.
The member went on to argue that, on the other hand, the economy
demonstrated a modest recovery and forecasts indicated continued growth for this
year and the next, potentially reaching or even surpassing its potential level,
which suggested that there was no significant pressure to implement an early
rate cut given the current situation. The member pointed to the need to keep the
Base Rate unchanged from the current level for some time and monitor the
inflation path and movements of many related indicators until the Board was
confident that inflation would stabilize at the target level.

The member took the view that, going forward, it would be necesesary

to make monetary policy decisions with a top priority placed on achieving price
stability, while taking into account domestic and international economic

conditions, changes in monetary policies in major countries, movements of the
exchange rate, and risks to financial stability.

Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to keep
the Base Rate unchanged and maintain it at 3.50% at this meeting.

The member saw that the global economy showed growth exceeding
initial expectations, led by the U.S., and that it was expected to exhibit growth
more favorable than initially expected, although growth would slow due mainly
to ongoing monetary tightening in major economies.

The member presented the opinion that inflation in the major advanced
economies would continue its slowing trend, but that it may still take some time
before the Board would be confident of its downward stabilization. The member
saw that, since more-favorable-than-expected economic conditions were leading
the inflation rate to decline at a slower pace, particularly in the services sector,
any convergence on the target could be slower than expected.

The member noted that, in international financial markets, price variables
had fluctuated in-line with adjustments in expectations for monetary policies in
major advanced economies. The member stated that, with central banks in major

10


-----

advanced economies having indicated that they would maintain their current high
policy rate levels for some time, expectations for early rate cuts had weakened
as subsequently released economic and inflation-related indicators had exceeded
market expectations. The member added that, as a result, policy rate forecasts, as
reflected in market price variables, had been revised upward and the U.S. dollar
had strengthened.

The member stated that the domestic economy has continued its modest
recovery, with exports improving, led by IT, although domestic demand,
including consumption and construction investment, remained sluggish. The
member noted that growth this year would be broadly in-line with the November
forecast, but the divergence in growth between exports and private consumption
would likely expand compared with initial expectations.

The member projected that domestic inflation would continue its gradual
deceleration. However, the member still saw the possibility of the deceleration
slowing due to the great uncertainty surrounding oil prices stemming from
ongoing geopolitical risks of late, as well as sustained high agricultural product
prices.

The member commented that, in financial markets, long-term interest
rates rose due to changes in expectations of the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary
policy and in geopolitical risks, and the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange
rate fluctuated within a limited range. The member stated that stock prices rose
on expectations of an improvement in the semiconductor industry despite
weakening expectations of an early Fed rate cut.

The member saw that household lending in the financial sector continued
to grow at a slower pace overall, but that housing-related lending at banks has
maintained a relatively high growth trend.

The member pointed out that, in the credit and securities markets, credit
spreads had narrowed considerably, and anxiety in the PF-ABCP market had
eased somewhat. However, the member saw that difficulties in the rollover of
some non-investment grade CPs persisted.

The member projected that, overall, the economy has continued to
recover modestly and that inflation is expected to continue to slow, albeit with
uncertainty around oil prices. The member stated that household lending has

11


-----

been growing at a slower pace, but it will be necessary to monitor the still
ongoing increase in home mortgage lending.

The member presented the opinion that, in light of these considerations,
it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current level of
3.50% at this meeting. The member argued that, for now, it would be necessary
to maintain a sufficient tightening stance so as to ensure that disinflation and
deleveraging would be sustained. The member added that, as part of this
process, it would be necessary to comprehensively examine domestic and external
conditions, including future inflation developments, financial stability conditions,
and the impact of monetary policies in major economies.
