#     MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2019
 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75%

1. The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy

interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors:

i. In March, the YoY inflation rate and trend inflation indicators showed levels within the

inflation target range;

ii. The expected YoY rate of inflation decreased to 2.33 percent in March;

iii. Indicators of non-primary economic activity continue showing signs of dynamism, even

though production remains below its potential, and

iv. There are still risks in terms of global economic activity, although lower volatility has been

observed in international financial markets.

2. The YoY inflation rate is projected to remain within the target range and around 2.0 percent

in the forecast horizon. The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an
expansionary policy stance while inflation expectations remain anchored, in a context in
which the level of economic activity is below its potential level.

3. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following:

i. Inflation in March showed a rate of 0.73 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation

rate registered 2.25 percent in March 2019. Moreover, the monthly rate of inflation
excluding food and energy prices was 1.02 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate
was 2.6 percent in March due to specific factors, such as the increase in tuition and
education fees.

ii. Indicators of business expectations remain on the optimistic side. Furthermore, indicators

of non-primary economic activity continue pointing to a gradual closure of the output gap.

4. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending

and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and
the financial system, as specified below:

i. Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent.

ii. Direct security and currency repos and rediscount operations: i) 3.30 percent for the
first 10 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and ii)
the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations
for additional operations to the 10 first operations carried out in the last 12 months.

iii. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent.

5. The Monetary Program for the month of May will be approved on the Board meeting to be

held on May 9, 2019.
