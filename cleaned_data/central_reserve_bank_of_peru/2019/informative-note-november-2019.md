# PRESS RELEASE

 MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT NOVEMBER 2019
 BCRP LOWERED REFERENCE RATE TO 2.25%

1. The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to cut the reference

rate from 2.50 to 2.25 percent, in light of the following developments:

# i. Year-on-year inflation is expected to remain within the target range close to 2.0 percent over

the forecast horizon, with a downside bias due to the possibility of a lower-than expected
increase in domestic demand.

# ii. Monthly inflation was 0.11 percent in October, bringing up year-on-year inflation to 1.88
percent, from 1.85 percent in September. With monthly inflation excluding food and energy at
0.23 percent in October, the year-on-year figure increased to 2.34 percent, from 2.16 percent
in September due to a transitory increase in water, electricity, and transportation rates.
Monthly inflation would have been negative without these items.

# iii. One-year ahead expected inflation as of October remains at 2.2 percent.
 iv. Primary industries’ weak performance in January-September was partially offset by a

recovery in non-primary industries. The slowdown in public investment over the same period
is expected to revert in the remainder of the year. Business conditions expectations improved
slightly in October. Economic activity indicators point to a more gradual closure of the output
gap.

# v. Global growth risks decreased as trade tensions moderated.

2. This decision does not necessarily imply additional reductions in the policy rate. The BCRP

Board pays close attention to new information on inflation and its determinants in assessing
future changes in the monetary policy stance.

3. The Board also decided to reduce the interest rates on BCRP off-auction credit and deposit

operations in domestic currency with financial entities.

# i. Overnight deposits: 1.00 percent per year.
 ii. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: i) 2.80 percent per year for financial

entities’ first 10 operations over the last 12 months; and ii) the rate fixed by the BCRP
Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations Committee for operations other than financial
entities’ first 10 operations over the last 12 months.

# iii. Dollar swaps: a fee equal to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.80 percent.

4. The BCRP Board’s next monetary policy session will take place on December 12, 2019.
