 MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT OCTOBER 2021
 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 1.50%

1. The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference
interest rate by 50 bps to 1.50 percent. Monetary policy is still expansionary, with a historically low
reference interest rate. The current decision does not necessarily imply a cycle of successive
increases in the reference rate. This decision takes into account the following developments:

# i. Year-on-year inflation increased from 4.95 percent in August to 5.23 percent in September,

temporarily above the target range due mainly to a surge in international food and fuel prices,
as well as exchange rate depreciation. Year-on- year core inflation was 2.57 percent in
September.

# ii. Inflation is expected to return to the target range over the next twelve months and remain

within target for the rest of next year, as transitory pressures (exchange rate and
international fuel and grain prices) will likely revert, with economic activity below potential.

# iii. One-year-ahead expected inflation increased from 3.1 percent in August to 3.6 in September;

and is forecasted at 3.25 percent for 2022, slightly above the upper limit of the inflation
target range.

# iv. Most indicators of expectations for economic activity improved slightly in September, but

remain in pessimistic territory.

# v. The current improvement in global economic activity is expected to continue into the next

quarters, as the vaccination rollout continues around the world and significant stimulus
packages are implemented in developed countries.

2. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation expectations and economic
activity, with an aim to consider, if necessary, changes in the monetary stance. Based on the
available information, the Board sees the convenience of maintaining an expansionary stance for
an extended period through a gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus. The BCRP will continue to
take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows. In a context of
uncertainty, financial markets showed high volatility, with BCRP policies aiming at mitigating it.

3. The Board also decided to raise the following interest rates on its window facility operations in
domestic currency with financial entities:

# i. Overnight deposits: 1.35 percent per year.
 ii. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 2.0 percent per year.

4. The BCRP Boardâ€™s next monetary policy session will take place on November 11, 2021.
