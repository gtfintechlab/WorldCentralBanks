# PRESS RELEASE

 MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT JULY 2021
 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25%

1. The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its
expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing
liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments:

# i. Year-on-year inflation increased from 2.45 percent in May to 3.25 percent in June being

temporarily above the target range due to supply-side pressures. Trend inflation remains
around the center of the target range. Year-on- year core inflation was 1.9 percent in June.

# ii. Inflation is expected to return to the target range in the next twelve months and remain within

that range in 2022, due to the reversal of the effects of transitory factors on the inflation rate
(exchange rate, fuel and grain prices in international markets) and that economic activity will
remain below its potential level.

# iii. One-year-ahead expected inflation increased from 2.43 percent in May to 2.60 in June and

hence the real reference rate kept doing down.

# iv. Most leading indicators and expectations about the economy deteriorated in June. v. Global economic recovery is expected to be more pronounced in the next quarters, as the

vaccination process continues around the world, and significant stimulus packages are
implemented in developed countries.

2. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain an expansionary stance as long as the negative
effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist and is especially attentive to new
information referring to inflation expectations and the evolution of economic activity. The BCRP will
continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows. Financial
markets were highly volatile in a context of electoral uncertainty and the BCRP’s actions were
intended to mitigate this volatility. As of July 7, BCRP injection operations totaled S/ 62,758 million,
of which S/ 47,654 million were associated with government-backed repos.

3. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in
domestic currency with financial entities:

# i. Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year.
 ii. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year.

4. The BCRP Board’s next monetary policy session will take place on August 12, 2021.
