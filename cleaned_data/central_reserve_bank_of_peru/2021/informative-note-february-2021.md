 MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT FEBRUARY 2021 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25%

1. The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its
expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing
further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments:

# i. Year-on-year inflation increased from 2.0 percent in December to 2.7 percent in January due

to specific supply factors that led to higher prices of some goods and energy. Trend inflation
remains in the lower part of the target range. Thus, year-on- year core inflation was 1.7 percent
in January at the center of the target.

# ii. Inflation is expected to remain within the target range throughout 2021 and 2022; and to lie at

the lower part of the range by the end of the year, as economic activity will remain below its
potential level over the forecast horizon (2021-2022).

# iii. One-year ahead expected inflation was 2.0 percent in January.
 iv. The recovery of leading indicators moderated in January. Firms’ growth expectations deteriorated

in January, considering the intensified impact of the pandemic on the economy due to the beginning
of a second wave of contagions and the new restriction measures.

# v. Global economic activity has been improving, but at a more moderate pace due to social

confinement measures in the face of the new pandemic outbreak.

2. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance for as long
as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The BCRP will
continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows, and stands
ready to expand monetary stimulus using a range of instruments. As of February 10, BCRP injection
operations totaled S/ 64,566 million, of which S/ 50,364 million were associated with governmentbacked repos, S/ 1,097 million with repos conditioned to credits rescheduling, and S/ 245 million
with repos conditioned to the expansion of long-term credit.

3. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in
domestic currency with financial entities:

# i. Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year.
 ii. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year.

4. The BCRP Board’s next monetary policy session will take place on March 11, 2021.
