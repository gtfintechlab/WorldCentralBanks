# PRESS RELEASE

 MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT JUNE 2021
 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25%

1. The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its
expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing
liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments:

# i. Year-on-year inflation increased from 2.38 percent in April to 2.45 percent in May due to supply
side pressures. Trend inflation remains at the lower part of the target range. Year-on- year core
inflation was 1.8 percent in May.

# ii. Inflation is expected to remain within the target range throughout 2021 and 2022; and to lie at

the lower part of the range during 2022, as economic activity will remain below its potential
level.

# iii. One-year-ahead expected inflation was 2.4 percent in May. iv. Most leading indicators improved in May. v. Global economic recovery is expected to be more pronounced in the next quarters, as the

vaccination process continues around the world, and significant stimulus packages are
implemented in developed countries.

2. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance as long as
the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The BCRP will
continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows, and stands
ready to expand monetary stimulus using a range of instruments. Financial markets were highly
volatile in a context of electoral uncertainty and the BCRP’s actions were intended to mitigate this
volatility. As of June 9, BCRP injection operations totaled S/ 56,670 million, of which S/ 48,870
million were associated with government-backed repos.

3. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in
domestic currency with financial entities:

# i. Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year.
 ii. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year.

4. The BCRP Board’s next monetary policy session will take place on July 8, 2021.
