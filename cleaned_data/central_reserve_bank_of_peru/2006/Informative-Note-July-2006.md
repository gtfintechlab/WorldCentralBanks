# Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JULY 2006
 CENTRAL BANK MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 4.50%

1. The Board of the BCRP acknowledge the following information:

a. The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) decreased 0.1
percent in June, as a result of which the CPI inflation rate over the last
twelve months was 1.8 percent, within the target range (1.5 percent â€“
3.5 percent). On the other hand, core inflation over the last 12 months
was 1.3 percent.

b. In the January-May period, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew 6
percent with respect to the same period last year. This evolution reflects
the continuous dynamic performance of economic activity, with domestic
demand growing at a rate of nearly 8 percent.

c. The average exchange rate decreased 0.5 percent to S/. 3.26 per dollar
in June. The real exchange rate fell 1.3 percent (2.9 percent of real
depreciation in the last twelve months), an evolution that was associated
with the appreciation of other currencies against the US dollar. On June
5, the Central Bank intervened in the exchange market purchasing US$
2.5 million.

d. The interbank interest rate was 4.53 percent in June, close to the
reference level (4.5 percent), while the 90-day corporate prime rate for
loans in soles fell from 6.0 percent to 5.8 percent between May and
June.

e. The country risk indicator by the end of June was 169 bps, a level
similar to that recorded by the close of May (168 bps). On the other
hand, the 15-year maturity sovereign bond yield decreased from 8.26 to
8.14 percent. A greater volatility was recorded in the international
markets of capitals and commodities during this month, although it was
offset following a statement issued by the United States Federal
Reserve.

2. The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the interbank reference
interest rate at 4.50 percent. This decision has been taken taking into
account that:

a. Between December 2005 and May 2006, as a result of a partial
withdrawal of monetary stimulation, the reference interest rate rose by


-----

150 basis points. The Central Bank will continue to assess all relevant
macroeconomic information to guarantee that the necessary measures
are in place to maintain inflation within the target range.

b. Forecasts on the dynamism of economic activity in the period 20062007 (around 5.5 percent) are consistent with the inflation target (from
1.5 to 3.5 percent).

3. The Board approved the following interest rates for the BCRP operations:

a. For direct repo and rediscount operations, the rate continues to be 5.25
percent.

b. For overnight deposits, the rate continues to be 4.00 percent.

4. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central
Bank and the Financial system are established as follows:

a. Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percent.

b. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point.

c. Swap: the commission continues to be at a level that implies a minimum
annual effective cost of 5.25 percent.

d. Reserve requirements in foreign deposits subject to payment: the rate is
increased to 2.5 percent.

5. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (for the month of
August 2006) on the session to be held on August 3, 2006.
