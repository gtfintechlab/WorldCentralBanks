# Press Release N° 012-2006-BCRP
 MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2006
 CENTRAL BANK RAISES REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 3.75% TO 4.00%

1. The Board of the Central Bank acknowledge the following information:

a. The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) rose 0.55 percent
in February, explained by temporary price rises of poultry, potato and
eggs (0.51 percentage points). Thus, CPI inflation rate over the last 12
months was 2.7 percent, within the target range (1.5 – 3.5 percent).
Core inflation over the last 12 months was 0.9 percent.

It is expected that the inflation rate over last 12 months be maintained
around the target level (2.5 percent) through 2006.

b. Economic activity grew 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005, thus
GDP increased 6.7 percent in 2005, the highest growth rate since 1997.
The indicators of consumer confidence are also located in their higher
levels ever registered.

c. The growing trend of the trade balance surplus is maintained, reaching
a record of US$ 1 676 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, and an
annual surplus of US$ 5 163 million or 6.6 percent of GDP. The terms of
trade increased 7.0 percent that year due to the 18.4 percent increase
of export prices.

d. The average exchange rate decreased 3.1 percent in February to
S/. 3.29 per dollar from S/. 3.39 per dollar in January. Thus, in February,
the real exchange rate diminished 3.5 percent (0.5 percent of real
appreciation in the last 12 months). During most of the month downward
pressures on the nominal exchange rate were observed; however,
during the last 2 days, upward pressures were registered, so the
exchange rate closed February in S/. 3.30 per dollar. Thus, it is
maintained the high volatility of the exchange rate observed in the last
months.

e. In February, the Central Bank intervened purchasing US$ 59 million in
the exchange market to avoid an excessive exchange rate volatility. It is
worth to mention that no purchases were carried out since September of

the previous year. During February, the bank’s balance of net forward
sales of foreign currency was reduced in US$ 120 million, the public
sales of dollars to banks in the spot market were of US$ 262 million and
the bank’s exchange position increased in US$ 74 million.

f. The average interest rate of the interbank market was 3.82 percent in
February, higher than in the previous month (3.58 percent), while the
corporate prime rate for loans in soles increased from 5.1 percent to 5.4
percent in the same period. In February, the BCRP continued carrying
out repo auctions in order to stabilize the interbank interest rate around
the reference interest rate (3.75 percent in February).

g. The country risk indicator dropped from 160 bps at the end of January to
143 bps at the end of February. This indicator reached a lowest level of
128 bps on February 27. The 15-year maturity sovereign bond yield in
soles decreased from 8.0 to 7.5 percent.

2. The Board of the Central Bank approved to raise the reference interest rate
for the interbank market from 3.75 percent to 4.00 percent. This decision was
taken considering that:

a. The expected dynamism of the economic activity for 2006 (5.0
percent) is consistent with the continuous accomplishment of inflation
target (from 1.5 to 3.5 percent).

b. The raise of the reference interest rate will contribute to prevent
situations of upward volatility in the exchange market. The Bank will
continue, if necessary, with their interventions to reduce the exchange rate
volatility, selling foreign currency at the spot market and auctioning
Adjustable Certificate Deposits (CDRBCRP) to avoid undesirable effects on
inflation and economic activity in general.

3. This decision does not imply a sequence of interest rates rises.

4. It was approved to raise the lending and deposits interest rates for the
Central Bank operations:

a. For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate raises to 4.75
percent.
b. For overnight deposits, the rate raises to 3.25 percent.

5. In the case that the interbank interest rate be higher than 4.75 percent,
monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market
interbank interest rate.

6. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central
Bank and the Financial System are:

2


-----

a. Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point.
b. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point.
c. Swap: the commission raises to a level that implies a minimum annual
effective cost of 4.75 percent.
d. Reserve requirement deposits in foreign currency subject to payment:
2.25 percent.

7. The session in which the Board will approve the following Monetary Program
(April) will be held on April 6th, 2006.
