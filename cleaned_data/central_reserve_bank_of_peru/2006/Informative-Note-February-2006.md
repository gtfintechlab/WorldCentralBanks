in January, explained by temporary price rises of poultry (8.6 percent)

expected the convergence of inflation toward its target level (2.5
percent) in 2006.

The terms of trade increased 7.0 percent that year due to the 18.4
percent increase of export prices.

from S/. 3.43 per dollar in December to S/. 3.39 per dollar. Thus, in

real depreciation in the last twelve months). The pressures for the
nominal exchange rate increase at the beginning of month were
dissipated completely in the second two-week period, so the exchange
rate closed January at S/. 3.31 per dollar.

US$ 364 million in the exchange market (sales of US$ 355 million and
placements of Adjustable Certificates of Deposit (CDRBCRP) by US$ 9
million) to avoid an excessive exchange rate volatility. During last
