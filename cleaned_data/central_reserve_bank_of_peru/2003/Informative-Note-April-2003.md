1. In March, the rate of inflation was 1,1 percent (3,4 percent in annual terms), mainly due
to specific factors such as the increase in fuels and transportation fares. However, the
underlying inflation, which exclude high volatility items from the CPI basket, increased
0,1 percent in March and 1,7 percent through last 12 months.

Unless the price increases in fuel and transportation fares migrate to other prices or
inflation expectations deviate from the BCR’s target, the Central Bank will not take any
specific action. Monetary policy decisions are oriented to attain a 2,5 percent rate
**of inflation with a 1 percent point margin.**
