 MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2005

 CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.00%

1. As of December 2004, the cumulative year inflation was 3.48 percent, thus
achieving the annual inflation target for the third consecutive year, as the
inflation was located inside the target range (2.5 percent with a rank of
tolerance of a percentage point up or downward). In turn, the Core inflation
was 2.63 percent in the 2004.

In December, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) diminished
0.01 percent due mainly to the reduction in the price of the food (-0.2
percentage points), fuels (-0.3 percentage points) and telephone rates (-1.9
percentage points).

Transitorily between June and November 2004, 12-month inflation was above
the upper limit of the target range (3.5 percent) mainly due to supply shocks in
food and fuels. In this period, the Central Bank increased in two opportunities
the reference interest rate (August and October), passing from 2.5 to 3.0
percent in a preventive way to guarantee the convergence of the inflation
toward the goal. The partial reversion of these shocks and the appreciation of
the Nuevo Sol have influenced in the convergence of the inflation toward the
upper limit of the goal in the 2004, according to the Inflation Report of August.
Likewise, the projections of the last report of August with respect to the
evolution of the inflation in the 2005, are maintained. That is, it is expected the
continuity of the shocks reversion in the 2005, so the inflation will converge
toward the target level (2.5 percent).
