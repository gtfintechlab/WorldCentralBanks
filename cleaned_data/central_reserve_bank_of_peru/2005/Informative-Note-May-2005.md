percent). Core inflation, indicator of the inflationary trend, was 1.3 percent over

For the remainder of the year 2005 the forecasts of the Inflation Report of
January 2005 are maintained (2.3 percent). In the first months of 2005, there is

inputs) volumes are above the forecast from January Inflation Report. Also, the
