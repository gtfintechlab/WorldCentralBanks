 MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JUNE 2005

 CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.00%

**1.** **The Board of the Central Bank approved to keep the reference interest**
**rates for the interbank market at 3,00 percent. Thus:**

**a.** **The monetary operations of injection and withdrawal of liquidity**
**by means of auctions will be oriented to place the interbank**
**interest rate around 3.00 percent.**

**b.** **For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate is kept**
**at 3.75 percent.**

**c.** **For overnight deposits, the rate is maintained at 2.25 percent.**

2. In this decision it has been considered:

a. The Metropolitan Lima Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0,1
percent in May. Thus, the CPI inflation over last twelve months
diminished from 2,0 percent in April to 1,8 percent in May, being located
in the lower section of the inflation target range (between 1,5 percent
and 2,5 percent). In turn, the 12-month core inflation decreased from
1,3 to 1,2 percent.

b. The 2005 inflation forecast is maintained at a similar level of the one in
the January Inflation Report (2,3 percent). The inflation forecast for the
following months shows a transitory fall to a level around the lower limit
of the target range (1,5 percent). For 2006 it is projected that the
inflation converge to a nearby level of the target range center (2,5
percent).

c. In the first months of the year itâ€™s being observed a higher dynamism of
the economic activity, explained by the investment, private consumption
and exports expansion. The export and import volumes (capital goods
and industrial supplies) are above of what was forecasted in the
January Inflation Report. Likewise, the terms of trade are above the
expectations due to the higher export prices, in spite of the higher oil
international prices.

If the tendency observed in the economic activity is maintained, it would
be expected that the GDP growth rates in 2005 and 2006 be around 5
percent.
