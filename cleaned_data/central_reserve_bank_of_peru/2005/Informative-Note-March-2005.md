 MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2005

 CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.00%

1. In February, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) diminished
0.23 percent. Thus, the 12-month inflation reached 1.7 percent; lower than in
January (3.0 percent). This evolution continues reflecting the reversion of the
inflationary effect of the supply shocks that affected the economy in 2004.
Core inflation, indicator of the inflationary trend, was 1.4 percent over last 12
months.

For the remainder of the year 2005 the forecasts of the Inflation Report of
January 2005 are maintained. Thus, it would continue the partial reversion of
the inflationary supply shocks that affected the economy last year. The
12-month inflation would converge toward the lower section of the target range
(1.5 to 2.5 percent) in most of months of this year.

With respect to the determinants of the 2005 inflation, it remains the inflation
expectations of the agents around 2.5 percent, moderate import goods inflation
and an expected economic growth of 4.5 percent.

4. For March, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks’
deposits held at BCRP is S/. 220 - S/. 240 million. This average balance is
neither a target nor a monetary policy stance indicator, since it also reflects,
among others, seasonal factors as well as liquidity demand changes.

a. Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point.
b. Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRP’s
deposits held abroad.
c. Swaps: the commission is maintained to a level that implies a minimum
annual effective cost of 3.75 percent.

6. The session in which the Board will approve the following Monthly Monetary
Program (April 2005) will be held on April 7th, 2005.
