**MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT OCTOBER 2022**

**BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 7.00%**

1. The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the

reference interest rate by 25 bps to 7.00 percent, thus continuing to adjust its monetary policy
stance. This decision takes into account the following developments:

i. Year-on-year inflation increased from 8.40 percent in August to 8.53 percent in

September, above the target range, due to significant increases in international food and
fuel prices. Core inflation increased from 5,39 percent in August to 5.51 percent in
September, above the upper limit of the inflation target range.

ii. The significant increase in international food and fuel prices since the second half of

last year, accentuated by international conflicts, has led to a sharp increase in global
inflation in magnitudes not seen in many years and towards levels significantly higher
than the inflation targets of central banks, both in advanced and other economies in the
region.

iii. A downward trend in year-on-year inflation is forecast with a return to the target range

in the second half of next year, due to a moderation of the impact of international food
and fuel prices, and to a reduction in inflation expectations.

iv. One-year-ahead expected inflation decreased from 5.10 to 4.89 percent between August

and September, above the upper limit of the inflation target range.

v. Several leading indicators and expectations for economic activity recovered in

September, but most remain pessimistic.

vi. The outlook for global economic activity this year and the next has deteriorated due to

expected policy interest rate hikes in advanced economies, lower growth in China, and
international conflicts.

2. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants,

including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, to consider changes in
the monetary stance. The Board reaffirms its commitment to adopt necessary actions to ensure
the return of inflation to the target range over the forecast horizon.

3. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic

currency with financial entities:

i. Overnight deposits: 5.00 percent per year.
ii. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: i) 7.50 percent per year for the first

10 operations in the last 3 months and ii) the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange
Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months.
In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates
based on the amount of the operations.

4. The BCRP Boardâ€™s next monetary policy session will take place on November 10, 2022.
