**MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT AUGUST 2022**

**BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 6.50%**

1. The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the

reference interest rate by 50 bps to 6.50 percent, thus continuing to normalize its monetary
policy stance. This decision takes into account the following developments:

i. Year-on-year inflation decreased from 8.81 percent in June to 8.74 percent in July,

above the target range, due to significant increases in international food and fuel prices.
Core inflation rose from 4.95 percent in June to 5.44 percent in July, above the upper
limit of the inflation target range.

ii. The significant increase in international food and fuel prices since the second half of

last year, accentuated by international conflicts, has led to a sharp increase in global
inflation in magnitudes not seen in many years and towards levels significantly higher
than the inflation targets of central banks, both in advanced and other economies in the
region. Thus, inflation is expected to return to the target range in the second half of next
year.

iii. A downward trend in year-on-year inflation is forecast due to a moderation of the impact

of international food and fuel prices, and to a reduction in inflation expectations.

iv. One-year-ahead expected inflation decreased from 5.35 to 5.16 percent between June and

July, above the upper limit of the inflation target range.

v. Most leading indicators and expectations for economic activity deteriorated in July and

remain pessimistic.

vi. The outlook for global economic activity this year and the next has deteriorated due to

the expected unwinding of stimulus in advanced economies, international conflicts, and
persistent global supply bottlenecks, despite some improvement in recent months.

2. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants,

including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, with an aim to consider
changes in the monetary stance so that inflation returns to the target range over the forecast
horizon.

3. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic

currency with financial entities:

i. Overnight deposits: 4.50 percent per year.
ii. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: i) 7.00 percent per year for the first

10 operations in the last 3 months and ii) the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange
Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months.
In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates
based on the amount of the operations.

4. The BCRP Boardâ€™s next monetary policy session will take place on September 8, 2022.
