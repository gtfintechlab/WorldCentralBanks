**MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT JUNE 2022**

**BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 5.50%**

1. The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the

reference interest rate by 50 bps to 5.50 percent, thus continuing to normalize its monetary
policy stance. This decision takes into account the following developments:

i. Year-on-year inflation increased from 7.96 percent in April to 8.09 percent in May, above

the target range, due to the upsurge of significant increases in international food and
fuel prices. Year-on-year core inflation also rose from 3.81 percent in April to 4.26
percent in May, above the upper limit of the inflation target range.

ii. The significant and continuous increase in international energy and food prices since

the second half of last year, accentuated by international conflicts, has led to a sharp
increase in global inflation in magnitudes not seen in many years both in advanced and
other economies in the region. Thus, inflation is expected to return to the target range
between the second and the third quarter of next year.

iii. The downward path of year-on-year inflation is expected to begin in July, as transitory

pressures (exchange rate and international fuel and grain prices) begin to recede, with
economic activity still below potential.

iv. One-year-ahead expected inflation increased from 4.62 to 4.89 percent between April and

May, above the upper limit of the inflation target range.

v. Most leading indicators and expectations for economic activity remain pessimistic but

recovered in May.

vi. Global economic activity is improving at a slower pace due to the persistent bottlenecks

in the global supply of goods and services, the reversal of monetary stimulus in
advanced economies, the confinement measures in China, and international conflicts.

2. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants,

including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, with an aim to consider
changes in the monetary stance so that inflation returns to the target range over the forecast
horizon.

3. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic

currency with financial entities:

i. Overnight deposits: 3.50 percent per year.
ii. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: i) 6.0 percent per year for the first

10 operations in the last 3 months and ii) the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange
Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months.
In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates
based on the amount of the operations.

4. The BCRP Boardâ€™s next monetary policy session will take place on July 7, 2022.
