 MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT DECEMBER 2020
 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25%

1. The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its

expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing
further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments:

# i. Inflation in 2020 will lie at the center of the target range due to transitory factors; and inflation

in 2021 is expected to be around the lower limit of the target range, as domestic demand,
although in recovery, will remain low.

# ii. One-year ahead expected inflation was 1.7 percent in November.
 iii. Year-on-year inflation increased from 1.7 percent in October to 2.1 percent in November due

to higher food and energy prices associated with transitory supply-side factors. Trend inflation
remains in the lower part of the target range. Year-on-year core inflation was 1.75 percent in
November.

# iv. Leading indicators continued to improve at a higher than expected rate, although they remain

below last year’s levels, while firms’ growth expectations continued to recover in November.

# v. Global economic activity has been improving, but remains below last year’s levels.

2. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit

flows. As of December 9, the BCRP’s liquidity injection operations totaled S/ 61.5 billion, of which
S/ 50.2 billion were associated with government-backed repos. In this context, credit to the private
sector grew 13.1 percent year-on-year in October, with interest rates declining steadily since April.

3. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance for as long

as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The BCRP stands
ready to expand monetary stimulus using a range of instruments.

4. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in

domestic currency with financial entities:

# i. Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year.
 ii. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year.

5. The schedule of monetary policy meetings for the next twelve months is the following

# January 14     February 11      March 11 April 8         May 13         June 10 July 8          August 12       September 9 October 7       November 11    December 9
