1. The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue with

an expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and
implementing further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments:

i. Inflation this year would be below the target range due to the significant weakening of

domestic demand.

ii. One-year-ahead expected inflation fell from 2.2 percent at the end of December 2019 to

1.5 percent in May.

iii. Year-on-year inflation rose from 1.72 percent in April to 1.78 percent in May, while

inflation excluding food and energy prices fell from 1.87 percent to 1.85 percent.

iv. Economic activity continues to be severely affected by the effects of social isolation

measures. Business expectations indicators on GDP growth have recovered slightly in
May, in line with the gradual resumption of economic activities.

BCRP amount to S/ 44.3 billion, of which S/ 20.6 billion was Government-backed repo
operations. In addition, BCRP has approved repo operations that promote credit
rescheduling, thereby injecting liquidity and promoting a more quickly passthrough of the
reductions in the reference interest rate to the interest rates of the new credits granted by the
financial system enterprises.

extended period and while the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its
