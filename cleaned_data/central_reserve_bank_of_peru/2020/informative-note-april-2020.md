 MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT - APRIL 2020
 BCRP LOWERS REFERENCE RATE TO 0.25%

1. The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to lower the reference

interest rate by 100 basis points, from 1.25 to 0.25 percent, in light of the following developments:

# i. Annual inflation is expected to approach the lower bound of the target range over the forecast

horizon due to a significant weaking in domestic demand.

# ii. Monthly inflation was 0.65 percent in March; consequently, year-on-year inflation decreased

from 1.9 percent in February to 1.8 percent in March. With monthly inflation excluding food and
energy at 0.42 percent in Februrary, the year-on-year figure decreased from 2.3 percent in
February to 1.7 percent in March.

# iii. One-year ahead expected inflation as of March was 2.0 percent.
 iv. Economic activity is being severely affected by simultaneous temporary supply and demand

shocks.

# v. The risks to global economic activity have increased, including the possibility of a global

recession in the first half of the year.

2. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to support the payments system and the credit

chain. In this context, the BCRP has implemented liquidity easing operations such as security and
currency repos in March and so far in April. The BCRP has several additional liquidity injection
# instruments.

3. The Board pays close attention to new information on inflation and its determinants to continue

expanding monetary stimulus under different modalities.

4. In the same meeting the Board also decided to reduce the following interest rates on BCRP

discount window operations in domestic currency:
