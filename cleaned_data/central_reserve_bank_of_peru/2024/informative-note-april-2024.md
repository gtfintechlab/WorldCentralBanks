**PRESS RELEASE**

**MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT APRIL 2024**

**BCRP REDUCED THE REFERENCE RATE TO 6.0%**

1. The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) agreed to reduce the
reference rate by 25 pbs to 6.0 percent. Future reference rate adjustments will be conditional
on new information about inflation and its determinants.

2. The decision to reduce the reference rate considered the following information and projections:

i. In March, monthly inflation was 1.01 percent and core inflation was 0.88 percent. This
result is considered transitory and is primarily explained by increases in the price of
certain foods and beverages, and by the seasonal rise in education and transportation
costs. Year-on-year inflation decreased from 3.3 percent in February to 3.0 percent in
March, and year-on-year core inflation remained at 3.1 percent between February and
March.

ii. Following a significant reduction in global inflation between the second quarter of 2022
and the end of 2023, there has been a slight persistence in year-on-year rates in recent
months. However, inflation is expected to continue its downward trend over the course
of the year.

iii. One-year-ahead expected inflation decreased from 2.65 percent to 2.56 percent
between February and March, marking the fourth consecutive month it has remained
within the inflation target range.

iv. Year-on-year inflation is projected to continue its downward trend and gradually
converge towards the center of the target range in the coming months.

v. In March, all expectation indicators were in the optimistic range. However, the 12-month
expectation indicators showed a slight deterioration.

vi. The outlook for global economic activity points towards moderate growth in a context of
lower inflationary pressures. However, volatility in financial markets persists, primarily
driven by uncertainties regarding the initiation of monetary policy easing in advanced
economies. Additionally, there are potential risks to fuel and freight price stability
stemming from international conflicts.

3. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants,
including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, to consider, if necessary,
additional changes in the monetary stance. The Board reaffirms its commitment to adopt the
necessary actions to ensure the return of inflation to the target range over the forecast horizon.

4. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic
currency with financial entities:

i. Overnight deposits: 3.75 percent per year.
ii. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: i) 6.50 percent per year for the first
10 operations in the last 3 months and ii) the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange
Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months.
In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates
based on the amount of the operations.

5. The BCRP Boardâ€™s next monetary policy session will take place on May 9, 2024.
