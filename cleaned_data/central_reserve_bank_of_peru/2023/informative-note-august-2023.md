**MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT AUGUST 2023**

**BCRP MAINTAINED THE REFERENCE RATE AT 7.75%**

1. The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to maintain the
reference rate at 7.75 percent. Future reference rate adjustments will be conditional on new
information about inflation and its determinants.

2. The decision to maintain the reference rate considered the following information and
projections:

i. In July, month-on-month inflation was 0.39 percent and core inflation was 0.29 percent.
Year-on-year inflation fell from 6.46 percent in June to 5.88 percent in July, while core
inflation decreased from 4.35 percent in June to 3.89 percent in July. Both indicators
significantly fell two months in a row but remain above the upper limit of the inflation
target range.

ii. The sharp increase in international food and fuel prices since the second half of 2021,
accentuated by international conflicts, has led to a sharp increase in global inflation in
magnitudes not seen in many years and towards levels significantly higher than the
inflation targets of central banks, although in most countries it started to decline. In the
Peruvian case, there were transitory inflation effects due to restrictions in the supply of
some food items, which would have begun to recede since June.

iii. The downward trend in year-on-year inflation is forecast to continue in the following
months, near the target range at the end of the year and approaching the range
beginning next year, due to a moderation of the impact of international food and fuel
prices, a reversal of agricultural supply shocks, and declining inflation expectations in
the rest of the year. However, there are risks related to climatic factors.

iv. One-year-ahead expected inflation decreased from 3.83 percent in June to 3.57 percent
in July, above the upper limit of the inflation target range.

v. The leading and expectations indicators for economic activity in July show a moderate
recovery compared to the previous month but remain in pessimistic territory. The shocks
derived from social conflicts and the coastal El Niño have had a greater than expected
impact on economic activity and domestic demand.

vi. The outlook for global economic activity has moderated; however, global risks remain
due to monetary tightening in advanced economies and international conflicts.

3. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants,
including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, to consider, if
necessary, changes in the monetary stance. The Board reaffirms its commitment to adopt the
necessary actions to ensure the return of inflation to the target range over the forecast horizon.

4. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations
in domestic currency with financial entities:

i. Overnight deposits: 5.25 percent per year.
ii. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: i) 8.25 percent per year for the first
10 operations in the last 3 months and ii) the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange
Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months.
In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates
based on the amount of the operations.

5. The BCRP Board’s next monetary policy session will take place on September 14, 2023.
