#    MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2018
 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75%

1. The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy
interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors:

i. In August, the YoY rate of inflation and the indicators of trend inflation showed levels
within the inflation target range;
ii. The expected YoY rate of inflation was 2.39 percent in August;
iii. Some indicators of economic activity show temporary signs of lower dynamism and
economic activity remains below its potential level of growth, and
iv. Greater risk and increased financial volatility, both associated with recent commercial
tensions, could affect global economic activity.

2. The YoY inflation rate is projected to remain within the target range in September and to
gradually converge to 2.0 percent by the end of the year. The Board considers that it is
appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance until it is certain that this convergence
will take place when inflation expectations are anchored in a context in which the level of
economic activity is close to its potential level of growth.

3. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following:

i. Inflation in August showed a rate of 0.13 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation
rate fell from 1.62 percent in July to 1.07 percent in August 2018. Inflation without food
and energy recorded a rate of 0.09 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate fell from
2.33 percent in July to 2.04 percent in August, within the target range.
ii. Most indicators of business expectations continue to be on the optimistic side in August.
Moreover, a more gradual recovery is observed in indicators of economic activity.

4. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending
and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and
the financial system, as specified below:

i. Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent.
ii. Direct repos and rediscount operations: i) 3.30 percent for the first 15 operations carried
out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and ii) the interest rate set by the
Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to
the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months.
iii. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent.

5. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for October on its Meeting of October 11,
2018.
