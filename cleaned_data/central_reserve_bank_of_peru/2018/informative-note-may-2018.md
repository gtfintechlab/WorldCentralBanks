# MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2018
 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75%

1. The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy

interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors:

i. In April, the YoY inflation rate rose slightly to 0.48 percent, a rate still below the lower

band of the inflation target range (1.0 percent). This is explained mainly by the reversal of
the supply shocks in a context of economic activity that shows a lower level than the
potential level of growth. Moreover, trend inflation measurements show levels close to
the midpoint of the target range;

ii. The expected YoY rate of inflation fell slightly to 2.17 percent in April;

iii. Indicators of economic activity show clear signs of a greater dynamism, although GDP

remains below its potential level of growth, and

iv. The world economy continues to show positive indicators, although there is still

uncertainty in international financial markets.

2. The YoY inflation rate is projected to return to be within the target range in the second

quarter and to gradually converge to 2.0 percent by the end of the year. The Board considers
that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance until it is certain that this
convergence will take place in a context of anchored inflation expectations.

3. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following:

i. Inflation in April showed a rate of -0.14 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation rate

rose from 0.36 percent in March to 0.48 percent in April. Inflation without food and energy
recorded a rate of 0.01 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate fell from 1.99 percent in
March to 1.91 in April, within the target range.

ii. Most indicators of business expectations improved in April and continue to be on the

optimistic side. Moreover, several indicators of economic activity, consumption, and
investment show a recovery as well.

4. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending

and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and
the financial system, as specified below:

i. Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent.

ii. Direct repos and rediscount operations: i) 3.30 percent for the first 15 operations
carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and ii) the interest rate set
by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional
operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months.

iii. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent.

5. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for June on its Meeting of June 7, 2018.
