#            MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2018
 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75%

1. The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy

interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors:

i. Inflation in March continued declining for five consecutive months and, as anticipated,

showed a rate below the lower band of the inflation target range (1.0 percent). This is
explained mainly by the reversal of the supply shocks and by a level of economic activity
that is lower than the potential level of growth. The YoY inflation rate is projected to
return to be within the target range in the second quarter and to gradually converge
thereafter to 2.0 percent by the end of the year. Moreover, trend inflation measurements
showed levels close to the midpoint of the target range;

ii. Expectations of inflation in 12 months continued decreasing and registered a rate of 2.18

percent in March 2018;

iii. Economic activity continues to grow at levels below its potential level of growth, amid a

context of low inflation, and

iv. The world economy continues to show positive indicators, although uncertainty in

international financial markets has increased.

2. The Board pays close attention to new data on inflation and inflation determinants to

consider the convenience of making additional adjustments in the Central Bankâ€™s monetary
policy stance should it be necessary.

3. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following:

i. Inflation in March showed a rate of 0.49 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation

rate fell from 1.18 percent in February to 0.36 percent in 2018. Inflation without food and
energy recorded a rate of 0.85 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate increased from
1.97 percent in February to 1.99 percent in March, within the target range.

ii. Most indicators of business expectations deteriorated in March, although they continue to

be on the optimistic side.

4. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending

and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and
the financial system, as specified below:

i. Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent.

ii. Direct repos and rediscount operations: i) 3.30 percent for the first 15 operations
carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and ii) the interest rate set
by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional
operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months.

iii. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent.

5. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for the month of May on its Meeting of May

10, 2018.
