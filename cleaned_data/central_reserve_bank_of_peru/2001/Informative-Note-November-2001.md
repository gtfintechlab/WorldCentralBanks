**highest. It should be noted that this is the fourth consecutive month in which the Bank**
reduced this rate. Formerly, the said rate was 7,5 percent.

b. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the
effective interest rate will be 2,5 percent. The latter rate was 3,0 percent.

c. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission
implies an effective annual cost of 6,0 percent. The latter cost was 7,5 percent.

3. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations:

a. The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be **4,5 percent. The latter**
rate was 5,0 percent.

b. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the
average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad.

4. The Central Bank grants monetary regulation credits in domestic and foreign currency on a
regular basis. Besides, the Central Bank operations will be oriented to reduce volatility in the
exchange market.
