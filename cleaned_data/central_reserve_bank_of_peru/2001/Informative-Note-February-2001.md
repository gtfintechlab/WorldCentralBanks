# BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERÃš

**Informative note on the Monetary Program: February 2001**

1. As anticipated in the Monetary Program Report for 2001, The Central Reserve
Bank Board of Directors established that, on the first Friday of each month, the
Bank would announce the range for the average daily balance of the current
accounts held by banks at the Central Bank, to be taken as benchmark for
monetary operations during the month. Additionally, the Bank will announce the
interest rates to be maintained during the month for monetary regulation credits and
overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank.

For the month of February, the range referred to in the previous paragraph will be
**S/. 125 - S/. 135 million as a daily average. In January, the said balance was S/.**
128 million.

2. The Central Bank Board of Directors also established that the following interest and
commission rates would be used in domestic-currency Central Bank operations:

a. For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest
rate would be **the average of the top-decile interbank interest rates, or**
**12,5 percent, whichever is highest. This rate has been maintained at its**
current level since January 4, when it was reduced from 14,0 percent.
b. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central
Bank, the effective interest rate will be 4,5 percent. Until February 1, this rate
was equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for overnight
deposits abroad (approximately 6,0 percent in January).
c. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the
commission will be 0,01720 percent, equivalent to an effective **12,5 percent**
annual cost. This cost has been maintained at its current level since January
4, when it was reduced from 14 percent.

3. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations:

a. The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 8,5 percent.
This rate has been maintained at its current level since 17 November, when it
was reduced from 10,0 percent.
b. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is
equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits
abroad.

4. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in
order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability.
