# BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERÚ


## Monetary Program for 2001- Information Note: September 2001

### The BCRP reduces its reference interest rate from 9,0 to 8,5 percent in domestic currency and from 6,0 to 5,5 percent in foreign currency and set the operating target range at S/. 130 - S/. 140 million

1. For the month of September, the Board maintained the range for its operating target at S/. 130 - S/. 140
**million as a daily average. In August, the said balance was S/. 132 million, which fell within the**
announced range (S/. 130 – S/. 140 million).

2. The Central Bank Board of Directors also established that the following interest and commission rates
would be used in domestic-currency Central Bank operations since September 7:

a. For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest rate would be **the**
**weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 8,5 percent, whichever is highest. It**
should be noted that this is the fourth consecutive month in which the Bank reduced this rate. In
August, the said rate was 9,0 percent.

b. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective
interest rate will be 4,0 percent. This rate is effective since March 2.

c. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission will be
0,0134 percent, equivalent to an effective **8,5 percent annual cost. This cost is lower than that**
effective since August 3 (9,0 percent).

3. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations:

a. The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 5,5 percent. This rate implied a
reduction with respect to the rate effective since August 3 (6,0 percent).

b. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average
obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad.

4. The Central Bank grants monetary regulation credits in domestic and foreign currency on a regular
basis.

5. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure
the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability.
