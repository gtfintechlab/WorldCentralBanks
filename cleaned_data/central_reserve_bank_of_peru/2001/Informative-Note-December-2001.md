# Monetary Program for 2001- Information Note: December 2001

1. For the month of December, the Board increased the range for its operating target at **S/. 150 -**
**S/. 160 million as a daily average. In November, the said balance was S/. 146 million, which**
fell slightly above the announced range (S/. 135 – S/. 145 million), as a consequence of a
higher liquidity requirement reflected in higher temporary purchase of CDBCRP on November
30

2. The Central Bank Board of Directors also established that the following interest and
commission rates would be used in domestic-currency Central Bank operations since
December 6:

a. For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest rate would be
**the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 5,0 percent, whichever is**
**highest. Formerly, the said rate was 6,0 percent.**

b. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the
effective interest rate will be 2,0 percent. The latter rate was 2,5 percent.

c. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission
implies an effective annual cost of 5,0 percent. The latter cost was 6,0 percent.

3. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations:

a. The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 4,5 percent. This rate
rules since November 9.

b. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the
average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad.

4. The Central Bank grants monetary regulation credits in domestic and foreign currency on a
regular basis. Besides, the Central Bank operations will be oriented to reduce volatility in the
exchange market.

5. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to
ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability, which mean avoiding
inflationary or deflationary pressures.
