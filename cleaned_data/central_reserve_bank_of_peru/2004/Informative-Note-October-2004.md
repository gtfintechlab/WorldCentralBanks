**CENTRAL BANK RAISES REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 2.75% TO 3.00%**

1.     In September, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increases 0.02
percent. The cumulative inflation in the January-September period stayed at 3.2
percent. Core inflation, indicator of the inflationary trend, was 2.3 percent in similar
period.

Transitorily, 12-month inflation is above the upper limit of the target range due to
supply shocks in foods and fuels during the first semester. The Import Goods Price
Index increased 9.3 percent in the January-September period.

The Central Bank forecasts that the 2004 cumulative inflation will be near to the upper
limit of the target range (3.5 percent) and, around the mid-point of the range (2.5
percent) for 2005. Core inflation will be slightly above the mid-point of the range in
both years.

2. **The** **Board of the Central Bank approved to raise in 25 basis points the**
**reference interest rates of the monetary operations:**

**a.** **The monetary operations regarding injection and withdrawal of liquidity**

credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate.

held at BCRP is S/. 190 - S/. 210 million. This average balance is neither a target nor
a monetary policy stance indicator, since it also reflects, among others, seasonal
factors as well as liquidity demand changes.

a. Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point.

deposits held abroad.
