 BOARD OF THE CENTRAL BANK APPROVED MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2004

## REFERENCE INTEREST RATE IS KEPT AT 2.50%

1. In February the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 1.09
percent. Cumulative inflation through last 12 month reached 3.4 percent, higher than
in January (2.8 percent). However, core inflation, a price indicator that excludes high
volatility items grew 1.9 percent over last 12 months.

As mentioned in January Inflation Report, the rate of inflation is expected to rise
temporarily the first months of the year, due to the increase of the international price
of wheat and soybean oil as well as a shortage in the domestic agricultural supply
(potato, rice, vegetables and sugar). Besides, an increase in the price of poultry was
registered in February.

The projections included in the January Inflation Report point out that inflation will
meet the target of 2.5 percent for 2004.

2. Interbank interest rate averaged 2.52 percent in February, higher than in January
(2.41 percent)

**means of auctions will be made in order to place the interbank interest rate in**
**the center of this corridor of reference interest rates (2.50 percent).**

regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest
rate.
