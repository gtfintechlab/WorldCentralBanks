 BOARD OF THE CENTRAL BANK APPROVED MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JUNE 2004

## REFERENCE INTEREST RATE IS KEPT AT 2,50%

1. In May the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.35 percent,
due to transitory shocks in the supply of foods and fuels. Cumulative inflation through
last 12 month reached 3.18 percent, higher than in April (2.78 percent), since May
2003 rate was negative in 0.03 percent. Core inflation, a price indicator that excludes
high volatility items was 2.53 percent over last 12 months.

Inflation in 2004 and 2005 is expected to meet the target range (1.5-3.5 percent).
However, 12 month inflation might be transitorily over this range in some months of
the year due to supply shocks and an statistical effect since inflation was negative
between April and July 2003.

2. The average interbank interest rate was 2.48 percent in May, similar to April (2.49
percent).

regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest
rate.
