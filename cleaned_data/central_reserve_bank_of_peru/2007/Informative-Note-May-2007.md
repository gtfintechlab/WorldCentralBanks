# MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2007

   BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4,50%

1. The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to maintain
the interbank reference rate at 4.5 percent, but expressed concerns about a
possible inflationary impact in a 12-18 month horizon due to a very high
increase of domestic demand. Therefore, should inflationary pressures be
observed, the Board will be inclined to withdraw monetary stimulus.

2. The Board analyzed recent macroeconomic developments and prospects
based on data on the last month, including the following:

a. The Consumer Price Index for Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.18
percent in April. As a result of this, the last 12-month CPI inflation rate
fell from 0.25 percent in March to -0.08 percent in April, in line with the
forecasts included in the Inflation Report of January. On the other hand,
core inflation –indicator of the trend of price increases– was 0.13 percent,
and accumulated a last 12-month rate of 1.48 percent (1.42 percent in
March).

Last 12-month inflation in the first months of 2007 should transitorily be
below the lower band of the inflation target (1.0 percent). Inflation should
be in the range of the inflation target in the second half of the year, in line
with Inflation Report forecasts, and would converge to the 2.0 percent
inflation target thereafter.

b. Domestic demand grew from 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 to
an estimated rate of 10.5 percent in the first quarter of 2007, mainly as a
result of increased private consumption (6.9 percent) and private
investment (18.8 percent). In this context, the Board stands ready to
anticipate the eventual impact on prices of a very high expansion of
internal spending in a 12-18 horizon through the withdrawal of monetary
stimulus.

c. The average monthly interest rate in the interbank market was 4.51
percent in April. Short-term rates are relatively stable, while long-term
rates in domestic currency continue to show a downward trend. Thus,
the average 90-day corporate prime rate in soles in the same month was
5.18 percent, decreasing by 1 basis point relative to March, while the
yield on the 20-year sovereign bond in soles was 6.02 percent, 23 bps.
lower than at end March. The General Index of the Lima Stock Exchange
grew 20.5 percent in April. In March, last 12-month credit to the private
sector grew 18.1 percent and 33.9 percent in the case of credit in
domestic currency.

d. In April, the nuevo sol appreciated on average 0.2 percent in nominal
terms, closing at S/. 3.179 per dollar. This evolution was mainly

associated with a supply of dollars in the spot exchange market and in
the forward market of US$ 601 million and US$ 900 million respectively.
In this context, the Central Bank purchased US$ 1,330 million in the
exchange market to reduce the volatility of exchange and to accumulate
international reserves. This amount was higher than in March, due to
operations associated to the regularization of income tax payments.

3. During the session, the Board approved the annual interest rates on the
following active and passive operations in soles between the BCRP and the
financial system:

a. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.25 percent.
b. Overnight deposits: 3.75 percent.

Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the interest rates on the following
operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system:

a. Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point.
b. Overnight depostis: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage point..
c. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of
5.25 percent.

d. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration: 3.25
percent anually.

4. The Board approved to initiate procedures to raise the limit for investments
abroad by Private Administrators of Pension Funds from 13.5 to 15.0
percent.

5. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (June 2007) on the
session to be held on June 7, 2007.
