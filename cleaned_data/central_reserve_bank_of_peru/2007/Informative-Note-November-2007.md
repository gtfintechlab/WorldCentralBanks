# MONETARY PROGRAM FOR NOVEMBER 2007
 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 5.0%

1. The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the monetary policy reference
rate at 5.0 percent

The Board continues to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants,
distinguishing the factors with temporary impacts from those with permanent effects.

Inflation’s recent increase above the target is basically associated with rises in the
international prices of some basic food inputs. The Bank continues to keep a close
watch on international economy developments and on their repercussions on inflation
in the country.

Therefore, should expectations about inflation increase or should domestic demand
grow at a faster pace than productive capacity and productivity, the Bank will adopt any
necessary preventive adjustments in the reference interest rate.

2. The Board made this decision considering the following macroeconomic information:

a. The Consumer Price Index for Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.31 percent
in October and accumulated 3.1 percent over the last 12 months, a level above
the monetary target range (2 percent, plus or minus one percentage point).
Core inflation –indicator of the inflation trend– was 0.35 percent and accumulated
2.4 percent over the last twelve months.

Imported inflation, indicator representing the part of inflation that is mainly
determined by international prices, was 2.20 percent in October and was mainly
due to the rise in the price of bread, given the increase observed in the
international price of wheat. As a result of this, imported inflation showed a last 12month rate of 9.18 percent.

As pointed out in our Inflation Report of September, last 12-month inflation is
expected to be transitorily above the upper band of the target range (3.0 percent) in
the short-term, due mainly to a higher imported inflation rate, particularly in terms of
inputs used for the production of food products. These shocks have temporary
impacts on inflation and, therefore, inflation should converge thereafter to the target
(2.0 percent), as in other similar episodes.

As reflected in the surveys carried out with firms and economic analysts, inflation
expectations for 2008 and 2009 remain around the monetary policy inflation target
of 2.0 percent. Moreover, according to the surveys carried our with financial
entities, inflation expectations for 2008 and 2009 are 2.6 and 2.5 percent
respectively.

b. Economic activity continues to show a robust growth: GDP grew 7.7 percent and
domestic demand grew 10.9 percent during the first eight months of this year.

c. The nuevo sol appreciated 2.9 percent against the dollar in October and 6.2 yearto-date. The exchange rate by the close of the month was S/. 3.00 per dollar.
Moreover, the nuevo sol appreciated 1.5 percent against the currency basket of our
trading partners in October, and has appreciated 1.0 percent so far this year.

d. The average monthly interest rate for the interbank market was 4.98 percent in
October, close to the reference interest rate.

e. The spread of the global bond (indicator of the country risk) closed at 136 bps. in
October (137 bps. at end-September). Furthermore, the yield on the 20-year and
30-year sovereign bonds in soles closed at 6.3 and 6.5 percent respectively in
October. In both cases, the interest rates on these bonds declined by 14 bps.
compared to end September.

3. During the session, the Board approved the annual interest rates on the following
active and passive operations in soles between the BCRP and the financial
system:

a. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.75 percent.
b. Overnight deposits: 4.25 percent.

Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the interest rates on the following
operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system:

a. Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point.
b. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage point.
c. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.75 percent.
d. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration: 3.5 percent.

4. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (December 2007) in the
