## PRESS RELEASE

 MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2007

 BCRP MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 4.50%

i. The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the reference interest
rate for the interbank market at 4.50 percent, considering that no inflationary
pressures are expected in the short term and that the factors that have
driven the inflation rate below the target range are transitory. These include
the lower prices of fuels, of public utilities and of some food products which
are expected to have a one-time impact on the inflation rate.

ii. The inflation targeting scheme implemented by the Central Bank since 2002
involves a series of preventive monetary measures to maintain inflation
within the target range of between 1.5 and 3.5 percent. The inflation
targeting regime considers the possibility of transitory diversions from the
target range which fall out of the control of central banks and which are not
deemed to require particular monetary measures to address them given their
temporary nature.

iii. The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.03
percent in December 2006, as a result of which the last-12-month CPI
inflation rate was 1.14 percent –below the lower band of the inflation target
(1.5 – 2.5 percent)– in line with the trend forecast in the Central Bank’s
inflation report of September and with the announced monetary program for
December. This lower inflation rate is associated with the lower prices of
fuels, of electricity and telephone rates, and of some food products. The rate
of core inflation –a trend indicator of price increases– was 0.15 percent in
December, as a result of which last-12-month core inflation has increased
from 1.23 percent in 2004 and 2005 to 1.4 percent in 2006.

The last-12-month inflation rate is expected to remain below the lower band
of the inflation target (1.5 percent) in the first part of 2007 due to the reversal
of the price rises of some food products observed in the first four months of
2006, as these factors have a one-time impact on inflation and therefore
require no particular monetary policy measures to address them.

iv. The acceleration of economic activity since 2005, with growth rates of
domestic demand of around 10 percent during 2006, has been coupled by
low levels of inflation. This evolution is explained by productivity increases in
the economy as well as by the appreciation of the nuevo sol. In addition to
this, business expectations on inflation are stable.

v. In this context, the Central Bank will continue evaluating all relevant
macroeconomic information and will stand ready to take any necessary
measure to ensure that inflation continues to be within the target range (1.5 –
3.5 percent). Particularly, the Central Bank will oversee that an increased
domestic spending –that might exceed the improvements observed in terms
of productivity– is not translated into inflationary pressures.

vi. In the last twelve months, the nominal exchange rate decreased 6.4 percent
relative to the dollar, while the real exchange rate (considering the currency
fluctuations of our main trading partners and relative inflation in these
countries) declined less –1.3 percent– in a context of unprecedented
increased terms of trade (26 percent) over the last 50 years.

vii. The interbank reference interest rate has been 4.5 percent since May 2006,
and the average monthly interest rate for the interbank market was 4.51
percent in December. The short-term rates are relatively stable and longterm rates in domestic currency continue to exhibit a decreasing tendency.
Thus, the average 90-day corporate prime rate for credit in soles was 5.23
percent in December, decreasing 2 bps. with respect to November. On the
other hand, the yield on the 20-year sovereign bond in soles decreased for
the seventh consecutive month and fell from 6.88 percent in November to
6.58 percent in December.

viii. During the session, the Board of Directors approved the following annual
interest rates for active and passive operations between the BCRP and the
financial system:

a. Direct temporary purchases of securities and rediscount operations:
5.25 percent.
b. Overnight deposits: 3.75 percent.

Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the following annual interest rates
for operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system:

a. Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point.
b. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage
point.
c. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of
5.25 percent.
d. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration: 2.75
percent.

ix. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (for the month of
February) on the session to be held on February 8, 2007.

x. In 2007, the Board of the Central Bank will approve the Monetary Program
for each month according to the following schedule:
