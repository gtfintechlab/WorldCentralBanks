## MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2007

 BCRP MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 4.50%

i. The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the reference interest
rate for the interbank market at 4.50 percent, considering that no inflationary
pressures are expected in the short term and that the factors that have
driven the inflation rate below the target range are transitory. These include
the lower prices of public utilities and some food products.

ii. The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.26
percent in February, as a result of which the last-12-month CPI inflation rate
fell from 0.64 percent in January to 0.36 percent in February. On the other
hand, the rate of core inflation –indicator of the trend of price increases– was
0.26 percent, accumulating a last-12-month rate of 1.49 percent.

The last-12-month inflation rate should remain below the lower band of the
inflation target (1.0 percent) in the first part of 2007 due to the reversal of the
price rises of some food products observed in the first months of 2006, in line
with the forecasts outlined in the Inflation Report of January 2007. The
above-mentioned factors have a one-time impact on inflation and therefore
require no particular monetary policy measures to address them.

iii. This evolution of prices has taken place amid a context marked by a strongly
dynamic performance of economic activity, which posted the highest level of
growth (0.8 percent) observed in the last 11 years in 2006. This evolution is
explained by the expansion of the productive capacity as a result of higher
investment and productivity, the appreciation of the nuevo sol, low
expectations of inflation, and increased competition reflected in lower
margins.

iv. The macroeconomic prospects and the balance of risks described in our
Inflation Report of January 2007 prevail. Thus, based on the expected pace
of growth of economic activity, inflation expectations in line with the inflation
target, and a moderate evolution of imported inflation, inflation is expected to
converge to a rate of 2 percent. In contrast with the 2003-2005 period, the
prices of food products and fuels are not expected to generate an upward
trend of inflation in the forecast horizon, as normal conditions of supply are
forecast in the agricultural sector and relatively moderate prices rises are
expected in the international price of fuels.

v. This upward trend in the forecast growth of economic activity for 2007 (6.8
percent) is being confirmed by the first indicators of demand this year,
although no signals of inflation are observed yet. In this context, the Central

Bank stands ready to prevent that an increase in domestic spending might
be translated into inflationary pressures.

vi. The average monthly interbank reference rate was 4.48 in February. The
short-term rates are relatively stable, while the long-term rates for operations
in domestic currency continue to show a downward trend. Thus, the 90-day
corporate prime rate in soles in February was 5.20 percent, a level that was
1 basis point higher than the one posted in January, while the yield on the
20-year sovereign bond in soles decreased at the close of month was 6.40
percent, decreasing 36 bps. with respect to end January.

vii. Emerging markets exhibited a higher volatility in the last week of February
which involved portfolio adjustments in terms of the assets of these
economies (currency, sovereign bonds, etc.). In this context, the country risk
indicator was 136 bps. at the close of February, which represented an
increase of 5 bps. relative to the previous month.

viii. In February, the nuevo sol appreciated 0.1 percent in nominal terms and
closed at S/. 3.191 per dollar at the end of the month.

ix. During the session, the Board of Directors approved the following annual
interest rates for active and passive operations between the BCRP and the
financial system:

a. Direct temporary purchases of securities and rediscount operations:
5.25 percent.

b. Overnight deposits: 3.75 percent.

Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the following annual interest rates
for operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system:

a. Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point.
b. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage
point.

c. Swap: a commission equal to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.25
percent.

d. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration: 3.0
percent.

x. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (for the month of
April) on its session to be held on April 3, 2007.
