## PRESS RELEASE
 MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2007
 BCRP MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 4.50%

i. The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the reference interest
rate for the interbank market at 4.50 percent, considering that no inflationary
pressures are expected in the short term and that the factors that have
driven the inflation rate below the target range are transitory. These include
the lower prices of fuels, of public utilities and of some food products.

ii. The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.01
percent in January, as a result of which the last-12-month CPI inflation rate
fell from 1.14 percent in December to 0.64 percent in January. On the other
hand, the rate of core inflation was 0.1 percent, accumulating a last-12month rate of 1.3 percent.

The last-12-month inflation rate is expected to remain below the lower band
of the inflation target (1.5 percent) in the first part of 2007 due to the reversal
of the price rises of some food products observed in the first four months of
2006, in line with the forecasts outlined in the Inflation Report of September
2006 as well as with the recent communiqués on the Monetary Program.
The above-mentioned factors have a one-time impact on inflation and
therefore require no particular monetary policy measures to address them.

iii. The evolution of prices takes place amid a context characterized by a
dynamic performance of economic activity, whose growth –estimated at 7.9
percent by end 2006– is considered to be the highest level of growth
recorded in the last 11 years. This evolution is explained by the expansion of
the productive capacity as a result of higher investment and productivity, the
appreciation of the nuevo sol, and increased competition, reflected in lower
margins and expectations of inflation.

iv. In this context, the Central Bank will continue to evaluate all relevant
macroeconomic indicators and stands ready to take any necessary
measures to ensure that inflation converges to the target range. Particularly,
the Central Bank will oversee that an increased domestic spending –that
might exceed the improvements observed in terms of productivity– is not
translated into inflationary pressures.

v. The average monthly interbank reference rate was 4.47 in January. The
short-term rates are relatively stable. Thus, the 90-day corporate prime rate
in soles in January was 5.20 percent, a level that was 3 basis points lower

than the one posted in December. On the other hand, the country risk
indicator at end January was 131 bps., which represented an increase of 14
bps. with respect to the previous month. Furthermore, the yield on the 20year sovereign bond in soles decreased at the close of month was 6.77
percent, increasing 19 bps. with respect to the close of December.

vi. In January, the nuevo sol appreciated 0.4 percent on average in nominal
terms and depreciated 0.1 percent by the end of the period, thus closing the
month at S/. 3.198 per dollar.

vii. During the session, the Board of Directors approved the following annual
interest rates for active and passive operations between the BCRP and the
financial system:

a. Direct temporary purchases of securities and rediscount operations:
5.25 percent.
b. Overnight deposits: 3.75 percent.

Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the following annual interest rates
for operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system:

a. Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point.
b. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage
point.
c. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of
5.25 percent.
d. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration: 3.0
percent.

viii. The Board approved to initiate the procedures required to raise the
maximum limit of investments abroad from 12.0 percent to 13.5 percent for
Private Administrators of Pension Funds (Administradoras Privadas de
Fondos de Pensiones).

ix. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (for the month of
March) on its session to be held on March 8, 2007.
