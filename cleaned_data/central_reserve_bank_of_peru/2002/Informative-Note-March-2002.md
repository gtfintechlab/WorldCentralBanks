 MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD
 OF THE BANK FOR MARCH 2002

higher preference for domestic currency. In February, the current account balance was
S/. 189 million, higher than the operating target of that month (S/. 160 million to S/. 170

vaults in compliance of the legal minimum reserve requirement (6 percent).

banking liquidity with respect to the February Monetary Program announce in order to
avoid interbank interest rates rising pressures. Thus, the average interbank interest rate
in domestic currency was 2,6 percent in February, compared with 2,7 percent in
January.

a. For monetary regulation credits and temporary purchase of CDBCRP and
Treadury bonds out of auctions, the effective interest rate would be the weighted
**average of the interbank interest rates, or 3,0 percent, whichever is highest.**
Formerly, the said rate was 3,5 percent.

b. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank,
the effective interest rate remained at 1,9 percent.

c. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the
commission implies an effective annual cost of 3,0 percent. The former cost was
3,5 percent.

3. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations:

a. The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be **2,75 percent.**
Formerly, the said rate was 3,0 percent.

b. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to
the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad.

4. The Central Bank grants monetary regulation credits in domestic and foreign currency
on a regular basis. Besides, the Central Bank operations will be oriented to reduce
volatility in the exchange market.

5. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in
order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability, which
mean avoiding inflationary or deflationary pressures.
