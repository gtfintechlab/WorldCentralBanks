# Monetary Program - Information Note: January 2002

1. For the month of January, the Board increased the range for its operating target at **S/. 160 -**
**S/. 170 million as a daily average consistent with a higher preference for domestic currency.**
In December, the said balance was S/. 165 million, which fell above the announced range
(S/. 150 – S/. 160 million) avoiding unnecessary fluctuations in interbank interest rates in a
context of high concentration of supply and demand in the interbank market.

2. The Central Bank Board of Directors also established that the following interest and
commission rates would be used in domestic-currency Central Bank operations since January 4:

a. For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest rate would be
**the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 4,0 percent, whichever is**
**highest. Formerly, the said rate was 5,0 percent.**

b. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the
effective interest rate remained at 2,0 percent.

c. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission
implies an effective annual cost of 4,0 percent. The latter cost was 5,0 percent.

3. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations:

a. The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 3,5 percent. Formerly,
the said rate was 4,5 percent.

b. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the
average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad.

4. The Central Bank grants monetary regulation credits in domestic and foreign currency on a
regular basis. Besides, the Central Bank operations will be oriented to reduce volatility in the
exchange market.

5. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to
ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability, which mean avoiding
inflationary or deflationary pressures.
