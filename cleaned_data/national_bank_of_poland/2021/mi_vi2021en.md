# Minutes of the Monetary Policy Council decision-making

 meeting held on 9 June 2021

At the Council meeting it was pointed out that May had seen an improvement in the

pandemic situation around the world. Nevertheless, significant uncertainty about the further
development of the global pandemic persisted. In many countries, particularly in developing
ones, the vaccination process was slow and the epidemic situation remained difficult. In
many countries vaccination of a sufficient proportion of the population, which would allow
to contain the epidemic without the need to introduce restrictions in the future, will be
challenging.

The gradual easing of sanitary restrictions in the recent period had led to an

improvement in business conditions in the services sector in many economies, including in
the euro area. At the same time, economic indicators in industry suggested a further
recovery in activity in this sector, and in certain markets supply-side constraints were
emerging. However, much of incoming data is heavily distorted by statistical base effects
and the realisation of pent-up demand by some households and firms, which temporarily
boosted expenditure on certain goods and services.

The Council members drew attention to the fact that the rebound in economic activity

currently under way in many economies was taking place following the sharpest fall in GDP
in decades. In this context certain Council members underlined that in the euro area GDP
was significantly lower than before the pandemic and that employment was still falling in
2021 Q1.

It was judged that the recovery was contributing to the rise in commodity prices in the

global markets, including in oil prices, which were significantly higher than a year earlier.
Along with base effects, a rise in international transport costs, and supply-side disruptions
related to the pandemic, which were taking place amid the opening of economies following
the last wave of the pandemic, this was boosting global inflation. Some Council members
underlined that in the United States the annual inflation rate had exceeded 4% and was the
highest for a dozen or so years, while core inflation was the highest for three decades. These
Council members underlined that inflation in the euro area had also risen significantly in
recent months.

During the discussion it was pointed out that despite a significant rise in inflation in the

United States, the Federal Reserve was keeping interest rates close to zero, was conducting
asset purchases, and had not signalled a tightening of monetary policy, while pointing out
that heightened inflation was transitory. At the same time, the European Central Bank
declared that it would continue its pandemic emergency purchase programme until at least
March 2022. As a result, the financial markets expected that the ECB’s deposit rate would
remain negative at least for the following 3 years.

When assessing the situation in Poland, the Council members pointed out that 2021 Q1

had seen a 0.9% fall in GDP in annual terms. However, it was underlined that annual growth
in consumption and investment was slightly positive. It was pointed out that investment had


-----

been boosted by enterprises investing in means of transport and machinery and equipment.
At the same time, it was noted that consumer demand had not yet returned to the prepandemic level, which confirmed that the elevated inflation was not related to excessive
growth in demand.

The Council members judged that the easing of the epidemic restrictions had had a

positive impact on the economic situation in the recent period. However, it was underlined
that the incoming monthly data should be interpreted with caution, since in March and April
most annual macroeconomic indicators had been heavily distorted by statistical base effects.

In recent months the incoming data had indicated a further improvement in economic

conditions, with persisting differences between sectors. In April 2021, annual industrial
output growth and retail sales growth had risen significantly. However, it was underlined
that while industrial output in April had been higher than before the pandemic, retail sales
had still not reached the pre-pandemic level. At the same time, annual growth in
construction and assembly output had remained clearly negative. Attention was drawn to
the improvement in consumer sentiment, which, however, remained less optimistic than
before the pandemic, and to the improved financial results of enterprises.

While analysing the labour market situation, the Council members underlined that

although annual employment growth in the enterprise sector had been positive in April
2021, in monthly terms employment had fallen and remained lower than before the outbreak
of the pandemic. Moreover, a large number of jobs continued to be subsidised by public
funds. The unemployment rate remained higher than before the pandemic.

During the Council meeting it was pointed out that in 2021 Q1 wage growth in the

economy had remained lower than before the pandemic. Although annual wage growth in
enterprises had picked up in April, after excluding base effects it remained close to that
observed in 2021 Q1 in the whole economy. At the same time, some Council members
emphasised that corporate revenue had risen much faster than wages in 2021 Q1. As a result,
they judged that there was no cost pressure in the economy that would result from excessive
wage growth. These Council members also pointed to the further rise in the number of
immigrants last year, which might curb any potential tensions in the labour market related to
a shortage of employees. On the other hand, certain Council members drew attention to the
fact that a significant number of surveyed firms reported upward pressure on wages from
employees.

The majority of the Council members were of the opinion that lending growth remained

low and was not contributing to inflation rising above the NBP inflation target. It was
pointed out that in May 2021 annual credit growth in the economy had stood at 2.5%. Credit
growth had been supported by a further increase in housing loans; however, in the case of
enterprises annual lending growth had remained markedly negative while consumer credit
growth had been close to zero. However, the majority of the Council members judged that
housing loan growth remained moderate and lower than wage growth. Against this
backdrop certain Council members underlined that annual growth in prices of residential
real estate was significantly positive; however, in recent quarters it had declined and
demand in this market was partly related to the activity of foreign investors due to the


-----

persistence of low interest rates abroad. On the other hand, while discussing monetary
aggregates, certain Council members pointed out that money supply had risen significantly
in recent quarters and public debt was a significant factor contributing to its creation.

At the Council meeting it was pointed out that according to the GUS preliminary data,

May saw an increase in annual CPI to 4.8% (in monthly terms CPI stood at 0.3% and
decreased as compared with the previous month). In particular, rapid growth in fuel prices
in annual terms was observed, which was the result of growth in global oil prices and strong
base effects. At the same time, annual food price growth picked up. The majority of the
Council members underlined that annual inflation also continued to be elevated by other
factors beyond the influence of domestic monetary policy, including the increase in
electricity prices which took place at the beginning of the year and the increase in waste
disposal charges. In this context, these Council members drew attention to the fact that
according to the full data for April, the increase in fuel prices and prices of goods and
administered services accounted for almost half of the CPI inflation rate. As a result, the
majority of the Council members judged that although demand factors also supported price
growth, they were not causing inflation to exceed the inflation target.

While discussing inflation expectations, some Council members pointed out that,

although in surveys consumers noticed price growth, the balance statistics describing trends
in consumer opinions on future changes in prices had shifted towards lower inflation in
recent months and had reached the lowest level for 2 years. These Council members also
underlined that although inflation forecasts of financial sector analysts had recently
remained elevated, they continued to indicate a gradual decline in inflation in the coming
years. On the other hand, certain Council members pointed out that a significant number of
entrepreneurs expected faster price growth in the future. These Council members also
judged that although inflation expectations of households were not rising, the majority of
them expected inflation in the future to be close to the level that is observed currently.

The majority of the Council members judged that as a result of factors beyond the

influence of domestic monetary policy, annual inflation in the coming months was likely to
remain above the upper limit of deviations from the inflation target. However, the majority
of the Council members were of the opinion that next year, after the factors temporarily
boosting price growth fade, a decline in inflation was expected. These Council members also
pointed out that the development of inflation in 2022 would depend on the robustness of the
economic recovery, including the labour market situation following the phasing out of the
anti-crisis measures. The Council members also drew attention to the fact that the level of
inflation next year would depend on the fiscal policy stance.

Certain Council members were of the opinion that forecasts pointing to a decline in

inflation in the coming quarters were subject to uncertainty. They pointed out that amid the
ongoing economic recovery, the observed rise in inflation above the NBP inflation target
might lead to an increase in inflation expectations and the consolidation of inflation at a level
above the NBP inflation target in the coming quarters. Certain Council members judged that
the growth in money supply might also boost inflation.

The majority of the Council members were of the opinion that the present meeting

should keep interest rates unchanged and continue to pursue the NBP’s remaining measures.
These Council members judged that the monetary policy conducted by NBP supported the
consolidation of economic recovery following the pandemic-induced recession and stabilised
inflation at the level consistent with the NBP’s inflation target in the medium term. They
drew attention to the fact that keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged was currently
justified due to the sources and the expected temporary nature of inflation exceeding the
NBP’s target, as well as the uncertainty about the persistence and scale of the economic
recovery. The Council members underlined that as indicated in Monetary Policy Guidelines for
_2021, due to the macroeconomic and financial shocks, inflation may temporarily deviate_
from the target and even run outside the band for deviations from the target. The response of
monetary policy to the shocks is flexible and depends on their causes and the assessment of
persistence of their effects, including their impact on inflation developments.

The majority of the Council members judged that if the uncertainty about the further

course of the pandemic, and – as a result – the future economic conditions continued, and if
the rise in inflation above the target was the result of factors beyond the control of monetary
policy, it would be advisable to keep interest rates unchanged also in the near future. In their
opinion, the tightening of monetary conditions in response to inflation running above the
inflation target due to negative supply shocks and regulatory factors, would not curb price
growth in 2021, while it could halt economic recovery following a considerable economic
downturn caused by the pandemic.

Some Council members judged that future incoming data and forecasts, including the

July NBP projection, would be helpful in assessing the robustness of the economic recovery
and the outlook for inflation. These Council members judged that if forecasts indicated
robust economic growth in the coming years, with inflation remaining permanently above
the NBP inflation target due to increased demand and persistently favourable situation in the
labour market, amid fading uncertainty about pandemic it would be possible to adjust
monetary policy.

However, certain Council members were of the opinion that the NBP reference rate

should be raised at the current meeting. They assessed that inflation would remain above
3.5% in the following four quarters. In the opinion of these Council members, the increase in
the reference rate could reduce the risk of an increase in inflation expectations and
strengthening of wage pressure and thus it would mitigate the risk of inflation running
above the NBP inflation target in the medium term.

The Council rejected the motion to raise the reference rate by 15 basis points.
The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at

0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and
the discount rate at 0.12%.
