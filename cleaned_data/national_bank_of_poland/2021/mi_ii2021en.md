# Minutes of the Monetary Policy Council decision-making 

 meeting held on 3 February 2021

During the discussion the Council members pointed out that – as COVID19

infections increased and sanitary restrictions were tightened again – the global recovery
had slowed down in 2020 Q4. In particular, attention was drawn to the fact that
according to preliminary data, GDP in the euro area had fallen in that period, although
less than in 2020 Q2, and in January 2021, faced with the risk of another wave of
infections, some European countries had extended or tightened the existing pandemic
restrictions. It was pointed out that the extension or tightening of the restrictions had
adversely affected the sentiment of economic agents and might delay and reduce the
scale of the expected economic recovery in the external environment of the Polish
economy. At the same time, it was underlined that although a downturn in the services
sector continued, the situation in industry and international trade was relatively good.

The Council members stressed that inflation in the global economy remained low.

At the same time, certain Council members observed that in January 2021 there had been
a marked increase in inflation in Germany. It was pointed out that this had largely
resulted from the expiry of the temporary cuts in VAT rates in that country. In the
context of price developments in the external environment of the Polish economy,
attention was drawn to the rise in global oil prices in recent months. The increase in
these prices was driven by an improvement in sentiment due to the launch of the
vaccination programmes and the announcement of an additional stimulus package for
the US economy, which had boosted expectations regarding a rebound in global
economic activity at the beginning of 2021. Moreover, it was emphasised that countries
associated in OPEC+ were continuing the policy of limiting oil production, counteracting
the excessive growth in supply of this commodity, which also translated into higher
prices. It was pointed out that in the long term the global supply of oil might be affected,
on the one hand, by the likely change in climate policy in the United States, and on the
other hand, by the possible easing or lifting sanctions imposed on certain oil producers.

The Council members underlined that the major central banks were continuing their

highly expansionary monetary policy, including maintaining low interest rates and
purchasing assets on a large scale. In particular, the Council members drew attention to
the fact that the Federal Reserve of the United States announced it would conduct an
accommodative monetary policy until an improvement in activity was seen in the data,
and not only in the forecasts. Furthermore, the Fed had been clearly indicating that it
would aim for inflation to exceed its inflation target for some time in the future. The
European Central Bank also stressed its commitment to maintain all its current
measures, including conducting asset purchases on a large scale and maintaining
negative interest rates in subsequent years.

When referring to the Polish economy, it was pointed out that the rise in COVID-19

infections and the tightening of the epidemic restrictions in 2020 Q4 had had a negative
impact on economic activity in this period, which was particularly noticeable in part of
the services sector. The Council members indicated that taking into account the
preliminary estimate of GDP for 2020 and assuming no revision of GDP data for 2020
Q1-Q3, it could be estimated that in 2020 Q4 there had been another fall in GDP,
although its scale was significantly smaller than in 2020 Q2. It was pointed out that the
decline in activity had been driven by a fall in consumption and investment. The Council
members drew attention to the still lower level of average employment in the enterprise
sector than a year earlier, and a rise in the annual growth in average wages in this sector.
At the same time, some Council members pointed out that in December there had been
an increase in growth in construction and assembly output and industrial output,
including in the export sectors.

The Council members judged that according to the current forecasts following the fall

in GDP in 2020, in 2021 there would be a recovery in economic activity, which might
even be somewhat stronger than earlier estimated. Alongside that, it was pointed out
that data from the beginning of the year did not suggest that the recovery had already
begun, although the situation in individual sectors varied. The Council members also
underlined that the scale and timing of the recovery would depend, above all, on the
epidemic situation and the related restrictions. The further course of the pandemic and
its impact on the economic situation in Poland and abroad would remain the key sources
of uncertainty for the economic outlook in Poland, while it would take time to see the
impact of the vaccination process on the pandemic and the economy. At the same time, it
was observed that the economic policy measures taken so far, including NBP’s monetary
policy easing, and in the longer term also funds from the European Union, would
continue to have a positive impact on the economic situation.

When discussing price developments, the Council members pointed out that data on

inflation in December were evidence that consumer price growth at the end of 2020 was
running at a level consistent with the NBP’s inflation target, and was close to 2.5%. Some
Council members judged that according to current forecasts, in 2021 inflation would rise
somewhat compared to December, but despite this it would remain within the band of
deviations from the inflation target.

These Council members underlined that the forecast increase in annual CPI would

be due to the rise in global oil prices and the base effects in fuel prices. Moreover, as in
2020, inflation would be boosted by regulatory factors, above all by higher electricity
prices and waste disposal charges, which are negative supply shocks. These Council
members pointed out that regulatory factors would be responsible for over 1 percentage
point of inflation. At the same time, the further development of global oil prices
remained a risk factor for inflation; however, it was a factor beyond the control of
monetary policy.

Certain Council members underlined that due to the significance of oil for price

developments in the economy, their pass-through to the remaining consumer prices
should be carefully observed. Moreover, these Council members pointed out that
inflation might be boosted by the materialisation of pent-up demand and the launch of
large infrastructure investments. Certain Council members the risk of an increase in
inflation was also evidenced by a rise in producer prices.

When assessing the outlook for economic activity and inflation in Poland in the

coming quarters, the Council members drew attention to the significance of the zloty
exchange rate. It was underlined that adjustment of the exchange rate was one of the
basic mechanisms acting as a shock absorber for the domestic economy. The majority of
the Council members reiterated that the lack of a visible and more durable zloty
exchange rate adjustment might reduce the pace of the economic recovery. These
Council members judged that the interventions in the foreign exchange market
conducted since December 2020 – aimed at diminishing pressure on the appreciation of
the zloty due to further monetary policy easing by the major central banks – had lowered
the risk of a procyclical strengthening of the zloty and enhanced the impact of NBP’s
monetary policy easing on the economy.

The majority of the Council members also underlined that due to the relatively high

share of domestic value added in exports compared to other countries of the region, the
depreciation of the zloty would clearly improve the economic situation. It was observed
that Polish exports were less import-intensive than in other economies of Central and
Eastern Europe and as a result they were more vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations.
Furthermore, the position of Poland in the structure of the global supply chains makes
the impact of the exchange rate significant for the competitiveness of the country’s
producers. These Council members pointed out that the sharp increase in the role of
services in Poland’s foreign trade had a positive effect on the exchange rate pass-through
on GDP growth. Certain Council members expressed the opinion that while the impact
of a zloty depreciation on exports growth was positive, currently it was weaker than in
the past.

The Council members underlined that NBP’s monetary policy easing in 2020 had

been accompanied by a decline in bond yields and the full pass-through of cuts in NBP
interest rates to interest rates on loans to households and enterprises. In effect,
households and enterprises had received significant support, both through measures
related to the anti-crisis shields and through a reduction in loan instalments. Some
Council members also pointed out that the significant financial resources received by
many firms in the form of state aid had driven a strong rise in their deposits, which
along with uncertainty about the future economic conditions, had reduced demand for
corporate loans. At the same time, certain Council members drew attention to the fact
that amid keeping interest rates low – which was accompanied by a decrease in interest
rates on deposits – a marked increase in the prices of other assets, including real estate
prices, was noticeable.

While discussing monetary policy, the Council members were of the opinion that at

the present meeting interest rates should be kept unchanged and the remaining NBP’s
measures should be continued.

The majority of the Council members judged that if economic recovery progressed

in 2021 and price growth was in line with the inflation target, it would also be advisable
to keep interest rates unchanged in the subsequent quarters. At the same time, in the
opinion of these Council members, if the economic conditions and outlook were to
deteriorate significantly, e.g. due to a new surge in the pandemic, further monetary
policy easing might be justified, including by a reduction in the interest rate.

Certain Council members believed that, should further easing of monetary

conditions be necessary, a further cut in NBP interest rates would not be advisable and
instead additional measures aimed at supporting corporate lending should be
implemented.

Certain Council members argued that should a sharp rise in inflationary pressure

appear in the coming quarters, it might be advisable to consider raising NBP interest
rates in the second half of 2021.

It was observed that NBP’s monetary policy mitigated the negative impact of the

pandemic, supported economic activity and stabilised inflation at a level consistent with
NBP's medium-term inflation target. Due to its positive impact on the financial situation
of debtors, it was also conducive to the strengthening of financial system stability.

The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at

0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%,
and the discount rate at 0.12%.
