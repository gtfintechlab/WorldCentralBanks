# Minutes of the Monetary Policy Council decision-making

 meeting held on 8 July 2021

At the Council meeting it was pointed out that June had seen a reduction in the scale

of the pandemic globally and the number of new infections was less than half the spring
figure. As a result, the sanitary restrictions were being gradually eased in many countries.
At the same time, it was observed that the spread of new mutations of the virus had caused
increased uncertainty about the further course of the pandemic. This uncertainty was
boosted by the still relatively low vaccination rate in many countries and the lower effectiveness of vaccinations against the new variants of the virus. It was pointed out that in
some countries – even those with a high number of vaccinated people – the number of
infections with the new variant of the virus was increasing, which was contributing to the
reintroduction of certain restrictions.

The gradual easing of sanitary restrictions in many economies supported a marked

rebound of global economic activity following the earlier deep recession. It was pointed
out that the improvement in business conditions in services in many countries was accompanied by further growth in industrial sector activity alongside the occurrence of supply
restrictions in certain markets.

It was observed that in the euro area 2021 Q2 had brought an increase in industrial

activity and also a rebound in turnover in trade and services after a fall in GDP in 2021 Q1.
The majority of the Council members underlined that the high growth in industrial and
construction and assembly output, as well as in retail sales in this economy, was to a large
extent the result of the low base effect. They drew attention to the fact that economic activity in the euro area remained lower than before the pandemic and that the available
forecasts suggested that a full recovery in GDP would not take place until 2022. The opinion was expressed that it would not be possible to declare the negative effects of the pandemic completely eliminated until the macroeconomic indicators had returned permanently to the level determined by the pre-pandemic trend.

When referring to the global economic outlook, it was judged that the further devel
opment of the pandemic represented a risk factor for the sustainability of the currently
observed recovery in global economic activity. It was pointed out that although successive
waves of the pandemic had had a smaller impact on the economic situation, any new increase in the number of infections could slow down the economic recovery, particularly if
the new wave was accompanied by a deterioration in consumer and business sentiment.

It was judged that the global recovery was contributing to an increase in commodity

prices in the global markets, including oil prices, which were significantly higher than a
year earlier. Certain Council members expressed the opinion that in view of the expected
further increase in demand for oil, the price of this commodity would most likely continue

to rise. However, the majority of the Council members were of the opinion that even in
the face of growing demand, growth in oil prices should slow down.

High commodity prices alongside with rising costs of international transport and the

price effects of constraints in the supply of certain intermediate goods would boost inflation in the global economy, including in the developed economies. Some Council members
underlined that global inflation had risen by approximately 2 percentage points between
January and May, to reach its highest level in a decade. These Council members observed
that inflation in the United States had also risen sharply since the beginning of the year.

During the discussion it was pointed out that despite the significant increase in infla
tion, the major central banks were keeping interest rates low, conducting asset purchases
as well as signalling that loose monetary policy would be maintained in the future. It was
also observed that such measures were justified by the temporary character of the factors
currently boosting inflation, and the persistence of uncertainty about the future economic
outlook. It was pointed out that the majority of financial market participants also judged
the higher level of price growth to be temporary, as evidenced by the decline in long-term
inflation expectations and bond yields in the largest developed economies. Certain Council members drew attention to the fact that at its June meeting the Federal Reserve of the
United States had raised its interest rate on excess reserve balances by 0.05 percentage
points to 0.15% in order to increase the effectiveness of the monetary policy implementation. At the same time, the majority of the Council members underlined that this decision
was of a technical nature. They also observed that it did not represent a change in the
monetary policy stance.

Certain Council members pointed out that in response to heightened inflation, some

central banks in the region of Central and Eastern Europe, i.e. the central banks of the
Czech Republic and Hungary, had recently raised interest rates. However, the majority of
the Council members pointed out that such decisions were partly dictated by factors specific to these economies and a different assessment of the economic outlook and course of
future price developments.

When assessing the situation in Poland, the Council members pointed out that recent

months had seen a marked recovery in economic activity. Retail sales had risen significantly in May, accompanied by a slight rise in construction and assembly output and the
continued good situation in industry. Certain Council members expressed the opinion that
these data, along with the good export performance, indicated a very favourable situation
in the Polish economy. However, the majority of the Council members noted that the high
levels of annual economic indicators were the combined effect of three factors – the rebound in economic activity following the easing of the sanitary restrictions, the realisation
of pent-up demand, and the effect of a low base a year ago – and should be interpreted
with caution. These Council members underlined that while industrial output had already
exceeded its pre-pandemic level, construction and assembly output remained significantly
lower.

While analysing the labour market situation, the Council members underlined that it

remained good. They pointed out that in May, along with the easing of the restrictions,
average employment in the enterprise sector had increased. It was judged that the smaller
use of care and sickness benefits, the return of working hours to pre-pandemic levels, and
also the rising number of employees hired in the sectors most affected by the pandemic
restrictions contributed to this growth in employment. Certain Council members pointed
out that growth in demand for labour was accompanied by wage pressure reflected in
relatively high wage growth in the enterprise sector. In turn, the majority of the Council
members expressed the opinion that the labour market situation was not generating excessive wage pressure, and that wage growth in the enterprise sector – after adjustment
for the low base effect – remained lower than before the pandemic. Moreover, these Council members observed that wage growth did not exceed labour productivity growth and
as a result annual growth in unit labour costs in industry was negative.

The Council members underlined that NBP’s July projection indicated a very favour
able domestic economic outlook. The majority of the Council members were of the opinion
that the economic developments in the coming quarters were subject to considerable uncertainty, primarily related to the future course of the pandemic. These Council members
observed that it could not be ruled out that a possible new increase in the number of infections and the consequent reintroduction of restrictions would translate into a weakening of economic growth. The majority of the Council members also pointed out that the
positive impact of pent-up demand on consumption observed so far might be short-lived
and that growth in consumer spending might slow down later in the year. These Council
members also underlined that in a situation in which the rebound in economic activity
was weakening, the labour market situation might begin to deteriorate, particularly in
view of the termination of assistance from the anti-crisis shields. In turn, certain Council
members judged that continued high GDP growth which was forecast for the coming
quarters was highly likely, taking into account the very good situation in industry, the
rapid growth in exports, and the significant household savings. These Council members
expressed the opinion that in view of the significant number of people vaccinated and the
progressive adaptation of economic entities to operating amid a pandemic, any further
waves of infections would not represent a significant risk factor for rapid economic
growth.

At the Council meeting it was pointed out that according to the GUS preliminary data,

June saw a fall in annual CPI to 4.4% (in monthly terms CPI stood at 0.1%). At the same
time, according to preliminary estimates, core inflation excluding food and energy prices
declined to its lowest level for over a year. The majority of Council members underlined
that the annual CPI inflation rate continued to be boosted by rapid growth in fuel prices –
due to significantly higher global oil prices than a year earlier – the increase in electricity
prices, which took place at the beginning of 2021, and the increase in waste disposal
charges, and thus by factors which were beyond the control of domestic monetary policy.
They observed that inflation was also driven up by the higher costs of running a business

amidst the pandemic, higher international transport charges and temporary disruptions
in global supply chains. In this context, these Council members drew attention to the fact
that according to the full data for May, the increase in fuel prices and of in administered
prices accounted for over half of the CPI inflation rate. As a result, the majority of the
Council members judged that demand factors were not causing excessive price growth
and not causing inflation to exceed the inflation target.

In turn, certain Council members drew attention to the fact that demand factors ac
counted for almost half of the observed growth in the prices of consumer goods. Moreover,
they underlined that the persistence of elevated inflation might lead to an increase in inflation expectations. The majority of the Council members observed that balance statistics
describing consumers’ inflation expectations had recently shifted towards lower price
growth.

The majority of the Council members judged that as a result of factors beyond the

influence of domestic monetary policy, annual inflation in the coming months was likely
to remain above the upper limit of deviations from the inflation target. These Council
members were of the opinion that, as indicated by NBP’s July projection, in 2022, following
the fading of the factors temporarily boosting price growth, inflation would decline. t the
same time, these Council members pointed out that the scale of the decline in inflation
would depend on the development of the future economic situation, while even amid a
very positive economic scenario as outlined in the projection, inflation would return to the
band of deviations from the inflation target. The majority of the Council members drew
attention to the fact that in accordance with the projection, over the whole of its horizon
price growth would remain significantly lower than wage growth, including growth in
the minimum wage, which would translate into a marked improvement in the financial
situation of households and would limit the build-up of wage pressure.

Certain Council members underlined that the July projection pointed to a higher in
flation path in 2022 than the previous projection and showed only a temporary decline in
price growth in 2022 and another increase in 2023. These Council members were of the
opinion that with the continued favourable economic situation and in view of the gradual
realisation of pent-up demand, in the coming quarters demand pressure would build up.
In the opinion of these Council members, this might lead to inflation running at an elevated level in 2022 as well.

The majority of the Council members were of the opinion that lending growth was

not contributing to inflation rising above NBP’s inflation target. It was also observed that
the rate of growth in deposits of the non-financial sector remained higher than the growth
of liabilities of this sector.

The majority of Council members were of the opinion that the present meeting should

keep interest rates unchanged and continue to pursue NBP’s remaining measures. These
Council members judged that the monetary policy conducted by NBP supported the consolidation of economic recovery following the pandemic-induced recession and stabilised
inflation at the level consistent with NBP’s inflation target in the medium term. They drew

attention to the fact that keeping NBP interest rates unchanged was currently justified due
to the sources and the expected temporary nature of inflation exceeding NBP’s target, as
well as the uncertainty about the robustness and scale of the economic recovery.

The majority of Council members judged that if the uncertainty about the further

course of the pandemic, and – as a result – the future economic conditions continued, and
if the rise in inflation above the target was the result of factors beyond the control of monetary policy, it would be advisable to keep interest rates unchanged also in the near future.
In their opinion, the tightening of monetary conditions in response to inflation running
above the inflation target due to negative supply shocks and regulatory factors would not
curb price growth in 2021, while it could halt economic recovery following a considerable
economic downturn caused by the pandemic.

Some Council members judged that if, after the uncertainty about the pandemic situ
ation and the economic outlook had subsided, robust economic growth continued and
inflation, driven by demand factors, exceeded NBP’s inflation target, it might be advisable
to adjust monetary policy.

Certain Council members were of the opinion that the NBP reference rate should be

raised at the current meeting. They drew attention to the fact that price growth was currently elevated and that demand factors were also boosting prices. They also judged that
heightened inflation expectations and wage pressure might lead to the consolidation of
inflation above NBP’s target. They underlined that according to July projection inflation
would stay above 2,5% over the whole forecast horizon and in some quarters would exceed to upper limit of deviations from the target. In the opinion of these Council members,
an increase in the reference rate could reduce such a risk and support the development of
inflation at a level consistent with NBP’s inflation target.

The Council rejected the motion to raise the reference rate by 15 basis points.
The Council rejected the motion to increase the required reserve ratio to 3.5% and the

motion to lower the interest rate on required reserves from the level of the NBP reference
rate (currently 0.1%) to 0.01%.

The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at

0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%,
and the discount rate at 0.12%.
