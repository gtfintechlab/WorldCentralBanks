# Minutes of the Monetary Policy Council decision-making 

 meeting held on 3 March 2021

During the discussion the Council members pointed out that the surge of the

pandemic and the related restrictions had had a negative impact on global economic
activity in 2020 Q4 and at the beginning of 2021. Attention was drawn to the fact that the
euro area had slipped into recession again in 2020 Q4. It was observed that available data
on the economic situation at the beginning of 2021 pointed to a continued downturn in
the services sector, with a further rise in industrial output. At the same time it was
underlined that the negative impact of weakened activity in services on the overall
economic situation was so significant that 2021 Q1 would most likely see a fall in GDP in
quarterly terms. Moreover, the majority of the Council members underlined that even
under the assumption of an improvement in the pandemic situation in the second half of
the current year, the forecasts indicated only a moderate economic growth in the euro
area for the whole of 2021.

The Council members pointed out that despite slight rise in some countries in

January, inflation in the global economy was low. The majority of the Council members
emphasised that in January and February inflation in the euro area had increased, but
the rise had taken place after half a year of deflation, and the increase in price growth
was largely the result of regulatory factors, including the hike in the VAT rates in
Germany (after their temporary lowering in the second half of 2020). Inflation had also
been boosted by the rise in commodity prices in the global markets in recent months,
including in particular the rise in oil prices. Certain Council members judged that the
rising prices of this commodity reflected an optimistic assessment of the outlook for
global demand by investors, supported by the progress of the COVID-19 vaccination
programmes and the highly expansionary economic policy in many countries. They
pointed out that oil prices would also be boosted by the implementation of the policy of
limiting oil production by the countries associated in OPEC+ and the temporary increase
in demand for oil as a result of unfavourable meteorological conditions in Europe and in
some areas of the United States. Certain Council members expected that a further
increase in oil prices was likely in the nearest future.

The Council members underlined that the major central banks were continuing their

highly expansionary monetary policy, including maintaining low interest rates and
continuing asset purchases. The majority of Council members drew attention to the fact
that the ECB had announced the continued monetary support even after the end of the
pandemic and the economic crisis. The ECB had also announced that it would not adjust
its monetary policy in response to the current, temporary rise in inflation. Also, the
Federal Reserve of the United States reiterated that it would conduct an accommodative
monetary policy until an improvement was seen in the achievement of the bank’s
objectives.

When referring to the Polish economy, it was pointed out that preliminary data on

national accounts for 2020 Q4 confirmed that GDP had fallen in this period. Activity had
declined under the influence of a fall in consumption and lower investment than a year
ago However, the scale of the fall in GDP had been limited by the positive impact of net
exports.

The majority of the Council members judged that at the beginning of 2021 the

economic conditions in Poland remained weakened, with the situation varying between
sectors. It was observed that incoming data pointed to the continued, relatively good
situation in industry, particularly in sectors oriented to exports. At the same time, it was
underlined that industrial output growth had declined in January, while production
oriented to the domestic market had risen much slower than export production. It was
judged that along with the fall in retail sales, this suggested a weakening of domestic
demand, which was limited by the restrictions in force. It was pointed out that this was
accompanied by a fall in construction and assembly output in January.

The Council members judged that the situation in the labour market remained

favourable. However, it was observed that in January it had deteriorated somewhat, as
was indicated by the fall in average employment in the enterprise sector in this period.

The Council members observed that a rise in economic activity was expected in 2021,

although the scale and speed of the recovery were uncertain. The further course of the
pandemic and its impact on the economic situation in Poland and abroad continued to
be the main source of uncertainty. It was underlined that according to NBP’s March
projection, following the fall in GDP in 2021 Q1, the following quarters would see
growth in economic activity supported by rising exports and a strengthening of domestic
demand. It was observed that the economic policy measures implemented so far,
including the easing of NBP’s monetary policy and the expected recovery in the global
economy, would have a positive impact on the economic situation. In 2022 GDP growth
would be additionally supported by the inflow of European Union funds, and – in line
with NBP’s March projection – economic growth would be higher than in 2021.

The majority of Council members judged that the risk for the realisation of the

forecast scenario of GDP growth was currently high. They underlined that the pace of
the improvement in the domestic economy would depend not only on the further course
of the pandemic, but also on the response of economic entities to the normalisation of the
epidemic situation, particularly in regard to savings and investment. Moreover, these
Council members observed that the pace of the economic recovery in Poland might be
reduced by the lack of a visible and more durable zloty exchange rate adjustment to the
global pandemic shock and to the monetary policy easing introduced by NBP.

When discussing price developments, the Council members pointed out that

according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, inflation stood at 2.7% y/y in January. It
was observed that the slight increase in price growth compared to December 2020 was
almost entirely the result of faster growth in energy prices, related to an increase in
administered tariffs for electrical energy and higher global oil prices. It was underlined


-----

that these factors were negative supply shocks and were beyond the control of domestic
monetary policy.

Council members observed that in the coming months, with price growth being

boosted by the base effect in fuel prices and the current increase in global oil prices,
inflation might pick up. The majority of Council members pointed out that in the whole
2021 regulatory factors, such as the rise in the price of electricity and in waste disposal
charges, would continue to drive inflation up. Those members also stressed that those
were factors beyond the scope of monetary policy control. They also observed that
despite the expected improvement in economic conditions, the output gap in 2021 would
remain negative, constraining inflation growth.

Referring to the prospects for inflation in the subsequent years, it was pointed out

that they were surrounded with considerable uncertainty. It was pointed out that
according to the central path of the March projection, inflation was expected to be
slightly lower in 2022 than this year and run at 2.8%, while in 2023 it might increase to
3.2%, as the previous recovery in activity gradually fed into prices.

The majority of Council members observed that, should epidemic developments

take an undesirable course, activity might take longer to rebound than currently
expected, which would also postpone the anticipated rise in the demand pressure. At the
same time, those members expressed the view that as economic activity recovered and
the impact of the pandemic faded, factors that had acted to limit price growth in earlier
years would resurface, including the increasing globalisation of services and mounting
competition in the global economy. In the opinion of the majority of the Council
members, inflation might be additionally curbed by the increase in the automation and
digitalisation of production of goods and some services related to the pandemic crisis.

Certain Council members, on the other hand, assessed that inflation might prove

higher than forecast, due to, among other things, the realisation of pent-up demand after
the restrictions had been lifted. Certain Council members also argued that price growth
might be boosted by constraints on the supply of commodities and raw materials amid
a rise in demand for semi-products during the economic recovery. These members also
judged that the changes in the global value chains might be permanent, and hence their
operation after the pandemic would not be a factor dampening price growth.

Council members assessed that the activities of NBP taken so far, aimed at reducing

the economic cost of the pandemic, had been effective. They highlighted the relatively
strong GDP data for 2020, according to which the decline in GDP in Poland was less than
half the average of EU countries. They also underlined that despite the considerable scale
of the shock, the situation in the labour market remained good, as indicated by the still
low unemployment rate and continued relatively rapid wage growth, also in real terms.
Furthermore, they observed that the fairly favourable financial situation of Polish firms
and households was demonstrated by the substantial increase in the funds held on their
bank accounts.

While discussing monetary policy, Council members were of the opinion that at the

current meeting interest rates should be kept unchanged and the remaining measures of
NBP should be continued.

The majority of the Council members judged that if economic recovery progressed

in 2021 and price growth in medium term was in line with the inflation target, it would
also be advisable to keep interest rates unchanged in the subsequent quarters. At the
same time, in the opinion of these Council members, if the economic conditions and
outlook were to deteriorate significantly, e.g. due to a new surge in the pandemic,
further monetary policy easing might be justified, including by a reduction in the interest
rate.

Certain Council members believed that, should further easing of monetary

conditions be necessary, a further cut in the NBP interest rates would not be advisable
and instead additional measures aimed at supporting corporate lending should be
implemented. In the opinion of these Council members NBP should exert greater impact
on the longer end of yield curve in order to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy
in limiting the increase in yields on government bonds and government-guaranteed debt
securities.

Certain Council members argued that should a sharp rise in inflationary pressure

appear in the coming quarters, it might be advisable to consider raising NBP interest
rates in the second half of 2021. At the same time, the majority of Council members
emphasised that the experience of other central banks pointed to a strong negative
economic impact of tightening monetary policy too quickly.

It was observed that NBP’s monetary policy mitigated the negative economic impact

of the pandemic, supported economic activity and stabilised inflation at the level
consistent with NBP’s medium-term inflation target. Due to its positive impact on the
financial situation of debtors, it was also conducive to the strengthening of financial
system stability.

The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at

0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%,
and the discount rate at 0.12%.
