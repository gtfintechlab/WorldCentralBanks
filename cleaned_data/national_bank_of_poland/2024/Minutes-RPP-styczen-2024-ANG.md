# Minutes of the Monetary Policy Council decision-making meeting held

 on 9 January 2024

At the meeting, it was noted that the global economic conditions remained weakened,

although they varied across the major economies. It was emphasized that stagnation

tendencies continued in the euro area. The subsequent quarters were expected to see a

certain recovery in this economy, yet it was likely to be slow. By contrast, the economic

situation in the United States remained favourable. It was also pointed out that the pace

of economic recovery in China was limited. It was indicated that uncertainty regarding

the outlook for global economic activity – including uncertainty related to the geopolitical

situation – persisted.

It was underlined that disinflationary processes continued in the external environment of

the Polish economy, although in many countries inflation remained elevated. It was also

pointed out that in December 2023 the annual growth in the prices of consumer goods in

the euro area rose, yet it resulted mainly from the statistical base effects of energy prices.

At the same time, core inflation in the euro area continued to decline. It was pointed out

that inflation was also declining in many Central and Eastern European economies.

The Council members indicated that most central banks in advanced economies had been

keeping interest rates unchanged. In turn, in the region of Central and Eastern Europe,

central banks of the Czech Republic and Hungary had recently cut interest rates.

At the meeting it was observed that the Polish economy was on a gradual recovery path.

After a rise in October 2023, the annual growth of retail sales and industrial output fell

below zero in November 2023, yet remained above the average recorded in previous

months. At the same time, construction and assembly production continued to grow. It

was also emphasized that in 2023 Q4 consumer and business sentiment indicators had

been better than in previous quarters. Consequently, the Council members judged that in

2023 Q4 the annual GDP growth had probably picked up, although remained relatively

low. Certain Council members drew attention to the uncertainty regarding the impact of

migration flows between Poland and Ukraine on consumption growth.

While analysing the labour market situation, the Council members noted that it remained

good, as reflected, in particular, in the low unemployment rate. It was pointed out that in

recent months the annual nominal wage growth in the enterprise sector remained

elevated. Alongside that, it was observed that increase in the minimum wage, as well as

salary increases for public sector employees in 2024 would contribute to a higher wage

growth in the economy. It was also noted that although the number of working persons

remained high, the annual employment growth in the enterprise sector in November 2023

was again slightly negative. At the same time, the number of job vacancies in the economy

at the end of 2023 Q3 was markedly smaller than a year before.

According to the majority of the Council members, the effects of the previous NBP

monetary policy tightening were still observed in the credit market. The ratio of bank

credit to the non-financial private sector to GDP was 15 percentage points lower than

before the pandemic. Some members of the Council pointed out that the annual growth in

household and corporate loans remained negative. Yet, it was emphasized that from

month to month banks granted more and more loans to households, including especially

mortgages. This was significantly supported by the so-called “2% Safe Mortgage”

programme. The Council Members noted that although the statutory limit of subsidies

under this programme had been exhausted, new solutions had been announced, which –

if put in place – might continue to contribute to a rise in housing loans. Certain Council

members also paid attention to the fact that the annual growth in housing loans

denominated in PLN, as well as consumer loans, was positive.

At the meeting it was pointed out that – according to the data available at that time, i.e.

the Statistics Poland flash estimate – the annual inflation rate declined to 6.1% in December

2023. It was noted that these data were lower than the market expectations. It was

emphasised that the annual price growth in December was almost three times lower than

the peak seen in February 2023. It was observed that when taking into account the Statistics

Poland data, it might be estimated that in December core inflation fell for the ninth

consecutive month. Certain Council members underlined that core inflation remained

elevated, although its decline in the past quarters was faster than previously forecasted.

The majority of the Council members assessed that the decline in inflation was driven not

only by the reduced cost pressure or statistical effects but also by the low demand

pressure. Those members pointed out that at present it was relatively difficult for

enterprises to raise prices, especially as consumers’ inflation expectations had fallen

sharply in recent quarters. On the other hand, certain Council members expressed the

opinion that entrepreneurs’ expectations regarding price increases – as well as inflation

forecasts formulated by financial sector analysts for 2025 – continued to be elevated.

Certain Council members judged that amid the fading of external shocks boosting price

growth, domestic factors started to play a more important role in inflation developments

in Poland. At the same time, the Council members judged that the decrease in inflation

was being supported by the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which was consistent

with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.

While discussing the short-term outlook for inflation in Poland, it was pointed out that a

further decline in price growth was expected in the coming months. It was also

emphasised that in 2024 Q1 inflation would probably be lower than predicted in the NBP’s

November projection. It was judged, that according to the current forecasts, the annual

price growth might decline below 3% in March 2024, i.e. to the level consistent with the

NBP inflation target of 2.5% +/-1 percentage point.

While discussing the longer-term outlook for inflation, the Council members underlined

that inflation developments in the subsequent quarters were subject to high uncertainty.

In this context, it was pointed out that in accordance with the draft Budget Act, zero VAT

rate on food products was supposed to be in place until the end of March 2024. Alongside

that, according to the current legal status, prices of gas, electricity and district heating for

households were to remain frozen until the end of June 2024. It was emphasized that

should higher VAT rate on food products be restored and energy prices raised, inflation

might rise significantly in the second half of 2024.

At the same time, it was noted, that uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery in

Poland and its impact on inflationary pressures persisted. It was also pointed out that in

particular higher wages in the public sector together with rising childcare benefits as well

as old-age and disability pensions would increase household income, thus contributing to

higher consumption, and, consequently, higher price growth. Some Council members also

drew attention to the uncertainty about external factors affecting inflation, including those

related to the future global economic conditions and commodity prices developments.

The Council members expressed an opinion that given the above mentioned factors which

were likely to affect CPI inflation in 2024, core inflation developments were of significant

importance for the assessment of domestic inflation processes.

The majority of the Council members assessed that despite the observed economic

recovery, demand and cost pressures in the Polish economy remained low, which amidst

the weakened economic conditions and falling inflation pressure abroad would support

lower price growth in Poland. In the first months of 2024, the annual CPI growth is likely

to fall significantly, while the decline in core inflation will be slower. However, inflation

developments in subsequent quarters are associated with high uncertainty, related in

particular to the impact of fiscal and regulatory policies on price developments, as well as

the pace of economic recovery in Poland. It was emphasized that should higher VAT rate

on food products be restored and energy prices raised, inflation might rise significantly in

the second half of 2024. At the same time, increases in salaries for public sector employees

and social benefits would contribute to higher inflation. Under these circumstances, the

Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. The Council judged that the

current level of the NBP interest rates was conducive to meeting the NBP inflation target

in the medium term.

Certain Council members expressed the opinion that given the persistently high annual

price growth and elevated inflation expectations, as well as amid the expected further

recovery in demand and the fiscal measures launched, the level of the NBP interest rates

was too low to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower

inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.

The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.75%,

the lombard rate at 6.25%, the deposit rate at 5.25%, the rediscount rate at 5.80%, and the

discount rate at 5.85%.

The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on

incoming information regarding the prospects for inflation and economic activity.
