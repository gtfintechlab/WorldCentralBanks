# Minutes of the Monetary Policy Council decision-making meeting held

 on 7 February 2024

At the meeting, it was noted that the euro area was stagnant in 2023 Q4 and GDP in

Germany had fallen. In contrast, economic conditions in the United States remained

favourable and the labour market situation was even better than expected. At the same

time, it was observed that the disinflation process was proceeding in the environment of

the Polish economy. In particular, core inflation in the largest advanced economies

continued to gradually decline and recently a significant fall in the global prices of most

energy commodities had also been recorded.

At the meeting, it was pointed out that – according to the Statistics Poland preliminary

estimate – GDP growth in Poland stood at 0.2% in 2023. The Council members indicated

that this implied a certain acceleration in GDP growth in 2023 Q4, which was in line with

the NBP November projection and was evidence of a gradual economic recovery. At the

same time, it was observed that monthly data for December showed a year-on-year decline

in retail sales, a fall – although smaller than market expectations – in industrial output,

and a strong rise in construction and assembly output. In turn, certain Council members

underlined that the situation in many industrial sections had been improving steadily for

several months.

Some Council members judged that the available data confirmed that despite the recovery,

GDP growth was still relatively subdued and significantly lower than the potential of the

Polish economy. In the opinion of these Council members, going forward the economic

recovery could be expected to continue – above all, due to the anticipated higher growth

in consumption – although its scale was subject to uncertainty. It was pointed out that

consumption growth would be boosted by the pick-up in growth of real household

income, amid lower inflation, which would be accompanied by an increase in the

minimum wage, indexation of social benefits and wage increases in the public sector. Yet,

some Council members judged that households’ efforts to rebuild savings could weigh

visibly on the outlook for consumer demand.

When referring to the labour market conditions, it was indicated that they were still good

as reflected, in particular, in the low unemployment rate. The scale of the fall in

employment in the enterprise sector was also slightly smaller in year-on-year terms.

Alongside that, certain Council members underlined that the number of people working

under other forms of employment relationship than an employment contract was rising.

At the same time, it was pointed out that in December 2023 annual nominal wage growth

in the enterprise sector had fallen below 10%, although it was argued that – taking into

account the minimum wage increases and the wage rises for public sector employees –

wage growth could rise significantly in 2024 Q1. Moreover, certain Council members

observed that at the end of 2023 real wage growth was higher than in previous quarters,

and was not accompanied by a marked improvement in labour productivity.

According to the majority of the Council members, the effects of NBP earlier monetary

policy tightening could still be seen in the credit market. In the opinion of these Council

members, this is particularly evidenced by the fact that the ratio of credit of the private

non-financial sector to GDP was much lower than before the pandemic. At the same time,

a recovery in the credit market was noted, which was attributable to the so-called “Safe

Mortgage” programme. Certain Council members also indicated a rise in the stock of both

consumer and corporate loans.

At the meeting, it was observed that the annual inflation rate in December 2023 had

declined to 6.2%, which meant that it was almost three times lower than its peak in

February 2023. The Council members underlined that the fall in the CPI index was not

only the result of lower commodity prices or statistical base effects, since the monthly

growth of the majority of price categories had declined to their long-term averages.

Additionally, it was noted that in December core inflation had fallen yet again, driven by

weakened demand pressure and the earlier monetary policy tightening, although it

remained elevated. Some Council members drew attention to the fact that in December

the fall in industrial producer prices had also deepened, which evidenced the fading of

the earlier external supply shocks and weak cost pressure. It was judged that the decline

in inflation was being supported by the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which was

consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.

When discussing the short-term inflation outlook in Poland, it was pointed out that a

further fall in price growth was expected at the beginning of 2024. As at the January

meeting, the Council members observed that in 2024 Q1 inflation would most likely be

lower than predicted in the NBP November projection. It was judged that according to

current forecasts, the CPI index might fall below 3% in March 2024, i.e. to a level consistent

with the NBP inflation target of 2.5% +/-1 percentage point. At the same time, the Council

members underlined that core inflation would also ease, although at a slower pace, and

consequently it would remain higher than headline inflation. In this context, the Council

members expressed the opinion that developments in core inflation were of significant

importance for the assessment of domestic inflation processes. Certain Council members

emphasised that a further marked fall in inflation at the beginning of 2024 – with

unchanged interest rates – would be a factor pushing up real interest rates.

When discussing the longer-term inflation outlook, the Council members upheld the

assessment that price dynamics in the coming quarters would depend on regulatory and

fiscal decisions and were subject to high uncertainty. It was pointed out that, according to

the current regulations, the zero VAT rate on food products was supposed to be in place

until the end of March 2024, while the prices of gas, electricity and district heating for

households were to remain frozen until the end of June 2024. It was observed that

assuming no increase in the VAT rate on food and unchanged energy prices until the end

of the year, inflation might remain at a level consistent with the NBP inflation target from

February until the end of 2024. However, should the VAT rate on food products be

restored from zero to 5% and should subsidies to energy prices be totally or partially

removed, inflation might rise significantly in the second half of 2024. Moreover, some

Council members drew attention to the fact that risks around the inflation path included

developments in commodity prices and the return of tensions in international trade due

to the situation in the Red Sea, which had caused a sharp increase in freight prices in recent

months.

Also, when discussing the longer-term outlook for core inflation, the Council members

underlined that uncertainty persisted about its further path, which was related to, in

particular, the pace of economic recovery in Poland and its impact on inflationary

pressure. Some Council members judged that the significant rise in public sector wages

would be a factor that could boost core inflation. This was because it would push up wage

growth in the whole economy as well as consumer demand. The implementation of other

fiscal measures, such as an increase in the tax-free allowance, could have a similar effect,

although some Council members emphasised that currently it was not clear whether and

to what degree these proposals would be implemented. In this context, certain Council

members pointed out that – particularly in view of the need for increased public

expenditure on the military and on energy transformation – the room for increasing the

expansiveness of fiscal policy was limited and rather consolidation policies should be

expected.

The majority of the Council members assessed that despite the observed economic

recovery, demand and cost pressures in the Polish economy remained low, which amidst

the weakened economic conditions and fading inflationary pressure abroad would

support lower price growth in Poland. In 2024 Q1, the annual CPI growth is likely to fall

significantly, while the decline in core inflation will be slower. However, inflation

developments in subsequent quarters are subject to high uncertainty, related in particular

to the impact of fiscal and regulatory policies on price developments, as well as the pace

of economic recovery in Poland. It was emphasised that should higher VAT rate on food

products be restored and energy prices raised, inflation might rise significantly in the

second half of 2024. At the same time, higher nominal wage growth, including due to

increases in public sector wages, would contribute to higher demand pressure in the

economy. Under these circumstances, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates

unchanged. The Council judged that the current level of the NBP interest rates was

conducive to meeting the NBP inflation target in the medium term.

Certain Council members expressed the opinion that given the persistently high annual

price growth and elevated inflation expectations, as well as amid the expected further

recovery in demand and the fiscal measures launched, the level of the NBP interest rates

was too low to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower

inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.

The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.75%,

the lombard rate at 6.25%, the deposit rate at 5.25%, the rediscount rate at 5.80%, and the

discount rate at 5.85%.

The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on

incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity.
