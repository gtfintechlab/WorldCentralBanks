# Minutes of the Monetary Policy Council decision-making

 meeting held on 8 January 2020

During the meeting, the Council pointed out that activity growth in the world economy

remained relatively weak, although signals concerning a possible trade agreement between
the United States and China had translated into some improvement of the sentiment in the
global economy at the end of 2019. Attention was also drawn to a slight increase in the global
manufacturing PMI and a slower decline in the global trade. Despite this, uncertainty about
the global economic outlook for the quarters to come persists. This uncertainty might be
aggravated by a rise in the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the risk of oil prices
rising further.

In the euro area, amid an ongoing downturn in industry, economic activity growth

remains slow. Confidence indicators for the industry and services sectors point to further
weak GDP growth in 2019 Q4. Growth is supported by consumption, which continues to
benefit from high consumer confidence and low unemployment. At the same time, it was
observed that in December the European Central Bank had again revised down its forecasts
of GDP growth for 2020.

In the United States, economic conditions are still fairly robust when compared to other

economies, although activity in the US industry also remains weak, and GDP growth
probably slowed down in 2019 Q4. In China, economic activity growth is slower than in
previous years, with data for November 2019 indicating GDP growth stabilisation in 2019
Q4.

Oil prices have risen recently. The increase in oil prices was initially driven by the

improvement in the sentiment concerning trade relations between the largest global
economies, and subsequently by a sharp rise in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. At
the same time, some Council members indicated that the supply of oil from the United States
was a factor alleviating the upward pressure on global prices of this commodity, which
curbed the impact of negative supply shocks in the oil market. Furthermore, it was observed
that despite higher oil prices, inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy
was moderate, and in the euro area it was low.

The European Central Bank is keeping the deposit rate below zero, while conducting

asset purchases and signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the coming
quarters. The US Federal Reserve, after the interest rate cuts of 2019, is keeping the rates
unchanged.

Proceeding to discuss the information from the Polish economy, the Council started by

assessing the economic situation in Poland in 2019. It was pointed out that GDP growth in
2019 had probably exceeded 4%, unemployment had dropped to a record-low level and
confidence indicators had been high. At the same time, it was emphasised that the zloty
exchange rate had been stable, the current account close to zero and lending growth slightly
below the nominal GDP growth. Moreover, public debt in relation to GDP had probably
decreased. Attention was also drawn to the fact that despite higher CPI at the end of the year,

the average annual inflation had stood at 2.3%. Council members underlined that the above
indicators confirmed that economic growth was robust and the economy remained balanced
both internally and externally.

When analysing recent months' data more closely, it was highlighted that economic

conditions in Poland remained good despite gradually slowing economic growth. GDP
growth is supported by stable consumption growth, fuelled by favourable labour market
conditions, very strong consumer confidence and disbursement of social benefits. At the
same time, the Council members observed that consumer confidence indicators had declined
somewhat in the recent period and signs of weakening labour demand had become apparent.
In this context, some Council members pointed to slower wage growth in enterprises in
recent months, although they also noted that raising the minimum wage at the beginning of
2020 would support wage growth. It was also underlined that incoming information
signalled further, albeit slower than in previous quarters, growth in investment and exports.
In this context, certain Council members highlighted the recent strengthening of the zloty
exchange rate, which, along with weaker export growth, might negatively affect the financial
performance of exporters.

When referring to inflation developments, it was observed that according to the GUS

flash estimate, the CPI stood at 3.4% y/y in December 2019. Available information showed
that the higher December inflation was driven by a rise in the prices of food and fuels. The
majority of the Council members assessed that core inflation might have increased as well,
which would have been related to higher prices of some services. Certain Council members
indicated that inflation in December had risen more than expected. These Council members
believed that apart from the likely impact of temporary factors, the increase in inflation might
have been driven by a gradual weakening of structural factors which had previously
constrained consumer price growth, especially that of goods. In this context, these Council
members pointed to a slowdown in the expansion of the discount chains.

The majority of the Council members argued that the higher-than-forecast preliminary

CPI reading for December did not affect the anticipated inflation path over the monetary
policy horizon. In their assessment, inflation would rise temporarily in 2020 Q1, to
subsequently start declining and approximate the inflation target in 2021. It was emphasised
that inflation in the next few years would be dampened by the expected slowing of economic
growth in Poland. Those Council members underlined that such a scenario was also
suggested by medium-term expectations of financial analysts. The majority of the Council
members also highlighted the fact that the temporary rise in inflation anticipated for 2020 Q1
would result mainly from factors beyond the scope of domestic monetary policy, including
regulatory factors and supply shocks. Factors boosting inflation would include higher
electricity prices (related to, among others, the climate policy) and more expensive fuels
(associated with higher global oil prices). Moreover, the anticipated rises in waste disposal
charges and the excise taxes on alcohol and cigarettes may temporarily heighten inflation as
well. The expansion of the ASF epidemic, in turn, along with other supply shocks, may
translate into higher food prices. Those Council members observed that the above factors,
apart from leading to a temporary rise in price growth, would also have a negative impact

on real incomes and the sentiment of businesses and households, thus putting downward
pressure on demand growth, which would in the medium term hamper the growth in the
prices of the remaining goods and services. Certain Council members drew attention to the
persistently slow producer price growth, and the recent appreciation of the zloty, as factors
weakening price pressure.

At the same time, certain Council members argued that the expected acceleration of

consumer price growth in 2020 might prove stronger than previously estimated. They
indicated that this may result in particular from possible further oil price growth and a
stronger pass-through of both rising wages and demand on prices, especially amid the rise
of the minimum wage. At this point, these Council members also drew attention to an
increase in households’ inflation expectations.

The majority of the Council members stressed that, faced with uncertainty about the

global economic outlook, a considerable number of central banks were currently conducting
loose monetary policies, which was a significant factor supporting economic conditions in
many countries. This means that the interest rates of a number of central banks – including
in particular the ECB – are negative in real terms and will most likely remain in negative
territory for a long time. At the same time, these Council members pointed out that although
the NBP reference rate in Poland was negative in real terms as well, the real interest rates on
household and corporate loans were positive, and the total credit growth in the economy
remained lower than nominal GDP growth, with corporate lending growth continuing to be
weak.

However, certain Council members underlined that the growth of both broad money

(M3) and household lending was currently higher than or close to nominal GDP growth.
Referring to corporate investment loans, these Council members judged that they were
characterised by low price elasticity, which meant that any possible increase in interest rates
on these loans would not have a strong impact on the investment outlays of companies.
Moreover, it was pointed out that inflation increase coupled with no NBP interest rate rises,
caused the NBP reference rate to decline in real terms.

Taking into account the current information and forecasts, the majority of the Council

members decided that interest rates should remain unchanged. In their opinion, the outlook
for the domestic economy remained favourable, yet GDP growth would most likely be lower
than in previous years. At the same time, the Council assessed that uncertainty as to the scale
and duration of the economic slowdown abroad and its impact on domestic economic
activity persisted. Moreover, the majority of the Council members judged that the factors that
would most likely boost CPI inflation in the coming months were mainly of a supply-side
and regulatory nature. Therefore they would have only a temporary impact on inflation,
while at the same time, they would put a drag on economic activity. As a result, along with
the expected slowdown in economic growth, inflation would stay close to the target over the
monetary policy transmission horizon. In the opinion of the majority of the Council
members, the current level of interest rates would hence be conducive to keeping the Polish
economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability, and would
at the same time allow meeting the inflation target in the medium term.

The majority of the Council members also expressed an opinion that, taking into account

current information, interest rates were likely to remain stable in the coming quarters. These
Council members pointed out that their assessment was supported by current forecasts
indicating that inflation would remain in line with the NBP inflation target over the monetary
policy horizon amid the forecast gradual slowing in GDP growth. In the opinion of these
Council members, considering lags in the monetary policy transmission mechanism, any
interest rate increase under the current conditions would not prevent a temporary rise in
inflation in 2020, while at the same time, could deepen the economic slowdown.

However, certain Council members emphasised that there were factors that might keep

inflation higher than indicated by the current forecasts. They noted that the risk of a further
rise in inflation and inflation expectations, combined with the small – in their opinion – scale
of the expected economic slowdown in Poland, could jeopardise meeting the inflation target
in the medium term, which justified – in their view – increasing interest rates at the current
meeting. According to these Council members, such a move would curb the rise in real estate
prices, contributing to increasing their affordability.

In turn, certain Council members pointed to signs indicating that global economic

conditions would continue to be weak. In the opinion of these Council members, this could
have a negative impact also on economic growth in Poland in the quarters to come. At the
same time, the risk of inflation deviating from the NBP target over the monetary policy
transmission horizon was limited. As a result, a view was expressed that it was justified to
lower interest rates at the current meeting and that – in the longer run – it might be justified
to consider further cuts in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary
policy instruments.

At the meeting, a motion to increase the NBP interest rates by 0.15 percentage points was

submitted. The motion was rejected. At the meeting, a motion to cut the NBP interest rates
by 0.25 percentage points was submitted. The motion was rejected. The Council decided to
keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%,
the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.
