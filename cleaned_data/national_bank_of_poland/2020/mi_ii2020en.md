# Minutes of the Monetary Policy Council decision-making

 meeting held on 5 February 2020

During the meeting, the Council noted that incoming data from the global economy

indicated a stabilisation of economic growth at a relatively low level. Despite a recent
improvement in sentiment, economic conditions in some economies remained weakened,
while available forecasts pointed to a stabilisation in global GDP growth or its merely
marginal pick-up in 2020 as compared to the previous year. At the same time, uncertainty
persists about the global economic outlook, related, among others, to the spreading-out of
coronavirus, whose impact on economic activity is hard to assess.

In the euro area, economic growth declined in 2019 Q4, amid the ongoing downturn in

industry. It was observed that the situation in the industrial sector remained unfavourable,
despite some rise in the PMI indicators. This has a negative impact on the outlook for growth
in the euro area, and current forecasts suggest that GDP growth in 2020 will be slightly lower
in that area than in the previous year. In the United States, economic conditions are still
relatively strong compared to other advanced economies. GDP in 2019 Q4 progressed at a
pace close to that of the previous quarter, although it continued to be held back by flagging
activity in industry. Certain Council members judged that the economic climate in this
economy might deteriorate, which, in their opinion, was indicated by the negative yield
differential between short- and long-term Treasury securities. In China, GDP growth
stabilised in 2019 Q4 at a lower level than in previous years.

In the recent period, global oil prices have fallen sharply, following their prior rise. This

was assessed to have been driven by concerns about a decline in demand for this commodity
in the subsequent quarters due to the potential adverse effect of the coronavirus on economic
activity growth in China. These concerns also brought about a fall in the prices of natural gas
and industrial metals. At the same time, the prices of many food commodities have risen in
recent months, and the food commodity price index is running high at the moment. The
increasingly expensive food and the previous rise in oil prices contributed to higher inflation
in the external environment of the Polish economy.

The European Central Bank is keeping the deposit rate below zero, while conducting

asset purchases and signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the coming
quarters. The US Federal Reserve, after the interest rate cuts of 2019, is keeping the rates
unchanged. Moreover, a number of central banks in large emerging market economies have
eased their monetary policy.

When analysing the situation in the Polish economy, it was observed that economic

conditions remained strong, although economic growth had slowed down. According to
preliminary GUS data on GDP in 2019, GDP growth in 2019 Q4 may be estimated to have
fallen by more than expected. GDP growth is supported by the rising consumption, which,
however, has probably slowed down notwithstanding the strong financial position of
households. Some Council members assessed that this could have followed from a slight
weakening of household sentiment. Certain Council members expressed the view that slower

real consumption growth might also have been driven by higher price growth than at the
beginning of 2019.

It was observed that preliminary GDP estimates suggested a possible pick-up in

investment growth in 2019 Q4. In this context, some Council members pointed to the
uncertainty about the pace of investment growth in 2019 Q4 related to weaker readings of
some sectoral data over the past few months.

According to preliminary estimates, export growth also continued in 2019 Q4, albeit

probably at a slower pace than in the preceding quarter. It was pointed out that export
growth was benefiting from strongly rising exports of services. Growth in external sales of
goods, on the other hand, had probably halted. It was judged that this was a sign of the
increasing impact of the weakened conditions in the external environment of the Polish
economy on external sales and domestic economic activity.

The Council members judged that given the slower than expected implied GDP growth

in 2019 Q4, economic growth in 2020 might also prove weaker than previously forecast and
slower than the estimated potential output growth. In this context, some Council members
drew attention to a recurring decline – following a few months of improvement – in the PMI
index and the results of the NBP surveys of enterprises signalling weaker expectations of
financial performance of firms and lower forecasts of their investment activity in 2020. They
also pointed out that the outlook for economic activity in Poland’s immediate environment
remained a significant source of risk of slower growth in the domestic economy.

When referring to inflation processes, it was observed that annual CPI inflation stood at

3.4% y/y in December 2019. An increase in price growth was driven, above all, by higher food
prices related to the spread of the ASF epidemic, combined with a rise in fuel prices on the
back of prior increases in global oil prices. At the same time, the rises in waste disposal
charges, insurance premiums and air fares were reflected in higher service price growth.
High growth of administered prices was also noted. As a consequence, core inflation also
rose, although it runs at moderate level. Some Council members expressed the opinion that
faster than in previous years growth in service prices was a natural and expected response
of the economy to several quarters of the ongoing expansion in consumer demand and
income. At the same time, it was pointed out that the prices of non-food products were still
rising slowly, rendering a still moderate total growth in goods and services prices excluding
the impact of supply-side and regulatory factors.

The Council members noted that according to current forecasts, inflation would rise in

the coming months and might exceed the upper limit of band for deviations from the
inflation target. It was observed that the rise in inflation was to be primarily the effect of
supply-side and regulatory factors, which were beyond the direct influence of domestic
monetary policy. These included the increase in the prices of electricity, further rises of waste
disposal charges, increase in excise taxes and rising meat prices resulting from the ASF
epidemic spreading out further and the related strongly rising demand from China for
European pork. The majority of the Council members pointed out that the rise in inflation
would be driven by supply shocks that negatively affect aggregate demand growth. In effect,
these Council members judged that the rise in inflation above the upper limit for deviations

from the inflation target would only be temporary, and as the impact of those factors faded,
and amid the anticipated weakening of economic growth, inflation would subside and return
close to the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon.

In turn, certain Council members argued that considering the persistence of some of the

factors increasing inflation, price growth might be higher than currently forecast. At the same
time, in those Council members’ opinion, the scale of economic slowdown would be limited
and thus would not weaken demand pressure substantially. Those Council members
assessed that in the face of the current heightened inflation there was a risk of mounting wage
pressure and the occurrence of second-round effects. As a consequence, although price
growth in the second half of 2020 will probably be lower than in the first half of the year,
according to these Council members it might continue above the inflation target over the
monetary policy horizon. Those Council members also observed that some measures of
inflation expectations of households and businesses had risen recently. They judged that the
rising inflation expectations of enterprises, amid lower profitability of their operations than
in previous years, might increase the propensity of firms to raise prices.

Yet the majority of the Council members noted that households’ and enterprises’ inflation

expectations were adaptive and their rise mainly reflected higher current inflation. It was
indicated that given the expected economic slowdown, the propensity and ability of firms to
raise prices would be limited. Furthermore, it was observed that financial analysts forecast
inflation to decline to around 2.5% next year.

The majority of the Council members pointed out that in the current global economic

conditions, real interest rates were at negative levels in many countries, including in all the
economies of Central and Eastern Europe, and that their level in Poland was among the
highest in the region. At the same time, these Council members noted that although the NBP
reference rate in Poland was negative in real terms, the real interest rate on loans to
households and corporations was significantly positive. They also emphasised that the
average interest rate on new loan agreements for households in Poland was currently one of
the highest of all the economies of the European Union. These Council members additionally
highlighted the recent marked slowdown in lending growth in the economy. They also
underlined that in 2019 the loan-to-GDP ratio had further declined.

However, certain Council members pointed out that – with no NBP interest rate increases

– the forecast rise in inflation would cause the NBP reference rate to decline in real terms to
a more negative level. Those Council members judged that the negative level of real interest
rates, in their opinion, was conducive to rapid lending growth, including in particular
lending growth in consumer loans to households. They also expressed the view that the low
level of real interest rates was responsible for the high growth in current deposits and also
increased demand for other, more risky assets, including real estate.

Taking into account current information and forecasts, the majority of the Council

members decided that interest rates should remain unchanged. In their opinion, the outlook
for the domestic economy remained favourable, yet GDP growth would be lower than in
previous years. At the same time, the Council assessed that uncertainty as to the scale and
duration of the economic slowdown abroad and its impact on domestic economic activity

persisted. The Council observed that according to current forecasts, in the coming months
inflation might exceed the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target. At the same
time, the factors that would most likely boost CPI inflation in the coming months were
mainly of a supply-side and regulatory nature. Therefore they would have only a temporary
impact on inflation, while at the same time they would put a drag on economic activity. As
a result, along with the expected slowdown in economic growth, inflation would decline and
return close to the target over the monetary policy transmission horizon. In the opinion of
the majority of the Council members, the current level of interest rates would hence be
conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining
macroeconomic stability, and would at the same time allow meeting the inflation target in
the medium term.

The majority of the Council members also expressed an opinion that, taking into account

current information, interest rates were likely to remain stable in the coming quarters. These
Council members pointed out that their assessment was supported by current forecasts
indicating that inflation would remain in line with the NBP inflation target over the monetary
policy horizon amid a more pronounced slowdown in GDP growth than previously forecast.
In the opinion of these Council members, considering lags in the monetary policy
transmission mechanism, any interest rate increase under the current conditions would not
prevent a temporary rise in inflation in 2020, but at the same time could deepen the economic
slowdown and cause inflation to fall below the target over the monetary policy horizon.

However, certain Council members judged that over the monetary policy horizon

inflation might be higher than indicated by the current forecasts. They pointed out that such
a risk was related to the possible persistence of some of the factors currently raising price
growth. In the opinion of these Council members, should incoming data and the projection
indicate an increase in this risk, it might be justified to raise interest rates in the coming
period.

In turn, certain Council members pointed to the increased risk of a sharper and more

lasting global economic slowdown, as well as to further signs indicating the transmission of
the weak global economic conditions into economic growth in Poland. At the same time, the
risk of inflation deviating from the NBP target over the monetary policy transmission horizon
was limited. As a result, a view was maintained that it was justified to lower interest rates
now and that – in the longer run – it might be justified to consider further cuts in interest
rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.

At the meeting, a motion to cut the basic NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points was

submitted. The motion was rejected. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates
unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%
and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.
