# Minutes from the Monetary Policy Council decision making 

 meeting held on 15 September 2020

The Council members pointed out that data on GDP in 2020 Q2 in many economies
confirmed a sharp drop in activity, including in the immediate environment of the Polish
economy. In particular, euro area GDP declined by 14.7% y/y. It was observed that
confidence in many economies had improved in July and August 2020 as the epidemic
restrictions had been relaxed. This was also supported by the introduced fiscal measures
and the accompanying easing of monetary policy. The Council members also judged
activity in this period to have been boosted by an increase in households’ demand for
goods and services that could not be satisfied earlier due to the restrictions.

The Council members emphasised that the global economic activity, in particular
industrial output in many economies and global trade, was still below the levels observed
before the onset of the pandemic. It was pointed out that current forecasts indicated an
improvement in global economic conditions in the second half of 2020, yet activity would
remain lower than before the pandemic. At the same time, it was underscored that
uncertainty persisted about the pace and robustness of the improvement in the global
economic conditions. The further path of the pandemic remained the key risk factor here. In
this context, the Council members observed that the number of new coronavirus infections
in the world was on the rise again, exceeding in many countries the March or April 2020
figures. As a result, some countries were opting for a restoration or tightening of epidemic
restrictions.

The Council members pointed out that according to current forecasts economic activity
in the largest economies, including in the Poland’s immediate environment, would
rebound to the pre-pandemic levels only in 2022. It was assessed at this point that global
economic activity in the subsequent quarters would be hampered by – besides increased
uncertainty – deteriorating labour market conditions, a decline in global trade and a rise in
debt, which, while helping to alleviate the impact of the economic crisis at the moment,
might drag on growth in the longer term.

According to current forecasts, global inflation is to remain low, which, apart from
depressed economic activity, will also be supported by the previous fall in global
commodity prices. In this context, it was pointed out that the annual price growth in the
euro area had dropped below zero in August.

The Council members observed that considering the above macroeconomic conditions,
the major central banks were signalling the maintenance of interest rates at a level close to
zero and continued asset purchases in the subsequent quarters. Against this background it
was emphasised that the Federal Reserve had recently de facto raised its inflation target for
the subsequent years, thus indicating it would not tighten its monetary policy for some
time to come.

In Poland, a marked decline in GDP occurred in 2020 Q2, albeit smaller than in many
other EU countries. Council members emphasised that despite the fall in both domestic

demand – including private consumption and investment – and exports, the decline in
GDP was smaller than forecast. At the same time, it was pointed out that in 2020 Q2, the
number of persons working in the economy had fallen and wage growth in the economy
had declined.

The Council members assessed that incoming data pointed to an improvement in
sentiment and a revival in economic activity in the past few months, even though GDP
would remain lower in 2020 Q3 than the year before. It was pointed out that the annual
growth in retail sales, industrial output and exports had turned positive by July, yet the
decline in construction and assembly output had deepened. It was highlighted that
business and consumer sentiment indicators had decreased in August, following their prior
rise. Certain Council members stressed that surveys of companies suggested that their
investment activity would remain limited. On the other hand, certain Council members
highlighted the fact that the expected rise in consumption and exports, coupled with the
implementation of infrastructure projects from public funds, would support investment.

The Council members were of the opinion that economic activity might be expected to
pick up further in the subsequent months. This would be supported by continued
improvement in the economic climate in the external environment of the Polish economy
and economic policy measures, including monetary easing by NBP. At the same time, it
was assessed that the scale of the recovery might be limited by uncertainty about the future
development and effects of the pandemic, which might have an adverse effect on
consumption, investment and lending. The Council members also observed that the scale of
economic recovery might be dampened by the lower wage growth and weaker business
sentiment than in previous years. The majority of the Council members judged in this
context that the risks to economic growth in the coming quarters were mostly tilted to the
downside. The majority of Council members were of the opinion that the pace of economic
growth might be also limited by the lack of a visible zloty exchange rate adjustment to the
global pandemic-driven shock and to the monetary easing introduced by NBP.

The Council members also emphasised that a key factor determining economic
conditions in the coming quarters would be the situation in the labour market. Against this
background, it was pointed out that wage growth had slowed down substantially in recent
months, while the decline in the number of working persons and the increase in
unemployment was limited. At this point, some Council members drew attention to the
fact that as the instruments of the anti-crisis shield were phased out, a greater adjustment to
the depressed demand in the economy might take place, which would have a negative
impact on household sentiment and consumption. In this context, it was pointed out that
the concerns of the surveyed households about unemployment had risen recently.

When referring to inflation, the Council members emphasised its decline to 2.9% y/y in
August 2020. It was pointed out that the annual CPI index was 1.8 percentage points lower
in August than in February 2020. Some Council members underlined the sustained
negative producer price growth. In turn, certain Council members observed that core
inflation and services price growth continued to exceed CPI inflation.

The majority of the Council members judged that inflation might be expected to
decline further in the subsequent quarters, which would be supported by the persistently
negative output gap, higher unemployment, slower wage growth and absence of
inflationary pressure from abroad. A further decline in inflation was also indicated by
external forecasts. These members judged that although some regulatory factors might put
upward pressure on prices, their impact on inflation would probably be smaller than in
2020. On the other hand, certain Council members were of the opinion that inflation in the
coming quarters might remain close to the currently observed level, which might result
from the persistence of elevated services price growth, impact of regulatory factors and a
potential rise in commodity prices.

The Council members pointed to out a decrease in annual lending growth in the
economy. In this context, particular attention was given to the decline in corporate lending
growth. It was stressed that the decline had been caused to a large extent by lower demand
for working capital loans, which might be related to companies receiving funds as part of
the anti-crisis shield. Certain Council members judged that the drop in corporate lending in
recent months was cyclical in nature and that the surveyed enterprises did not report any
deterioration in the availability of bank credit. In contrast, certain Council members drew
attention to a tightening of lending criteria reported by banks.

The Council members observed that the measures taken by NBP so far had contributed
to an easing of financing conditions in Poland. In particular it was emphasised that interest
rate cuts had translated into lower expenses of indebted enterprises and households, and as
a result they supported their budgets. It was also judged that the NBP interest rate cuts
were reflected in lower yields on Treasury bonds. It was underlined that this effect was
boosted by the asset purchases conducted by NBP.

Certain Council members emphasised that in response to the reduction in the NBP
interest rates, commercial banks had also cut interest rates on deposits. In the opinion of
these Council members, cutting interest rates on bank deposits led to an increase in current
deposits at the expense of term deposits, and to depositors seeking higher-risk investment,
including in the real estate market. Yet the majority of Council members assessed that no
imbalances that might pose a threat to macroeconomic or financial stability were building
up in the real estate market.

The majority of Council members judged that due to their positive impact on the
financial position of indebted enterprises and households, the interest rate cuts would
support the stability of the banking sector. These members also judged that the banking
sector was characterised by high capital ratios and high liquidity, and that lending margins
remained relatively high, which created favourable conditions for banks to expand lending.
It was pointed out that the increased risk in the economy had been a factor curbing lending.
Certain Council members pointed out that the number of banks reporting losses had
increased.

The Council members were of the opinion that following the earlier significant interest
rate cuts and the launch of asset purchases, the present meeting should keep interest rates
unchanged and continue to pursue NBP’s remaining measures. It was pointed out that

NBP’s monetary policy easing mitigated the negative economic effects of the pandemic,
limiting the scale of the decline in economic activity and supporting the income of
households and enterprises. As a result, NBP’s monetary policy contributes to mitigating
the fall in employment and limiting the deterioration of the financial situation of
enterprises, supporting a quicker economic recovery. NBP’s measures reduce the risk of
inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the medium term, and through a positive
impact on the financial situation of borrowers, they contribute to the strengthening of the
stability of the financial system.

The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at
0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and
the discount rate at 0.12%.
