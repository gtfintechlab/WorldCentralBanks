# Minutes of the Monetary Policy Council decision-making meeting held

 on 8 March 2023

At the meeting it was pointed out that global economic activity growth remained subdued.

It was also observed that in the euro area – despite a certain improvement in recent months

– economic conditions remained weak.

The Council members pointed out that in the recent period global negative supply shocks

had gradually eased. It was emphasized that in recent months prices of energy

commodities had fallen, although they remained considerably higher than before the

pandemic. At the same time, disruptions in global value chains were easing. It was pointed

out that the fading of these shocks was supporting global economic activity and reducing

inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, according to available forecasts, in 2023 GDP growth

in major economies would be relatively weak. At the same time, attention was drawn to

the uncertainty about the global macroeconomic outlook due, among others, to the

consequences of China’s departure from the restrictive epidemic policy.

It was pointed out that in the recent period CPI and HICP inflation had declined in the

United States and in the euro area, respectively, whereas in certain Central and Eastern

European countries consumer price growth had picked up. Global inflation is forecast to

fall due to the easing of the negative supply shocks and a slowdown in consumption

growth observed in many countries. It was also emphasised that according to forecasts,

inflation would decline gradually, especially core inflation, which remained high and in

many countries had not yet started to fall. Certain Council members also drew attention

to the uncertainty about the pace of disinflationary processes in the euro area and future

developments of service prices in the United States.

At the meeting it was pointed out that the Federal Reserve of the United States and the

European Central Bank continued to increase their interest rates, while certain Council

members pointed out that representatives of those central banks were indicating that it

was necessary to bring inflation down relatively fast. Other Council members underlined,

however, that these banks had launched interest rate hikes much later than NBP, and that

the total scale of the monetary policy tightening so far in the United States and the euro

area was significantly smaller than in Poland. At the same time, it was indicated that

central banks in Central and Eastern Europe – following the earlier strong monetary policy

tightening – were now keeping interest rates unchanged. It was observed that amid

weaker economic conditions and the forecast decline in inflation, an increasing number of

central banks were putting monetary policy tightening on hold.

While analysing the situation in Poland, the Council members pointed out that – amid the

weakening of economic growth around the world – activity in Poland had also slowed

down. In 2022 Q4, real GDP growth declined to 2.0% y/y. Economic growth was lowered

by reduced consumption demand. At the same time, investment activity continued to

increase. In this context the majority of the Council members judged that the observed

structure of GDP growth should support the disinflationary processes. It was pointed out

that the available data for January 2023 – including data on industrial output and retail

sales – corroborated the weakening of economic conditions.

While discussing the outlook for economic activity, Council members pointed out that

according to the March projection in 2023 GDP growth would be low amid weaker

consumption. It was observed that economic activity would continue to be curbed by the

consequences of the earlier negative supply shocks, slowdown in the global economy and

the monetary policy tightening implemented so far. In line with this projection, in the

years 2024-2025 economic growth would pick up, however, it was observed that this

would be a gradual process. It was emphasised that throughout the entire projection

horizon the output gap would be negative. Attention was also drawn to the uncertainty

about the forecast growth in economic activity. In this context some members of the

Council pointed to a higher likelihood of GDP growth running below the central path of

the projection, although certain Council members stressed that higher economic growth

was possible.

The Council members pointed out that the robust labour market situation continued,

although employment growth in the enterprise sector had slowed down slightly.

According to the LFS data, the number of working persons in the economy in 2022 Q4

remained close to the level recorded a year before, while it declined in the private sector.

It was pointed out that the annual growth in average nominal wages in the enterprise

sector had increased in January 2023. Certain Council members pointed out that the rise

in nominal wages exceeded labour productivity growth. At the meeting it was assessed

that labour market adjustment to the weakened economic conditions occurred through

real wages rather than rising unemployment which was a favourable scenario from the

point of view of macroeconomic stability and long-term growth.

At the meeting it was pointed out that according to the Statistics Poland preliminary data

– not taking into account the annual change in the weights in the basket of consumer goods

and services – annual CPI inflation in January 2023 had increased compared to December

2022 due to a rise in VAT rates on energy products and the adjustment of some prices of

energy carriers. It was pointed out that core inflation might also have increased slightly,

yet this was judged not to be an effect of accelerating demand as demand growth was on

the decline. By contrast, annual food price growth had declined again. At the same time,

it was pointed out that in the recent period inflation expectations of consumers and

businesses had fallen considerably, although certain Council members indicated that the

structure of responses to the survey questions had improved only recently.

While discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, it was pointed out that according to

the available forecasts, February 2023 probably saw the peak of CPI inflation. According

to the March projection and other forecasts, in 2023 Q2 price growth would start to

systematically decline. It was emphasised that the decline in inflation would be driven not

only by the statistical base effect, but also by weakening price pressures. It was also

observed that, on the one hand, demand was weakening, limiting the room for price

increases, and, on the other hand, the growth in costs was slowing down, which was

reflected, among others, in falling PPI inflation. At the same time, it was pointed out that

the effects of the earlier shocks would fade away gradually, given the nature and the scale

of these shocks.

According to the projection, CPI inflation in Poland will continue to decline also in the

coming years. Certain Council members stressed that the projection was prepared under

the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates. The majority of the Council members

underlined that at the end of the projection horizon price dynamics should be consistent

with the NBP inflation target. It was also observed that core inflation would decrease in

the projection horizon. Certain Council members pointed out, however, that from mid
2023 core inflation would account for most of the overall inflation. Some Council members

pointed to the uncertainty about the outlook for inflation, with certain Council member

highlighting the possibility of price growth running above the central path of the

projection, while others were flagging the possibility of a faster decline in inflation.

During the meeting the impact of NBP’s strong monetary policy tightening on monetary

conditions was highlighted. It was pointed out that growth in monetary and credit

aggregates had slowed down considerably, including a decline in households lending

stock. Certain Council members pointed out that the value of newly granted loans was

significant in their view. At the same time, some Council members remarked that the

easing of the supervisory recommendations regarding credit underwriting criteria for

certain types of loans might contribute to a slight rebound in lending.

The majority of the Council members assessed, that the weakening of the external

economic conditions, together with a decline in commodity prices, would continue to curb

global inflation, which would contribute to lower price growth in Poland. Decline in

domestic inflation would be supported by the weakening in GDP growth, including

consumption, amid significant decrease in credit growth. As a result, the majority of the

Council members assessed that the earlier strong monetary policy tightening undertaken

by NBP would lead to a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target. At

the same time, given strength and persistence of the recent shocks that remain beyond the

impact of domestic monetary policy, the return of inflation to the NBP inflation target

would be gradual. Such an assessment was supported by the March projection of inflation

and GDP. Alongside that, it was underlined that the Council flexibly determined the

desirable time necessary to bring inflation back to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly

back to the target might entail significant costs to macroeconomic and financial stability.

The decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by appreciation of the zloty

exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the

fundamentals of the Polish economy. In the opinion of the Council, considering the

expected scenario of the gradual return of inflation to the NBP inflation target in the

coming years, amid the deterioration in domestic economic conditions, including in the

labour market, and the incoming signals of the global inflationary pressure slowing down,

it was justified to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.

Certain Council members expressed the opinion that given the persistently high price

growth and elevated inflation expectations, the hitherto scale of interest rate hikes by NBP

was insufficient to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to

lower inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target. In

the opinion of those Council members, the disinflation process as foreseen by the forecasts,

and particularly the decline in core inflation, would be too slow.

The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 6.75%,

the lombard rate at 7.25%, the deposit rate at 6.25%, the rediscount rate at 6.80%, and the

discount rate at 6.85%.

incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity.
