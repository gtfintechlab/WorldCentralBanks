# Minutes of the Monetary Policy Council decision-making meeting held

 on 6 December 2023

At the meeting, it was noted that the economic conditions in the external environment of

the Polish economy remained weakened, although it varied across countries. It was

pointed out that the economic situation in the United States was still favourable, yet – after

the rapid GDP growth in 2023 Q3 – activity growth might have slowed down. On the other

hand, stagnation tendencies continued in the euro area. Annual GDP growth in Germany,

Poland’s main trading partner, was negative in 2023 Q3. Forecasts suggest that in 2024

GDP in Germany will return to the upward trend; however, uncertainty persists as to the

materialisation of this scenario. The uncertainty is related to the structural problems of the

German economy, the previous monetary policy tightening by the ECB and the likely

fiscal tightening.

The Council members underlined that annual price growth in the external environment of

the Polish economy was declining further, although in many countries it remained

elevated. In the euro area, inflation – including core inflation – declined by more than

expected. Price growth in the countries of the Central and Eastern Europe region was also

slowing down, yet it remained higher than in advanced economies.

It was observed that amid the falling inflation, most central banks in advanced economies

had recently kept interest rates unchanged after prior increases. It was pointed out that

market expectations indicated a possibility of interest rate cuts in the major economies in

2024, although it was also stressed that those expectations were subject to uncertainty.

At the meeting it was observed that amid the weakened global economic conditions, also

in Poland activity growth remained low, although it rose recently. According to the

Statistics Poland preliminary estimate, GDP growth in Poland stood at 0.5% y/y in 2023 Q3

compared to -0.6% y/y in the previous quarter. GDP growth was positively affected by the

contribution of net exports, and, albeit to a lesser extent, an increase in investment and

consumption. Some Council members emphasised that consumption growth had been

higher than expected. At the same time, the Council members stated that the contribution

of changes in inventories to GDP growth was markedly negative in 2023 Q3.

While discussing the outlook for the economic activity, it was pointed out that GDP

growth would probably be accelerating in the coming quarters. This would be driven by

an increase in consumption on the back of real wage growth. The majority of the Council

members emphasised that despite the expected higher GDP growth, the output gap in the

following quarters would, according the NBP’s November projection, remain negative.

Certain Council members observed that also the rise in the nominal value of household

assets observed in recent years might have an upward effect on consumption.

During the discussion it was stated that the latest monthly data were consistent with the

scenario of accelerating economic growth as outlined in the November NBP’s projection.

In October, retail sales as well as industrial output and construction and assembly

production were higher than the year before. At the same time, it was underlined that

consumer confidence was improving. The PMI Manufacturing index had also risen,

although it continued to indicate an ongoing downturn in industry.

While analysing the labour market situation, the Council members noted that it remained

good, as reflected in particular in the low unemployment rate. Although the number of

working persons remained high, employment in the enterprise sector was lower than at

the beginning of the year. Certain Council members pointed out that despite the increase

in the number of foreign workers in the Polish labour market, demographic changes might

be one of the factors hampering employment growth.

Alongside that, as inflation decreased, the annual real wage growth in the national

economy increased in 2023 Q3, and, like in Q2 of that year, was positive. The majority of

the Council members judged that despite the observed increase in real wages, the overall

cost pressure among enterprises was easing. In contrast, certain Council members drew

attention to the fact that real wages were rising faster than labour productivity, and –

according to surveys – the measures of wage pressure, despite falling, remained above the

long-term average.

According to the majority of the Council members, the effects of the previous NBP

monetary policy tightening were still observed in the credit market. The ratio of bank

credit to the non-financial private sector to GDP was approximately 15 percentage points

lower than before the pandemic. Annual growth in credit to both households and

corporates remained negative. However, the Council members pointed out that

increasingly visible signs of recovery could be observed in the credit market. It was

indicated that banks were granting more and more housing loans, which was supported

in particular by the so-called “2% Safe Mortgage” programme.

At the meeting, it was pointed out that – according to the data available at that time, i.e.

the Statistics Poland flash estimate – the annual inflation rate was running at 6.5% in

November. The Council members pointed out that, as previously expected, the

disinflation process was slower than in previous months, although given the available

Statistics Poland data, the decrease in core inflation in November could be estimated as

greater than in October. The majority of the Council members argued that price growth

was curbed by the weakened demand pressures and the decline in cost pressures. The

diminishing cost pressures and the fading of most external supply shocks were also

indicated by the increasingly sharper declines in the PPI index. At the same time, the

Council members judged that the decrease in inflation was being supported by the

appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which was consistent with the fundamentals of

the Polish economy.

Some Council members observed that in recent months, the indicators of inflation

expectations had decreased. Yet certain Council members drew attention to the slight

deterioration in the structure of the responses in the surveys of inflation expectations.

While discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, the majority of the Council members

pointed out that a further decline in price growth was expected. It was also emphasised

that inflation developments, both in the short- and medium-term, were associated with

uncertainty, related in particular to the pace of economic recovery in Poland and its impact

on price developments as well as future course of fiscal and regulatory policies. In

particular, it was pointed out that despite the incoming announcements concerning the

shape of fiscal policy, uncertainty persisted as to future VAT rates on food products,

energy price regulations as well as other elements of fiscal policy. It was underlined that

fiscal and regulatory measures might affect future inflation developments, both directly

and through their impact on the economic conditions and demand in the economy.

The majority of the Council members assessed that the incoming data indicated low

demand and cost pressures in the Polish economy, which amidst the weakened economic

conditions and falling inflation pressure abroad would support a gradual decline in

domestic inflation. Considering the adjustment in the NBP interest rates introduced in

previous months, together with uncertainty about a future course of fiscal and regulatory

policies and their impact on inflation, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates

unchanged. The Council judged that the current level of the NBP interest rates was

conducive to meeting the NBP inflation target in the medium term. It was emphasised that

the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring inflation back to the

target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs to

macroeconomic and financial stability.

The view was expressed that given the persistently high annual price growth and elevated

inflation expectations, the level of the NBP interest rates was too low to ensure the return

of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower inflation expectations to levels

consistent with the medium-term inflation target.

The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.75%,

the lombard rate at 6.25%, the deposit rate at 5.25%, the rediscount rate at 5.80%, and the

discount rate at 5.85%.

The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on

incoming information regarding the prospects for inflation and economic activity.
