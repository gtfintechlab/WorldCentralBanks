# Minutes of the Monetary Policy Council decision-making meeting held

 on 6 July 2023

At the meeting it was pointed out that the economic conditions in the environment of the

Polish economy remained subdued. In the euro area activity growth had been constrained

in recent quarters. It was emphasised that the euro area economy was expected to rebound

in the coming quarters; however, the scale of the recovery would be rather modest, and in

Germany, according to forecasts, GDP would fall in 2023. In the United States the current

economic conditions remained better than in the euro area, although forecasts indicated

their possible weakening.

The Council members underlined that global inflation was declining, but continued to be

elevated. CPI inflation in the United States had fallen to 4.0% in May, while HICP inflation

in the euro area had fallen to 5.5% in June. In Central and Eastern European countries

inflation had also declined. It was pointed out that in recent months core inflation had also

begun to decline in many economies, although it remained elevated.

Forecasts signalled a further fall in global inflation in the coming quarters. This was

supposed to result from both the fading of the earlier supply shocks and the significant

global monetary tightening and the related weakening of economic activity. The

continuation of the disinflation process is indicated by the significant fall in cost and price

pressure, including a sharp decline in PPI inflation.

At the Council meeting it was pointed out that the central banks in the United States and

the euro area forecasted that price growth would decline only gradually. As a result,

inflation in these economies might still slightly exceed the inflation targets in 2025. It was

underlined that the future pace of disinflation in the environment of the Polish economy

would be determined in particular by the situation in the labour markets and enterprises’

price policy. In this context, attention was drawn to the significant role of growth in

corporate mark-ups and profits in shaping prices in recent quarters.

Amid subdued economic growth around the world, activity growth had also slowed

down in Poland. The Council members stressed that May 2023 was the third month in a

row in which retail sales had fallen sharply in annual terms. Consequently, it was pointed

out that in 2023 Q2 the fall in household consumption had most likely deepened. Industrial

as well as construction and assembly output had also declined in annual terms in May

2023. At the same time, it was highlighted that the situation in the labour market had not

changed significantly. It was observed that employment continued to rise in the services

sector, while industry saw a fall in employment. This was accompanied by steady wage

growth in the enterprise sector.

While discussing the economic activity outlook in Poland, the Council members indicated

that in line with the NBP’s July projection, GDP growth would be low in 2023. It was

underlined that consumption growth might be negative throughout the whole of 2023,

which would support the disinflation process. Although according to the July projection

the coming quarters were to see some recovery in activity – amid a rise in real wages and

the fading of the negative supply shocks – GDP growth was expected to remain moderate

and the output gap negative over the projection horizon.

At the Council meeting it was underlined that – in line with earlier predictions – inflation

declined significantly. According to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, CPI inflation fell

to 11.5% y/y in June 2023. It was observed that in the last four months inflation had

declined by about 7 percentage points, and that June was the second month in a row in

which the overall consumer price level had remained unchanged from the previous

month. Attention was drawn to a further drop in energy prices and a decline in food prices

compared to the previous month.

Therefore, the majority of the Council members argued that the still high annual inflation

rate was not resulting from current growth in the overall price level, but was reflecting

past price changes in previous periods. It was pointed out that based on available data, it

could be estimated that in June price growth of all the main groups included in the basket

of consumer goods and services had declined, and that in particular core inflation had

probably fallen markedly. The Council members also observed that PPI inflation had

fallen rapidly in recent quarters and producer price growth in the manufacturing sector

had already been negative in May 2023.

Certain Council members expressed the opinion that price-setting processes in Poland,

like in other countries, were currently following a different pattern than in a low inflation

period. In the view of these Council members, the decline in the annual CPI index mainly

reflected the base effects and the fall in commodity prices, while inflation expectations –

despite declining – continued to be high, and inflation both in Poland and aboard

remained persistent. These Council members also underlined the improvement in the

expected labour market situation envisaged in several previous NBP projections, which

could support higher inflation.

However, while discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, the majority of the Council

members pointed out that in line with the July projection, in the coming quarters inflation

would keep declining and in the second half of 2025 it would reach a level consistent with

the NBP inflation target. This would be supported by the fading of the earlier shocks in

commodity markets and the global supply chain disruptions, strong monetary policy

tightening undertaken by NBP and the slowdown in aggregate demand growth. In the

opinion of these Council members, the currently observed strong fall in PPI inflation, the

reduction in value of loans to the non-financial sector and the declining inflation

expectations of consumers and enterprises would also contribute to a fall in CPI inflation.

It was judged that the disinflation process was also supported by the marked appreciation

of the zloty observed in recent months.

Some Council members drew attention to the fact that relatively high wage growth could

be a risk factor for the inflation outlook in Poland. However, the majority of the Council

members judged that the weakening economic conditions would curb enterprises’ ability

to raise prices further and that firms would be able to absorb rising costs, including labour

costs, by reducing their margins, which had been high in the previous quarters.

The majority of the Council members assessed that the weakening of the external

economic conditions, together with lower commodity prices, would continue to curb

global inflation, which would still contribute to lower price growth in Poland. The decline

in domestic inflation would be supported by the weakening of domestic GDP growth,

including the continued decline in consumption, amid a significant decrease in credit

growth. The majority of the Council members assessed that the strong monetary policy

tightening undertaken by NBP has been leading to a decline in inflation in Poland towards

the NBP inflation target. At the same time, given the strength and persistence of the earlier

shocks, which remained beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, the return of

inflation to the NBP inflation target would be gradual. Alongside that, it was underlined

that the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring inflation back

to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs

to macroeconomic and financial stability. The Council members upheld the assessment

that the decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by an appreciation of the zloty

exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the

fundamentals of the Polish economy.

The majority of the Council members recognised that, taking into account the above

conditions, and in particular the significant decline in inflation and its expected further

gradual decline, as well as the weakening of the domestic economic conditions, including

the consolidating fall in consumer demand, decline in inflation expectations, low growth

in monetary and credit aggregates, and also the decline in inflationary pressure abroad

combined with the risks to the global economic outlook, and taking into account the earlier

strong monetary policy tightening, it was warranted to end the monetary policy tightening

cycle. At the same time, certain Council members pointed out that the significant fall in

inflation and declining inflation expectations amid unchanged interest rates were

contributing to an increase in the restrictiveness of monetary policy. Under these

circumstances, and also considering the prospect of a further fall in inflation and low

economic activity growth, in the coming months it might be justified to consider lowering

of the NBP interest rates.

The view was expressed that given the persistently high annual price growth and elevated

inflationary expectations, the current level of the NBP interest rates was too low to ensure

the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower inflation expectations

to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.

The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 6.75%,

the lombard rate at 7.25%, the deposit rate at 6.25%, the rediscount rate at 6.80%, and the

discount rate at 6.85%.

The Council pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming

information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity.
