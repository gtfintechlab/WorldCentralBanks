# Minutes of the Monetary Policy Council decision-making meeting held

 on 8 June 2022

During the discussion at the Council meeting, the situation in the external environment of

the Polish economy was assessed. It was observed that growth in global economic activity

was slowing down. It was pointed out that recent months had seen a marked deterioration

in economic conditions in some emerging economies, including in China, while relatively

favourable economic conditions persisted in the largest developed economies. The

Council members highlighted that global economic activity continued to be curbed by

high prices of commodities and components used in production, persisting global supply

chain disruptions and the consequences of the Russian military aggression against

Ukraine.

It was pointed out that in 2022 Q1 the euro area had recorded moderate GDP growth,

which resulted, on the one hand, from the gradual easing of the pandemic restrictions

imposed in the euro area economy and, on the other hand, from the persisting supply

chain disruptions, which had intensified in recent months due to the war in Ukraine and

the zero-covid policy in China. At the same time, the situation in the euro area labour

market continued to improve, with the unemployment rate declining to a very low level.

The labour market situation remained favourable also in the United States, which

translated into accelerating wage growth. It was pointed out that despite a decline in GDP

in 2022 Q1, growth in private consumption and investment in the US economy was

positive, and April had seen both retail sales and industrial output pick up.

The Council members drew attention to a further rise in inflation worldwide, which in

some countries reached the highest levels for decades. In particular, it was indicated that

in May 2022 the euro area had seen HICP inflation rise to 8.1% (with some euro area

economies recording double-digit inflation). In the United States inflation continued to

run at a historically high level, although CPI inflation had declined slightly in April.

It was emphasised that high commodity prices, prolonged disruptions in global supply

chains and international transport, exacerbated by the effects of the war, remained the

main source of rising inflation. In this context, some Council members drew attention to

the European partial embargo imposed on Russian oil, which affected oil prices, and the

decision of the OPEC countries to increase oil supply, which – in turn – should ease

somewhat the tensions in the oil market. It was stressed that the price of oil had increased

by more than 50% over the year, and by almost 200% over the past two years. European

prices of coal and gas were also several times higher. Moreover, it was emphasised that

the shock in energy commodity prices and the war in Ukraine had resulted in a sharp rise

also in agricultural commodity prices.

It was noted that in many economies a relatively high aggregate demand, financed partly

with savings accumulated during the pandemic and partly with growing income, amidst

a very good labour market situation, supported the transmission of supply shocks to

inflation. It was emphasised that as a result, core inflation was also on the rise. At the same

time, inflation forecasts for the coming quarters were significantly revised upwards.

At the meeting it was pointed out that amid a strong rise in inflation, many central banks

were tightening their monetary policy. In particular, the US Federal Reserve had ended its

net asset purchases and was continuing its interest rate hikes. On the other hand, the ECB

had so far kept negative interest rates, yet had reduced the scale of its asset purchases.

Central banks in many economies, including in Central and Eastern Europe, had

continued to increase interest rates.

While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, the Council members pointed out

that according to the Statistics Poland preliminary estimate, in 2022 Q1 GDP growth

amounted to 8.5% y/y. However, the data on its structure indicated that the rise in

inventories had a large contribution to GDP growth, whereas consumption and

investment growth had declined. It was assessed that the large growth in inventories was

likely the result of companies accumulating raw materials and semi-products due to the

uncertainty about their future prices and serious disruptions in supply chains.

The Council members emphasised that data available for 2022 Q2 suggested continuation

of favourable economic conditions, although the pace of economic activity was gradually

declining. Attention was drawn, in particular, to the fact that in April growth in industrial

output had slowed down somewhat, and that in May the PMI index for industry had fallen

below the level of 50 points. Data for construction were also markedly worse, with a

significant slowdown in the growth of construction and assembly production. At the same

time, April saw a significant growth in retail sales which was, on the one hand, the result

of the inflow of refugees and the pandemic-related base effects and, on the other hand, the

result of the constantly rising household income. It was emphasised that the situation in

the domestic labour market continued to be very good, which was confirmed by the LFS

data for 2022 Q1 and the incoming monthly data. In April employment continued to rise,

accompanied by a further fall in unemployment and a marked rise in wages.

The Council members assessed that the outlook for the Polish economy in the coming

quarters was still relatively favourable, although a slowdown in economic growth was

anticipated. At the same time, it was noted that forecasts of the macroeconomic situation

both in Poland and worldwide are fraught with high uncertainty. It was pointed out that

the pace of economic growth would still be negatively affected by growing prices of

commodities and certain products, resulting in a rise in enterprises’ costs and limiting the

growth in real disposable income of households. Economic activity would also be curbed

by the forecast slowdown in global economic growth. It was emphasised that a more in
depth analysis of the medium-term scenario for the Polish economy would be possible in

July, after the projection of inflation and GDP is published.

It was pointed out at the meeting that in May 2022 inflation in Poland had risen to 13.9%

y/y. It was emphasised that heightened inflation in Poland – as in other countries – was

mainly driven by a sharp rise in global prices of energy and agricultural commodities

which was largely the result of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine. Other

global factors affecting consumer prices were supply chain disruptions and high costs of

international transport. Another factor boosting inflation in Poland was the earlier

increases in regulated domestic tariffs on electricity, natural gas and thermal energy.

Consequently – as pointed out by the Council members – in May the annual growth of

energy prices reached 33% and that of food prices exceeded 13%. At the same time, price

growth was supported by high demand, which facilitates enterprises to pass growing costs

to prices of final products, resulting also in higher core inflation. On the other hand,

inflation was mitigated by the reduction in some tax rates under the Anti-Inflation Shield.

With regard to the outlook for inflation in Poland, the Council members stressed that in

the coming quarters inflation would remain markedly elevated due to the further impact

of the factors currently boosting price growth, including those related to the Russian

military aggression against Ukraine. It was emphasised that high uncertainty regarding

future inflation prevailed, among others, due to uncertainty concerning changes in

commodity prices, the impact of war in Ukraine on the global and domestic economic

conditions, as well as due to regulatory changes affecting prices, including the decision on

solutions provided for in the Anti-Inflation Shield. At the same time, the Council members

pointed out that the NBP interest rates increases, together with fading of the impact of

shocks currently boosting prices would contribute to a gradual fall in inflation in the

coming years. The decrease in inflation should also be supported by appreciation of zloty

exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the

fundamentals of the Polish economy. However, certain Council members pointed out that

expected more expansionary fiscal policy would have pro-inflationary effects.

Certain Council members also pointed out that the government measures aimed at

shielding mortgage borrowers, i.a. by introduction of the so-called repayment holidays,

would hinder the efforts to permanently lower inflation. At the same time, they indicated

that the planned changes in reference rates could, depending on the adopted solutions,

weaken the monetary transmission mechanism.

In context of the discussion on macroeconomic conditions, the Council members assessed

that there remained a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the

monetary policy transmission horizon. Consequently, the Council concluded that, in order

to bring inflation down to the NBP inflation target in the medium term, the NBP interest

rates should continue to be raised. The increase in NBP interest rates is curbing inflation

expectations and should support the appreciation of the zloty.

The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.75 percentage points, i.e. to

6.00% and set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at

6.50%, the deposit rate at 5.50%, the rediscount rate at 6.05%, and the discount rate at

6.10%.

The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on

incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity,

including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish

economy.
