# Minutes of the Monetary Policy Council decision-making meeting held

 on 5 May 2022

At the Council meeting, it was observed that in 2022 Q1 conditions in the global economy

remained relatively favourable, although prolonged disruptions in international trade,

partially related to the successive waves of the pandemic in China, and high commodity

prices had a negative impact on the global economic situation. The Council members

highlighted that Russian military aggression against Ukraine had contributed to an

intensification of these factors and to a substantial rise in uncertainty surrounding further

global macroeconomic developments as well as led to a deterioration in economic

sentiment. Consequently, activity growth slowed down in some economies in 2022 Q1 and

GDP growth forecasts had been revised downwards. At the same time, it was pointed out

that although in the United States GDP growth was lower in 2022 Q1 than in the previous

quarter, further growth in domestic demand indicated that economic conditions remained

good. It was observed that in the euro area GDP continued to grow in 2022 Q1, supported,

among others, by a rebound in activity in the German economy following its decline in

2021 Q4.

During the meeting it was pointed out that in the recent period inflation in many countries

was still rising, reaching the highest levels in decades. At the same time, price growth

forecasts for the coming quarters were significantly revised upwards. High commodity

prices as well as prolonged disruptions in global supply chains and international transport

remained the main source of rising inflation around the world. The impact of these factors

on inflation processes in the recent period had intensified due to the Russian aggression

against Ukraine. In particular, oil prices had risen once again, despite the decision of the

United States to begin selling its oil supplies. At the same time, European prices of coal

and gas were several times higher than a year ago. This was accompanied by a rapid

growth in the prices of agricultural commodities, reflected in the agricultural commodity

price index running at its highest level on record. The Council members observed that,

apart from the factors indicated, in some of the economies rising labour costs were also

contributing to the surge in inflation.

At the Council meeting, it was stressed that, according to Eurostat preliminary data, in

April 2022 HICP inflation in the euro area reached 7.5%. At the same time, in some

economies of this currency area price growth was in double digits. Inflation remained high

in the United States as well. At the same time, it was underlined that growth in core

inflation that accounted for a significant part of consumer price inflation was observed

both in the United States and in the euro area.

The Council members pointed out that amidst a strong increase in inflation, many central

banks were tightening their monetary policy, although the decisions of the major central

banks were not uniform. The US Federal Reserve had concluded its net asset purchases

and had raised interest rates for the second time in May. On the other hand, the ECB was

keeping the deposit rate negative, although it had reduced the scale of its asset purchases.

At the same time, the financial markets were expecting interest rate increases in the euro

area later in the year. It was highlighted that recently central banks in Central-Eastern

Europe region had continued to increase interest rates.

When analysing the situation in the Polish economy, the Council members pointed out

that, according to available data, the good economic conditions had continued in 2022 Q1.

It was emphasised that, despite the Russian military aggression against Ukraine, which

had contributed to a weakening in sentiment of economic entities, data for March had

indicated a further significant rise in economic activity. In particular, retail sales had

grown in real terms by 9.6%, which was partly supported by the inflow of refugees. In

turn, industrial output had increased in March by 17.3% y/y. Construction and assembly

output had also risen significantly.

At the Council meeting it was pointed out that the situation of employees in the domestic

labour market remained favourable. Steady employment growth in the enterprise sector

continued, the number of job offers was increasing and unemployment was at a record

low. It was pointed out that wage growth had picked up to 12.4% y/y in March. At the

same time, it was pointed out that the high wage growth could be partly attributed to

significant wage growth in mining and transport. It was also observed that although

wages were currently growing rapidly, wage pressure had somewhat eased in the

enterprise sector, while still remaining at high levels. At the same time, it was pointed out

that the easing of this pressure, at least in some sectors, should be supported by the

gradual professional activation of refugees.

At the meeting the Council members assessed that a continuation of the favourable

economic conditions might be expected in the coming quarters, although a gradual

slowdown of economic growth was forecast. It was pointed out that in April consumer

sentiment had slightly improved following a significant decline in March. It was assessed

that the pace of economic growth would be negatively affected by the rise in the prices of

commodities and some products, boosting corporate costs and limiting household

disposable income. It was pointed out that the reduction in exports to Russia and Ukraine

as well as the expected global economic slowdown might also contribute to the weakening

of economic activity. At the same time, the domestic economic conditions would be

supported by additional consumer demand due to the inflow of refugees as well as

expenditure necessary to provide them with access to some services. It was pointed out

that domestic demand and economic conditions would also be supported by fiscal policy

measures, among others, the lowering of the personal income tax rate and the planned

increase in expenditure on national defence.

Council members also emphasised that currently both domestic and global economic

outlook was subject to significant uncertainty stemming from the impact of Russian

military aggression against Ukraine. It was pointed out that one of the factors of

uncertainty was further development of commodity prices and the decisions about the

import of energy carriers, including a potential embargo on Russian oil imports. In this

context, the Council members pointed out that the direct deliveries of natural gas from

Russia to Poland had been stopped. However, it was highlighted that given the available

technical possibilities of obtaining gas from other sources and the relatively high level of

stocks in gas storage facilities in Poland, according to the current forecasts it should not

have a significant negative effect on domestic economic activity in the coming quarters.

At the Council meeting it was observed that according to Statistics Poland flash estimate,

inflation in Poland had increased to 12.3% y/y in April 2022, which was mainly driven by

a strong growth in food prices, largely related to a rise in global agricultural commodities

prices amid Russian military aggression against Ukraine. It was pointed out that food

prices were probably also boosted by increased demand generated by the inflow of

Ukrainian refugees to Poland. At the same time, it was emphasised that the earlier

increases in energy commodities prices as well as in regulated tariffs on electricity, natural

gas and thermal energy, continued to contribute to markedly elevated inflation. Inflation,

especially with respect to the prices of goods, was also significantly boosted by disruptions

in international trade – aggravated not only by the war in Ukraine, but also by the

shutdown of factories and ports in China due to the pandemic – as well as high transport

costs. Council members highlighted that the ongoing economic recovery, including an

increase in demand driven by rising household incomes, had also had a positive

contribution to the price growth. It was further noted that the markedly elevated price

growth encompassed an ever broader group of goods and services, which was

accompanied by a rise in core inflation. However, it was also highlighted that inflation

was being mitigated by the reduction in tax rates under the Anti-Inflation Shield. Yet, at

the same time, certain Council members pointed out that expected more expansionary

fiscal policy would have pro-inflationary effects.

With regard to the inflation outlook in Poland, the Council members stressed that in the

coming quarters inflation would remain markedly elevated due to a further impact of the

factors currently amplifying price growth, including those related the Russian military

aggression against Ukraine. In the Council’s assessment, in the coming years inflation will

gradually decline, although it will be higher than previously expected. The gradual

decrease in price growth will result from the expected fading of some of the global shocks

currently boosting prices, as well as from the increases in the NBP interest rates. The

decrease in inflation should also be supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate,

which, in the Council’s assessment, will be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish

economy. At the same time, the Council members stressed that high uncertainty regarding

future developments of inflation prevailed, as related, among others, to changes in

commodity prices, impact of the Russian aggression against Ukraine on the global and

domestic economic conditions, as well as regulatory factors affecting prices.

The Council members assessed that in view of the above circumstances, including higher

than expected price growth – which shifts the expected inflation path upwards in the

coming quarters – and taking into account the expected relatively favourable economic

situation in Poland, there remains a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target

in the monetary policy transmission horizon. Consequently, the Council concluded that,

in order to bring inflation down to the NBP inflation target in the medium term, the NBP

interest rates should continue to be raised. The increase in NBP interest rates is curbing

inflation expectations and should support the appreciation of the zloty.

The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.75 percentage points, i.e. to

5.25% and set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at

5.75%, the deposit rate at 4.75%, the rediscount rate at 5.30%, and the discount rate at

5.35%.

The Council members pointed out that the further decisions of the Council would depend

on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity,

including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish

economy.
