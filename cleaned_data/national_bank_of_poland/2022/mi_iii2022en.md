# Minutes of the Monetary Policy Council decision-making meeting held

 on 8 March 2022

At the Council meeting, it was observed that after a strong growth of global economy in

2021, at the beginning of 2022 economic activity has softened somewhat in some countries,

amid a surge in the pandemic. However, it was noted that along with the improving

epidemic situation in the United States and the euro area, economic sentiment indicators

in these economies had picked up, signalling improving conditions, both in the industrial

and the services sector.

During the meeting it was stressed that after the outbreak of the Russian military

aggression against Ukraine, uncertainty regarding further course of global

macroeconomic situation had increased significantly, including in Europe. It was assessed

that Russian aggression and the related economic sanctions would contribute to slowing

down the activity growth in many economies. Yet the scale of the impact would depend

on the duration and course of the aggression, the range of sanctions imposed and the way

economic agents adapt to these conditions.

It was pointed out that the Russian military aggression against Ukraine had contributed

to a marked deterioration of sentiment in global financial markets, which had a downward

effect on the prices of many assets and led to a depreciation of many currencies, including

those of the Central and Eastern Europe region. This was accompanied by another strong

increase in global commodity prices related to the expected reduction in supply of

commodities from Russia and Ukraine. In particular, it was pointed out that at the

beginning of March the prices of gas in Europe were more than twice as high as in January,

and that Brent oil prices had temporarily reached the highest level since 2008. Coal prices

had also risen sharply. At the same time, the prices of agricultural commodities – including

wheat and maize – also markedly increased. It was observed that the upward pressure on

the prices of agricultural commodities would be driven not only by their limited supply

from Russia and Ukraine, but also by rising prices of nitrogenous fertilisers which are

produced using natural gas. It was also pointed out that international transport prices

were still elevated, and that disruptions in global supply chains continued and might be

intensified by Russian military aggression against Ukraine.

In the opinion of the Council, amid the Russian military aggression against Ukraine the

risk of further rise in global inflation, including in the external environment of the Polish

economy, has grown. It was observed that already before the start of the Russian

aggression, inflation in many countries had reached its highest levels in decades. In the

euro area, HICP inflation rose to 5.8% in February, and in the United States, CPI inflation

rose to 7.5% in January. It was pointed out that the accelerated price growth in these

economies resulted mainly from supply-side factors – including, in particular, more

expensive commodities – yet the recovery in demand and low unemployment level had

been also driving the prices upwards, leading to a significant increase in core inflation.

The Council members indicated that amidst a marked increase in inflation, many central

banks were withdrawing monetary accommodation. It was highlighted that the central

banks in Central and Eastern Europe continued to raise interest rates, and that the ECB

kept negative interest rates, although it had been reducing the scale of asset purchases. It

was also pointed out that the US Federal Reserve had signalled the termination of asset

purchases in March and a start of interest rate increases.

When analysing the situation in the Polish economy, Council members pointed out that

according to available data, the economic situation remained favourable. It was observed

that GDP growth in 2021 Q4 amounted to 7.3% according to preliminary estimate by

Statistics Poland, on the back of a marked increase in consumption and investment. It was

emphasised that the favourable economic conditions had continued into early 2022, as

evidenced by a rapid growth in retail sales and industrial output. At the same time,

attention was drawn to the favourable situation in the labour market, reflected in a further

increase in employment and a marked increase in the average wage in the corporate sector,

although wages were growing slightly slower in January than in December 2021.

It was indicated that Russian military aggression against Ukraine and the related sanctions

would have a negative impact on economic activity in Poland, although the scale of this

impact was surrounded with considerable uncertainty. It was pointed out that a decline

in exports to Russia, Belarus and Ukraine would have a dampening effect on GDP growth.

Yet, it was indicated that this influence was bound to be limited due to the small share of

exports to these economies in Poland’s foreign trade. However, it was noted that exports

to other economies may also slow down, due to the intensified disruptions in supply

chains and subdued growth of external demand due to a probable weakening of the

economic conditions in countries that are Poland’s main trading partners. In addition,

activity growth may be slowed down by a moderation in private sector investment – given

the heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook – and slower consumption growth

amid persistently higher inflation.

At the same time, it was pointed out that in the aftermath of Russian aggression against

Ukraine, some factors will support activity growth in Poland. In this context, attention was

drawn to the considerable inflow of refugees to Poland, which would generate additional

demand for consumer goods and services and would require higher investments related

to the migrants, including investment in expanding the health care system, education and

increasing the availability of housing. It was also pointed out that defence spending would

be increased. Moreover, Council members observed that the inflow of refugees would

contribute to increasing supply in the domestic labour market.

The majority of the Council members observed that despite the negative impact of Russian

aggression against Ukraine, NBP’s March projection pointed to a likely continuation of the

relatively favourable economic situation in the coming quarters, despite somewhat slower

economic growth. Certain Council members judged that the scale of the weakening of

economic activity might be greater than indicated by the central path of the March

projection.

During the meeting it was pointed out that inflation in Poland – according to the Statistics

Poland flash estimate – increased to 9.2% in January 2022. Council members emphasised

that the markedly elevated inflation was mainly driven by a significant rise in the prices

of energy and agricultural commodities as well as regulated tariffs for electrical energy,

natural gas and heating. At the same time, it was pointed out that prices were also boosted

by the ongoing economic recovery, including increased demand stimulated by rising

household incomes. It was further observed that the markedly elevated price growth

encompassed an increasingly broader group of goods and services, which was

accompanied by a rise in core inflation. At the same time, it was noted that the reduction

in some of the tax rates under the Anti-inflationary Shield had a curbing effect on inflation.

With regard to the prospects of inflation in Poland, Council members pointed out that

according to the NBP March projection, inflation in 2022 and the subsequent years would

be higher than previously forecast. It was indicated that in 2022 inflation would be running

at a substantially elevated level, which – in addition to the factors that had already boosted

price growth – would result from the economic fallout of Russian military aggression

against Ukraine. In particular, it was highlighted that the Russian aggression had

contributed to a sharp rise in commodity prices, a weakening of the zloty and

intensification of disruptions to supply chains. At the same time, according to the NBP

March projection, despite being higher than previously expected, inflation will gradually

subside in the coming years. This process will be facilitated by the fading of some of the

global shocks currently driving up price growth, and the increases in the NBP interest

rates. It was observed that declining inflation should also be supported by the appreciation

of the zloty, since in the Council’s opinion, the market pressure on the weakening of the

zloty – observed in the first days following the launch of the Russian military aggression

against Ukraine – was not in line with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.

At the same time, the Council members observed that the inflation outlook was subject to

high uncertainty in the current environment. Developments in price processes would

depend, in particular, on evolution of global commodity prices, which at the moment were

highly volatile, the impact of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine on global and domestic

economic conditions, as well as regulatory factors affecting prices.

Council members assessed that in view of the additional shocks having an upward effect

on price growth, and taking into account the expected relatively favourable economic

situation in Poland, there persists a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target

in the monetary policy transmission horizon. Consequently, Council members concluded

that, in order to bring inflation down to the NBP inflation target in the medium term, the

NBP interest rates should be raised again. The increase in the NBP interest rates will also

curb inflation expectations and should support appreciation of the zloty.

The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.75 percentage points, i.e. to

3.50% and set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at

4.00%, the deposit rate at 3.00%, the rediscount rate at 3.55% and the discount rate at 3.60%.

The Council members pointed out that the further decisions of the Council would depend

on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity,

including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish

economy.
