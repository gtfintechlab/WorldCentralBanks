### Monetary policy assessment of 15 September 2011 


### Swiss National Bank enforces minimum exchange rate  with utmost determination

The Swiss National Bank will enforce the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro set
on 6 September with the utmost determination. It is prepared to buy foreign currency in
unlimited quantities. It continues to aim for a three-month Libor at zero and will maintain
total sight deposits at the SNB at significantly above CHF 200 billion.

With these measures, the SNB is taking a stand against the acute threat to the Swiss
economy and the risk of deflationary development that spring from massive overvaluation
of the Swiss franc. Even at a rate of CHF 1.20, the Swiss franc is still high and should
continue to weaken over time. If the economic outlook and deflation risks so require, the
SNB will take further measures.

The growth of the global economy has slowed substantially in the course of the second
quarter. The outlook for the advanced economies, in particular, has worsened
considerably. In Switzerland, economic activity is suffering from both the strong Swiss
franc and the softening in international demand. The SNB expects growth to come to a
halt in the second half of the year. For 2011 as a whole, GDP growth can be expected at
1.5–2.0%. This is only because of the favourable economic development in the first half of
the year. Without the stabilising effect of the minimum exchange rate, there would be a
substantial threat of recession.

Uncertainty about the future outlook for the global economy remains exceptionally high
and the risks for the global financial system have increased substantially. The
deterioration in the outlook for growth and fiscal problems in the advanced economies are
both adversely impacting confidence in financial markets worldwide.

The SNB’s conditional inflation forecast has shifted substantially downwards as a result of
the massive appreciation in the Swiss franc and the deterioration in the outlook for the
global economy. For 2011, the forecast shows an inflation rate of 0.4%, for 2012 a rate of
–0.3% and for 2013 a rate of 0.5%. This forecast is based on the assumption of a threeh Lib f 0 0% d f h k i i h S i f I h f bl

future, there is no risk of inflation in Switzerland. There are, however, downside risks for
price stability should the Swiss franc not weaken further.
