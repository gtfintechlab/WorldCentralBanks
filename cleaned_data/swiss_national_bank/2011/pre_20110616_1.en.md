### Monetary policy assessment of 16 June 2011 


### Swiss National Bank maintains expansionary monetary policy

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is maintaining its expansionary monetary policy. The target
range for the three-month Libor remains at 0.0–0.75%, and the SNB intends to keep the
Libor within the lower part of the target range at around 0.25%.

The global economic recovery is continuing, even if the outlook has dampened somewhat
in the past few weeks. The level of capacity utilisation in the Swiss economy is rising.
Despite the strong appreciation of the Swiss franc, the economy continues to benefit from
robust international demand. However, margins in the export industry are coming under
increasing pressure. For 2011, the SNB is maintaining its forecast of real growth in Swiss
GDP of around 2%.

Overall, however, downside risks predominate. These include, in particular, the debt
problems in the euro area periphery. In addition, high deficits require several countries in
various parts of the world to undertake fiscal consolidation measures, economic fragility
notwithstanding. The recent commodity price increase weighs on global economic growth
and poses upside risks to inflation. In Switzerland, the main risks remain, on the one
hand, the effects of the strong Swiss franc on the export industry and, on the other, the
danger of overheating in the real estate sector.

Until the beginning of 2012, the path of the SNB’s conditional inflation forecast lies
above that of the previous quarter’s forecast. This is attributable to the assumption of
higher oil prices compared to the previous quarter and somewhat higher import prices.
Assuming an unchanged three-month Libor of 0.25% over the forecast horizon, the SNB
expects average inflation rates of 0.9% for 2011, 1.0% for 2012 and 1.7% for 2013. Over
the course of 2012, the path of the new forecast is lower than that of March because of
the latest appreciation of the Swiss franc and the slightly slower development of
international growth. Towards the end of the forecast period, inflation rises briskly and
exceeds the upper bound of 2%. This shows that the current expansionary monetary policy
cannot be maintained over the entire forecast horizon without compromising price
stability in the long term. Due to the risks mentioned previously, the conditional inflation
forecast is however associated with a high level of uncertainty
