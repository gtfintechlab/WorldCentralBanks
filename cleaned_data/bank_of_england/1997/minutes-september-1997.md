#### These are the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting held on 10 and 11 September 1997. They are also available on the Internet (http://www.bankofengland.co.uk.).

 The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced on 6 May that the Government was giving the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The Committee meets on a regular monthly basis and minutes of its meetings are released no later than 6 weeks after each meeting. Accordingly, the minutes of the Committee meeting held on 8 and 9 October will be published on 12 November.

**MINUTES OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING ON**

**10-11 SEPTEMBER 1997**

1 The meeting took place against the background of an earlier presentation by Bank staff of the

most recent data on monetary and economic conditions. The presentation is summarised in the

Annex, updated for the data which subsequently became available before the Monetary Policy

Committee meeting.

2 The Committee began its meeting by recalling the statement in the August Inflation Report

that: “... the MPC concluded that monetary policy has now reached a position at which it should be

possible to pause in order to assess the direction in which the risks are likely to materialise.”. An

overview of the subsequent data suggested a mixed picture. Domestic demand continued to grow

strongly and, whilst the exchange rate had fallen back from its peak, it remained some 20% above the

level in August 1996. The latest revision of the manufacturing output data had eliminated the

slowdown signalled earlier; but survey evidence still warned of a slowing in activity ahead. The

financial market price movements following the August announcement of the 25bp rate rise showed a

fall and subsequent partial reversal in short-term interest rate expectations, but a more sustained fall

in sterling.

3 The Committee went on to examine this overview under three headings: demand and output,

including the impact of asset price developments; monetary aggregates; and the labour market.

**Demand and output**

4 The Committee discussed the implications of the new Mori survey on demutualisation

windfalls. The survey results broadly confirmed the assumptions used in the August Inflation Report.

However, the survey suggested that the time profile would show a more concentrated impact in mid
1997 when the payments were made, arising from the immediate impact on those freed from their

liquidity constraint; and a smaller impact next year and the year after.

5 The latest BRC survey indicated a slowdown in retail sales in August. This was consistent

with suggestions that the immediate effect of the windfalls had begun to tail off, although it was also

noted that much of the windfall expenditure, for example on cars and foreign holidays, would not be

captured by the retail sales measure. It was also pointed out that other survey and anecdotal


-----

evidence, and the data from some retail groups, pointed to a weaker August than July; and that this

would be consistent with the M0 data.

6 Overall the Committee thought that the Mori survey results, taken on their own, suggested

that windfalls posed a smaller upside risk to the central projection in the Inflation Report than had

earlier been thought. The Mori survey had not confirmed some of the more extreme estimates which

had been suggested.

7 Moving on to fixed investment, Committee members discussed the preliminary aggregate data

which showed investment barely rising. By contrast some sectoral data showed investment rising

robustly in the second quarter, and it seemed unlikely that those sectors for which data were not yet

available - private residential and public sector investment - would have fallen sufficiently sharply to

validate the aggregate data. The Committee therefore thought that the aggregate figure might be

revised upwards.

8 As for external trade, the Committee noted the suggestions by Bank staff that import prices

for the EU might have been overestimated and import volumes commensurately underestimated. If

this proved true, it would imply that the domestic value added component of UK inflation would

have been correspondingly higher, since there was no evidence of distortions to the RPI, and a higher

level of domestically generated inflation would be a cause for concern.

9 The Committee reviewed the puzzling relationship between the rising exchange rate and

robust trade volumes. It was agreed that modelling trade was problematic, in other countries as in the

UK, with income and relative price effects rarely providing a complete explanation of the data. Time

trends to capture other influences were frequently used but were not informative. One possible view

was that there had been a fundamental improvement in the UK’s underlying trade performance which

had led to, and to some extent offset, sterling appreciation. Another view was that the lags in

transmitting exchange rate movements were longer than expected. Firms would try to maintain

export market share in the face of uncertainty about how long sterling’s appreciation would be

sustained. For at least some firms, the strength of domestic margins would have helped them absorb

the squeeze on export margins. On this view the impact of the appreciation would eventually come

through, although sterling’s recent retreat might moderate its scale.

10 Committee members noted that the survey evidence continued to point to a deteriorating

export outlook. Whilst the most recent data for continental economies suggested that economic

growth was picking up, much of this was export rather than domestic demand led. The recent


-----

financial crises in Asia would tend to reduce external demand but, unless the problems became more

widespread, probably not by a significant amount or for very long. Overall the Committee saw no

reason to change the central projection of the August Inflation Report, that the appreciation of

sterling since August would cause net exports to make a significant negative contribution to GDP

over the next two years.

11 The Committee noted the evidence, including the latest CIPS survey, that service sector

output, whilst still growing strongly, had decelerated a bit in Q3, following strong recorded growth in

Q2. Meanwhile the latest industrial production data contained significant back revisions, suggesting

that Q2 GDP growth might be revised upwards slightly. Manufacturing output looked less weak in

recent months than had previously been the case.

**Asset prices**

12 The Committee turned its attention to asset prices, particularly equities and the housing

market, noting that recent rises had been dominated by particular sectors (in the equity market) and

particular regions (in the housing market). Even at the aggregate level not all asset prices had been

growing strongly. For example, although Tobin’s Q, which is the ratio of the market valuation of

ICCs to the replacement cost of their capital stock, is estimated to have been exceptionally strong in

the 1990s, the prices of industrial, retail and office property had been growing this year by only 3 to

4% per annum, after falling by between 5 and 10% during 1995.

13 As regards house prices, it was hard to interpret the latest data, given the increasing

divergence between the Halifax index, with its longer track record and bigger sample, and the

Nationwide index, which was showing faster growth in line with DoE data. Part of the rapid rise in

house prices may have represented a bounceback from the low levels associated with debt deflation

in the late 1980s and early 1990s. On this view, house price inflation should moderate as

debt:income ratios fall back to more normal levels. This could explain the recent moderation in the

Halifax index. However the Nationwide and DoE indices were less reassuring. The Committee noted

that rising house prices would have contributed to the rise in consumer confidence reported by

surveys. These surveys were regarded as corroborative, rather than independent, evidence of strong

consumer demand.

14 High and rising stock market prices were a concern both because of their immediate

contribution to the rapid growth of consumption and because, if they proved unsustainable and fell


-----

abruptly, they might create a shock to the real economy. Some comfort on the latter point could be

taken from the relatively small percentages of loans collateralised against stocks and shares.

15 The Committee considered the proposition that the impact of equity price movements could

have been increased by wider share ownership. The number of individuals holding shares had been

increased both by the recent demutualisations and by the earlier privatisations, but the aggregate

value of direct holdings remained small. The value of equity held indirectly through pensions had

significantly increased during the past decade. If equity prices fell sharply, future pensions paid out

of defined-contribution schemes might be lower, and companies with defined-benefit pension

schemes might have to make larger contributions, so that their shareholders might suffer. The

Committee concluded that there was no simple relationship between asset prices and future inflation

but it was essential to continue to review asset price developments.

**Money**

16 The Committee discussed how to interpret the divergent money data: narrow money had

decelerated but broad money, whether measured by M4 or Divisia money, had accelerated. The rise

in narrow money velocity might be explained by the period of adjustment to a low inflation

environment coming to an end, but it might also reflect a slowdown in consumer spending.

17 The Committee noted the divergence between the bank and building society components of

retail M4. If the strong inflows into building societies had been encouraged by speculation about

future demutualisations, then the resulting balances could perhaps be regarded as temporary

investment rather than transaction balances. Bank staff were continuing to analyse the significance

within M4 of OFIs’ holdings but no new information had come to hand.

**Labour market**

18 Discussion turned to the state of the labour market. The falls in unemployment continued to

indicate tightening, although the pace had been exaggerated by the impact of the Jobseeker’s

Allowance (JSA) on the claimant count figures. This distinction did not directly affect

unemployment as measured by the Labour Force Survey. Measured in this way, short-term

unemployment was now lower than at any time since the Survey was first published in the early

1980s. Business surveys and the Bank Agents’ contacts continued to indicate tightening and skill

shortages .


-----

19 This evidence, together with stable earnings growth, could be taken to imply that the rate

of unemployment consistent with a stable rate of inflation was lower than previously thought. Job

insecurity might have been a stronger factor; or inflation expectations might have been more subdued.

But it was also possible that the growth in average earnings could suddenly increase as in the late

1980s after a long period of stability. This remained an upside risk to the central projection for

inflation.

20 The Committee considered the alternative proposition that a significant degree of slack

remained in the labour market. Hours worked per week, although rising over the last few years,

remained below the peak of the late 1980s; employment as a percentage of the working population

showed a similar picture; and the inactivity rate had changed little since the recovery began. Such

indicators might suggest that there was still potential to increase employment without reducing

unemployment, in which case upward pressure on wages would be deferred.

21 The Committee concluded that uncertainties remained about how much further tightening of

the labour market could be tolerated without generating upward pressure on wages. It would be

unwise in the current state of knowledge to take a strong view about the level of the natural rate of

unemployment; but it remained essential to monitor closely wage settlements and average earnings.

**Financial markets**

22 The Committee discussed the main market movements since the August meeting. The

exchange rate had fallen, particularly against the DM, but the fall in the UK yield curve relative to

that abroad immediately following the August meeting had since been reversed, so that changes in

relative monetary conditions did not appear to have contributed significantly to the fall in sterling.

The Committee discussed whether sterling’s fall could be explained by changed views about the

prospect for EMU. The chances of countries meeting the fiscal convergence criteria were perceived

by the market to have increased, as continental economies recovered. Bond market data showed no

evidence of a prospective high-inflation euro, but nor had they for some time. A more confident

market view towards the euro may have lessened the attraction of sterling as a safe haven currency.

**Summary and policy conclusion**

23 The Committee agreed that the evidence over the last month did not point conclusively in

either direction, nor resolve the main uncertainties. The upward revisions to industrial production

suggested that GDP might have been a little higher in Q2 than earlier thought. The survey evidence

on windfalls provided some reassurance that one of the upside risks to the Bank’s central projection


-----

for inflation might prove less serious than earlier thought. There were uncertainties about the trend

in house prices; whilst equity prices remained an upside risk although no more so than last month.

There was no new evidence on the pace and impact of fiscal consolidation. The trade data continued

to be stronger than expected, and their future deterioration remained uncertain. M4 remained a clear

upside risk. The possibility that labour costs might suddenly accelerate sharply, as in the 1980s,

could not be excluded but equally some remaining degree of slack in the labour market could not be

ruled out.

24 In the light of the conclusion of the August Inflation Report, and the fact that the subsequent

evidence did not point conclusively in either direction, the Committee voted unanimously to leave

interest rates unchanged.

**ANNEX:  SUMMARY OF DATA PRESENTED BY BANK STAFF**

1 This Annex summarises the data and analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary

Policy Committee ahead of its meeting.  At the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were

made aware of subsequent information that had become available, and this is reflected in this Annex.

**I** **Monetary conditions**

2 Notes and coin grew by 0.4% in August so that the twelve-month growth rate continued to

fall, to 5.1% from 5.5% in June and 7.6% a year ago. Some of this deceleration might have been

associated with a decline over this period of tourist spending in the UK, as the strength of sterling

and demutualisation windfalls encouraged people to take holidays abroad. But some was probably

also explained by structural influences: narrow money growth had in recent years exceeded that of

retail spending, as individuals had adjusted their portfolios to accommodate higher transactions

balances to a low inflation environment, but this adjustment could be coming to an end.

3 However broad money grew strongly again in July. M4 increased by 1%, raising the three
month annualised growth rate to 13.7% and the twelve-month rate to 12%, higher than the broadly

10% rate observed for much of last year.

4 Retail M4 grew by 0.6% in July, down from the exceptionally strong rise of 1.1% in June. In

part this reflected the drawdown of Halifax deposits as the proceeds of sales of Halifax shares, which

had been placed temporarily on deposit in June, were subsequently withdrawn. Retail bank deposits

were unchanged in July whereas building society deposits grew exceptionally strongly, at 1.8%, and

it seemed plausible that at least part of the funds withdrawn from Halifax were transferred to building

societies, perhaps in the hope of gaining from subsequent demutualisation windfalls. Reflecting this,

the growth of individuals’ underlying M4 holdings had continued to rise, with the three-month

annualised rate at 10.5%, causing the twelve-month rate to rise to 7.8%.

5 Wholesale M4, which had grown only slowly in June, accelerated in July, though its monthly

growth of 1.7% was not out of line with the average this year.

6 There had been no new data on the sectoral composition of M4 growth. OFIs’ deposits were

thus still estimated to have contributed almost half of the growth in M4 over the past year. Rising


-----

asset prices and values would, under well-established portfolio theory, have been expected to lead

OFIs to hold higher money balances. But there may also have been causality in the other direction;

money balances in excess of some equilibrium might have been spent and helped to drive up asset

prices. Tentative analysis by Bank staff of life assurance and pension funds’ M4 holdings, which

had accounted for some 40% of the rise in OFIs’ M4 since 1995, appeared to indicate that LAPFs’

M4 balances may currently exceed equilibrium levels, with the risk that they could be run down,

contributing to higher asset prices in the process. But this analysis was obviously sensitive to the

measurement of equilibrium money holdings, which would in practice depend crucially on expected

returns from equities and other assets, and these were inevitably hard to model.

7 M4 lending grew by 0.5% in July, rather slower than the average monthly rate during 1997,

possibly because of a share redemption by a single company without which M4 lending might have

grown by up to 0.7%.

8 Although M4 growth had now reached 12%, M4 lending growth had not kept pace but rather

remained steady, at around 9%. The flows of M4 and M4 lending had been broadly comparable in

money value, as the contribution from other M4 counterparts had been roughly offsetting. In

particular, banks’ capital had risen with increased profitability, while banks’ net external outflows

had risen with increased sterling lending overseas. But the relative sizes of the outstanding stocks of

M4 lending and M4 meant that M4 growth had exceeded M4 lending when expressed in percentage

terms.

9 Within the (rather slower) growth in M4 lending in July, net secured borrowing by persons

continued its gradual pick-up but gross borrowing rose more, reflecting remortgage activity and/or a

greater rate of repayments. Persons’ net unsecured borrowing was much more subdued in July than

in recent months, with a very sharp rise of around £1 bn in repayments of consumer credit almost

certainly as a result of windfall receipts. But unsecured consumer credit continued to grow strongly,

at around 17% pa, and whilst some part of this may have been due to borrowing in anticipation of

receiving windfalls, this effect could well have been largely unwound in July. The underlying

strength of consumer borrowing reflected both higher personal wealth and reduced interest costs, as

credit card and unsecured personal loan spreads over market rates had fallen; it could therefore

persist.

10 As for asset prices, changes in monetary conditions at home and abroad over the past month

did not seem to have contributed to sterling’s depreciation, measured on an effective-rate basis; but


-----

changed market perceptions about prospects for monetary policy in Germany did, by contrast,

seem to have played a role in sterling’s depreciation against the DM.

11 Bank staff also noted that an analysis of recent movements in the interest rates applicable to

standard variable mortgages and to typical low-balance instant access deposit accounts showed that

recent increases in official rates had already been more than fully passed on into mortgage rates, an

unusually rapid response in relation to historical experience. Experience of deposit rates, however,

differed significantly. Whilst bank deposit rates had fully adjusted, building society rates had not

kept pace, not surprisingly given the scale of speculative inflows to this sector, whereas institutions

converting into banks had more than matched increases in official rates perhaps to try to stem

outflows following conversion.

**II** **Demand and output**

12 The first full, but provisional, estimates of GDP and its expenditure components in Q2

confirmed overall growth at 0.9% with non North Sea GDP revised down slightly also to this rate.

But, revisions to the level of manufacturing output had led to upward revisions of 0.2pp to the level

of industrial production. That was likely to lead to a small upward revision to GDP in Q2, assuming

no other offsetting revisions. Domestic demand growth was very strong (1.2%), although not quite

as strong as had been expected, with private consumption showing the most rapid growth (1.5%),

broadly in line with Bank staff’s expectation. Net trade exerted a negative contribution (-0.4%), but

this was less than had been expected and was in any event more than accounted for by oil and erratic

items. Fixed investment growth was surprisingly low, at 0.1%, which taken together with other

available data would imply weak government and private housing sectors.

13 Retail sales volumes grew by 0.3% in July, more slowly than the 0.7% monthly average in

the first half of the year, but this was nevertheless sufficient in combination with the strong growth

in May and June to keep the three-month (on previous three months) growth rate on a rising trend.

Compared with a year ago, retail sales volumes were 6.5% higher in July and 5.8% up in the latest

three months as a whole. Within retail sales, household goods were much less robust than in the

previous two months, but nevertheless the ONS estimated that some £100 mn of retail sales in

household goods stores in July were exceptional and indicative of windfall-related spending; and

Bank staff calculated an equivalent figure of some £300-£400 mn using a deviation from trend

method, over the three months to July, a figure much lower than some other estimates but consistent

with the Mori survey (see below).


-----

14 In contrast to the official retail sales data, which were consistent with continuing strong

consumer confidence data, the CBI distributive trades survey suggested slowing retail sales growth.

The survey nevertheless interestingly showed a sharp increase in retail import penetration to the

highest level since May 1990.

15 There were record car registrations in August, up 10% from last August, with business and

fleet sales rather surprisingly stronger than private. Some 68% of sales were imported, up from 63%

last August, helping to explain why domestic car output was significantly less buoyant.

16 An assessment of developments in the housing market continued to be clouded by the

divergent Halifax and Nationwide house price data: the Halifax index was decelerating, to 6.4% in the

year to August, whereas the Nationwide index had continued to accelerate, to just over 12% in

August. Analysis of their regional components showed that most of the difference lies in parts of the

Midlands, North of England and Northern Ireland; both indices confirmed the strength of the market

in London and the South East. Overall housing market indicators gave a mixed picture of both house

price inflation and activity.

17 Finally in the personal sector, Bank staff focused on the results, published on 5 September,

of the Mori survey of the response of consumers to the windfall receipts from the demutualisations

in the building society and insurance sectors, and provided a preliminary assessment of their

implications. The survey was conducted in late August, with telephone interviews of 764 individuals

all of whom had received at least one of the four largest windfalls (which accounted for just under

£31 bn of total windfalls of nearly £36 bn).

18 The main findings were that:

- by value, some 35% of free shares had already been sold, implying additional sales beyond those

who had pre-registered to sell;

- of which some 47% of the proceeds had been spent and the same proportion saved, with 6% used

to repay debt;

- home improvements had been the biggest expenditure category, with holidays, cars and household

goods receiving rather smaller proportions;


-----

- nearly 40% of the reported spending would have occurred anyway, financed in other ways,

giving additional spending on household goods around the time of the flotations, for example, of

around £450 mn, not inconsistent with an ONS estimate of some £300 mn in June and July

together;

- only a small amount of the windfall receipts were used to bring forward consumption in

anticipation; and

- the proceeds were used to repay some £800 mn of borrowing, suggesting this as a major

explanation for the July consumer credit data.

19 Taking the survey results at face value, total spending from windfalls were estimated at

around £10 bn, of which around £6 bn was additional (see below).

20 However, the relaxation of financing constraints on consumers could give rise to further

spending which was more difficult to quantify, so the survey alone was likely to provide a lower

bound for estimated additional spending. It was questionable whether the survey had captured

accurately the incremental spending by individuals who were not liquidity constrained. Theory

suggested that these individuals would smooth their additional consumption, spending the annuity

value in each year: for example, the annuity value of a windfall of £2,000 spread over 30 years with a

real interest rate of 4% was a little over £100.  It was not clear that these individuals would identify

a relatively small increase in spending as a “windfall effect”: in responding to the survey, a large

proportion may well have answered that their spending had not increased - ie as if they had saved

their windfall. If an adjustment was added to the survey results for such an annuity effect, the total

-----

impact on domestic demand over 1997 to 1998 would be close to the estimate embodied in the

August Inflation Report forecast, although the survey suggested a more concentrated impact than

previously thought.

21 The preliminary Q2 figure for aggregate investment, which barely showed an increase, was

hard to square with the available partial sectoral data. Manufacturing investment continued to recover

from the sharp falls in 1996 whilst investment in the services sector continued to grow strongly; and

overall the trends in investment were unchanged despite a weak aggregate figure. To assist an

assessment of the prospects for investment, the Bank’s Agents had undertaken in mid-to-late-August

a survey of 113 diverse UK companies in manufacturing and services. The survey had confirmed the

rather greater readiness to invest of the service sector - driven in particular by capacity shortages 
than manufacturing - where cost and efficiency considerations were judged more influential. The

survey suggested that overall there may be a slowdown next year, reflecting to some extent

uncertainties about demand. The strength of sterling did not appear to be a significant deterrent for

most companies (although a more important factor than two years ago), perhaps because of the

proportion of capital goods imported. Companies with overseas investment programmes on balance

expected to increase the proportion spent overseas.

22 Stockbuilding was estimated to have contributed positively to GDP in Q2 but the data were

particularly subject to revision.

23 The latest public sector data, for July, were encouraging, with rather greater tax revenues

than expected contributing to a reduced PSBR, but much of this may simply have reflected the timing

of payments.

24 The external trade volume data remained surprisingly strong in the face of sterling’s

appreciation. More than all of the estimated negative (0.4%) contribution of net trade to GDP

growth in Q2 could be explained by oil and erratics. Robust growth in overseas markets, especially

in the US in Q2, may have had a stronger than expected offsetting effect. Disaggregated data

suggested that there might be a positive correlation between those sectors most exposed externally, as

measured by the contribution of exports and degree of import penetration, and a weakening in output

growth. It was possible that sterling’s appreciation may have had a greater impact on trade volumes

than the aggregate data indicated, and this could also help to explain a growing puzzle in trying to

equate the supply of and demand for manufactured goods. A large gap had opened up between the

strong growth in retail sales and much weaker manufactured consumer goods output, which could be

at least partly explained by a more rapid growth than so far identified in manufactured import


-----

volumes. Upward revisions to the level of manufacturing output, published with the July data, still

left a significant gap.

25 Industrial production had risen by 0.6% in July; and manufacturing production by 0.4%.

Large upward revisions to the level of manufacturing output in the first six months of 1997 were also

published. These had had the effect of raising the level of the June index by 0.7pp from that

previously estimated.

26 The latest survey evidence for manufacturing, from CIPS and other surveys, showed further

weakening in export orders; and there were suggestions in a number of recent surveys (BCC, CIPS

and CBI financial services) that sterling’s appreciation might have been beginning also to affect

services.

**III** **Labour market**

27 There was little news in the labour market data this month. Claimant count unemployment

fell by 50,000 in July to 1.55 mn, the lowest level for 17 years, representing 5.5% of the workforce.

Some 20,000 of the fall was explained by rather fewer students than normal registering, possibly

deterred by the tighter JSA rules.

28 The number of notified vacancies increased by 1,500, less than the recent monthly average

of around 3,500. Whilst the inflow of notified vacancies was declining, placings were declining even

faster, perhaps reflecting skill shortages.

29 Underlying average earnings growth was estimated to have remained unchanged at 4 % in

June, with services unchanged at 4 % and manufacturing unchanged at 4 %. As a result, average

earnings growth in Q2 was lower than in Q1 when bonuses inflated the data: after smoothing for

bonuses, average earnings were currently estimated by Bank staff to be growing at a little under 4 %.

30 There was no significant change in wage settlements in the twelve months to July, with

whole economy settlements continuing to grow at 3.1%, with private and public sector components

at 3.5% and 2.7% respectively. Within the private sector, services - at 3.6% - were running ahead of

the production industries - at 3.2%. The Bank’s Agents continued to corroborate reports of quite

widespread skill shortages in specific sectors and evidence of pay premia to retain key staff. The 5%

construction workers’ settlement would affect the August data, significantly raising the three-month

rate then.


-----

**IV** **Prices**

31 The Bank’s index of sterling commodity prices (weighted by UK usage) showed a further

small fall in July, to 7.3% below a year ago. By contrast the Economist index showed a small rise in

dollar commodity prices in recent months, particularly because of the rather bigger weight attached to

metals prices. Oil prices had risen in early August on uncertainties over Iraqi supplies, but had since

fallen back to their July level.

32 Although producer input prices fell again in July, under the influence of sterling appreciation

and favourable supply conditions, they rather unexpectedly increased in August, by 0.6% to stand

7.8 % below a year ago, under the impact particularly of higher oil and zinc prices. Producer output

prices showed a modest rise in July, accounted for by higher excise duties, and again in August, when

there were small increases spread across a range of industries. Output prices were now 1.4% above a

year ago. Difficulties in raising prices of goods for domestic consumption in the face of competition

from imports were widely reported.

33 Export prices had been slow to react to sterling’s appreciation but there was evidence of an

increasing impact: in Q2, excluding oil and erratics, sterling export prices were 1.7% lower than in

Q1, on a non-annualised basis, with prices to the non-EU falling faster than to the EU.

34 Import prices continued to fall steadily, to a level in June some 6% lower than last August

when sterling began to appreciate, but nevertheless the pace of the pass-through had been slow. The

partial non-EU data indicated a further fall in July. Bank staff pointed out that the ONS did not

collect import prices for distinct EU and non-EU goods, but used trade value weights to derive

different price indices. This could explain why import volumes appeared, oddly, to have been

growing much faster from non-EU countries. It is conceivable that, within the growing value data,

import prices from the EU might have been overestimated and volumes commensurately

underestimated. Moreover the method for estimating total import prices left open the possibility

that they may have been overstated (particularly for finished manufactures); and even quite a small

measurement error could have had significant effects, through import volumes, on the GDP

expenditure estimates (and hence on the reconciliation with GDP on an output basis).

35 Manufacturers’ domestic margins were estimated to be widening only slowly despite falling

input prices, and export margins were narrowing as export prices fell. By contrast estimates of

retailers’ margins showed a marked further rise in Q2, as retail prices continued to rise in the face of


-----

strong retail sales volumes whilst weighted costs decelerated and began to fall, with falling fuel costs

recently and bought-in goods prices, notably foods, over the last year.

36 RPIX inflation fell back a little in August, to 2.8% from 3% in July, following the unwinding

of recent increases in seasonal food prices. RPIY inflation moderated slightly, to 2.1% in August.

By contrast, headline RPI inflation increased to 3.5%, from 3.3% in July and 2.9% in June, under the

influence of mortgage interest rate changes this year and last.

37 On an international comparison, UK inflation clearly stood above many other major

countries: within Europe on the harmonised CPI measure, where the UK stood in July at 2%, only

Denmark and Greece had higher inflation (on the latest comprehensive data for June).

38 Looking ahead, with cost pressures remaining weak and as sterling’s appreciation continued

to have an impact, RPIX inflation was expected to moderate, although the risks remained on the

upside.

39 The sterling ERI stood at 99.9 (1990 average = 100) at the close of business on

10 September, 4% lower than the level (103.9) on 6 August, the eve of the final part of the August

Committee. Over this period sterling had fallen by 5% against the Deutschemark, although by only

1% against the dollar. Since its peak on 23 July, sterling had fallen back by 6.8% on its ERI, and by

7.5% and 5.9% against the DM and dollar respectively.

40 The foreign exchange markets had been volatile in August, even more so than normal. The

DM had recovered some of its recent losses, particularly against the US dollar and sterling, on a belief

that the strengthening German economy could lead the Bundesbank to begin raising interest rates later

this year, earlier than previously thought. But the yen had weakened, as the large depreciations in

many SE Asian currencies encouraged the view that the Japanese authorities would be less hostile to

a lower value for the yen in order to alleviate some of the competitive losses which Japan would

otherwise suffer.

41 Sterling had fallen sharply, against the dollar, DM and on the ERI, in the aftermath of the

Committee announcement accompanying the % rise in interest rates on 7 August. It had fallen

further on 13 August, as the Inflation Report had confirmed the message that the central projection

for inflation two years ahead was in line with the inflation target, although with the risks skewed on

the upside, and as the Bundesbank had published its monthly report which had led to speculation

about a possible rise in German interest rates. Sterling might also have been affected by market

rumours, subsequently denied by HM Treasury, that the Government would take the UK into the

single currency.

42 In the middle of August sterling had briefly rallied as the dollar had begun to move up, but

towards end-August and in early September it had subsequently softened again.  It was noteworthy

that in this latest period sterling had not generally moved up on those occasions when the dollar had

rallied, so that the sterling:dollar rate had fallen back below 1.60 and indeed below technical support

levels, which had encouraged further selling. Some part of this may have been due to renewed market

discussion of a possible postponement of EMU, which some believe would increase the possibility

of sterling’s inclusion.

43 Not surprisingly, sterling’s sharp downward adjustment against the DM, but also to a lesser

extent against the dollar, had increased market uncertainty about particularly the immediate future

prospect for sterling. Options prices revealed that since the last Committee meeting the market had

come to attach a higher probability to sterling falling further, particularly against the DM. Whereas

on 6 August the probability of the £:DM rate being at or below 2.80 one month ahead had been

calculated at under 5%, this probability had increased to nearly 25% by 4 September (when the one

month forward rate stood at DM 2.87).

44 In the domestic markets, interest rate expectations were immediately moderated by the

Committee announcement on 7 August, falling by as much as 12 basis points in 1998. But

expectations had subsequently firmed through much of August, both on the perceived greater

prospect of higher international interest rates and on the release of strong UK economic data,

particularly for retail sales and M4; although they had eased back again most recently. Overall

market expectations of interest rate prospects over the next eighteen months were a little lower than

on the first day of the last Committee meeting, by up to 15bp 18 months ahead. The markets

expected rates to peak early in 1998, % higher than current levels. Following the last Committee

statement, there was virtually no market expectation of any rise in official rise in September. It was

noteworthy from options prices that implied volatility of short-term interest rates had fallen sharply

in the wake of the August Committee announcement, as expectations had hardened around the central

view; but subsequent data releases later in August had led to renewed uncertainty.

45 The gilt market had been relatively thin and quiet in August, and overall less volatile than

other international bond markets. In the early part of the month, the nominal yield curve, which had

previously been virtually flat around 7%, had appeared to tilt upwards, with short yields falling and

long yields rising. But by early September the yield curve had again become effectively flat, close

to 7%.

46 Equity markets had been dominated by the sharp falls in the SE Asian markets but Western

markets had remained relatively insulated. There had nevertheless been increased volatility,

particularly in the US and UK, as doubts continued about whether the recent strength in equity

prices could be sustained. The FTSE 100 had fallen back since the August Committee meeting, under

the influence particularly of financial stocks, but the FTSE 250 and FTSE small cap indices were

higher. Closer analysis indicated that the five largest stocks (by capitalisation) had accounted for a

disproportionate share of recent large daily movements in the FTSE 100 index and, given the

international orientation of these companies, it was hard to read into them any message about

prospects for the UK economy.
