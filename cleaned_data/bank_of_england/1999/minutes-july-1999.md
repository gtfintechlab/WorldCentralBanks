## MINUTES OF
# MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING

## 7 and 8 July 1999

##### These are the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting held on 7 and 8 July 1999. They are also available on the Internet (http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/mpc9907.pdf).

 The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the GovernmentÕs inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the BankÕs Monetary Policy Committee. The Committee meets on a regular monthly basis and minutes of its meetings are released on the Wednesday of the second week after the meeting takes place. Accordingly, the minutes of the Committee meeting held on 4 and 5 August will be published on 18 August 1999.

#### MINUTES OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING ON 7-8 JULY 1999

1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed the

world economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; the labour

market; prices and costs; and other issues relevant to its decision.

**The world economy**

2 The Committee considered whether the gradual improvement in the outlook for

the world economy had continued over the past month.

3 In the United States activity had remained robust, although consumption growth

had slowed a little. The Federal Open Markets Committee had raised rates by

25 basis points, accompanying this with a statement that it no longer had a bias to

tighten policy. This had been interpreted by the markets as a sign that the prospect of

further increases in official rates was now less immediate than they had believed

before, and equity prices had reached new highs. The timing and extent of any

slowdown in activity in the United States remained unclear, and it was possible that

growth might stay above trend for longer than previously thought.

4 Business confidence had picked up a little in Germany and France, with orders in

Germany and Italy also showing some signs of recovery. While the steepening of the

euro yield curve might reflect some upwards revision in views on activity, this

explanation was not consistent with the recent depreciation of the euro. There was

market comment that these recent movements might be explained by an increase in

concerns related to the fiscal position in the euro area.

5 In Japan the recorded path of output was likely to be volatile. GDP figures

indicated growth of 1.9% in the first quarter of 1999. Adjustments to reflect a variety

of factors, such as seasonal adjustment techniques, might lead to the initial estimate of

growth in Q1 being revised down, though it might still be above most earlier

forecasts. Even if such a revision were made, GDP might contract in the second


-----

quarter. Nevertheless base money growth continued to pick up, equity prices had

risen again and business confidence was a little less weak.

6 GDP forecasts compiled by Consensus Economics for the emerging market

economies had generally been revised up over the last month. However, this was not

so for some countries, such as Argentina, where yield spreads for government debt

over US Treasuries had also increased.

7 The Committee agreed that the prospects for growth in the world economy were

now a little stronger than a month ago, although arguably the uncertainties in the

United States had if anything increased. If growth in the United States remained

strong, and if the Asian recovery gathered pace, this might begin to put pressure on

non-oil commodity prices, some of which had already begun to rise, as had

commodity-related currencies and equities. It was also argued that the level of world

output remained below capacity and no major area except the United States was

expected to grow significantly faster than its long-term trend during the coming year

or two; such a persistence of spare capacity in both OECD and emerging market

economies would continue to restrain global prices for the time being.

**Monetary and financial conditions in the United Kingdom**

8 Growth in narrow money had risen, with notes and coin growing at their highest

rate since end-1996. This appeared to be consistent with a pick-up in retail sales in

Q2. While broad money growth had eased overall, this had not been reflected in the

household component. It might be that the reductions in official rates were feeding

through into broad money growth for households rather faster than expected, but this

was by no means certain. Total household borrowing remained robust, despite some

slowing in consumer credit growth.

9 Market expectations for interest rates at the shortest maturities were if anything a

little lower than a month ago. However, at the two to three year horizon, interest rates

implied by short-sterling futures contracts had increased by around 40 basis points.

This might reflect a market view about the cyclical path of interest rates, particularly

if market participants believed that the United Kingdom was now less likely to be part


-----

of Economic and Monetary Union in the near future. Alternatively, the rise in

expected UK interest rates might simply reflect the fact that euro rates had risen at the

same maturity; it was not clear whether such a high correlation was warranted.

Standard variable mortgage rates had moved little over the month; there was not yet

much pass-through into retail rates from last month’s reduction in official rates. With

the steepening in the yield curve, further increases in fixed rates on new mortgages

were possible.

10 The effective exchange rate index had fallen a little over the month, and was now

close to the central assumption in the May Inflation Report. It was difficult to tell

how much significance should be ascribed to this decline. Sterling had moved little

against the euro, which accounted for two thirds of the exchange rate index, and was

of considerable importance for many UK exporters. Sterling had fallen more against

the dollar and was outside the range within which it had traded for some time. The

question was raised of whether the significance of such a decline was fully captured

by the dollar’s weight in the effective index. To the extent that the linkage between

sterling and the dollar had weakened, sterling’s effective exchange rate might be less

susceptible to future movements in the dollar against third currencies.

**Demand and output**

11 While the estimate of GDP growth was unchanged for the first quarter, revisions

had been made to the expenditure components. Growth in consumption was higher

than had been thought earlier, and remained strong even when adjusted for a number

of special factors, such as a shift in the registration date for new vehicles. The decline

previously indicated for business investment had been reversed, although in overall

terms investment was flat because of a steep fall in the general government

component, which might reflect erratic timing factors. Final domestic demand had

been revised up, and was now estimated to have grown by over 1% in the quarter.

Much slower stockbuilding and a more negative contribution from net trade

(reflecting higher imports) had offset these revisions, leaving the level of GDP


-----

unchanged. It was likely that the lower starting point for stock levels would represent

a more secure base for output growth in the coming quarters.

12 Retail sales volumes in the three months to May were over 1% higher than in the

previous three months, and survey data also indicated a strengthening in activity, not

only in services but also in manufacturing and construction. However, reports from

the Bank’s regional Agents did not suggest much of an improvement in retail

conditions, with demand sluggish in many areas.

13 Data from surveys and other published sources had been used to produce

estimates for GDP in the second quarter, both by the National Institute for Economic

Research and by Bank staff. These suggested that growth in Q2 could be marginally

higher than in the central projection in the May Inflation Report. Such estimates were

subject to error, but appeared to indicate that the recovery in output growth was on

track, and that the prospects for activity were slightly better than had appeared a

month ago. One complication, however, was that the annual Blue Book dataset would

be published later in July, together with the full Quarterly National Accounts for Q1,

and might alter the measured profile of activity for recent years. But the size and

direction of any revisions were not yet known.

14 Indications from the housing market, reflecting data on prices, lending and

transactions, all suggested a continuing recovery from the previous autumn.

Developments in this area would require continued monitoring, although they were

not yet a cause for concern.

15 On balance, the Committee agreed that the news over the past month suggested

that the projected recovery in activity seemed to be underway and was if anything a

little faster than expected.

**The labour market**

16 Data on labour market quantities were also consistent with a somewhat stronger

path than had been expected for activity in Q2. Employment had continued to grow,

if at a slower pace, with the increase more than accounted for by full-time workers.


-----

Unemployment had again declined slightly, reflecting a fall in the numbers of the

short-term unemployed. Despite the slowdown in GDP growth over the past year, the

unemployment rate was little changed from its mid-1998 level. Overall, labour

market conditions remained somewhat tighter than had been expected, and the

possibility of a substantial rise in unemployment had diminished.

17 By contrast, growth in nominal earnings appeared to be slowing more than

expected, with the Average Earnings Index (AEI) showing a decline in earnings

growth in the private sector and in services. The fall in the twelve-month growth rate

to April was particularly marked, in part reflecting a fall in bonus payments by

comparison with a year ago. It would be unwise to place too much emphasis on a

single month’s figure for the AEI, but there were other signs of a deceleration in

private sector nominal earnings, for instance in the Reward index. The Bank’s

matched sample of private sector settlements also showed a decline, from 3.7% a year

ago to 3.1% in April, in contrast to the rise in public sector settlements.

18 Reports from the Bank’s regional Agents and the Federation of Recruitment and

Employment Services provided less evidence of downwards pressure on pay. Nor

was there any clear downward trend in the growth of earnings on a per hour basis. In

addition, one-year-ahead inflation expectations of trade unionists – as given by the

Barclays Basix survey – had fallen by 0.8 percentage points over the past year, rather

more than the fall in settlements, indicating that real wages were growing a little

faster than a year ago. Developments in the growth of nominal and real wages

therefore seemed to be rather different. An explanation might be that the effect of a

change in inflation expectations on wage settlements was typically less than one-for
one in the short-term.

19 The Committee noted that the National Minimum Wage had come into effect in

April and had been expected to raise measures of average earnings. However, around

half of those affected were thought to work in firms which were too small to be

covered in the AEI sample. This increased the difficulties of assessing the impact of

the minimum wage on earnings more generally. It was possible that more of the

effect from the National Minimum Wage had been reflected in earnings before April

than had previously been assumed.


-----

20 It was possible, however, that any deceleration in nominal earnings might prove

temporary. First, during the past year, RPI inflation had fallen from over 4% to 1.3%.

If this was the measure on which wage bargainers focussed, rather than RPIX, it

might help explain the slowdown in earnings growth. But as the impact of the

reduction in interest rates began to fade, growth in RPI would become closer to that of

RPIX. Second, the fall in settlements might reflect the plunge in business confidence

in the autumn, when expectations of future profits had been revised down, or the

sharp fall in consumer confidence, perhaps due to increasing fears of unemployment.

Since then, survey data pointed to a recovery in business and consumer confidence.

Third, lower bonus payments might reflect lower profits; if so this might reverse as

the economy recovered.

21 However, a temporary downward shock to inflation might persist for some time in

so far as the settlements sought by wage bargainers were determined by recent

inflation outturns. It was also possible that supply-side factors, such as the increasing

importance of the services sector, falling union membership, and labour market

reforms, might have reduced the rate of unemployment at which wage inflation would

tend to increase.

**Prices and costs**

22 RPIX inflation had fallen by more than expected in May, foreshadowed by the

ONS advance estimate available to the Committee at its June meeting. This was

largely accounted for by food prices, and to that extent the impact on prices two years

ahead was unclear. That depended, in part, on whether the weakness in non-seasonal

food prices was transient or reflected a trend towards a compression of retail margins.

Even if the food price weakness were transient, its impact on RPIX two years out

would depend on the degree of persistence of the effect of a temporary shock to

inflation. In May, other goods inflation had been marginally weaker than expected


-----

and services inflation marginally stronger. The annual retail sales deflator had fallen

in the year to May - the first fall since the series began in 1986.

23 Both oil and non-oil commodity prices were higher than a year ago and continuing

to rise, and evidence from the Bank’s regional Agents suggested that downwards

pressure on import prices might be moderating. But imported materials prices

continued to fall in May, and it was likely that some of the lagged effects of earlier

declines in import prices were still to come through to retail prices.

24 Figures for unit labour costs (derived from the wages, employment and output

figures), when taken together with price data, suggested that margins might be coming

under pressure. But margins might rise again if demand picked up. An alternative

possibility was that output (and hence productivity) was higher than suggested by

present estimates. In that case potential output could also be higher; if so, there

would be no implications for inflation.

25 The Committee noted that, in the short term, RPIX was likely to remain below

2.5%, but that the extent and duration of any undershoot was uncertain. It would

depend on the extent to which this fed through into inflation expectations, on future

movements in margins and the terms of trade, on changes in the output gap, and on

how changes in productivity fed through into real wages. More generally, the outlook

for prices given the prospective profile of activity was less clear than the prospects for

activity itself, which seemed to be somewhat stronger than earlier expected.

**Other issues**

26 The Committee noted that the analysis and projections to be carried out for the

August Inflation Report would allow it to reassess some of the puzzles in the data

over the next month: in particular the contrast between activity, which was somewhat

stronger than expected, and prices, which were somewhat weaker. In addition, later

in July new national accounts data would be published, more information on earnings

would become available, and it would be easier to assess the significance of sterling’s

recent movements, particularly against the dollar. While not of themselves

conclusive, these were reasons for waiting another month to get a clearer picture of


-----

the way in which the economy was developing.

**The immediate policy decision**

27 The Committee identified a variety of arguments for leaving the repo rate

unchanged at 5%. Indicators of activity had strengthened over the past month, both in

the United Kingdom and overseas. The pattern of revisions to GDP in the first

quarter, with stronger final domestic demand and imports, and weaker stockbuilding,

suggested stronger growth in subsequent quarters. Indications from surveys and retail

sales, as well as the money and employment data, also suggested that growth in Q2

would be a little stronger than expected last month. However, price indicators were

weaker than expected. The sharp fall in the twelve-month growth rate of the Average

Earnings Index needed more corroboration, but private sector settlements also

appeared to be slowing in nominal terms. Finally, the exchange rate had eased

slightly over the month, particularly against the dollar. The implication of these

factors for inflation over the next two years or so would be examined through the

work to be carried out for the August Inflation Report.

28 Further arguments for leaving the repo rate at 5% were advanced. One was that

given the impact of earlier interest rate reductions had yet to be fully seen, official

rates should be kept at 5% until evidence emerged of price pressures in either

direction. A second was that rates were now close to their neutral level, and that this

was appropriate given the state of the economic cycle and the evidence on

employment. A third argument was that against a background with a significant

probability for inflation to undershoot the target in the short term, the Committee

might be able to wait and see whether some of the developments, for instance in the

labour market, as was looking increasingly likely, reflected structural changes in the

economy.

29 On another view, it might have been preferable last month to have left the repo

rate unchanged for the reasons set out at the time. Developments over the month had

probably strengthened that argument. Although cost increases were lower than

expected, other indicators, such as domestic demand, money data and housing market

activity, were pointing to a less benign inflation outlook further ahead, and the


-----

exchange rate was back in line with the central assumption in the May Inflation

_Report. But there were two reasons for not reversing last month’s reduction. First, to_

do so might affect business and consumer confidence disproportionately. A reduction

followed by an immediate rise in interest rates, in the absence of significant news

about the economy, did not necessarily have the same impact on confidence as a

constant level of rates. Second, a reversal might wrongly be interpreted as a stronger

signal of the future path of interest rates than was warranted. It was desirable,

therefore, to leave the repo rate unchanged this month.

30 The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s

repo rate be maintained at 5.0%. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the

proposition.

#### ANNEX: SUMMARY OF DATA PRESENTED BY BANK STAFF

A1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the

Monetary Policy Committee on 2 July, in advance of its meeting on 7-8 July 1999. At

the start of the Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information

that had subsequently become available, and that information is included in the

Annex.

**I The international economy**

A2 The international environment had improved a little over the month. Activity

in the United States had remained strong, and survey data for the euro area had been

largely positive. Growth forecasts for Asia had been revised up.

A3 The final estimate of Q1 GDP growth in the United States had been revised up

to 1.1% quarter on quarter, reflecting a slightly less negative contribution from trade.

In Japan, the estimate for Q1 GDP growth had been surprisingly strong, at 1.9%

quarter on quarter. But this most probably overestimated underlying activity.

Monthly activity data had suggested weaker growth, and it is possible that some of the

public investment reflected orders booked in Q1 that would materialise in Q2.  In the

euro area, the preliminary estimate of Q1 GDP growth was 0.4% quarter on quarter,

in line with the May Inflation Report projection. Consumption and investment had

grown strongly, while net trade and destocking each subtracted from growth. In Italy,

GDP had increased by 0.2% in Q1.

A4 The pattern of growth in the major industrialised economies reflected ongoing

adjustment to the emerging market crises of the past two years: net trade had made a

negative contribution to growth in the major industrialised economies over the past

two quarters. Industrial production in the United States had remained steady at

around 2% at an annual rate. Data for the euro area as a whole were available only to

February. More timely data were available for some individual economies; German

industrial production had risen by 1.0% in April, but that was still 1.3% lower than a

year ago, while French industrial production had fallen by 0.3% in April, and had

been flat on the year-on-year comparison. Retail sales data had showed no sign of a


-----

slowdown in consumer spending in the United States. In Japan, retail sales had been

stronger than last month, but still lower than a year ago. In the euro area, lack of

timely data and distortions caused by the timing of Easter made retail sales data hard

to read; German retail sales had risen by 4% in March and fallen by 4% in April.

A5 In the United States, the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) had

increased the Federal Funds target rate by 25 basis points to 5.0% on 30 June and

reverted to a neutral stance towards monetary policy. Interest rates implied by futures

contracts had fallen after the FOMC announcement. Short-term inflation expectations

had picked up recently, possibly reflecting the rise in energy prices, but long-run

inflation expectations had remained flat. Overall the data suggested that consumption

had perhaps slowed a little in Q2, but nevertheless remained robust. Consumption

had risen in May, but sales data suggested a slowdown in June. Consumer confidence

and employment, however, had risen further in June. Some signs of slowing had been

apparent in housing sales, but mortgage growth, which appeared to have fuelled

consumption, had remained high.

A6 The forward-looking information available from surveys indicated a further

narrowing of the gap between business and consumer confidence in the euro area in

May and June. Business confidence had risen a little (from a low level) and consumer

confidence had fallen slightly (from a higher level). The IFO survey of business

confidence in western Germany and the French INSEE business survey had both risen

in May, partly reflecting improvements in foreign orders. Italian orders had also

picked up. In the United States, the National Association of Purchasing Managers

Index had risen above market expectations in June, reflecting rises in the sub-indices

for production and new orders. The export orders index had also risen. In Japan, the

Tankan survey had shown a small improvement in business sentiment, reflecting

better financial conditions.

A7 International data on consumer price inflation in May suggested that the pick
up in April had been temporary. In the United States, consumer price inflation fell to


-----

2.0%, from 2.3% in April; for Japan, May’s figure was -0.4%; and in the euro area

inflation on the harmonised measure had fallen back to 1.0%.

A8 Turning to global financial markets, the yen had reached a high of 118 against

the dollar around the time of the release of Q1 GDP. Since then, several rounds of

intervention had brought it back into the 120-122 range. Implied volatility had

subsequently fallen sharply. Japanese bond yields had risen slightly, and equities

more markedly, over the month, following the strong GDP data. In the euro area,

expectations of short-term interest rates had risen over the past month.

**II Monetary and financial conditions**

A9 Narrow money growth had remained robust. The twelve-month growth rate of

notes and coin, after adjusting for the introduction of the new 50 pence and £2 coins,

had risen to 7.0% in June, the highest rate since December 1996.

A10 M4 had risen by £3.4 billion (0.4%) in May. The annual rate of growth had

slowed to 7.0%. The slowdown in aggregate M4 and aggregate M4 lending had been

largely driven by Other Financial Corporations’ (OFCs’) M4 and M4 lending. OFCs’

M4 deposits had fallen by £2.0 billion in May, and lending to OFCs had fallen by

£1.8 billion in May.

A11 The M4 deposits of the household sector had risen by 0.6% (or £2.9 billion) in

May. The growth rate of households’ M4 deposits had increased generally since

1998 Q2. M4 lending to the household sector had remained strong; it had risen by

0.6% (or £3.1 billion) in May, leaving the twelve-month growth rate unchanged at

7.9%. Total lending secured on dwellings had fallen from £3.1 billion in April to

£2.7 billion in May, although gross lending had remained strong. Approvals in May

had been strong and, reflecting the current ‘tight’ state of the housing market, many

banks and building societies were now allowing consumers to carry approvals forward

if their offers were rejected. This had caused the stock of loan approvals outstanding

to rise sharply, and could have altered the relationship between the stock of approvals

and secured lending. Monthly consumer credit growth had fallen from 1.3% in April

to 0.6% in May, though this in part could have reflected a switch to mortgage equity


-----

withdrawal leaving total borrowing for consumption still strong in 1999 Q2.

Compared with a year earlier, consumer credit growth remained robust at over 17%.

A12 Private Non-Financial Corporations’ (PNFCs’) M4 deposits had been strong

in May, rising by 2.1% on the month (or £2.6 billion). However, this figure had been

inflated by a large temporary item; adjusting for this, the flow in May was negative.

Lending to PNFCs had fallen by 0.4% on the month (or £0.8 billion). The sharp rise

in capital issues since the beginning of the year had continued.

A13 Turning to price indicators of monetary conditions, interest rate expectations

implied by longer-dated short-sterling futures contracts had risen since the previous

MPC meeting: the rate implied by the September 2001 contract had risen by close to

40 basis points to around 6.80%. Expectations of interest rates in the euro area and

Japan had risen over the month, which might have contributed to the increase in

interest rates implied for the United Kingdom.

A14 Nominal forward rates at maturities of 3 to 5 years had risen by between

35 and 45 basis points since the previous meeting; this rise had been in line with the

rise in longer-dated short-sterling futures contracts. Longer rates (beyond about

9 years) had fallen by up to 55 basis points. This pattern had also been reflected in

swap rates and corporate bond yields which rose by similar amounts at 3 to 7-year

maturities.

A15 Real interest rates derived from the index-linked gilt market had been broadly

unchanged since the previous meeting, suggesting that the rise in nominal rates

largely reflected increased inflation expectations. Survey-based measures of inflation

expectations available each month had also risen, but by less than those implied by

yield curves. According to the survey measures, the rise in nominal interest rates

could be split approximately half and half between a rise in real rates and a rise in

inflation expectations.


-----

A16 The Consensus Economics Forecasts measure of the expected average

inflation rate over the next two years had risen since 1999 Q1 by 20 basis points, to

2.3% in 1999 Q2. But over the same time period, the Barclays Basix survey

suggested that inflation expectations for the next two years had ticked down. In

particular, trade union expectations for the year ahead had fallen from 2.7% in Q1 to

2.5%.

A17 The Bank’s survey of advertised interest rates suggested that the 25 basis

point cut in the repo rate in June had not been passed through to standard variable

mortgage rates. Moreover, fixed-rate mortgages had risen over the month: for

example, average 5-year fixed mortgage rates with no lock-in had risen by around

20 basis points to 6.20% in June. Furthermore, spreads between fixed-rate mortgages

and swap rates had narrowed in recent months, suggesting that further increases in

mortgage rates were possible. Unsecured loan rates and savings rates had been

broadly unchanged on the month.

A18 The FT-SE All-share index had risen by around 3% to 3069 since the previous

meeting, with small and mid-capitalisation stocks continuing to outperform the

FT-SE 100. Information technology, resources and cyclical consumer goods stocks

had performed relatively well over the month.

A19 The sterling effective index had fallen by 1.0% since the June meeting to

103.5, approximately 0.1% below the level implied by the central projection of the

May Inflation Report. Sterling had fallen by 0.6% against the euro and 2.6% against

the dollar. Movements in sterling over the month appeared largely unrelated to

changes in UK yields relative to overseas.

**III Demand and output**

A20 According to the latest ONS release, quarterly growth of GDP at constant

market prices had been unrevised at 0.0% in 1999 Q1. But the annual rate had been

revised up by 0.1 percentage points to 0.7%, and there had been revisions to the

expenditure composition of growth in Q1. No revisions had been made to previous

quarters, pending the release of the full 1999 Q1 National Accounts. Stronger


-----

household consumption and investment in Q1 had been offset by weaker contributions

from net trade and stockbuilding. The difference between final domestic demand and

GDP growth had widened in Q1.

A21 Quarterly growth of gross value added at constant basic prices had been

revised up from -0.1% to 0.0%, with service sector growth revised from 0.2% to

0.4%, largely the result of an upward revision to the transport and communications

sector (up from 0.2% to 1.3%). Excluding the erratic energy and agriculture sectors,

the quarterly growth rate of GDP had been 0.2%.

A22 Household consumption growth in Q1 had been revised up from 1.1% to

1.4%, the highest quarterly growth rate since 1997 Q2. Within this, spending on

vehicles, household goods, clothing and footwear, and financial services had been

particularly strong. The strength of spending on vehicles had probably been affected

by the timing change to new vehicle registrations.  But this had not accounted for all

the strength in spending in Q1.

A23 Government consumption growth had been unrevised at 1.4% on the previous

quarter. Investment growth in Q1 had been revised up from an unexpectedly low

-1.7% to 0.0%. Higher business investment, revised up from -2.0% to 1.7%, had

offset a sharp fall in general government investment (-19.2%). The increase in

investment had been concentrated in the service sector.

A24 On the income side of the accounts, the gross operating surplus of

corporations had been revised up from -3.2% to -3.0%. The sharp fall in Q1 had been

the largest since 1974 Q1, and was the result of a 4.2% fall in private non-financial

corporations, only partially offset by a 4.8% rise in financial corporations. The fall in

gross operating surplus had looked sharp, relative to survey evidence and profits

warnings, but the inclusion of the alignment adjustment had had a downward effect on

the growth of the gross operating surplus. Excluding the alignment adjustment, the

gross operating surplus of private non-financial corporations was flat, although the

annual rate was little different (at around 5%).

A25 The contribution from stockbuilding to GDP growth had been revised down


-----

from -0.2 percentage points to -0.4 percentage points. But excluding erratic items, the

contribution to GDP growth from stockbuilding was estimated to have been around

-0.2 percentage points.

A26 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted a survey of their contacts about

trends in stock-to-output ratios, both in the recent past and looking to the future. The

contacts had been from the manufacturing, retailing and wholesale sectors. The

Agents had asked how firms’ stock-to-output ratios had changed over the last five

years. The majority of respondents (56%) had reported falling ratios. When the

responses had been weighted according to firms’ turnover, the balance of those

reporting rising and falling ratios had been more even. A majority of retailers had

reported a rise in stock-to-output ratios on this basis, while manufacturers had

continued on balance to show a fall.

A27 The Agents had also asked about the future trend of stock-output ratios over

the next few years - excluding cyclical influences. A clear majority of respondents

had expected their stock-output ratios to fall. This result had been seen across all

three sectors. In the retailing sector, increased competition, pressure on profit margins

and improvements in information technology had been seen as the drivers of the

expected reduction in stock levels as a proportion of sales. A majority of respondents

had expected future falls in stock-output ratios to be similar to those in the past, with

the exception of retailers.

A28 The contribution of net trade to GDP growth had been revised down to

-0.7 percentage points from -0.5 percentage points. This had reflected an upward

revision to import growth, from 0.3% to 1.1%, which had more than offset the upward

revision to export growth (from -1.4% to -1.0%). The Q1 net trade deficit, at 4.5% of

GDP, had been the second highest on record.

A29 Retail sales volumes had risen by 1.0% in May, following a revised fall of

-0.3% in April. The three month growth rate (on the previous three months) had risen

from 0.6% to 1.1%. The CBI Distributive Trades survey had suggested continued

strength in June with the balance on reported sales at +22, up from +11 in May. The

GfK measure of consumer confidence had suggested robust spending growth in Q2;


-----

the index had been broadly unchanged in June at 5.8.

A30 Most indicators had suggested continuing strength in the housing market. The

Nationwide house price index had risen by 0.8% in June; the Halifax index had risen

by 1.8%. The annual rates of the two indices had moved closer, at 7.5% and 6.6%

respectively. Housing starts had continued to rise from their trough in the autumn of

1998, and the House Builders’ Federation survey balance on net reservations had

remained at a strong level despite a slight fall in May. The improvement in starts was

expected to feed through to higher completions and investment in dwellings over

time. Particulars delivered in the three months to May had risen by 3.5% compared

with the previous three months, but were 5.4% up on a year earlier. The Royal

Institute of Chartered Surveyors’ survey had shown a rise in the number of sales per

agent in May for the second consecutive month.

A31 Construction output had risen by 0.2% in 1999 Q1 and had been broadly flat

over the last three quarters. The volume of orders for new work had been slightly

weaker over the last two quarters, but was expected to underpin construction output in

the short term. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) construction

survey had indicated rising optimism and orders: the construction activity index had

risen to 64.5 in June from 62.4. Within this, housing activity had risen faster than

total construction, consistent with the pick-up in housing market indicators.

A32 The outlook for manufacturing output had improved in June. The CIPS

activity index had been above 50 for the third consecutive month. The expected

output balance from the CBI survey had been positive in June, for the second month

running. The CBI new orders balance had fallen slightly in June, with manufacturers

citing the strong pound and weak European demand. Industrial production had risen

by 0.1% in May. The CIPS services activity index had been broadly unchanged in

June at 56.6. The new business index, at 58.5, had been at its highest level since

March 1998.

**IV The labour market**

A33 Employment growth, as measured by the Labour Force Survey (LFS), had


-----

slowed further in the three months to April compared with the previous three months,

rising by 46,000 (0.2%). Workforce jobs had fallen by around 4,000 in Q1. There

had been an increasing divergence between the two employment measures over the

past year. During this period, LFS employment had risen by around 300,000 whereas

Workforce jobs were only 85,000 higher. The increase in LFS employment during

February-April had been more than accounted for by a rise of 57,000 in full-time

employment and, consequently, the slowdown in employment growth was less

evident in full-time equivalent terms. Higher employment had been offset by average

hours per worker falling by 0.3% from the previous three months. Total hours had

therefore fallen slightly over the quarter (by 0.2%), but overall, had been broadly flat

for a year.

A34 Turning to survey information, the CIPS manufacturing survey for June

showed that employment had fallen further during the month, though the rate of

decline had slowed. In the construction and service sectors employment had

expanded further, and at slightly faster rates than they had in May. The Manpower

survey of employment prospects for Q3 had shown little change, with the service and

public sectors weaker and the manufacturing sector stronger. Information from the

Bank’s regional Agents suggested that further manufacturing redundancies would be

offset by job creation in services, especially in the hotel and transport sectors, where

the Working Time Directive was having a significant impact.

A35 Data problems persisted with the stock of unfilled vacancies in

Northern Ireland and the West Midlands. Notifications of vacancies had fallen by

15,700 in May, although the trend had been flat. Overall, there had been no clear

news in the vacancies data.

A36 Both measures of unemployment had fallen. LFS unemployment had fallen

by 23,000 to 6.2% in February-April, while the claimant count had fallen by 6,500 in

May with the rate unchanged at 4.5%. On both measures, unemployment rates had

changed little since mid-1998. The latest fall in LFS unemployment had been mainly

among the short-term unemployed. Long-term unemployment had been flat.

Changes in the regional pattern of unemployment had been consistent with the strong

growth in service sector activity and the decline in manufacturing activity.


-----

A37 Inactivity had risen by 25,000 in the three months to April compared with the

previous three months, which represented the first increase since mid-1998. This

increase had been driven by a rise of 50,000 in the number of people who did not

want a job.

A38 Annual headline earnings growth for the whole economy had fallen from

4.8% to 4.6% in April. The fall in the headline rate was accounted for by private

sector earnings growth, which had fallen by 0.4 percentage points. Public sector

earnings growth had risen by 0.1 percentage points. The fall in private sector earnings

growth had been particularly surprising given the introduction of the National

Minimum Wage (NMW) in April, which had been expected to push up earnings

growth. However, it was possible that some firms may have anticipated its

introduction and had raised wages before the introduction date. The largest fall in

earnings growth was in the services sector, where earnings had fallen 1.1 percentage

points in the twelve months to April. In manufacturing, on the other hand, annual

earnings growth had increased by 0.2 percentage points. The ONS had said that the

fall in earnings growth was partly the result of a broadly based fall in bonuses in the

business services sector, and partly the result of some firms paying their bonuses in

Q1 rather than in April, as they had done last year.

A39 Information from private surveys had suggested that earnings growth was

either flat or had fallen slightly. The Reward index had fallen from 3.9% in April to

3.6% in May. The Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services survey on

salaries and wage rates in June indicated that earnings growth was unchanged,

although the survey was based on a small sample.

A40 Wage settlements in May had changed little from the previous month. The

twelve-month mean for the whole economy had been unchanged at 3.8%. The private

sector mean had fallen by 0.1 percentage points to 3.7%, while the public sector mean

had been unchanged at 4.1%. In a matched sample, the mean private sector wage

settlement in April had fallen by 0.6 percentage points from the same time last year,

somewhat less than the fall in inflation expectations over the same period.

A41 The annual growth rate in the ONS measure of labour productivity in Q1 had


-----

been the weakest since 1991, rising by only 0.5%. A new productivity survey

produced by NTC Research and the Institute of Management Services had suggested a

sharp pick-up in productivity growth in Q2. Growth in unit wage costs had risen

again in Q1, as wages and salaries had grown faster than productivity.

**V Prices**

A42 The Bank’s index of commodity prices including oil had risen by 0.6% in

May, following strong rises in March and April. The index excluding oil had also

risen, by 0.2%. But annual inflation in both indices had fallen: to 3.4% (from 4.0%)

for the oil-inclusive index and 1.4% (1.7%) excluding oil. The oil price had risen

slightly over the month and exceeded $18 per barrel on 6 July.

A43 Producer input prices had fallen by 0.5% in May and the year-on-year

inflation rate had fallen back to -2.6% from -1.1% in April. Imported materials prices

had continued to fall. Evidence from the CIPS survey had suggested continued but

slowing deflation in the near future. The output price level, whether including or

excluding excise duties, had been unchanged in May. Total import prices had risen

by 0.2% in April, but prices for imports from the non-EU countries had fallen by

0.1% in May. Export prices had risen more sharply - by 0.7% to all countries in April

and by 0.5% to non-EU countries in May.

A44 The rate of GDP deflator inflation in the first quarter had been revised up by

0.1 percentage points on both a quarterly and annual basis (to 0.4% and 2.2%

respectively) in the third release of the GDP data. The retail sales deflator fell for the

third consecutive month in May, leading to negative annual inflation for the first time

in the series’ history. The annual rate of inflation on the harmonised index had fallen


-----

by 0.2 percentage points to 1.3% in May, equalling its lowest rate since the series

started in 1988.

A45 The annual rate of RPIX inflation had fallen sharply, to 2.1%, in May. The

rates of RPIY and RPI inflation had also fallen to 1.5% and 1.3% respectively. The

fall was largely due to lower food and other goods prices, and had continued the

recent pattern where goods price inflation had fallen but services inflation had

remained fairly constant. Inflation in April and May had been markedly weaker than

the central projection in the May Inflation Report forecast. This was entirely because

of goods price inflation.

**VI Reports by the Bank’s Agents**

A46 The Bank’s regional Agents had reported on their general discussions with

contacts. The manufacturing recovery had been fragile, but business expectations had

improved. And whereas business and financial services had shown ongoing growth,

the outlook for consumer services had remained weak.

A47 Retail sales had stayed weak. Only discount stores had recorded significant

strengthening in activity. Generally, discounting had continued to be widespread.

The evidence for other non-retail consumer expenditure had been mixed.

A48 Exports to the United States had continued to be strong. The East Asian

market on the other hand remained depressed, though the outlook had improved.

Demand from Europe had remained weak, particularly from Germany and Italy.

Sterling’s persistent strength was seen as the main obstacle to rising European orders.

A49 Manufacturing employment had fallen further, in contrast to the service sector

where employment intentions had firmed. Skill shortages and pay pressures had

persisted.

A50 Overall, the view had been that activity in Q2 had turned out stronger than in

Q1, though the latter had been perceived as very weak.

**VII Market intelligence**


-----

A51 Short-term expectations for UK interest rates had fallen since the previous

MPC meeting. For longer maturities, however, rates had risen by around 40 basis

points, having been up by 70 basis points or so at one stage. Changes in the shape of

the yield curve could be partially attributed to international influences, such as the

decision by the FOMC to raise rates, and to shifts in the market’s view on UK entry to

EMU and hence the future path of UK rates. In the more immediate future most

market participants did not expect a further cut in the repo rate this month, given the

retail sales data, evidence from surveys and house price data, although some believed

that it was possible in the next few months if inflation continued to be below

expectations.

A52 Sterling had, over the last month, continued to depreciate against the dollar,

reaching its lowest level since September 1996, with talk that it had moved into a new

trading range. The changing pattern of differentials in official interest rates

internationally was thought by many to be an important factor, as were signs of

growth in other economies. For these reasons corporate demand for sterling had been

less apparent at these levels than before. Data from options markets had suggested

that the market saw risks as being on the downside for sterling against both the euro

and the dollar.
