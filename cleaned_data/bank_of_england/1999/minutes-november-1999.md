# MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING

## 3 and 4 November 1999

#### These are the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting held on 3 and 4 November 1999. They are also available on the Internet (http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/mpc9911.pdf).

 The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the GovernmentÕs inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the BankÕs Monetary Policy Committee. The Committee meets on a regular monthly basis and minutes of its meetings are released on the Wednesday of the second week after the meeting takes place. Accordingly, the minutes of the Committee meeting held on 8 and 9 December will be published on 22 December 1999.

**MINUTES OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON**
**3-4 NOVEMBER 1999**

1  Before completing their November inflation and output growth projections and turning to their

immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed demand and output; the labour market; prices

and costs; money, credit and asset prices; and the world economic outlook. Prior to the meeting, the

Committee was briefed by Treasury officials on the Chancellor’s latest projections for economic

activity and the public finances.

**Demand and output**

2  Output was estimated to have increased by 0.9% between Q2 and Q3, significantly higher than

projected in the Committee’s August Inflation _Report; and growth in the first half of the year had been_

revised upwards, so that the level of activity was also higher than expected. The quarterly rate of

manufacturing output growth had been 1% in Q3. The recovery seemed to be spreading both

regionally and, with some exceptions such as agriculture, sectorally. The twelve-month growth rate of

final domestic demand in Q2, the latest period for which data were available, had been 4.5%, well

above trend. Strong domestic demand had to some extent been offset in the first part of the year by

destocking and, over a longer period, by weak net trade, reflecting the rise in sterling’s exchange rate

and shocks to world economic growth. Aggregate demand had therefore grown more slowly than final

domestic demand, and this had contained pressures on the economy’s supply capacity. More recently,

however, net trade had been stronger than expected, and in Q2 had even made a positive contribution to

GDP growth. Against this background, the Committee discussed whether the growth in demand was

sustainable, and if not whether it would slow spontaneously, ie without a further policy tightening.

3  Within final domestic demand, consumption growth had been especially buoyant. A number of

possible special factors were identified. First, strong growth in real earnings, and so real personal

disposable income, might have reflected not just tight labour market conditions, but also inflation

outturns that had been lower than expected when pay bargains were struck. Other things being equal,

any such effect was unlikely to continue as inflation expectations had come down over the past few

years, and were now broadly in line with the 2½% target. However, the Committee had built into its

latest central projection for inflation a number of particular downward influences on prices - such as


-----

2

utility price cuts and the effects of increased competition on retailers’ margins - which would tend to

reduce RPIX inflation, and it was unclear to what extent these were incorporated into wage bargainers’

inflation expectations.

4  Second, the rapid growth in consumption in Q1 and Q2 partly reflected recovery from the slowdown

last autumn, when confidence had been hit by the shocks to the world economy and international

financial markets. Third, consumer spending growth earlier in the year had partly been accounted for

by an earlier-than-usual spike in car sales, reflecting changes in the timing of new registrations. That

was expected to unwind in the second half of the year. Retail sales growth appeared, however, to have

strengthened during the year according to data for Q3 and some surveys, so that overall consumption

growth might not slow much. Moreover, strong output growth in Q3, evidence of strong tax receipts

(including corporate taxes), and the relative strength of household money and credit growth and of the

housing market suggested that strong final domestic demand growth might have continued beyond the

first half of the year.

5  There were, though, some possible indications that consumption growth had steadied. Indicators of

retail sales in Q4 appeared firm, but probably not more so than during Q3. Both the CBI Distributive

Trades Survey and the CIPS Services Index pointed to a moderation of activity. Consumer confidence

measures were positive but had been steady for about eight months, and in particular had not been

driven upwards along with the rapid rise in house prices. And some indicators of housing market

activity, such as particulars delivered, had ticked down slightly over the past two months. The

Committee judged, however, that the recent strength in house prices would tend to support continuing

buoyant consumption growth. House prices were generally expected to continue rising over the next

year or so at an annual rate which was higher than mortgage interest rates. In the view of some

members, the resulting negative own-real rate of interest should, other things being equal, make house

purchase attractive. This could alternatively be thought of as expected real capital gains more than

offsetting the real cost of borrowing (measured by mortgage interest rates less expected consumer price

inflation).

6  Other parts of the economy were, however, facing quite different own-real interest rates. In

particular, the nominal cost of borrowing for companies was still considerably higher than

manufacturing output price inflation, which might hold back investment spending.


-----

7  More generally, since August the sterling yield curve had steepened, with rates in the two-to-five

year range up by at least 50 basis points and the gap between fixed and variable mortgage rates having

closed. This had increased the cost of borrowing for both companies and fixed rate mortgage

borrowers. This would help to restrain demand in the medium term, and on one view was not fully

reflected in the forecast. Others felt that the effects were likely to be small. (The Committee’s

discussion of whether the shift in market interest rate expectations had more general implications for

policy setting is summarised below under ‘Tactical considerations’.)

8  The Committee agreed that final domestic demand could not continue to grow at the current rate

without jeopardizing achievement of the inflation target in the medium term. Even without further

monetary tightening some of the factors mentioned above were likely to restrain domestic demand

growth. The Committee’s latest projection incorporated a slowdown to around 3% by the end of the

two-year forecast horizon, but that would probably still place pressures on supply capacity unless the

contribution to GDP growth from stockbuilding and net trade was negative.

9  Stocks had been reduced in the first part of the year, consistent with reports of excess inventory

holdings at the end of 1998. More recent reports suggested that there was little reason to expect a

continuing negative contribution to GDP growth from this source in the short run.

10  The principal influences on net trade pointed in different directions. On the one hand, sterling

continued to be strong, and was higher than in August. On the other hand, the world economy was

recovering more quickly than expected. Exports of goods (excluding oil and erratics) to countries

outside the EU had grown at an annual rate of 11% between Q2 and Q3; and total goods exports grew

by 6% in the three months to August compared with the previous three months. Surveys suggested that

manufacturers’ expectations of export volume growth were higher than for around three years.

11  While it was possible that the strength of the recent exports data partly reflected temporary factors,

it was also possible that exporters had to some extent adjusted to a level of sterling that they now

expected to persist. If so, the equilibrium real exchange rate might have risen, but it was too early to be

at all confident about that possibility.

12  To the extent that export strength were to persist, a negative contribution to GDP growth from net

trade would have to come from a relatively faster increase in imports, so that the UK would in effect be

relying on spare capacity abroad to contain incipient inflationary pressures from strong domestic


-----

4

demand growth. But while there was probably still spare capacity abroad, some members felt that it

would be eroded as the world economy recovered, tending to put upward pressure on import prices.

13  On balance, the Committee had assumed that net trade would make a negative contribution to GDP

throughout the forecast period, reflecting the further rise in the sterling exchange rate and a likely

increase in imports.

**The labour market**

14  There was some evidence that the labour market had tightened further. Over the quarter, claimant

count unemployment had fallen to 4.2%, and the Labour Force Survey (LFS) measure to 5.9%.

Employment had continued to rise, as had total hours worked. Some forward-looking indicators

suggested continued tightening. Employment intentions, as measured by surveys, were up in all sectors

and were above average historical levels. Skill shortages persisted according to the Bank’s regional

Agents and surveys, but with differences across regions and different types of skill. The picture from

surveys was mixed. The BCC measure of recruitment difficulties had fallen slightly in both

manufacturing and services. The CBI survey showed skill shortages rising slightly but with the level

still below its historical average.

15  Real earnings growth calculated on the basis of the Average Earnings Index (AEI) had been rising

for some time, with the recent rate faster than would have been expected on the basis of the changes in

unemployment and employment. As noted above, one possible explanation for this was that a

greater-than-generally-expected decline in inflation had boosted ex post real earnings. Another

possible explanation was that the ‘natural’ rate of unemployment, the rate consistent with stable

inflation, was higher than the Committee had assumed in its August projections. Some members

thought it unlikely that the ‘natural’ rate was below the current actual rate or that it was continuing to

fall at the same rate as actual unemployment, so that there was good reason to think that labour market

pressures had been increasing. Other members noted that the Reward Index showed earnings growth

still trending lower and the New Earnings Survey also gave a more benign picture of earnings growth

than the AEI. Although there were different interpretations of the latest data, the Committee agreed to

take as its central projection a higher assumption for real earnings growth than in August.

16  The recent nominal pay data presented a second puzzle. On the one hand, settlements had

remained around 3.5%. On the other hand, the AEI had risen at an annual rate of 4.9% in the three


-----

5

months to August. Allowing for month-to-month volatility, the AEI series had been edging upwards in

recent months. If the difference was a good guide to wage drift, it was possible that the recent rise in

nominal earnings would be consolidated in forthcoming settlements. A survey by Industrial Relations

Services pointed in the opposite direction, however. In its latest survey, 43% of respondents had

expected to make lower settlements than last year, 46% the same, and 11% higher. Last year, only

23% had expected lower settlements than the previous year, and 26% had expected higher. It was

suggested that the apparent fall in expected settlements this year might reflect the low recent RPI

outturns (1.1% in August and September) and expectations that RPIX would remain below the 2½%

target for a while. Anecdotal evidence on this, based partly on Committee members’ own regional

visits, varied. There were suggestions both that RPI was the starting point in negotiations, and that the

benchmark was the higher of RPI or RPIX. Some employers had suggested that the recent outturn of

around 1% was not a feasible starting point; before allowing for productivity improvements, it was

easier to argue either for zero if necessary on the basis of a particular company’s circumstances, or

alternatively for 2½% reflecting the inflation target and so medium-term inflation expectations. The

Committee noted that there would not be much hard data on settlements until the new year, although

the Bank’s regional Agents would monitor, through their contacts, the emerging evidence.

17  Whatever the position, it was possible that settlements - both backward-looking data and

forward-looking surveys - were now less reliable indicators of labour market conditions given the

decline in collective bargaining, and the increase in personalised remuneration, over recent years. If so,

relatively more weight needed to be placed on the path of broader measures of earnings.

18  The Committee as a whole agreed that its assessment of labour market conditions was highly

uncertain.  Structural changes and the new monetary regime meant that behaviour may have changed,

but it was impossible to know by how much. Looking forward, the quantity data, particularly the LFS

series, would be important indicators of whether there were any further tightening, and possibly of its

speed. But what mattered was the extent of pressure on labour supply, for which there was no direct

measure, and the extent to which this was translated into nominal earnings growth and settlements.

**Prices and costs**

19  The main issue concerning prices was the prospective effect on the aggregate price level, and thus

on measured inflation in the short-to-medium term, of various expected developments. In particular,

the Committee had made allowance in its Inflation Report projections for falls in price-cost margins


-----

6

reflecting an increase in competition; utility prices changes; and the Government’s intention,

announced in its pre-Budget Report published on 9 November, of removing the automatic over
indexation of duties on tobacco and fuel. Taken together, on the agreed assumptions these reduced the

central projection for RPIX inflation by around half a percentage point at the two-year horizon (and

more before that).

20  Some members were content with the assumed effects for the first year but preferred a smaller

effect in the second year. This was for two reasons. First, they were concerned that the Committee had

focussed on some one-off price falls, whereas there might be some one-off upward pressures as well;

for example, it was conceivable that, as real incomes and wealth rose, consumers were switching from

cheaper, standard goods to higher-margin, customised or designer products. Second, there were doubts

about reflecting expected changes in relative prices in the aggregate nominal price level at longer

horizons given that, by targetting inflation, the Committee influenced nominal, not real, demand

growth over the medium term. While the particular downward pressures might plausibly be

unanticipated in the near-term, they would more likely be anticipated as time passed. In that case, the

effects of relative price changes might not show up as a decline in the overall rate of inflation over the

medium run.

21  While agreeing that this analysis applied in the medium to long run, those members who supported

the central assumption in the forecast argued that there was sufficiently clear evidence that the

downward influences on prices would increase during at least the next two years. They agreed that it

was difficult to calibrate the short-run impact of longer-term structural changes such as intensified

competition. The Committee agreed that the size and persistence of the specific effects were inevitably

uncertain, making it important to monitor the specific effects reflected in the published projections.

**Money, credit and asset prices**

22  M4 growth had continued to fall, the twelve-month rate reaching 2.8% in Q3, the slowest growth

rate since 1963 (when the series began). But this reflected continued falls in the money holdings of

non-bank financial institutions (OFCs). OFC money and credit were generally regarded as being most

relevant to analysis of monetary conditions during periods of financial market instability.

23  Excluding OFCs, annual broad money growth had been 6.1% in Q3. Within this, household M4

growth was 6.4%. M0 and household Divisia growth were each around 7%. Growth in net credit to


-----

7

households was 8.6% in Q3, the highest rate since 1991. These data were broadly corroborative of the

real-side evidence of continuing robust consumption growth.

24  The FT All Share Index had risen by about 2½% over the past month, and was at about the same

level as in August. House prices continued to rise rapidly, with the twelve month rate on both the

Halifax and Nationwide indices above 10%. As already noted, since the August Inflation Report the

sterling yield curve had steepened out to medium maturities.

25  The sterling exchange rate index had risen by over half a percentage point since the Committee’s

October meeting and was about three percentage points above the path assumed in the August fan chart

projections. The Committee agreed to incorporate in its published November projections an

assumption that sterling would be half way between its current rate and a path related to market interest

rate differentials, with the sensitivity of the projections to both shown in the Inflation Report. Some

members inclined towards the former, and some preferred the latter.

**The world economic outlook**

26  The Committee noted the assumptions it had made in its latest projections. The outlook in each of

the US, the euro area and Japan was somewhat better, and prospects among the emerging market

economies had generally improved. The overall picture was therefore slightly stronger than assumed in

the Committee’s August projection, although there remained clear downside risks from the possibility

of an equity price correction in the USA and persistent current account imbalances.

27  Against this background, Committee members agreed that the outlook for world prices looked less

benign than at the time of the August Inflation Report. While there was still spare capacity in parts of

the world economy, this was being utilised as a generalised recovery progressed. Imported price

inflation had been weak (or negative) over the past few years, but had recently begun to rise.

**The November inflation and output growth projections**

28  The Committee agreed the projections to be published in the Inflation Report on 10 November.

29  On the assumption of constant official interest rates of 5.5%, the central projection in the published

fan chart for activity was for slightly more rapid growth in the short term than in August, levelling off

to slightly above trend. The level of activity was higher than projected in August for almost all of the


-----

8

forecast period on account of the recent stronger-than-expected outturns. The balance of risks was on

the downside, mainly reflecting risks to the world economic outlook.

30  The Committee’s best collective judgment of the prospects for inflation was for RPIX to remain

below the 2½% target for nearly all of the forecast period, dropping just below 2% for a while, before

increasing quite sharply to end up at around the target at the two-year horizon, when it was still rising.

This acceleration in prices reflected the accumulating pressures on supply capacity from the period of

above-trend demand growth and the unwinding of the various temporary downward influences on the

price level and so on measured inflation. The trough was lower than in August. The projection at the

end of the forecast period was almost the same as in August, but with a higher sterling exchange rate

and with the official interest rate at 5.5% rather than 5.0%. For the same reasons as for the output

projection, the balance of risks to inflation was on the downside.

31  As already described, there was considerable uncertainty in the Committee about the inflation

outlook, and also a range of preferred assumptions for the path of the nominal exchange rate, earnings

growth, and price-cost margins; these were presented in Table 6.B on page 58 of the Inflation Report

published on 10 November. Different members preferred different combinations of these assumptions,

either raising or lowering the inflation projection at the two-year horizon by ¼ to ½ percentage points,

so that there was a range of approaching one percentage point between the lowest and highest preferred

central projections of individual Committee members.

**Tactical considerations**

32  The Committee discussed three other issues potentially relevant to its policy decision: the

significance of the steepening in the sterling yield curve; the relevance of ECB and FOMC policy

decisions; and the implications of the shape of the inflation projection.

33  On one view, the rise over recent months in short and medium-maturity market interest rates, as

evidenced by for example short sterling futures contracts and the gilt yield curve, meant that monetary

conditions were materially tighter than reflected in the fan chart projections. In consequence, the

market was doing some of the Committee’s work for it, so that other things being equal the Committee

could operate with a lower official repo rate than would otherwise be the case. Against this, it was

argued that the Committee would take material risks with its credibility if it failed to tighten in line

with market expectations, where it regarded those expectations as well based. If demand were


-----

9

restrained by higher market rates but the Committee then failed to raise rates, the market’s view of the

Committee’s reaction function would change, storing up trouble for the future.

34  The Committee agreed that it should not place great weight on expectations of what the ECB and

FOMC might do at their meetings on 4 November (the same day as the MPC’s meeting) and

16 November respectively. It was noted that a clear majority of market participants expected the MPC

to raise its rate by 25 basis points, in which case a move of that size would probably not have much

effect on market prices.

35  The shape of the inflation projection had changed materially over the past year. A year ago, it had

been humped; in May and August it had had a gentle saucer shape; now inflation was projected to fall

further below the target, before rising more steeply towards the end of the forecast period. This

reflected the view that accumulating inflationary pressures would surface after a period in which

measured inflation was held back by a series of specific price level changes. In particular, after falling

back in the short run earnings growth was likely to pick up further out in the forecast period. On the

one hand, the degree of uncertainty about the outlook was considerably greater at the two year horizon,

so that the Committee could be less sure about the projected steep rise than it could be about the nearer
term prospect of inflation remaining below target. On the other hand, monetary policy changes would

have a greater effect on inflation at around two years than on nearer-term prospects. The Committee

agreed that, other things being equal, the shape of the projection meant that, compared with a profile in

which inflation rose steadily, there was more time to tighten policy in order further to restrain demand

growth if that still proved necessary.

**The immediate policy decision**

36  The Committee agreed that the analysis of the outlook for inflation had changed over the past few

months. The news on demand and activity had been stronger than expected, whereas RPIX inflation

had been weaker than expected. The short-term relationship between output and prices had for some

time been uncertain, and if anything that uncertainty had increased. For a long time strong

domestically-generated inflationary pressures had been offset by strongly benign external influences:

the price and net trade effects of the rising pound and of the shocks to world activity. Those external

influences were now smaller. Sterling had recently risen slightly, but by less than during 1997 and

1998, and the world economy was recovering, with consequent rises in some input costs, for example

oil. The key issues were now on the one hand the size and persistence of various downward influences


-----

10

on prices, and on the other hand the more-rapid-than-expected pick up in output growth and the extent

to which domestic demand growth would slow without further monetary policy tightening. Members’

analysis of the immediate policy choice varied according to how they viewed those factors.

37  A variety of arguments were identified in favour of an immediate increase in interest rates.

Activity had recovered faster than expected, and confidence indicators had remained strong despite the

September tightening of monetary policy and sterling’s recent strength. A further decline in the

velocity of circulation was needed for narrow money, household Divisia and household M4 growth to

be consistent with the inflation target. Final domestic demand growth was projected to slow but still to

be above trend at the forecast horizon, supported amongst other things by a strong housing market. A

significant negative contribution to GDP growth from net trade was effectively being relied upon to

avoid aggregate demand exceeding the economy’s supply capacity. The labour market seemed again to

be tightening, and there was consequently a risk that unit labour cost growth would not in fact

moderate. AEI earnings growth had risen over recent months, and the Bank’s regional Agents had

reported greater concerns about skill shortages increasing wage growth. Although there was particular

uncertainty about the relationship between output growth and inflation, members were influenced by

the rise in wage pressures and the pick up in survey-based measures of pricing intentions. Input price

pressures were gathering. The inflation projection was still rising at the forecast horizon so that,

assuming no news in the meantime, the February projection for 2002 Q1 would be higher than the

target. While RPIX inflation was likely to be contained for a while by the various downward pressures

on prices, a further tightening of policy was needed to restrain the medium-term inflationary

implications of continued strong domestic demand. The risks from tightening and not tightening were

not symmetric. An immediate 25 basis point increase would not carry many risks to output as growth

was above trend and the level of activity was already probably not much, if at all, below the trend level.

But there would be risks in not increasing interest rates now. The news on activity had been

significantly stronger than expected since the Committee tightened pre-emptively in September, so that

not tightening again risked increasing inflation expectations, entailing a larger tightening later than

would otherwise have been necessary.

38  As well as weighing the considerations set out in paragraph 37, those members of the Committee

who favoured a higher central projection than that assumed - whether because of different preferred

assumptions on the path of the exchange rate or price-cost margins, or on both - regarded the risks of

overshooting the target as correspondingly greater. The choice for them now was between 25 and 50

basis points. While a case could be made for 50 basis points in order to counter the strength of


-----

11

underlying inflationary pressures, the following considerations led them to prefer a smaller rise. As the

Committee had discussed, there were signs, for example in surveys, that there might be some slowing

in demand growth. There was time to wait to gather evidence on this as inflation was projected to be

below the 2½% target for nearly all of the forecast period. Separately, given market expectations, an

increase of more than 25 basis points risked putting undue upward pressure on the exchange rate,

which would tend to restrain net trade and import prices whereas policy action was needed to address

domestically-generated inflationary pressures.

39  One member explored the arguments for an interest rate increase of less than 25 basis points. The

profile for inflation implied that the pressures on the economy’s supply capacity needed to be

restrained in the medium term but that there was time to do this, particularly given the uncertainties

about the outlook. An increase of less than 25 basis points would assist that process and would, in

particular, provide a clear signal of the Committee’s resolve in addressing those medium-term

concerns, while recognising the downward pressures on inflation in the near term, when it was

projected to drop materially below the 2½% target. It would be easier for the Committee to introduce

smaller-than-25 basis point changes now having already tightened policy in September. However, as

this would be the first time rates changed by less than 25 basis points, there was a significant risk that

the reasons would be misunderstood. The better course was, therefore, to raise rates by 25 basis points.

40  Various arguments were advanced for maintaining the official interest rate at 5.25%. Inflation was

below target and was set to remain so over the next two years. The outlook depended to a significant

degree on two material factors: the exchange rate, and the balance of aggregate demand and the

economy’s supply capacity. Recent export outturns added weight to the view that sterling would be

stronger than the path assumed as the best collective judgment; and survey measures showed capacity

utilisation falling slightly, perhaps because investment during this upswing had been strong. There

were significant downward pressures on prices, reflecting not only one-off regulatory measures but also

an ongoing intensification of competition throughout the economy. This would help to restrain

earnings growth below the path assumed as the best collective judgment. Monetary conditions, as

reflected in the yield curve, had tightened significantly in recent months, and were probably bearing

down on demand by rather more than had been assumed in the published fan charts. Taking these

considerations together, the steep rise in the central projection of inflation 18 months hence was highly

uncertain and there were clear downside risks to it. With a symmetric inflation target, a further

tightening was not yet needed.

**ANNEX: SUMMARY OF DATA PRESENTED BY BANK STAFF**

A1  This Annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee

on 29 October, in advance of its meeting on 3-4 November 1999. At the start of the Committee

meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and

that information is included in this Annex.

**I  The international environment**

A2  US GDP had risen by 1.2% in Q3, according to the provisional estimate. Consumption and

investment had remained strong, while inventories had made a positive contribution to GDP growth,

following a negative contribution in Q2. Net exports had continued to fall in Q3, albeit by less than in

Q2. Definitional and statistical changes to the National Accounts had raised the average annual GDP

growth rate by 0.4 percentage points between 1992 and 1998. The National Association of Purchasing

Managers’ (NAPM) Index had fallen slightly in September, but had remained at a level consistent with

an expansion of manufacturing output.

A3  The quarterly growth in the Employment Cost Index measure of labour costs had declined slightly

in Q3. Annual producer price inflation had increased to 3.1% in September, and annual consumer price

inflation to 2.6%.

A4  GDP growth in the euro area had been revised up to 0.5% in Q2. Both consumption and

investment growth had been revised up. Industrial production had risen by 2.5% in the year to August,

reflecting improving business confidence, particularly in France. M3 had risen by 6.1% in the year to

September. Private sector credit growth had been higher. Annual inflation had remained unchanged in

September, at 1.2%. Excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, inflation had continued to fall.

A5  Despite a decline in September, industrial production in Japan had risen by 3.8% in Q3. However,

the September Tankan survey indicated that companies were continuing to cut fixed investment.

Volumes of imports and exports had continued to strengthen, particularly to other Asian countries.

Consumption indicators had been mixed and retail sales growth had remained negative. Base money

had risen by 6.1% in the year to September, but broad measures of money growth had been lower.

Survey evidence had suggested that banks were becoming more willing to lend, but the stock of

outstanding loans (adjusting for write-offs and securitisations) had continued to fall. The rate of


-----

2

unemployment had fallen to 4.6% in September, although this had partly reflected a fall in the

participation rate. The consumer price index had fallen by 0.2% in the year to September.

A6  Trade volumes had risen in the United States, Japan and the euro area. Non-oil commodity prices

had remained stable. Oil prices had fallen very slightly, despite the most recently available evidence

suggesting a higher degree of compliance among OPEC members with the agreement to limit supply.

However, the continued strength in oil prices had contributed to an increase in petrol and producer

prices in all countries.

A7  There had been little movement in the main dollar, yen and euro exchange rates. Equity markets

in the main economies had recovered slightly from falls earlier in the month. There had been a further

increase in euro-area interest rates implied by Euribor futures contracts, with markets expecting around

50 basis points of tightening by next summer.

A8  The trend in industrial production growth in most emerging market economies had been positive.

It had remained negative in Latin America.

**II  Monetary and financial conditions**

A9  Provisional figures had suggested that narrow money growth had rebounded in October. The one
month growth rate of notes and coin had risen to 0.8%, compared with an upwardly revised 0.1% in

September. The twelve-month growth rate (after adjusting for the introduction of the new 50 pence

and £2 coins) had risen to 7.6% in October from 7.0% in September.

A10  M4 had fallen by £2.9 billion (0.4%) in September, with the annual growth rate falling back to

2.8%, the lowest since the series began in 1963. M4 lending (excluding the effects of securitisations)

had risen by £4.2 billion (0.4%) in September.

A11  Households’ M4 deposits had risen by 1.3% in Q3. In real terms, households’ M4 deposits were

estimated to have increased by 4.8% in the twelve months to Q3. And households’ real Divisia growth

was estimated to have picked up to 5.3%, consistent with strong consumption growth. Households’

M4 lending had grown strongly in Q3. Annual growth had been 8.6%, the highest since 1991. Within

total lending to individuals, the annual growth rate of secured lending had been 7.5%, reflecting

strength in the housing market. Loan approvals had also been strong. Total unsecured lending had


-----

3

increased by 3.3% in Q3, in line with its increases over the year. Credit card lending had continued to

grow in excess of 20% per annum.

A12  Private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs) deposits had remained broadly flat in Q3, though

deposits had risen by £1.4 billion (1.2%) in September. The twelve-month growth rate had fallen from

7.4% in Q2 to 4.9% in Q3. PNFCs’ M4 lending had picked up in Q3. Lending had been particularly

strong in September, increasing by £1.8 billion (0.9%). But the annual growth rate had fallen from

4.7% in Q2 to 4.2% in Q3, compared with an average annual rate of 5.8% in 1998. A broader measure

of PNFCs’ borrowing (that also included all bond and equity issues as well as non-sterling lending by

banks) had been weaker in Q3 than in Q2: the average monthly flow had increased by £3.3 billion

compared with £5.9 billion in Q2.

A13  Other financial corporations’ (OFCs’) M4 deposits had fallen sharply in Q3, and the annual

growth rate had continued the downward trend since 1998 Q1. The average monthly flow had been

-£2.7 billion in Q3, compared with -£1.3 billion in Q2. The monthly flow in September had been

particularly weak (-£7.0 billion). OFCs’ M4 lending had increased slightly in Q3, but the flow in

September had been -£2.1 billion.

A14  Short-term interest rate expectations implied by short sterling futures contracts had fallen since

the previous MPC meeting. The falls had been between 20 and 30 basis points in the

September 2002-March 2003 contracts (less at shorter maturities). Nominal forward rates at broadly

comparable maturities had also decreased (by 40-50 basis points after 3 to 3.5 years).

A15  Short sterling futures and nominal forward rates derived from the gilts market had pointed to

different profiles for the expected level of interest rates. In particular, short sterling futures had pointed

to a peak of 7.3% in interbank rates in December 2001, around 100 basis points greater than the peak of

6.3% for gilt yields in the forward curve in the second half of 2001. The three-month LIBOR/general

collateral interest rate spread had picked up sharply at the beginning of October as the date for year-end

LIBOR delivery had passed. But spreads further out along the curve had not looked unusual given

recent experience.

A16  There had also been falls in nominal yields at the long end of the forward curve during October.

This had been mirrored in falls in long corporate bond yields. Since the beginning of the year, the yield

on 25 year corporate bonds had also fallen relative to yields on shorter maturity bonds, reflecting

movements in similar maturity gilt yields. And it was noticeable that there had been a sharp pick up in

issuance of very long corporate bonds (with a maturity in excess of 15 years) over this period. So any

technical factors that may have helped to explain the fall in relative gilt yields at the long end appeared

to have reduced the funding costs for some firms.

A17  The pass-through of September’s base rate rise to retail savings rates had remained incomplete in

October. Interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages had increased, following continued increases in swap

rates at all maturities. But the narrowing in the spread of five-year fixed mortgage rates over five-year

swap rates observed this year had continued in October.

A18  Implied inflation expectations had fallen by around 15-30 basis points out to fifteen years. The

fall had been smaller at longer maturities. The October biannual Consensus Economics survey had

pointed to a fall in inflation expectations over the medium to long term (four years and further out)

between April and October. By contrast, over the same period, inflation expectations implied using

index-linked gilts had risen out to eight years, though they had fallen further out.

A19  The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) had appreciated, by 0.7% over the month.

Within this, sterling had appreciated by 1.4% against the euro, but had depreciated by 0.7% against the

US dollar and by 3.0% against the yen. Real exchange rate expectations calculated using the biannual

Consensus Economics survey of long-run inflation and nominal exchange rate expectations had

suggested that the markets increasingly expected the strength of sterling to be sustained. The real

exchange rate expected at end-2003 had increased by 2.8% between the October 1998 and 1999

surveys. The FTSE All-Share index had risen by 2.4% on the month. As in recent months the index

for smaller capitalisation stocks had performed more poorly, falling by 0.8% on the month.

**III  Demand and output**

A20  The preliminary ONS estimate of GDP growth in 1999 Q3 had been 0.9%, the strongest for two

years. The annual growth rate had risen to 1.8%. Service sector output had grown by 1.0% in Q3 and

had been 2.6% up on a year earlier - close to its long run average. Within services, the distribution,

hotels and catering sector had grown by 0.9%. Manufacturing output had risen by 1.0% in Q3,

following revisions to data in July and August.

A21  Construction new orders had fallen by 5.0% in the three months to September but the CIPS index

of construction activity had indicated strong growth since January 1999.

A22  Retail sales volumes had risen by 0.1% in September. Growth in Q3 had been 1.2%. The GfK

consumer confidence index had been flat in October, but remained above its historical average. The

new quarterly Consumers’ Association Consumer Trends Survey consumer confidence index had been

+34 in October, compared with +33 in July. According to this survey, households expected house

prices to rise by 4% over the next year.

A23  Both the Halifax and Nationwide house price indices had shown rises in annual house price

inflation in October, to 10.8% and 11.6% respectively. The Halifax index had grown particularly

sharply in October, rising by 2.8%, following zero growth in September. Particulars delivered had

fallen to 122,000 in September - the second consecutive monthly fall - but remained 7% higher than a

year earlier. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) survey had shown a similar picture of

housing transactions. Housing starts had risen by 2.9% in Q3.

A24  Vehicle sales had been very volatile, given the change to the registration letter system. Private

car registrations in Q3 had fallen by 16.6% on a year earlier. In the first 9 months of 1999, they had

been 0.8% lower than the same period a year earlier.

A25  The change in inventories had contributed negatively to GDP growth in Q2. The CIPS survey of

manufacturing had shown that stocks of finished goods had risen in October for the first time since July

1998. The CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey had shown that the balance of finished goods

inventories had risen to -10 in October from -20 in July.

A26  The BCC and CBI surveys had shown a pick-up of manufacturing investment intentions in Q3

compared to very low levels a year ago, though the CBI measure had fallen slightly to -11 in Q3 from

-8 in Q2. The BCC survey had shown an increase in investment intentions (plant and machinery), to

11 in Q3 from 3 in Q2. But as investment intentions are forward-looking it seemed likely that actual

investment would not strengthen until 2000.

A27  The public sector net cash requirement had been £2.0 billion in September - with cumulative

cash borrowing for 1999/2000 similar to the previous year.

A28  The deficit on trade in goods had narrowed to £1.9 billion in August from £2.2 billion in July.

The EU deficit had widened slightly to £0.4 billion, but the non-EU goods deficit had narrowed to

£1.5 billion. The non-EU deficit had narrowed further to £1.2 billion in September. Excluding oil and

erratics, export volumes had risen by 5.8% in the three months to August and imports had risen by

3.8%. Although export growth over the past half-year had been partly driven by erratic items,

underlying export growth (excluding oil and erratics) had also been positive. Based on monthly data,

the 1999 Q3 net trade contribution to GDP seemed likely to be positive.

A29  Looking ahead to Q4, survey evidence had suggested continuing strong growth. The CIPS

purchasing managers’ survey of manufacturing showed a slight improvement in the headline index, to

54.2 in October, with the output index above its no-change point of 50 for the seventh consecutive

month.  The CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends survey had shown a sharp improvement of manufacturing

sector confidence in Q3. The BCC survey for Q3 had shown a marked improvement in domestic and

overseas orders, in both the manufacturing and services sectors. Domestic and overseas orders

balances had appeared to be moving in line over recent quarters - though growth in domestic orders

remained stronger.  The CIPS Services Survey had shown an increase in activity in October (though the

rate of growth had been the slowest since March). The CBI Distributive Trades Survey had shown a

rise in retail sales in October (though with growth slowing, and sales considered to be slightly below

average for the time of year). The improved outlook had also been broadly consistent with other

surveys such as those by the Institute of Directors and the Engineers’ Employers Federation.  The

latest surveys when taken together suggested quarterly growth in GDP continuing in Q4 at broadly the

same rate as in Q3.

**IV  The labour market**

A30  LFS employment had increased by 99,000 (0.4%) in the three months to August compared with

the previous three months - up sharply on the increase in the three months to May.  In full-time

equivalent terms, growth had been the strongest since the summer of 1998. Total hours worked had

risen by 0.4% during the three months to August over the previous three months. Average hours

worked had risen by 0.1%, although they had remained weaker than in the same period the previous

year.


-----

7

A31  According to the CIPS survey, manufacturing employment had stopped falling, employment

growth in services had eased, while employment growth in the construction sector had been broadly

stable. Looking ahead, surveys of employment intentions had all indicated further employment

expansion.

A32  Surveys of skill shortages and recruitment difficulties had provided a more mixed picture of the

degree of labour market tightness. The CBI Industrial Trends Survey had reported that skill shortages

had increased in the September quarter, but remained below their historical average. The BCC

Quarterly Economic Survey had reported that recruitment difficulties had lessened over this period, but

remained high by historical standards. The stock of unfilled vacancies in job centres had remained

high in September. However, the National Press Recruitment Advertising Index had continued its

downward trend.

A33  Unemployment levels had fallen on both the LFS and claimant count measures. LFS

unemployment had fallen by 83,000 to 5.9% in June-August compared with the previous three months.

The claimant count had fallen by 5,400 in September, with the rate unchanged at 4.2%, the lowest since

the early 1980s. But the participation rate had still not exceeded its peak in the early 1990s.

A34  Inactivity had risen by 23,000 in June-August compared with the previous three months, with the

inactivity rate unchanged at 21.2%. However, it remained about 30,000 below its level at the same

time the previous year.

A35  August’s average earnings data had included returns from a new sample, implementing a

recommendation of the Turnbull-King report following the suspension of the index in late 1998.

Headline average earnings growth in August had risen by 0.3 percentage points to 4.9%. Stronger

growth in private sector earnings had more than offset a fall in public sector earnings growth. Earnings

growth had in recent months been affected by changes in the timing of bonus payments, though the

latest month’s figure had appeared to be free from such distortions. The implementation of the

National Minimum Wage (NMW) may also have had an impact on recent AEI outturns. The New

Earnings Survey had shown that gross weekly pay had grown by 3.6% in the year to April 1999,

slightly lower than the AEI over the same period (4.0%).


-----

8

A36  Other evidence on earnings growth had been mixed. The Reward Index had risen by

0.1 percentage points in September to 3.4%, but it remained well below the AEI. The FRES survey in

October had shown stronger earnings growth for temporary staff, but little change in salary growth for

permanent staff. The Bank’s regional Agents reported that overall pay pressures had remained

subdued. There had been little new information on settlements in September, because relatively few

settlements were made at this time of year. The Bank’s AEI-weighted twelve-month mean settlement

had remained at 3.5% in September. After allowing for inflation, settlements appeared to have stopped

growing, but remained at a high level.

A37  Wage drift, on the basis of these data, had increased in recent months, particularly in the service

sector. Service sector wage drift was now around 1 percentage point above its average level since

1994. Drift in the production sector had, however, been more subdued.

A38  The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted a survey of their contacts to help assess the nature of

the skill shortages that firms were facing.  A sample of firms thought likely to be experiencing skill

shortages had been selected. Of the 123 firms included in the survey, 84% had reported that shortages

had worsened since last year, primarily in specialist areas. A similar proportion of firms expected skill

shortages to persist both in specialist areas and more generally. Comments had included reference to

poor general educational standards, as well as the legacy of the past run-down in vocational training,

the erosion of work culture in some areas, and constraints on the mobility of labour.

A39  Around 80% of firms sampled had expected to have to pay higher wages to obtain the skills they

required, including more than two-thirds of the group for whom skills recruitment had become no

worse in the past year. More than a quarter had said there would be an increased focus on training by

management. Just under 10% had mentioned an impact on output, either via a constraint on output

levels, or on the development of their business (both from their own skill shortages and shortages of IT

services), or via poorer levels of service to customers. A number had also mentioned increased

pressure on existing staff, leading to higher staff turnover.

**V  Prices**

A40  The Bank’s oil-inclusive commodity price index had risen by 2.1% in September and by 13.5%

on a year earlier, mainly as a result of continued strengthening in crude oil prices. Excluding oil,


-----

commodity prices had been flat over the month and had been 3% higher compared with the previous

year. The contrast between different types of commodities had continued: metal prices had risen

further, whereas domestic food prices had fallen again.

A41  Seasonally adjusted manufacturing input prices had risen by 0.7% in September to give 5.8%

annual inflation. This had largely reflected higher oil prices. The latest CIPS survey input price index

had risen to 56.2 in September, the highest for four years. The CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends output

price expectations balance had strengthened further in Q3. Although cost pressures from materials had

been mounting since early this year, output price inflation had remained subdued.

A42  The latest CIPS services survey had shown a sharp rise in input prices in October, with the index

rising to 59.2, its highest since May 1997. The survey had also indicated that average prices charged

had risen for the first time in four months.

A43  Export and import prices had risen by 1% and 0.6 % respectively in the three months to August.

Stripping out the oil component, export prices had fallen and import prices had remained unchanged.

A44  Comparing price inflation with weighted costs had suggested that retailers’ and manufacturers’

margins had fallen over the past year. The Euler Trade Indemnity Survey had indicated that

competitive pressures had somewhat reduced respondents’ profitability since early 1999.

A45  RPIX inflation had remained at 2.1% in September. Whereas harvest-related seasonal food

prices had risen on the month, non-seasonal food prices had fallen. The annual rate of change of the

retail sales deflator had remained at -0.5% in September. This had mainly reflected falls in food and

non-food store prices earlier in the year.

**VI  Reports by the Bank’s Agents**

A46  The Bank’s regional Agents had reported a continued recovery in economic activity. Growth had

continued to be driven mainly by domestic demand, although many firms had also reported a pick-up in

export orders. However, although manufacturing output continued to rise, the recovery had been far

from universal. Construction activity had remained strong. The service sector continued to record

strong growth, although it had not increased further. IT activity had remained strong, as Y2K work had


-----

10

been replaced by firms investing in more developmental projects, such as Internet sites. Agricultural

production had remained weak in all regions.

A47  Retail spending had improved further, although growth had been moderate. The pattern of

consumer spending had remained similar to previous months, with department store sales weaker than

in discount and out-of-town stores.

A48  There had been evidence of further tightening in the labour market. Most regions had reported

increased skill shortages, with particular concern reported in the south and south-east of England.

Many contacts had noted that unskilled labour had also become more difficult to recruit, especially for

retail positions. Pay pressures had remained subdued, with most settlements lower than a year ago.

However, pressures had appeared slightly stronger than in previous months, especially in southern

regions.

A49  Input prices had picked up further, particularly for oil-related products and some metals, although

overall prices remained broadly flat. Many manufacturers had continued to find it difficult to raise

prices, and retail prices remained flat or falling. Furthermore, a number of firms thought that

consumers had become more sensitive to price differences within each sector, and had begun to bargain

over price to an increasing extent.

A50  Growth in house prices had remained more pronounced in the southern regions, although there

had been evidence that growth here had peaked. The buy-to-let market had slowed. In the northern

regions of the United Kingdom, growth in housing activity had continued to increase steadily.

**VII  Market intelligence**

A51  The effective exchange rate index for sterling had been little changed since the October MPC

meeting, but sterling had appreciated against the euro from the middle of the month. This

strengthening had coincided with the announcement of merger and acquisition activity. It was possible

that anticipation of potential sterling purchases had encouraged others to bring forward their purchases

of sterling. Such influences on sterling’s exchange rate were expected to be temporary.


-----

11

A52  Market participants had continued to comment that movements in US equities were an influence

on the dollar’s exchange rate against sterling and other currencies. There had been some evidence of a

greater correlation between the Dow Jones Industrial Average and dollar exchange rates, including that

between the dollar and sterling. However, the wider implications for sterling’s effective exchange rate

had been less clear.

A53  The difference between interest rates implied by futures and economists’ interest rate forecasts

had widened over the three months to October. This was more likely to be related to increased risk
aversion, the unwinding of long-standing trading positions and mortgage-related swap market activity,

rather than a genuine difference of view between traders and economists. In terms of the immediate

rate decision, market commentators on balance attached a high probability to a 25 basis point increase

in the Bank’s repo rate but did not expect changes in rates in December or January.
