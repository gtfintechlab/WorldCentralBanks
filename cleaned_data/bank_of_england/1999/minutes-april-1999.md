## MINUTES OF
# MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING

## 7 and 8 April 1999

##### These are the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting held on 7 and 8 April 1999. They are also available on the Internet (http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/mpc9904.pdf).

 The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the GovernmentÕs inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the BankÕs Monetary Policy Committee. The Committee meets on a regular monthly basis and minutes of its meetings are released on the Wednesday of the second week after the meeting takes place. Accordingly, the minutes of the Committee meeting held on 5 and 6 May will be published on 19 May 1999.

#### MINUTES OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING ON 7-8 APRIL 1999

1 The Committee discussed the prospects for the world economy; the exchange rate, money and

credit; demand and output (including business confidence indicators); the housing market; the

labour market; prices; and other issues including tactics, before turning to its immediate policy

decision.

**The world economy**

2 The Committee discussed whether the prospects for the world economy had improved over the

past month. In the United States, domestic demand in particular had continued to grow strongly,

with little sign yet of any slowdown in growth or any pick-up in inflation. Supply side developments

in the United States appeared to be more favourable than in the euro area, although in several

European countries output remained below potential. Growth was sluggish and industrial sentiment

weak, particularly in Germany. Meanwhile expectations had grown of a reduction in interest rates

by the European Central Bank (ECB). In Japan, the Nikkei had recovered strongly in the last few

weeks of the financial year, with buying from foreign investors amid signs of a higher probability of

corporate restructuring. But any recovery in business sentiment had been muted - and might be

reversed - while consumer confidence could be further damaged by record levels of unemployment.

3 Outside the major industrial countries, spreads on emerging market sovereign dollar debt - as

measured by J P Morgan - had fallen by over 200 basis points during the month. Sentiment - and in

some cases activity - was a little stronger in East Asia and Latin America, where some countries had

benefited from higher oil prices. The markets appeared to have discounted a deterioration in

prospects in Russia. So in general, developments in the world economy seemed much as expected in

the February Inflation Report, although the downside risks to activity might have diminished

somewhat. A major uncertainty was over the events in Kosovo, where the effects on consumer and

business confidence elsewhere, and on the budgetary positions of the NATO countries, were not yet

clear.

4 There were some signs that commodity prices had begun to bottom out, and oil prices had risen

sharply as a result of agreed cutbacks in supply. While it was too soon to judge whether these

increases would persist, the cutbacks appeared to have greater credibility in the market than had


-----

sometimes been the case. The downward pressure on world prices from oil and other commodities

might therefore be less than in the recent past. But with most economies outside the United States

below productive capacity, the scope for a generalised pick-up in inflation was limited.

**The exchange rate, money and credit**

5 For most of the month sterling had been stronger than at the time of the previous meeting of the

Committee, particularly against the euro, although it had weakened a little in recent days. But the

effective exchange rate index remained over 2% higher than implied by the central projection in the

February Inflation Report. Many possible explanations had been advanced for sterling’s strength,

and discussed by the Committee in this as in previous meetings. If this strength in the exchange rate

were sustained, it would tend to dampen inflation, and also activity in the internationally traded

sectors of the economy.

6 So far as money was concerned, growth rates for M4 had continued to slow, as expected, with a

sharp decrease in the contribution from other financial corporations (OFCs). Growth in M4 lending

had also slowed further.

**Demand and output**

7 The Committee discussed the revisions made to the estimates of the level and composition of

GDP for 1997 and 1998. Since the February Inflation Report, the estimated level of GDP at market

prices in 1998 Q4 had been reduced by ½ %, although by only ¼ % when measured at basic prices.

This had consequences for measures of the output gap and labour productivity. The implications for

future price developments were unclear. On one interpretation, this implied that there was less

pressure on capacity and that, given the lags involved, the effects of slower GDP growth had yet to

feed through fully into lower inflation. On an alternative view, it suggested a less favourable

short-run trade-off between activity and inflation; inflation was unchanged and either capacity

utilisation was lower, core inflation higher or estimates of capacity had been reduced. But the size of

the changes had not been large, and it was not clear on either view how much significance should be

attached to this.

8 Estimates for the growth of GDP in 1998 Q4 had also been revised downwards, to 0.1% over the

previous quarter. Within this total, the weakest demand components had been government


-----

consumption and net trade. In contrast private consumption and investment had been revised up,

significantly so in the case of business investment. At the same time, the downwards revision to

inventories suggested that the risks of a significant stock cycle in 1999 had diminished, particularly

since stocks held by manufacturers and retailers appeared under control. This interpretation was in

line with earlier survey evidence for these sectors. But because of the downwards revision to the

level of GDP, the estimated stock-output ratio was little changed.

9 Retail sales volumes had declined in February, and on a three month average had been only 1%

above the levels of a year earlier. But the CBI distributive trades survey suggested that a trough

might have been reached, and spending on services, which was not included in retail sales, had

continued to grow faster than spending on goods. The GfK consumer confidence index was now

positive for the first time in nine months. When taken together with other information on consumer

spending, the data appeared in line with the Inflation Report projections for consumption in the first

quarter of 1999.

10 The Committee considered the prospects for investment. The financial deficit of the private

non-financial corporations (PNFCs) had widened to 3% of GDP, the highest level since 1990. This

might in part reflect the growth of business investment in the second half of 1998. The increase

appeared to have been most marked in the services sector, and might represent a bringing forward of

IT-related spending ahead of the millennium. The millennium might also boost spending on

construction this year, with signs, perhaps, that next year would be less buoyant. All this might have

implications for the profile of activity over the next two years. But work by Bank staff suggested

that movements in the credit and money holdings of the PNFCs were consistent both with the recent

strength of investment, and continued growth in 1999.

11 The Committee agreed that the Budget contained little that altered the outlook for inflation. At

its previous meeting it had decided that the figures for the overall fiscal position, on which the

Committee had been briefed, were in line with the assumptions made in the February Inflation

_Report. Following the Budget itself, an analysis of the implications of the detailed measures for the_

composition of demand suggested that these should not have a significant additional effect on the

prospects for activity and inflation over the forecast period.

12 Forward-looking survey evidence continued to suggest an improvement (from a low base) in

business confidence in all sectors of the economy. But official data and that from surveys indicated


-----

that manufacturing output was still declining, and information from the Bank’s regional Agents

suggested that in this sector in particular, confidence remained fragile. By contrast, the CIPS index

for services output had risen above 50, indicating growth rather than contraction, for the first time

since October. The sharp fall seen in the second half of 1998 might have been partly in response to

events in financial markets at that time. A recovery in confidence had therefore been expected, with

the readings now consistent with the central projection for output in 1999 contained in the February

_Inflation Report. The CIPS survey for construction had also strengthened, in line with other_

indicators for that sector.

13 All in all, the data suggested that the prospects for activity were little different from those

expected at the time of the February Inflation Report. The downwards revision to the level of GDP

had been interpreted by some commentators as reducing inflationary pressures, but the size of the

revision of GDP measured at basic prices was small, and the implications for inflation ambiguous.

At the same time, significant changes had been made to the composition of demand, particularly to

investment and stockbuilding. While the recovery in business confidence had yet to be reflected in

official figures, this was to be expected given the lags involved.

**The housing market**

14 There had been a sharp increase in the Halifax and Nationwide house price indices in March.

Data from the House Builders Federation on net reservations and site visits, together with figures on

loan approvals and particulars delivered, suggested that turnover in the housing market had risen.

The increase had followed a sharp fall towards the end of 1998, and the turnaround might have been

influenced by the fall in interest rates since October.

**The labour market**

15 Employment had continued to rise, with the LFS measure increasing by 119,000 in the last three

months. However, much of this increase had been in part-time employment, and on a full time

equivalent basis the increase had probably been closer to 50,000. Total hours worked had fallen, and

the unemployment rate had risen. The effects of this on consumer confidence may not yet have been

seen. The surveys were mixed; while some suggested a sharp downturn in the demand for labour,

with the Manpower survey showing the weakest job prospects since 1993, the CIPS employment

index had risen slightly, but remained below 50.


-----

16 The latest data for average earnings growth continued the fall seen since the new series was

released. The headline figure had reached 4.3% in December. This decline was linked to a reduction

in hours worked per head, and to a negative contribution from bonuses.

17 Data on settlements also indicated a decline in nominal wage pressures, although inflation

expectations appeared to have fallen by even more. The decline in settlements was not yet apparent

from the headline twelve month figures, but for a matched sample of firms from the Bank’s database,

settlements this year were running at 3.3% in January and February, as against 4% the previous year.

**Prices**

18 The implications of a reduction in earnings growth for inflation would depend on a variety of

factors, including developments in productivity, margins and import prices. Productivity growth

over the past three years had been below its 40 year average. It was difficult to know how much

weight to attach to observed productivity growth over such a short period. But relatively small

differences in assumptions about productivity could have a material effect on the projections for

inflation over the next two years. More generally, the pass-through from unit labour costs to prices

was not straightforward. It would depend, among other things, on cyclical conditions and on other

input prices. These issues would be looked at again in the forthcoming Inflation Report round.

19 Oil prices were much higher than a month ago, although some rise had already been assumed in

the central projection in the February Inflation Report. These increases would exert some upwards

pressure on input prices, particularly since the falls in non-oil commodity prices might be coming to

an end. Depending on the path of the exchange rate, domestic inflationary pressures might come

more to the fore in determining the path of RPIX, even if competition from imports remained

intense. On the other hand, the recent falls in non-oil commodity prices had been steeper than

expected, and the exchange rate had strengthened. The balance between domestic and international

inflationary pressures would be examined in the context of the next Inflation Report.

20 The most recent figure for RPIX inflation - at 2.4% - had been below the target for the first time

since the Committee had been established.  This had been despite some strength in the price of

seasonal foods, which might unwind in coming months. But the difference from the 2.5% target was

very small, and of little relevance to the prospects for inflation two years ahead. Next month it was

very likely that RPIX inflation would be above target as a result of the timing of Budget measures,


-----

which would affect petrol prices in March as compared with April last year. But this effect would

last for only a month, and should have no implications for inflation in two years’ time.

**Tactical considerations**

21 The Committee noted that a reduction in rates was widely expected this month, although rather

less universally than had been the case a week earlier. There was also a growing feeling in the

market that the ECB might reduce its rates later that day. Should either factor influence the

Committee’s thinking?

22 It was possible that a decision to leave interest rates unchanged would be interpreted as a signal

that current levels would be the trough of this interest rate cycle. It was also possible that a similar

conclusion might be reached from an unexpectedly large reduction in rates. Given that any decision

was open to misinterpretation, the Committee agreed that this was not a factor which it would take

into account.

23 There was also the issue of the exchange rate. While this was little changed from its level at the

time of the previous meeting, its strength against the euro continued to surprise many observers. But

the reaction of sterling to any change in UK interest rates was unclear.

**The immediate policy decision**

24 Over the past month, there had been further revisions to the level and composition of GDP, a

continuing recovery in survey data from the low points reached in the latter part of 1998, and some

easing in labour market pressures, including lower settlements and earnings growth. This was

against the backdrop of a world economy in which some of the downside risks had diminished, oil

prices had risen sharply, and the exchange rate was over 2% higher than assumed in the February

_Inflation Report._

25 Given this background the Committee discussed the case for no change to rates, a reduction of

25 basis points, and a reduction of 50 basis points.

26 The Committee considered various developments which could have suggested leaving rates

unchanged this month. The prospects for activity were much as expected, with some signs that past

reductions in interest rates were beginning to sustain activity. The changes to the composition of


-----

demand were at least as important as the downwards revision to GDP, and suggested that the

downside risks to output from a stock cycle or weak investment during 1999 were less now than

previously thought. Financial wealth had risen, with share prices up further during the month and the

housing market showing signs of recovery. Survey measures of confidence had also recovered

somewhat. Overall, the evidence appeared consistent with positive, if slow, growth in GDP during

the rest of this year, as set out in the central projection of the February Inflation Report. And while

there were signs that labour market pressures had begun to ease, the evidence was not conclusive (for

example on earnings per hour) and the link between this and prices required further analysis.

Finally, oil prices were sharply higher.

27 But other developments pointed to the need for a further reduction in interest rates. The effective

exchange rate had been stronger throughout most of the previous month. Earnings growth seemed to

be lower than expected, a view supported by information on settlements, although assessing the

implications of this for prices required more work. Finally, confidence, although improved, probably

remained fragile. With a reduction in interest rates widely expected a decision to maintain rates at

their current levels could be seen as a policy tightening, which might have an unnecessarily

damaging effect on confidence and activity.

28 The previous month several members had felt that not much additional news would be required

to justify a further reduction in rates. They took the view that the balance of evidence since then

supported a reduction in interest rates this month. While the prospects for activity were little

changed over the month, the risks to the inflation outlook had shifted somewhat to the downside. It

was therefore appropriate to reduce rates by 25 basis points in order to meet the inflation target.

29 Another view which favoured an immediate reduction in the repo rate of 25 basis points was that

there was a growing risk that the inflation target would be undershot, given the lags between output

and inflation, the intensity of price competition from overseas and the deceleration seen in

settlements and earnings. Short-term inflation expectations as measured by surveys had declined,

and might fall further given the sharp decline in the RPI measure of inflation. The size of the PNFC

deficit was a concern, and the growth in investment might well be a temporary pre-millennium

effect. Finally, the intensifying Balkans conflict increased the downside risks of a further blow to

confidence in the global economy. It was therefore necessary to keep interest rates on a downwards

path, and a reduction in rates of 25 basis points this month was appropriate.


-----

30 Another view was that in March, a reduction of 40 basis points had been required. Since then the

revisions to GDP had contained little news, although given the underspend in 1998, it was possible

that government final demand might increase by less than planned. With price developments

favourable, and the future earnings profile likely to be below that contained in the February Inflation

_Report, it was preferable to reduce the repo rate by 50 basis points now, in order to prevent inflation_

falling below the target and to underpin activity.

31 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo

rate be reduced by 25 basis points to 5.25%. Eight members of the Committee (the Governor,

Mervyn King, David Clementi, Alan Budd, Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and

John Vickers) voted for the proposition. Willem Buiter voted against, preferring a reduction of 50

basis points.

#### ANNEX: SUMMARY OF DATA PRESENTED BY BANK STAFF

A1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by the Bank staff to the Monetary Policy

Committee on 1 April, in advance of its meeting on 7-8 April 1999. At the start of the Committee

meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available,

and that information is included in the Annex.

**I** **The international economy**

A2 In the United States the final estimate of GDP in 1998 Q4 had been 1.5%, in line with the
preliminary estimate. Some special factors which may have supported robust growth in Q4, such
as the seasonality of trade data, had possibly begun to unwind in Q1. The trade deficit had
widened to $17.0 billion in January from $14.1 billion in December. However, other factors
supporting rapid growth in Q4 had persisted in early 1999. The outlook for consumption had
been little changed: retail sales growth had remained rapid in the first two months of the year and
consumer confidence had risen again in March. The NAPM index of industrial sentiment had
risen further in March. The sharpness of the rise in the NAPM index in recent months had
suggested at least that the slowdown in industrial production growth might have bottomed out.
Employment growth had been strong in February, but had weakened in March. This month-tomonth volatility may have reflected some weather-related erratic influences. The unemployment
rate had fallen to 4.2% in March. Annual growth in average hourly earnings had continued to
ease, falling to 3.6% in March, and consumer price inflation had remained muted. Since the
March MPC meeting, market expectations of interest rates in the United States had declined,
while equity prices in mid-1999 were expected by the market to be slightly higher.

A3 Within the euro area, Italian GDP had declined by 0.3% in 1998 Q4. This decline had been
exaggerated by the smaller number of working days in the quarter compared with Q3, though the
data had still revealed unexpected weakness in domestic demand growth. In the euro area as a
whole, industrial sentiment had weakened slightly in February. The western German Ifo index
had fallen in February to its lowest level since August 1996. Yet consumer confidence had
remained buoyant. French retail sales had fallen in February but underlying growth had remained
robust. The three-month centred moving average of annual broad money growth in the euro area
had risen to 5.1% in January from 4.9% in December. Monthly data showed that year on year
growth had slowed to 5.2% in February from 5.6% in January, partly reflecting weaker growth of
overnight deposits. Annual growth in the euro-area HICP had remained at 0.8% in February, and
there had been little sign of inflationary pressure from intermediate prices. Since the previous
MPC meeting, the euro had depreciated against the dollar and market expectations of short-term


-----

interest rates had declined. In its spring forecast, the European Commission had revised down its

projections for GDP growth in the euro area in 1999 and 2000, to 2.2% and 2.7% respectively.

A4 Japanese GDP had fallen by 0.8% in 1998 Q4. There had been evidence of earlier fiscal
stimulus in the data on government investment, which had contributed 0.9 percentage points to
growth in that quarter. But all other major components of GDP had remained weak in Q4. In
February, the unemployment rate had risen to a record high of 4.6% and inactivity had increased.
Employment had continued to fall. In February, personal incomes had continued to decline. Real
consumption had fallen by 3.8% in the year to February. The March Tankan survey of industrial
sentiment had recorded a slight improvement in business confidence, owing primarily to an
easing of financial conditions. But other indicators within the Tankan had remained weak. Since
the March MPC meeting, ten-year government bond yields had continued to fall, by around
25 basis points. Market expectations of Japanese short-term interest rates had remained relatively
stable, as had the yen.

A5 Spreads on government bonds in emerging markets over US Treasuries had narrowed over
the month, although they remained higher in Latin America than in Asian countries. Agreement
on a new IMF financial package for Brazil had been reflected in the appreciation of the Brazilian
real since the previous MPC meeting. But available data for the first two months of this year had
shown that capital flows to emerging markets were unlikely to be markedly larger in Q1 than in
Q4.

**II** **Monetary and financial conditions**

A6 Growth of notes and coin had remained stable in March. After adjusting for the effects of

the new 50 pence and £2 coins, the one-month growth rate had remained at 0.5%, as in January
and February. The annualised three-month growth rate had fallen to 6.0% in March from 6.9% in
February.

A7 The stock of M4 had increased by £4.2 billion in February compared with £1.2 billion in
January. The February figure included a £3.9 billion rise in repos (not seasonally adjusted). The
slowdown in annual M4 growth had continued in February: the twelve-month growth rate of M4
had fallen to 7.4%, from 7.7% in January.

A8 The growth of M4 lending had been relatively weak in February at £3.6 billion, despite
strong reverse repo activity, partly reflecting a substantial securitisation. The twelve-month
growth rate of M4 lending had been 6.9% in February compared with 7.8% in January (after
adjustment for the securitisation, the twelve-month growth rate was 7.1%). This slowdown had
partly reflected strong February 1998 figures dropping out of the calculation.

A9 Private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs’) holdings of M4 had grown by 1.6% in


-----

February. The strong flow had been distorted by the proceeds of a large corporate debt issue

being held on deposit. Excluding the estimated effects of this issue, the twelve-month growth rate
had risen to 6.2% in February from 5.8% in January. When adjusted in the same way, the three

and six-month growth rates in February had fallen below their rates in January. M4 lending to
PNFCs had fallen by £0.2 billion in February. Analysis by Bank staff had suggested that the
coincident pick-up in the growth of PNFCs’ M4 lending and slowdown in M4 deposits over the
previous six months might have been due to the strength of business investment in 1998 H2. The
same analysis had indicated that the current level of PNFCs’ M4 deposits and lending might
suggest that business investment would remain relatively robust this year.

A10 Households’ holdings of M4 had increased by £2.0 billion in February, compared with an
increase of £1.9 billion in January. The weak figure for January had been attributed, in part, to
the effects of concentrated income tax payments following the introduction of self-assessment.
While it was possible that these effects had also been present in the February data, the new
information might imply a more general slowdown. Households’ M4 borrowing had remained
steady at £3.2 billion in February. Total lending to individuals had increased by 0.6% in
February, much the same as the average since February 1998. Within individuals’ lending,
secured lending had increased by 0.5% in February. Again this was broadly in line with onemonth changes since February 1998. But the one-month growth rate of unsecured lending had
fallen from 1.3% in January to 0.9% in February.

A11 The stock of M4 held by other financial corporations (OFCs) had increased by £0.3 billion
in February compared with a fall of £1.8 billion in January. The twelve-month growth rate in
OFCs’ M4 had fallen to its lowest level since 1995Q1. M4 lending to OFCs had increased to
£1.7 billion in February from £0.3 billion in January.

A12 Turning to price indicators of monetary conditions, sterling interest rate expectations had
fallen since the March MPC decision. Short-term interest rates had implied that financial market
participants expected the repo rate to fall to around 5% during 1999. Longer-term nominal
interest rates had also fallen: three-year forward rates had fallen by around 20 basis points since
the March MPC meeting. The falls had been concentrated at the short end of the yield curve.

A13 Measures of short-term inflation expectations from monthly surveys had remained broadly
unchanged at 2.2% to 2.3%. Measures of two-year inflation expectations from quarterly surveys
had shown falls for almost all groups surveyed: for example, the Barclays Basix survey had
reported that trade unions’ average RPI inflation expectations for the next two years had fallen by
40 basis points since the 1998 Q4 survey. Inflation forward rates, derived from index-linked bond
yields, had shown little change since the March MPC meeting. Since the February Inflation
_Report, however, inflation forward rates at all maturities had risen from a range of 2.5% to 2.9%_
to around 3%. One explanation offered by Bank staff was that nominal yields may have been
artificially depressed earlier this year as a result of institutional investors’ demand to hold liquid
instruments.


-----

A14 The FT-SE 100 index had risen by 6.8% since the March MPC meeting. Implied volatility

had fallen further, and to below the levels seen before the Russian debt crisis. The FTSE
SmallCap index had risen more than the rest of the market, reflecting in part the strength of the

General industrials sector over the period. The Resources sector had also performed very strongly
alongside the rise in oil prices.

A15 The effective exchange rate had fallen in recent days, after an earlier appreciation, to stand
0.3% lower than at the March MPC meeting. Sterling had changed little against the euro and had
depreciated slightly against the US dollar.

**III** **The Budget**

A16 Staff presented a short summary of the Chancellor’s recent Budget. HM Treasury’s
forecast of PSNB (including the windfall tax) for 1998/99 had been revised up slightly. Lower
receipts had more than off-set lower spending. The Budget had announced measures that would
increase borrowing by £1 billion in 1999/00, £1.4 billion in 2000/01 and £3.6 billion in 2001/02.
However, other changes to HM Treasury’s forecasts for spending and receipts over these years
had led to lower projected borrowing over the same period. Lower forecasts for social security
payments and debt interest payments had more than offset lower projected receipts.

A17 Overall, the outlook for the fiscal stance was little changed since the Pre-Budget Report: a
small deficit had still been projected in 1999/00 and 2000/01 but this was cyclical in nature; the
structural deficit had been projected to be broadly balanced. The ‘Golden Rule’ was expected to
be met with a small margin of safety over the next three years. The net debt to GDP ratio had
been projected to fall well below 40 per cent by 2001/02.

A18 The Budget measures had been aimed at targeting help on families with children,
improving work incentives and promoting enterprise through microeconomic reform. These had
included reductions in personal income tax rates; changes to National Insurance contributions;
measures to reduce taxation for small businesses; and the introduction of a Children’s Tax Credit
along with increases in existing benefits to families with children.


-----

**IV** **Demand and output**

A19 The 1998 Q4 National Accounts release had included revisions back to 1997 Q1. The

level of GDP at constant market prices in 1998 Q4 had been 0.3 percentage points lower than the
February estimate, and 0.5 percentage points lower than the preliminary estimate. Revisions to
GDP at constant basic prices had been more limited. Downward revisions to the level of the
income and output based measures of GDP had reduced the shortfall of expenditure relative to the
average measure. In 1998 as a whole, GDP had grown by 2.1% (revised from 2.3%) compared
with 3.5% (unrevised) in 1997. The quarterly growth rate of GDP at constant market prices in Q4
had been revised down to 0.1% from 0.2%. Within the expenditure measure of GDP, upward
revisions to consumption and investment growth and the contribution of net trade had been
matched by a large downward revision to changes in inventories.

A20 Household spending growth in Q4 had been revised up to 0.6% from 0.4%, following an
outturn of 0.1% in Q3. Spending on vehicles and energy had been particularly volatile in Q3 and
Q4. Household spending growth had slowed overall in 1998: the annualised rate of growth had
eased to 1.2% in 1998 H2 from 3.0% in H1. Despite strong consumption growth, the household
saving ratio in Q4 had risen to 7.4% from 6.3%. This had reflected a sharp decline in tax
payments which had led to an increase of 1.8% in post-tax income. Compensation of employees
had risen by 1.5% in nominal terms in Q4. The erratic path of tax payments and household
income during 1998 had partly been related to the introduction of self-assessment. The level of
tax payments made by households had risen sharply in 1998 by 17%, leading to virtually no
growth in real post-tax household income.

A21 Whole economy investment growth in Q4 had been revised upwards to 2.9% from 2.0%.
Business investment had grown by 5.5%. The ratio of business investment to GDP had increased
sharply in recent years - in line with the ratio in the US - to exceed its previous peak in 1989 Q3.
But the increase in the capital stock to output ratio had been more moderate. In both the UK and
the US part of the recent strength in business investment was due to IT spending.

A22 Changes in inventories in Q4 had been revised downwards to £0.9 billion from
£1.9 billion. If alignment adjustments are excluded, stockbuilding had increased by less in Q4
than in Q3. The revisions had been concentrated in ‘other industries’ and manufacturing.
Manufacturers and retailers had destocked in Q4, consistent with earlier survey evidence. But
lower stockbuilding had been to some extent offset by a downward revision to output so that the
stock-output ratio had been little changed. The March CBI monthly Industrial Trends survey had
continued to indicate that stocks were more than adequate: the balance had been +20, above its
average of +13 since 1985.

A23 The contribution of net trade to GDP growth in Q4 had been revised to -0.9 percentage


-----

points from -1.1 as a result of upward revisions to exports and imports. The level of exports and,

to a larger extent, imports back to 1997 Q1 had also been revised upwards. The revisions to
imports had helped to reduce the puzzle about their relative weakness following sterling’s

appreciation. Monthly trade data for January had shown a sharp decline in exports to EU and
non-EU countries (of 3.3% and 6.7%) and a continued rise in imports. Though the decline in
exports to non-EU countries had unwound in February, overall these data had suggested another
negative net trade contribution to GDP growth in 1999 Q1.

A24 Service sector output growth in Q4 had been revised down to 0.5% from 0.6%.
Manufacturing output had declined by an unrevised 1.3% in Q4. Construction output growth had
been revised up to 0.1%. On the income side of the accounts, the main news had been the decline
in financial company profits in Q4.

A25 Retail sales volumes had declined by 0.3% in February, following January’s strong rise.
Though the three month annual growth rate declined further to 1.0%, the CBI Distributive Trades
survey had suggested that the decline in sales volumes growth might have reached a trough. The
balance on reported sales in March had risen to +14 - the highest since September 1998 - and the
orders balance had risen for the second month running. New car registrations had fallen sharply
in January and February relative to a year ago, but had been difficult to interpret because of
changing seasonal patterns following the change in registration practices.

A26 Industrial production had declined by 0.5% in January - because of a sharp fall in output in
the energy extraction and supply industries - but had risen by 0.1% in February because of a rise
in energy-related output. Manufacturing output had shown a small increase of 0.1% in January,
following five successive monthly declines, but had fallen by 0.1% in February. Growth in
industrial production over the three months to February compared with the previous three months
had been -1.0% (-0.9% in January); and for manufacturing output it had been -0.8% (-1.0% in
January). The CBI and CIPS surveys had indicated another decline in manufacturing output in
1999 Q1, though it appeared that this would be less than in 1998 Q4.

A27 The CIPS Report on Services had reported a rise in all indices in March: the output index
had risen from 49.5 to 53, the first positive reading since October 1998; the incoming new
business index had also risen above 50 to 53.9, the highest level since June 1998 and above the
average for 1998 as whole; and the business expectations index had risen to 76.4 from 72.1 in
February.

A28 The Nationwide house price index had increased by 1.5% in March - the largest monthly

rise since June 1997 - and had been 7.6% higher than a year earlier; the Halifax index had
increased by 1.2% in March and had been 4.5% higher than a year earlier. The RICS survey had

suggested price rises across all regions in February. The HBF survey balances on site visitors and
net reservations had continued to indicate an increase in housing transactions in coming months.
Particulars delivered had increased for a third consecutive month, to stand 4.5% higher in the
three months to February compared with the previous three months. The GfK consumer
confidence indicator had risen for the third month running.

**V** **Labour Market**

A29 LFS employment had grown by 119,000 (0.4%) in the three months to January, compared
with the previous three months, somewhat stronger than the Workforce Jobs figure of 69,000 in
the three months to December. The difference between the two measures, probably due to timing
and the coverage of the surveys, was accounted for by the larger rise in employees in the LFS,
driven by a large increase in part-time jobs. Total hours worked had fallen by 0.2% in the three
months to January, and average hours per worker had been 0.7% lower. The fall in average hours
worked had reflected the large rise in part-time employment and a 0.7% fall in average hours
worked by full-time workers, consistent with a reduction in overtime working.

A30 The strong increases in employment had contrasted with survey evidence. The CIPS
surveys for March had suggested that employment was continuing to fall in the manufacturing
and construction sectors, though there had been a small increase in employment in the service
sector. Forward-looking surveys had suggested that this pattern might persist. The Manpower
survey for Q1 had shown the weakest job prospects since 1993, for the second quarter in
succession. The outlook in manufacturing had worsened, while employment intentions in the
service sector had been little changed.

A31 The stock of unfilled job-centre vacancies had edged down by 3,500 in February and the
number of jobs advertised in national newspapers had fallen, according to the Press Recruitment
Advertising Index. But the number of permanent placements by job agencies had increased in
March for the first time in six months, according to the FRES survey on the demand for staff.

A32 LFS unemployment had risen by 37,000 in the three months to January, taking the rate to
6.3%. This had been the first rise in the rate, in non-overlapping periods, since early 1993. The
number of people unemployed for more than one year had fallen by 17,000 in the three months to
January, offset by a rise in short-term unemployment. Claimant unemployment had risen by
4,300, but the rate had remained unchanged at 4.6%. Inflows into unemployment had been


-----

broadly flat, and the exit rate from unemployment had fallen, but remained at a high level. The

rise in employment had been associated with a fall in inactivity of 117,000. In net terms, all of
the rise in employment had been concentrated among workers more than 25 years old, which had

been roughly matched by falls in inactivity.

A33 Headline whole-economy annual average earnings growth had fallen to 4.3% in
December, reflecting a decline in the growth of irregular pay. The slowdown in headline earnings
growth since the peak in May had been sharp, but this measure referred to growth in earnings per
head. It was likely that the growth in earnings per hour had fallen less rapidly, reflecting the
reduction in average hours worked over this period. The Reward index of annual earnings growth
had continued to fall, from a peak of 5.4% in June 1998 to 4.5% in February. The growth of
wages and salaries had been broadly flat since mid-1997. The rise in 1998 Q4, which had
contrasted with the fall in growth measured by the Average Earnings Index over the same period,
could be explained by volatility in pension contributions and balancing adjustments between
different measures of GDP.

A34 The Bank’s employment-weighted twelve-month measure of whole economy settlements
had remained at 3.7% in February, but the three-month measure had fallen by 0.3 percentage
points to 3.3%. In a matched sample of firms from the Bank’s settlements database, mean
settlements in January and February had fallen to 3.3% in 1999, from 4% in 1998. The
proportion of employees in this sample who had received a lower settlement in 1999 had been
78%. The three-month measure from Industrial Relations Services had also fallen in February.

A35 Annual productivity growth had fallen from 1.1% in Q3 to 0.7% in Q4, the lowest rate
since 1991. The revisions to Workforce Jobs, announced in December, had caused a generally
downward revision to productivity growth. Because the growth of wages and salaries per head
had increased and productivity growth had fallen in Q4, the growth of unit wage costs had
continued to rise.

A36 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted a survey of their contacts about employment
prospects and the adequacy and quality of their labour force. They had asked whether contacts
had expected employment to change over the next 6 months: 36% of respondents had reported
that the level of employment was expected to be unchanged, whereas the number of companies
who had been planning to increase staff had been the same as the number planning to shed labour
(32% each). Over 50% of manufacturers had reported that employment levels were expected to
be lower whereas in the service sector over 40% of respondents expected higher employment.
There had also been some differences across regions, but most had presented a picture consistent
with the overall results.

A37 The Agents had also asked about the adequacy of the existing labour force in relation to


-----

current output. About 30% of respondents had reported that their current employment was more

than adequate, whereas less than 20% had reported that their labour force was less than adequate.
In manufacturing, there had been many more firms who had reported that they were over-staffed

than under-staffed, whereas in the service sector, there had been slightly more firms reporting an
under-resourced rather than over-resourced labour force. Some contacts had been recruiting staff
even if their existing workforce had been more than adequate, either because they were expecting
a significant upturn in demand conditions or because they had been recruiting different types of
staff, perhaps with specialist skills.

A38 The Agents also asked whether the quality of recruits had changed in the last 12 months.
Around two-thirds of their contacts had reported that the quality of recruits had been the same
recently. There had been little evidence of lower quality recruits overall. However, in the service
sector, especially retail, there had been more dissatisfaction with the recent quality of recruits than
in manufacturing.

**VI** **Prices**

A39 Oil prices had risen by over 20% in March in response to an agreement to new OPEC
production cuts. The effect on RPIX inflation and GDP if oil prices were to remain at these levels
was likely to be limited. The Bank’s index of commodity prices excluding oil had fallen by 0.4%
in February, and 1.2% including oil prices. The trend in both measures had continued to be one
of moderating deflation. The measures to reform the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which
had been agreed at the Berlin summit in March, included smaller and later price cuts than in the
original proposals. The 0.3% (upper-limit) effect on the RPI which had been estimated by MAFF
on the basis of the original proposals was likely to be smaller in light of the agreement. Producer
price inflation had remained weak in February: input prices fell by 0.1% - as in January, the
movement had been largely accounted for by the oil price (10% of the index); output prices
excluding excise duties had risen by 0.2%, to a level 0.6% lower than a year earlier. The CIPS
and CBI surveys had continued to suggest further falls.

A40 Import prices had fallen by 0.6% in January whereas export prices had risen by 0.6%. The
difference between the annual rates of export and import price inflation had reached
1.5 percentage points in January, the largest difference since June 1997 - though both had
remained sharply negative (imports -4.9%, exports -3.4%). The GDP (market prices) deflator in
the year to the fourth quarter of 1998 had grown by 2.6%, revised down from 2.8%. The
equivalent measure for the implied household consumption deflator had been revised up by


-----

0.4 percentage points to 2.3% - close to the annual rate of RPIX inflation in the fourth quarter

(2.5%). The unit labour costs based measure of domestically generated inflation had become
available again, and had continued to rise in the fourth quarter of 1998.

A41 RPIX inflation had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 2.4% in February; both RPIY and
RPI inflation had also fallen, to 1.8% and 2.1% respectively. The fall had been largely due to
goods price inflation falling by 0.3 percentage points to 1.1%. The HICP inflation rate had also
fallen, by 0.1 percentage points to 1.5%, for the same reasons as RPIX. Annual RPIX inflation
was likely to increase temporarily in March - largely due to the difference of timing of the
budgets in 1998 and 1999 - and fall in April.

**VII** **Reports by the Bank's Agents**

A42 The Agents had reported on their general discussions with contacts. Firms in the service
sector had tended to report slower growth. But conditions had remained fairly positive overall,
particularly in leisure, finance and business services. Growth in the retail sector had continued to
be relatively weak, though there had been an increasing polarisation in performance between
stores reporting quite strong growth and those reporting no growth or even falling sales volumes.
Service firms with an exposure to the manufacturing sector - such as road hauliers - had
experienced adverse trading conditions. But Agents had felt that the rate of deterioration in
manufacturing activity may have eased. Stock corrections that had started in 1998 Q4 had largely
been completed. But competition in the domestic market from imports had been increasing,
particularly from European-based firms as European markets had remained relatively weak. The
exchange rate had remained a concern for UK exporters and was considered an obstacle to
recovery. Demand from the United States had continued to be strong and some East Asian
markets had seen a rise in trade enquiries.

A43 Construction sector activity had remained buoyant and this was expected to continue into
next year. Housing market activity had shown signs of improvement although it had remained
fairly subdued in many areas. But there was less construction work available beyond mid-2000.
Firms had suggested that public sector work was likely to be an important factor next year. The
outlook for investment more generally had remained positive, though still cautious, and the focus
of spending had continued to be on improved efficiency and product development. Investment in
some sectors - such as oil and steel - had been reduced or moved overseas.

A44 The service sector had continued to be the main provider of new jobs, though tighter
control on numbers and increased flexibility had been evident. More firms had been introducing
annualised hours contracts and making more use of part-time and temporary contract staff. There


-----

had been evidence that some firms were reluctant to shed staff as demand slowed because of

likely recruitment difficulties in any upturn. Natural wastage had been employed to reduce staff
numbers by small amounts. Pay awards had moderated in both the manufacturing and service

sectors, more so in manufacturing where there had also been a rise in the number of zero or
deferred awards.

**VIII** **Market intelligence**

A45 There had been a broad market consensus that interest rates would be lowered in April,
based on the improving inflation picture, with some also expecting an ECB rate cut. Survey and
asset price evidence had suggested a wider divergence of views on UK rates over the next year or
two, based on alternative forecasts for growth and inflation up to 2000. Long-term rates had
fallen slightly over the past month. Sterling had appreciated during 1999 versus the euro, and had
appeared little affected by domestic factors in the month. Some of the factors influencing
sterling - such as demand related to merger and acquisition business - were thought to have been
temporary, and there had been some evidence that the market saw downside risks over the next
year.
