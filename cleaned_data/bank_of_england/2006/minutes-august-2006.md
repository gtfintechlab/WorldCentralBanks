#### MINUTES OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 2-3 AUGUST 2006

1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, and against the background of its latest

projections for output and inflation, the Committee discussed financial market developments; the

international economy; money, credit, demand and output; and costs and prices.

**Financial markets**

2 There had been relatively little news from financial markets since the July MPC meeting. Short
term market interest rates had fallen in the United Kingdom during the first part of the month, but had

risen following the stronger-than-expected CPI data on 18 July to end the period little changed.

Market prices implied one rate rise in 2006 and a further rise in 2007. Implied volatility of short-term

interest rates had also increased over the month, suggesting heightened uncertainty about the decision

to be made at the August meeting. In a poll conducted by Reuters, 7 out of 46 private sector

economists had expected an increase in August.

3 Euro-area short-term interest rates were lower on the month by around 10 basis points and in the

United States short-term rates had fallen by around 25 basis points. The decline in US rates seemed to

reflect the markets’ interpretation of public testimony by the Chairman of the Federal Open Markets

Committee on July 19, as well as weaker-than-expected data on employment and output. Longer-term

nominal and real interest rates had fallen by 10-25 basis points in the United States, the euro area and

the United Kingdom.

4 Consistent with developments in interest rate differentials, the sterling effective exchange rate

index had risen by nearly 2% on the month, leaving it around 3% above the May Inflation Report

forecast path. Equity prices in the major economies had initially fallen after the start of hostilities in

Lebanon, but had recovered later to be little changed on the month.

5 In a widely anticipated move, the Bank of Japan had brought to an end its long-standing policy

of zero short-term interest rates, raising rates to 0.25% on July 14.

**The international economy**

6 Oil prices had been volatile, primarily reflecting concerns about developments in the Middle

East. By the start of the MPC meeting, the price of a barrel of Brent Crude had risen to over $77

despite rising OPEC production and US oil stocks.

7 In the United States, GDP growth in the second quarter had been estimated at 0.6% following

unsustainably strong growth of 1.4% in the first quarter. Some slowdown had been expected in

consumption, consistent with a softer housing market, but investment growth had been unexpectedly

weak. There had also been substantial revisions to earlier data, leaving the level of real GDP some

0.8% lower than previously estimated, and upward revisions to price deflators. In particular, the

inflation rate of the core deflator for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) now looked to have

stabilized at over 2.0% during 2005 – rather than drifting lower – and had risen to 2.4% in June 2006.

It was likely that productivity data due to be released the following week would show commensurate

downward revisions, raising the possibility that the growth rate of potential output in the United States

was somewhat less than previously thought.

8 Some of the more recent US activity data had been more positive, with the Purchasing

Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing increasing to 54.7 in July for example. And despite the

weakness in Q2 investment, the financial conditions of corporations remained strong, credit conditions

were favourable and capacity utilisation was above average. These were all factors potentially

supporting investment growth going forward.

9 In the euro area, business survey evidence suggested that output growth in Q2 was likely to have

been faster than in Q1. Some survey data had weakened slightly in July, but the European

Commission’s industrial confidence survey had reached its highest level since September 2000. In

Germany, the IFO index had remained high in July. Consumption indicators for Germany and France

had been reasonably positive. Looking forward, the pattern of German demand growth was likely to

be distorted by the planned increase in VAT announced for 2007, bringing forward some consumption

from 2007 to 2006 and hence acting as a drag on demand growth next year.

10 Output growth in Asia had remained robust, especially in China where the official estimate of

GDP growth in the year to Q2 had been in excess of 11%.

11 Price inflation had been rising in many of the major economies. In the United States, in addition

to the rise in core PCE inflation, the corresponding headline measure had risen to 3.5% while CPI

inflation had reached 4.3% in June. Recent upwards revision to labour compensation and the

prospective downwards revision to productivity growth would also imply higher unit labour costs. In

the euro area, CPI inflation remained at 2.5% in June, despite some slowdown in energy price

inflation. In Japan, the CPI inflation rate had reached 1%, its highest for eight years. There was also

growing evidence of upward pressures on major economy import and producer output prices, possibly

reflecting a limited capacity for producers to absorb further oil price increases.

12 Overall, the news on the month had been consistent with continued brisk expansion in UK export

markets, albeit with some downside risks to the outlook for growth in the United States. There was

also some evidence of a small, but generalised, increase in global inflationary pressures.

**Money, credit, demand and output**

13 Domestic activity data had been broadly positive on the month. The Office for National

Statistics’ initial estimate of GDP growth in the second quarter had been 0.8%, consistent with the

May Inflation Report forecast. But within the aggregate growth rate, energy output had been

erratically weak, suggesting that underlying output had grown faster than expected. Taken together

with earlier revisions, GDP growth over the past three quarters looked to have been consistently at, or

slightly above, its long-run average. Given that the level of GDP in 2004 had been revised up by

around 1% in the previous month’s National Accounts data release, and in the light of survey and other

indicators, it was likely that there was less spare capacity in the economy than previously thought; this

had been reflected in the August Inflation Report forecast.

14 Activity indicators for the third quarter had been consistent with broadly unchanged GDP

growth. The CIPS/RBS indices for manufacturing and for services had both eased a little in July but

remained close to recent peaks. And the drag on growth from the energy sector was likely to diminish

in the third quarter.

15 In contrast to the first quarter, expenditure indicators had also been firm: retail sales had

recovered since their post-Christmas dip, growing by 2.1% in the second quarter. This recovery had

occurred despite the squeeze on real incomes arising from higher energy prices and taxes, although it

was possible that energy prices might not yet have had their full impact. In the August forecast the

consumer demand compared with the second quarter would be consistent with some of the more recent

indicators such as the CBI Distributive Trades Survey.

16 The housing market continued to be reasonably firm with the lenders’ house price indices

showing an average rise of 0.5% in July; a preview of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’

survey had shown an increase in current and expected prices. Loan approvals had also increased.

House price-to-earnings ratios remained at historically high levels.

17 There were few new data on investment or trade: business surveys of investment intentions had

picked up in recent quarters and growth in the UK’s main export markets had remained robust.

18 The M4 measures of broad money and lending growth had both risen in June, with broad money

up around 15% on a year earlier. The increase in growth on the month had been mainly accounted for

by annual growth in the Other Financial Companies (ie non-banks) component. Monetary data for this

sector were subject to idiosyncratic or temporary movements. However, if institutions such as pension

funds and insurance companies were building up deposits, that might over time put upward pressure on

asset prices, increasing household wealth and potentially pushing up nominal spending.

**Costs and prices**

19 There had been limited news about the labour market. The employment rate remained broadly

unchanged. The Labour Force Survey (LFS) measure of the unemployment rate had edged up further

to 5.4% in May, its highest level since 2000, in contrast the claimant count measure had remained at

3.0% in June, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. The difference between these two

measures had been growing through 2006. A broader measure of non-employment that weighted

together the unemployed and those people supposedly not seeking or not available for work, according

to the likelihood of them finding work, had increased by rather less than the LFS measure. Growth in

the working population had increased markedly in recent years, partly reflecting increased inward

migration. The participation rate had been increasing gently, but it was possible that this would

reverse if job seekers were discouraged by fewer job opportunities. Overall, the degree of slack in the

labour market remained uncertain.

20 Pay growth had remained subdued, with the mean twelve-month settlement dipping to 3.1% in

June and growth in the whole economy average earnings index picking up slightly to 4.3% in May.

There was little evidence yet of any ‘second-round’ effects of higher energy prices being passed

through into higher wages. On the contrary, as reported by the Bank’s regional Agents, firms appeared

to have reacted to the squeeze on their profit margins by bearing down on wage (and other) costs. It

was also possible that recent downward pressure on wages reflected the more general loosening in

labour market conditions during 2005.

21 Price inflation at the start of the supply chain remained high. The sterling price of oil had risen

by over 7% in July. The annual rate of manufacturing input price inflation had eased a little to 11% in

June while manufacturing output price inflation had picked up to 3.6%. More recent business surveys

gave a somewhat mixed picture, with the manufacturing output price balance in the CIPS/RBS survey

picking up a little in July, but the service sector balance declining slightly. The Agents’ business

contacts had suggested a slightly increased propensity to pass cost increases through.

22 Consumer price inflation had risen to 2.5% in June, with unexpectedly strong rises in the prices

of household goods and food: fresh food prices were possibly beginning to reflect the unusually hot

summer conditions in Europe. Going forward, it was likely that the recent further rises in energy

prices and the impact of increases in university tuition fees at the start of the next academic year would

push CPI inflation further above the target in the next few months, although the impact from tuition

fees on the CPI remained uncertain.

23 Some surveys of the general public’s near-term inflation expectations had declined in recent

months whereas longer-term inflation expectations for the Retail Prices Index, derived from index
linked gilt prices, had edged up again to around 3% at five- and ten-year horizons.

**The August GDP growth and inflation projections**

24 The Committee reached its policy decision in the light of the projections to be published in the

_Inflation Report on Wednesday 9 August._

25 Conditional on assuming market participants’ expected path for interest rates, the Committee’s

central projection was for UK GDP to continue to grow at a rate close to its average over the past

decade. Steady growth in consumer spending, a moderate recovery in investment and a small boost

from net trade offset slower growth in public expenditure. This profile represented a slightly stronger

outlook than that published in the May Inflation Report.

26 The Committee’s central projection for inflation was also a little higher than in May, rising

further above the target in the near term, before easing back towards 2%. As energy price inflation

moderated, and against a background of robust demand growth and limited spare capacity, some

recovery in profit margins and pay growth was projected.

27 As usual, substantial risks had been identified surrounding the central projections. These

included, in particular: the prospects for world growth; the strength and duration of the recovery in

consumer spending; the outlook for energy and import prices and their interaction with domestic

pricing pressures; and the margin of spare resources within firms and in the labour market.

28 Under the alternative assumption of constant interest rates, output growth and inflation were both

projected to be a little higher.

**The immediate policy decision**

29 Committee members first reviewed some of the key issues arising from consideration of the

August forecast and then discussed factors affecting the timing of any change in interest rates.

30 A major uncertainty was the degree of slack in the economy as a whole. On the one hand, the

recent upwards revisions to the GDP data, together with the central projection for output growth,

implied that there would be less slack in the economy than previously thought. On the other hand, the

labour market looked as if it had loosened, with inward migration boosting the working population and

with the demand for labour having eased through 2005, possibly as firms sought to offset the impact of

higher energy prices by reducing labour costs. Most Committee members concluded that, on balance,

the overall degree of slack was less.

31 Earnings growth remained muted, but if demand pressures were building that might well be

reflected first in prices, as firms rebuilt profit margins – wage increases would then be a lagging

indicator of inflation.

32 In previous months the Committee had discussed the risk of a sustained slowing in consumption

growth, following the weak data for the first quarter. That risk seemed to be considerably less in the

light of the robust Q2 indicators.

33 Supporting evidence of potential demand pressures in the medium term came from the rapid

rates of broad money and credit growth. The implications of that for inflation would depend on the

extent to which higher money balances would eventually be used to finance the purchases of either

goods and services or financial and other assets, and some Committee members interpreted the money

numbers as a possible indication of longer-term inflationary pressures.

34 Over the previous four years, CPI inflation had been gradually picking up and had reached 2.5%

in June. During the remainder of 2006, inflation was likely to rise further above the target rate of

2.0%, before falling back through 2007. The Committee noted that the market yield curve implied a

modest rise in interest rates over the next two years, and that under that assumption the central

projection for inflation remained above 2% over the forecast period.

35 The Committee concluded that it was most likely that interest rates needed to rise in order to

bring inflation back to target in the medium term. The question was whether an immediate increase

was justified or whether there was a case for delay.

36 The Committee considered what information it could expect to receive in the near term relating

to the main uncertainties. Most of the risks identified in the August forecast would take some

considerable time to resolve. For example, the uncertainties about the margin of spare capacity in

firms, or pricing dynamics as energy and import price inflation abated, would not become clear until

2007 or beyond. There would be more information on the labour market, but that currently seemed

likely to be a lagging indicator of inflationary pressures, although there were differences of view on

this point. It was unlikely that the medium-term outlook for inflation would become any clearer in the

next few months.

37 There were reasons to suppose that an immediate increase in rates would not significantly

exacerbate the downside risks. Consumption growth had recovered from its post-Christmas dip.

Output growth overall had been robust and, according to surveys, looked set to remain so in the near

term. Most members thought that increasing interest rates to 4.75% would most likely remove a

degree of monetary accommodation, without restraining demand unduly; and that there would be time

to reverse any increase should that prove necessary once the medium-term paths of demand growth

and inflation became clearer.

38 The Committee also considered whether there could be increased upside risks from delaying an

increase in rates. CPI inflation was likely to rise further above the target in the next few months.

There was a risk that the short-term increase might dislodge inflation expectations, making it more

difficult to bring inflation back to target subsequently. One specific factor was that inflation was likely

to be rising in the period just before the majority of next year’s pay settlements. An early increase in

rates would reduce the risk that a sharper rise would be needed later. Although most commentators

were not expecting an increase at this meeting, such an increase would not be hard to explain.

39 Against the background of firm growth, limited spare capacity, rapid growth of broad money and

credit, and with inflation likely to remain above the target for some while, the Committee judged that

an increase in the official Bank rate was necessary to bring CPI inflation back to the target in the

medium term. Most members favoured an immediate increase of 0.25 percentage points to 4.75%.

40 For one member, the uncertainty over demand and price pressures, the mixed evidence on the

tightening of capacity within firms, together with labour market conditions, was sufficient to make a

case for not changing interest rates this month. In particular, the rise in the LFS measure of

unemployment and subdued wage pressures could be consistent with a loosening of labour market

conditions that would imply a greater degree of slack in the economy overall than inherent in the

central projection of the forecast. Although finely balanced, the risk of greater slack in the labour

market was sufficient to offset such inflationary pressures as observed elsewhere in the economy.

41 The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that the official Bank rate should

be increased by 25 basis points to 4.75%. Six members of the Committee (the Governor, Rachel

Lomax, John Gieve, Kate Barker, Charles Bean and Paul Tucker) voted in favour of the proposition.

One member (David Blanchflower) voted against, preferring to maintain the Bank rate at 4.5%.

42 The following members of the Committee were present:

Mervyn King, Governor
Rachel Lomax, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy
John Gieve, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability
Kate Barker
Charles Bean
