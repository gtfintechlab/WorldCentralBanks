#### MINUTES OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 5-6 JULY 2006

1 At the start of the meeting, the Committee stood in silence in remembrance of David Walton,

who died on 21 June.

2 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed developments in

financial markets; the international economy; money, credit, demand and output; and supply, costs

and prices.

**Financial markets**

3 Financial markets had been relatively uneventful this month, with asset prices stabilising after

the falls recorded the previous month. Equity price indices had risen a little over the month in many

developed economies, but were still below the levels at the time of the May Inflation Report.

Emerging market indices were rather weaker. There had been some further widening of bond spreads

this month, although they remained relatively narrow compared with recent years. As previously

discussed by the Committee, one interpretation of recent developments was that there had been a re
pricing of the risk incorporated in some asset prices.

4 Short-term market interest rates had risen a little over the past month in the United States, and to

a lesser degree in the euro area and the United Kingdom. The UK short-term yield curve was now

markedly higher than at the start of the year, when markets had been pricing in a reduction in the

official Bank rate in 2006.

5 Further along the yield curve, long-term forward interest rates had crept up in the United

Kingdom, United States and euro area. Both nominal and real forward interest rates were substantially

higher than at the start of the year.

6 The dollar had appreciated somewhat over the month, following the earlier depreciation since

May. Associated with this, sterling had fallen against the dollar, and with little change against the

euro, the sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) had fallen a little over the month. The ERI was

nevertheless 1¼% higher than in the May Inflation Report.

7 Measures of implied volatility of most major equity prices and of many exchange rate pairs had

fallen over the past month. That fall was rather less apparent in measures of implied volatility for

short-term interest rates – especially for the United States.

**The international economy**

8 Developments in the world economy appeared to be broadly consistent with a continued

rebalancing of demand growth away from the United States and towards the rest of the world.

9 In the euro area, the manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had increased for the

fifth consecutive month in June, leaving the index at its highest level since August 2000, and the

European Commission industrial confidence measure had risen in Q2 to its highest level since late

2000. The German IFO index had continued to be unusually strong, although the answers to some of

the questions on which the index was based, as well as the ZEW survey of financial analysts,

suggested that there was somewhat less optimism about the near future than was apparent from the

headline IFO index. The euro-area services PMI had increased further in June. Overall, the survey
based evidence suggested GDP growth was likely to have been strong in Q2, and higher than the

Committee had expected at the time of the May Inflation Report. It suggested that some of the near
term upside risks to euro-area activity might be crystallising.

10 Consumption growth had bounced back in the euro area in Q1 and consumer confidence had

crept up. However, retail sales had fallen back in May, following the sharp increase in April, so it was

difficult to discern a clear trend in the data. Labour market conditions had continued to improve

slowly, with the euro-area unemployment rate falling below 8% for the first time since 2001. The

harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) had increased by 2.5% in the year to May, up on the

corresponding figure for April.

11 Growth in the United States had been revised up in the first quarter. The latest indicators had

continued to point to annualised growth of around 3% in Q2. As far as households were concerned,

consumption growth had eased over the course of the year. Real personal disposable income growth

had been broadly flat in April and May, while growth of nominal wages and salaries had also flattened.

Other influences on consumption had pointed to a slowing: there had been a sharp oil-induced

deterioration in the terms of trade, a fall in equity prices, and an easing in house price inflation. Real

personal disposable income growth might pick up again, particularly if energy prices did not rise

further, but more subdued household spending growth seemed in prospect. Nonetheless, business

investment had continued to look robust.

12 Headline US CPI inflation had risen in May, accompanied by a tick up in inflation excluding

food and energy prices. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure – the core private

consumption expenditure deflator – had been unchanged in May.

13 Japanese GDP growth had been revised up substantially to 0.8% in Q1 on the back of large

upward revisions to business investment and government spending. The Tankan survey had

strengthened, and was consistent with continued robust growth in Q2. Elsewhere in Asia, Chinese

activity indicators had also strengthened.

14 Oil prices had risen slightly over the past month, mostly in the days leading up to the meeting.

Other commodity prices had fallen over the past month.

15 Measures of world export price inflation had generally picked up over the past year or so. The

outlook for global export prices, and hence the prospects for UK import prices, was an important issue

that the Committee would wish to examine further in the quarterly Inflation Report round.

**Money, credit, demand and output**

16 The revisions contained in the latest Quarterly National Accounts – consistent with the annual

2006 Blue Book – had been fairly modest compared with those seen in some past years. With

incorporation of the 2004 Annual Business Inquiry and the first balancing of the 2004 data, perhaps

the greatest interest related to the revisions for that year. Growth in 2004 and some earlier years had


-----

been revised up. The picture for 2004 was broadly consistent with survey-based estimates of output

growth, coupled with the historical pattern of past revisions at this stage in the data cycle.

17 The picture for 2005 had been broadly unchanged by the recent release (with a slightly faster

pickup in output growth from the 2005 Q1 trough, little change in consumption and only modest

upward revisions to investment); although the National Accounts data for 2005 would not be fully

balanced until next year’s Blue Book. The latest vintage of data indicated that the alignment

adjustments in Q4 and Q1 were large and of opposite signs, reflecting the difficulty of reconciling the

output and expenditure measures of GDP growth in these two quarters.

18 The quarterly GDP growth rates for both 2005 Q4 and 2006 Q1 had been revised up, as

expected, to 0.7%, although the first three quarters of 2005 remained weak. The latest indicators

continued to point to a further acceleration of activity in Q2, with the CIPS/RBS surveys suggesting

strong growth in both manufacturing and services.

19 The new data for business investment had not changed the picture of relatively subdued growth

in the wake of the 2003-2004 cyclical pickup in output growth. Reflecting the absence of significant

revisions to those data, there now seemed a greater likelihood that the weakness of investment growth

in recent years was real, despite the slightly firmer survey indicators of investment intentions over that

period, the healthy financial position of the corporate sector, the fall in the relative price of capital

goods, and the relatively low cost of capital. The Committee had previously discussed various

possible explanations for this. Off-shoring of investment might be one way of reconciling the surveys

of investment intentions with the data. The Bank’s regional Agents had undertaken a special survey of

the effects of pension deficits, which suggested that this particular factor was likely to have had only a

small effect on investment. Overall, the upwardly revised investment-to-GDP ratio had raised the

estimated capital stock, making the recent levels of spending look less weak.

20 The slowdown in annual consumption growth through 2004 and 2005 appeared to have been

sharper and was longer lived than previously thought, with the first three quarters of 2005 all now

looking rather weak. There had been downward revisions to real post tax labour income, consistent

with the new path for consumer spending, and the weaker-than-expected pickup in labour income in

2006 Q1 might suggest a downside risk to future household spending. There was estimated to have

been a slightly larger fall in the terms of trade in 2005 than previously thought; that too might weigh


-----

on consumption prospects. However, the Q1 data for consumer spending growth had been revised up

slightly. The latest indications from the retail sales data and the CBI Distributive Trades Survey

pointed to stronger growth in Q2.

21 The latest housing indicators had been mixed. The Nationwide house price index had risen by

0.3% in June, while the Halifax index had fallen 1.2%. An average of the two lenders’ indices for Q2

was a little weaker than expected at the time of the May Inflation Report. However, loan approvals as

well as indicators of the number of site visitors, the sales-to-stock ratio and the current and forward
looking price balances in the preview of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ survey had all

risen. Although estimates of household sector income gearing had fallen in recent quarters, the

prospective trend still seemed to be upward, but that was to be expected given the increase in the stock

of secured borrowing. It remained difficult to assess the equilibrium house price-to-earnings ratio, and

to draw meaningful international comparisons given the differences in housing markets across

countries.

22 There had been less news in the National Accounts concerning recent movements in public

sector demand or net trade. The recent pickup in exports to the euro area had seemed consistent with

the reports from the Bank’s regional Agents and the apparent strengthening of demand in the euro

area.

23 The annual rate of nominal GDP growth had increased in Q1, and was now close to 5%, after

having slowed in 2005. This was close to its average growth rate over the previous decade. Broad

money growth had eased in May: it remained strong, but was now slower than at any time since

September 2005. Nevertheless, money growth continued to pose an upside risk to the medium-term

outlook for inflation.

**Supply, costs and prices**

24 The Labour Force Survey (LFS) of employment growth in the three months to April had

remained a little stronger than had been expected at the time of the May Inflation Report, and the

annual growth rate was close to the average since 1997. A significant share of this employment

growth was accounted for by self-employment. The LFS unemployment rate had also been a little

higher than expected, at 5.3% in the three months to April, despite the rise in the employment rate


-----

since last autumn. Surveys of labour availability presented a mixed picture. The Bank’s regional

Agents had reported a strengthening of employment intentions among their contacts, but that

recruitment difficulties remained muted.

25 Earnings growth, as measured by the Average Earnings Index (AEI), had been slightly weaker

than expected at the time of the May Inflation Report. Some of that may have been accounted for by

bonuses and elements of regular pay drift, but settlements had also continued to be weaker than at the

same time last year, and a little below expectations. There were a variety of other earnings measures,

some of which were less timely and of lower frequency than the AEI, which also pointed to a softening

in average earnings growth in recent years. The Bank’s regional Agents had reported no evidence of

widespread pay pressures, but their special survey had indicated that the need to finance defined

benefit pensions might be bearing down on other labour costs. There was a broader question about the

extent to which earnings growth was being determined by narrow labour market conditions, or by

other wider cost pressures. RPI inflation had fallen through much of 2005, but had risen broadly in

line with CPI inflation in recent months, and remained the single most cited inflation index used in pay

bargaining.

26 There had been a pickup in the annual growth rate of unit labour costs in Q1. This, in part, had

been broadly boosted by an upward revision to non-wage employment costs in 2005 Q4 and strong

growth in Q1. To the extent that this reflected a series of special payments to deal with past ‘legacy’

pension deficits, it did not necessarily reflect the cost of employing new labour.

27 The participation rate was now at its highest level since 1991. This reflected the increased

participation of older workers and various cohort effects (as, for example, younger generations with

higher participation rates replaced older generations with lower rates).

28 Substantial pressures on firms’ costs from the increases in energy prices had continued. Input

price inflation had fallen back in May, but remained at high levels. Output price inflation had ticked

up in May. Survey measures of pricing pressures in both manufacturing and services had generally

been firmer this month. Non-oil import prices were rising at the fastest rate for some years.

29 CPI inflation had risen to 2.2% in May. Within this, goods price inflation had risen by 0.9 of a

percentage point to 1.3%. That reflected the impact of higher prices of both energy and other imported

goods. The general public’s inflation expectations had appeared to ease.

30 The relative stability of aggregate CPI inflation over recent years was notable, following

significant movements in import and energy prices. It was possible to construct a variety of different

measures of domestically generated inflation that attempted to strip out the effects of import prices and

energy prices, using various assumptions about the speed of pass-through of these prices along the

supply-chain. These measures had generally been volatile in recent years, compared with the broader

stability of aggregate CPI inflation. This pointed to an inverse relationship between energy and import

prices on the one hand and domestically generated inflation on the other. That, in turn, suggested that

it was not appropriate to aggregate independently derived projections of import, energy and

domestically generated inflation components of CPI in a mechanical way without considering the

interrelationships between them.

**The immediate policy decision**

31 Following the sharp movements in financial markets prior to the Committee’s June meeting, the

financial markets had been more stable over the past month. Equity prices were lower and sterling was

higher than at the time of the May Inflation Report, and if sustained, would tend to reduce inflationary

pressures. But the falls in equity markets had to be put in the context of the substantial price increases

observed over the previous twelve months. If firms and households had assumed that some of the

asset price increases over the past year were unlikely to be sustained, then they might not change their

spending significantly in response to the recent price corrections, and the implications for inflation

might therefore prove modest. Despite the stability over the recent month, it was too early to know

whether the recent falls in prices would prove to be a limited correction or whether there would be a

more marked and sustained change.

32 Developments in the world economy appeared to have been consistent with some signs of

rebalancing in the composition of world demand, with a pickup in the pace of growth in the euro area

and Asia and a possible slowdown in the United States.

33 In the United Kingdom, the Quarterly National Accounts had not led to particularly large

revisions by past standards, although the level of GDP was somewhat higher than previously

estimated. But there was still considerable uncertainty about the National Accounts estimates for

2005, which had yet to be balanced. It was difficult to reach firm conclusions about the implications

of the revisions for the overall balance of demand and supply until the data had been fully analysed in

the context of the Inflation Report round.

34 On the expenditure side, the slowdown in consumption in 2005 now looked more pronounced.

Business investment had been revised up a little, but by much less than expected and remained

relatively subdued in the recent past. There was little significant news for net trade.

35 GDP growth had been revised up slightly over the past six months, broadly as expected on the

basis of the survey and anecdotal evidence. And the latest indicators still pointed to stronger GDP

growth in the second quarter. So the overall picture for the near-term prospects for output did not look

materially different from that expected at the time of the May Report. The latest consumption

indicators appeared to be consistent with stronger growth in Q2, following the weakness in Q1. The

latest survey indicators, and demand developments in the euro area, still suggested an upbeat outlook

for exports. But it remained difficult to reconcile fully the movements in the output and expenditure

measures of GDP over the past few quarters.

36 Producer input price inflation and import price inflation were high by recent historical standards,

and the surveys of manufacturing and services prices were still firm. Earnings growth remained

subdued, perhaps as firms squeezed labour costs in the face of rising input and import prices. The

expansion of the labour force with continued inflows of migrant workers and rising participation rates

may have also acted to subdue wage growth. The immediate prospects for real labour income were

bolstered by slightly stronger employment growth than had been expected. CPI inflation had risen

recently, but broadly as expected at the time of the Inflation Report. The general public’s inflation

expectations appeared to have edged down following the rise earlier in the year, increasing the

probability that the rise would prove temporary.

37 The upside risks to the outlook for inflation were broadly the same as those identified by the

Committee the previous month. Growth in the euro area and Asia might well turn out stronger than

had been assumed in the May Inflation Report, and associated with this was the risk that global


-----

9

inflationary pressures might turn out to be stronger than expected. Although broad money growth had

recently eased, its past and continuing strength, together with the sharp increases in property and

financial asset prices over the past year, was still a risk to inflation in the medium term. The apparent

inverse relationship between energy and import prices on the one hand and estimates of domestically

generated inflation on the other – with aggregate inflation broadly stable – was striking. This seemed

to reduce the probability that inflation might for a while settle below the target as energy effects on

CPI inflation dissipated.

38 There were also a number of downside risks to the outlook for inflation. There was a risk that

asset prices might fall further in coming months. The slowdown in the United States might prove

more pronounced than had been assumed in May, and could adversely affect growth in other UK

markets, especially the euro area. In the United Kingdom, although Q1 growth had been revised up

slightly, and Q2 output indicators remained robust, there remained a risk that the erosion of spare

capacity in the economy would be slower than envisaged in the May Inflation Report. The

combination of higher participation and weaker earnings in the latest data was perhaps suggestive of a

positive supply shock.

39 Different committee members attached different weights to those arguments. But given that

recent developments had seemed broadly in line with the May Inflation Report, and that there were

significant risks in both directions, members felt that the interest rate should remain unchanged this

month.

40 The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that the official Bank rate should

be maintained at 4.5%. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the proposition.

41 The following members of the Committee were present:

Mervyn King, Governor
Rachel Lomax, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy
John Gieve, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability
Kate Barker
Charles Bean
David Blanchflower
Paul Tucker

Jon Cunliffe was present as the Treasury representative.
