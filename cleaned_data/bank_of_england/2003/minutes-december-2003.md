## MINUTES OF
# MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING

## 3 and 4 December 2003

##### These are the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting held on 3 and 4 December 2003.

 They are also available on the Internet

(http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/mpc/mpc0312.pdf).

##### The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The Committee meets on a regular monthly basis and minutes of its meetings are released on the Wednesday of the second week after the meeting takes place. Accordingly, the minutes of the Committee meeting held on 7 and 8 January will be published on 21 January 2003.

#### MINUTES OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 3-4 DECEMBER 2003

1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed financial markets; the

world economy; money, credit, demand and output; the labour market, costs and prices; and some

other considerations.

**Financial markets**

2 The most significant of the month’s developments in financial markets was the further marked

fall in the US dollar exchange rate, which had depreciated by more than 5% against the euro – taking

the euro/dollar exchange rate to its highest since the launch of the euro in January 1999. Though this

depreciation was consistent with the changes in medium-term interest rate differentials, it was possible

that it also reflected mounting concerns about the sustainability of the US current account deficit.

3 That deficit had earlier been associated with private sector borrowing, financed by private sector

inflows, but it was now largely the counterpart of a public sector deficit, financed by inflows from

overseas public sector entities – particularly Asian central banks. It was unclear how long this pattern

of financing could continue. So there could be further sharp movements in the dollar exchange rate,

even without the stimulus of an adverse economic event. So far, sterling had been largely unaffected

(in effective rate terms) by the revaluation of the euro relative to the dollar, and remained broadly in

line with the assumption underlying the November Inflation Report projections.

4 Short-term interest rates had moved little over the month, in either the United Kingdom or the

euro area. The market expectation was that there would be no change in UK official rates this month,

and official rates were expected to remain at current levels for a while in other countries too. The

Federal Open Market Committee was not expected by market participants to start increasing the Fed

funds rate until May. Longer-term rates had moved up a little in both the United Kingdom and the

euro area, but had fallen in the United States, for which there did not seem to be any wholly

convincing explanation in terms of macroeconomic news. Equities were a little stronger in most

markets, and corporate spreads had generally eased.

5 Market expectations of inflation prospects in the United Kingdom had been moving steadily

upwards over the past six months or so, and the Committee considered what might account for this.

One possibility was that it might reflect market speculation about a change in the inflation target. If

the market expected this target to be 2%, on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices measure of

inflation, and also took the view that the long-run difference between this measure and RPIX inflation

was around three-quarters of a percentage point, that could account for about half the apparent increase

in inflation expectations. The remainder might perhaps reflect increased uncertainty about whether the

inflation target would be met. An alternative explanation was simply that expectations were based on

past outcomes: RPIX inflation had been somewhat below the 2½% target for several years, but had

now been above target for a year. In any case, inflation expectations had been below the target for

RPIX for a while and the recent increase had returned them to around the target rate.

**The world economy**

6 The news on the world economy in the past month had generally been positive, and in some

respects stronger than expected. Data for the third quarter showed that growth in the United States had

been revised up, and that the euro area had been growing for the first time for a year. In addition,

survey information, including that from a special survey of euro-area demand carried out by the

Bank’s regional Agents through their business contacts, was generally positive.

7 Within the euro-area data, however, there were some less positive features. Final domestic

demand growth would probably need to be a key feature of a sustainable euro-area recovery,

particularly if the US dollar were to continue to weaken against the euro. But it had made no overall

contribution to growth in the third quarter: the main positive contribution had come from net trade. It

was also noteworthy that the past level of consumption and output in Germany had been revised down.

8 In the United States, GDP was now estimated to have grown by 2.0% in the third quarter – the

fastest quarterly growth since 1984 – and business surveys pointed to a strong fourth quarter. The

main issue remained the durability of this recovery. On that, too, the news was encouraging. Much of

the upward revision to third-quarter growth was attributable to investment growth; and corporate

profitability and confidence seemed to be recovering, so the investment recovery was likely to be

sustained. The outlook for consumption was also positive: consumer confidence had improved


-----

somewhat, on both the main measures; there was greater optimism about labour market conditions;

and non-farm payrolls had increased by nearly 300,000 in three months. Nevertheless, uncertainties

remained. The improvement in the labour market was modest, and unemployment had not yet fallen

substantially. Past recoveries had been associated with a sharp pickup in durables spending, but that

had weakened in recent months. The financial incentives offered to purchasers by auto manufacturers

were becoming less generous. It was also possible that next year’s tax cuts had already been

anticipated by consumers and so would generate less additional stimulus when they actually took

effect. Mortgage refinancing, which had sustained consumption growth earlier in the year, was now

much lower, and (partly as a result) the M2 measure of the money stock had contracted in the past two

months. That too might indicate that the recovery was faltering. Equally, though, the contraction

might be related to changes in the relative attractiveness of non-monetary assets, and associated

portfolio shifts.

9 Japanese GDP estimates, based on expenditure data, showed the seventh successive quarter of

growth, with the third-quarter estimate somewhat stronger than had been expected by the Committee at

the time of the November Inflation Report. Investment was estimated to be growing strongly, and net

trade had also made a positive contribution to overall growth: exports to other Asian countries

continued to grow strongly. But there were doubts about the price deflators used in these estimates,

particularly for business investment. The all-activity index of output growth continued to suggest a

markedly weaker recovery than that shown by the GDP estimates.

10 Third-quarter growth in non-Japan Asia had rebounded from the weak second-quarter outturn,

reinforcing the view that that weakness had reflected the temporary effects of SARS-related disruption.

It was encouraging that, in the area as a whole, domestic demand was making a strong contribution to

growth.

**Money, credit, demand and output**

11 The month’s news on the UK economy was also mostly positive. GDP was now estimated to

have grown by 0.7% in the third quarter, 0.1 percentage points faster than the preliminary estimate,

with both services and construction growing more strongly than expected – and more than offsetting

somewhat weaker production output data.

12 The pattern of expenditure was, however, rather different from that envisaged in the November

_Inflation Report, with investment falling rather than rising, a strong positive contribution to growth_

from stockbuilding and the net trade position weaker than expected. As a result, the economy seemed

a little less well-balanced. The news on consumption growth tended to reinforce the view that it was

not slowing as rapidly as expected. The fall in investment, however, was unexpected. It was possible

that the investment data – one of the less reliably measured components of GDP – would be revised.

13 The outlook for the fourth quarter was one of continued strength, with growth if anything likely

to be a little stronger than in the third quarter and so at an above-trend rate. Surveys remained

generally, but not uniformly, strong, with the CIPS services business activity index at its highest level

since 1997 and the manufacturing PMI at its highest since the end of 1999; and construction was also

up strongly. By contrast, aggregate M4 was now growing at only 6½% on twelve months ago –

compared with over 8% during the second quarter. That might suggest some slowing in the overall

pace of nominal GDP growth in the coming quarters.

14 Retail sales were showing some signs of slower growth, and the Bank’s regional Agents reported

that some retailers were disappointed with their sales in November. The GfK measure of consumer

confidence had fallen a little, largely because consumers were less confident that it was a good time to

make a major purchase. But that was perhaps to be expected, given the increase in interest rates and

the extensive press commentary on the dangers of excessive household borrowing. The latest CBI

Distributive Trades survey showed less buoyancy in retail sales in November, and falls in optimism in

all three distribution sectors. The growth of unsecured lending, while still rapid, had also eased –

continuing a pattern that had now been evident for some months. This might be a better indicator of

the immediate outlook for consumer spending than the growth in secured borrowing, as that was

driven largely by house prices and housing market turnover. But the easing in unsecured borrowing

growth could simply reflect substitution of secured for unsecured borrowing, a shift which was both

cost-effective and was being encouraged by lenders. It was also noted that credit card borrowing

growth remained strong.

15 The monthly rates of house price inflation shown by the two main lenders’ indices were a little

lower. Nonetheless, prices continued to surprise on the upside. The preview of the survey by the

Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) pointed to some moderation in expectations of price

increases in the coming months. There had also been fewer new buyer enquiries. In addition, there


-----

5

had been substantial downward revisions to mortgage approvals data, which now showed a much less

marked increase over the past few months. It would be a little while before the effects of last month’s

increase in the repo rate would become evident in the data. All this was consistent with the

Committee’s previous judgment that both activity and house price inflation would moderate in the

coming months.

**The labour market, costs and prices**

16 Surveys continued to point to a modest tightening in the labour market. Agency staff were in

increasing demand, and their availability was falling; private sector employment was reported to be

increasing; and the public sector was continuing to recruit. There was some evidence to suggest that

underlying earnings growth was picking up, with annual earnings growth in the third quarter 0.3

percentage points higher than in the second, once the effects of bonuses were excluded. This was

partly accounted for by rapid public sector earnings growth, which was temporarily inflated by the

lagged effects of the delayed agreement and implementation of last year’s Local Authorities pay

settlement. But private sector earnings growth was also picking up, as were pay settlements. It was

likely that bonus payments would be higher in the coming months than they had been a year ago,

particularly in the financial sector. Employers in some areas were becoming more concerned about

possible difficulties in reaching agreement in pay negotiations in the coming pay round, though

members noted that such concerns were by no means country-wide and did not necessarily imply that

settlements would be higher. The surprise this year had been that there had not so far been more

upward pressure on wages, given the increase in National Insurance contribution rates and the higher

levels of retail price inflation. The increase in earnings growth over the past few months was

consistent with the modest tightening suggested by the surveys, rather than with overheating.

17 RPIX inflation had eased to 2.7% in October, as expected. But the contribution from housing

depreciation, which was based on the ODPM index of house prices rather than the lenders’ indices,

had been a little smaller than expected and implied a somewhat lower profile for RPIX inflation over

the next few months than thought likely a month ago. HICP inflation was also likely to be a little

lower than previously expected. Nevertheless, there was little in these data that seemed likely to be

material to inflation prospects further out.

18 Within the aggregate outturns, annual goods price inflation had increased by some 2 percentage

points over the past year, and services price inflation – at least, of those services produced

domestically and in competitive rather than regulated markets – remained high. This pickup in goods

price inflation was a feature of price developments in other countries too, earlier in the year, and might

have been related to the increased cost of fuels and to the effects of the war in Iraq. But it had not

subsequently eased in the United Kingdom, perhaps suggesting growing demand pressures here.

**Other considerations**

19 The Committee had been briefed, immediately before their meeting, by Treasury officials on the

macroeconomic and fiscal projections to be published in the Chancellor’s Pre-Budget Report on

10 December. They noted that the net borrowing requirement was now projected to be higher than in

the Budget projections in each of the next five years, and by £10 billion in the current fiscal year. The

Treasury still expected to meet both of its fiscal rules, though with a smaller margin for error. The

implications for monetary policy of the information in the Pre-Budget Report would be assessed more

fully in the coming months.

**The immediate policy decision**

20 The month’s news on the world economy, most of which related to the third quarter, matched or

exceeded the expectations reflected in the November Inflation Report. The US economy was growing

particularly strongly, and the euro area too now showed signs of recovery although overall domestic

demand there remained flat. The Asian economies had rebounded from the weakness associated with

SARS-related disruption, and growth there seemed in significant part to be generated within the

region. It now seemed plausible that the euro-area recovery would materialise earlier than previously

thought. But it was by no means certain that it would be more rapid. The continuing weakness of

domestic demand in the euro area, together with the risks to the recovery from the possibility of further

falls in the US dollar exchange rate, suggested that it was too early to judge its underlying strength.

21 In the United Kingdom too, the news on the month had been positive, but the medium-term

outlook remained broadly as envisaged in the November Inflation Report projections. The upside

news in the upward revision to third-quarter growth had been accompanied by a rather less balanced

composition of demand, with consumption growth remaining strong and business investment


-----

apparently falling back. House price inflation continued to exceed expectations, though data revisions

and new information suggested rather less buoyancy in housing market activity than previously

thought. The labour market was tightening modestly, but with no evidence yet that earnings were

growing any more strongly than had been expected. So the medium-term outlook for RPIX inflation

remained consistent with the projection on which last month’s interest rate decision had been based.

22 Against this background, most members agreed that it was not necessary to change the repo rate

this month. First, the news on the month suggested that the downside risks to the outlook were

somewhat less than had been thought last month, but it did not have material implications for the

central projections. For one member, whose assessment of the medium-term outlook for inflation was

somewhat more subdued, the news was not sufficient to discriminate between the alternative views of

the balance between potential supply and demand in the economy, and the pace at which underlying

inflation was likely to pick up. Second, the full implications of the recent revisions to past National

Accounts data were still to be unravelled; and those of the Chancellor’s Pre-Budget Report were still

to be assessed. Third, a significant factor in the previous month’s decision had been the high level of

household debt and the consequent uncertainties about the impact of monetary policy. Though the

immediate effects of last month’s increase in the repo rate had not been unusually large, it was too

early to judge whether its eventual effects on the economy – and particularly on households – would

match or exceed previous experience; and some of the upside risks in the housing market now

appeared to be moderating. Overall, policy needed to remain forward-looking, and to be based – as

always – on a fresh assessment each month of the accumulated data, against the projections for output

and inflation. If the economy continued to evolve in line with the Committee’s central projections, a

further increase in the repo rate would be warranted at some point. But the news was not yet sufficient

to justify another increase.

23 One member, however, while accepting the thrust of these arguments, put particular weight on

the vulnerabilities created by the continued build-up of household debt and felt that an increase in the

repo rate this month was justified. While acknowledging that it was too soon to judge the extent of the

impact of last month’s increase in the repo rate, it could be some time before conclusive evidence on

that issue was available to the Committee and next month’s decision could in practice be complicated

by the probable change in the Committee’s target. The news on the month might be small, but it was

almost uniformly in an upside direction – both domestically and especially overseas. Inflation

expectations had also edged upwards in recent months. Delay in moving the repo rate higher risked


-----

allowing interest rates to fall increasingly below their warranted path. Action, by contrast, would be

purposeful and at the same time consistent with caution. It would be more likely to ensure a

dampening effect on consumption growth and on the further accumulation of debt, and so would help

to reduce the future vulnerability of the household sector to adverse economic shocks.

24 The Governor invited members of the Committee to vote on the proposition that the repo rate

should be maintained at 3.75%. Eight members (the Governor, Rachel Lomax, Kate Barker, Charles

Bean, Marian Bell, Richard Lambert, Stephen Nickell and Paul Tucker) voted in favour. One member

(Andrew Large) voted against, preferring to increase the repo rate by 25 basis points.

25 The following members of the Committee were present:

Rachel Lomax, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy
Andrew Large, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability
Kate Barker
Charles Bean

#### ANNEX: SUMMARY OF DATA PRESENTED BY BANK STAFF

A1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee

on 28 November 2003, in advance of its meeting on 3-4 December. At the start of the Committee

meeting itself, members were made aware of the information that had subsequently become available,

and that information is included in this Annex.

**I** **The international environment**

A2 According to the preliminary estimate, US GDP had risen by 2.0% on the quarter in 2003 Q3,

higher than the 1.7% growth previously suggested in the advance estimate. Within this total,

consumption growth had been unchanged from the advance estimate, at 1.6%; private investment

growth had been revised up, from 3.3% to 3.9%; and the growth of government spending had been

unchanged at 0.3%. The net trade contribution to GDP growth had also been unchanged, at

0.2 percentage points. The contribution from stocks had been revised up to zero, from –0.2 percentage

points in the advance estimate. Non-farm business sector labour productivity had risen by 2.2% on the

quarter in 2003 Q3, following a rise of 1.7% in 2003 Q2.

A3 US industrial production had risen by 0.2% on a month earlier in October, following an increase

of 0.5% in September; new orders for non-defence capital goods had risen by 2.8%. The Institute for

Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing index had risen to 62.8 in November, from 57.0 in October.

The ISM non-manufacturing index had fallen to 60.1 in November, from 64.7 in October.

a month earlier in October, following a fall of 1.2% in September. Nominal retail sales had fallen by

0.3% in October, following a downwardly revised fall of 0.4% in September. Excluding sales of

automobiles, retail sales had risen by 0.2% in October, following an increase of 0.2% in September.

The Conference Board measure of consumer confidence had increased to 91.7 in November, from

81.7 in October, and the University of Michigan headline index had risen to 93.7, from 89.6.

A5 Annual headline consumer price inflation in the United States had been 2.0% in October,

compared with 2.3% in September. Annual core consumer price inflation (which excludes food and

energy prices) had been 1.3% in October, having been 1.2% in the year to September. US producer

prices had risen by 3.4% in the year to October, following an increase of 3.5% in the year to

September.

A6 According to the first release, euro-area GDP had increased by 0.4% on the quarter in 2003 Q3,

unchanged from the flash estimate, after falling by 0.1% in 2003 Q2. Final domestic demand had

made no contribution to quarterly GDP growth in 2003 Q3. Private consumption had been unchanged

on the quarter, after an increase of 0.1% in 2003 Q2. Investment had fallen by 0.5%, after a similar

fall in the previous quarter. Government consumption had increased by 0.5%, compared with 0.4% in

2003 Q2. Net trade had contributed 1.0 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth in 2003 Q3, and

inventories had subtracted 0.6 percentage points.

A7 German GDP had increased by 0.2% on the quarter in 2003 Q3, following a fall of 0.2% in 2003

Q2. Within total German GDP, private consumption had fallen by 0.6% in Q3 compared with a fall of

0.5% in 2003 Q2. Total investment had fallen by 0.8%, after falling by 0.7% in Q2. Government

consumption had grown by 0.4%, after rising by 0.5% in 2003 Q2. Inventories had subtracted

1.1 percentage points from GDP growth in Q3, while net trade had added 1.8 percentage points.

French GDP had increased by 0.4% on the quarter in 2003 Q3, following a fall of 0.3% in 2003 Q2.

Private consumption had increased on the quarter by 0.4%, total investment by 0.3% and government

Spanish GDP had increased by 0.7%; Dutch GDP had increased by 0.1%; and Belgian GDP had

increased by 0.5% on the quarter in 2003 Q3.

A8 Industrial production in the euro area had fallen by 0.6% on the month in September, following a

monthly decline of 0.7% in August. The Purchasing Managers' Index for the manufacturing sector had

risen to 52.2 in November, from 51.3 in October; and the Index for the services sector had risen to

57.5, from 56.0. According to the European Commission survey, the euro-area business confidence

indicator had increased to –7 in November, from –8 in October. The euro-area consumer confidence

indicator had also increased, to –16, in November, from –17 in October. The West German IFO index

had increased to 95.7 in November, from 94.3 in October.

A9 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted an informal survey of 155 firms that either exported

to, or had operations in, the euro area, regarding their sales there. Most of these firms had reported

that sales volumes had increased during the second half of 2003, compared with the first half of the

year. A majority had also expected sales to increase during the first half of 2004 compared with the

second half of 2003. An improvement in euro-area demand had been identified by the firms as the

main reason for these results.

A10 Annual inflation in the euro area, as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices

(HICP), had fallen to 2.0% in October, from 2.2% in September. Annual core inflation (excluding

energy, food, alcohol and tobacco) had fallen to 1.7% in October, from 1.8% in September. According

to the Eurostat flash estimate, euro-area annual HICP inflation had risen to 2.2% again in November.

A11 According to the preliminary estimate, Japanese real GDP had risen by 0.6% in 2003 Q3,

compared with a 0.9% increase in the previous quarter. Within the total, private consumption had

been unchanged, business investment had increased by 2.8% and total government expenditure had

fallen by 1.0%. Net trade had contributed 0.2 percentage points to quarterly growth and inventories

had made no contribution. The Japanese tertiary activity index had fallen by 0.2% in 2003 Q3

compared with the previous quarter, while the all-activity index had been unchanged.

A12 Industrial production in Japan had risen by 0.8% on a month earlier in October, following a 3.8%

increase in September. The workers’ household survey had reported an annual decline of 1.1% in real

spending in October, compared with an annual fall of 1.9% in September. Annual growth in export

volumes had been 7.5% in October, after an increase of 4.5% in September. Annual growth in import

volumes had slowed to 8.9% in October, from 10.9% in September.

A13 Since the Committee’s previous meeting, the spot price of Brent crude oil had increased by

$0.71 per barrel to $29.27, and The Economist dollar non-oil commodity price index had risen by

0.2%.

**II** **Financial markets**

A14 Between 5 November and 3 December, short-dated sterling interest rates had fallen. Economists

polled by Reuters between 25 and 27 November had attached a mean probability of 73% to there being


-----

4

no change in the repo rate at the December MPC meeting. Their mean expectation for rates at the end

of 2004 had been 4.45%, slightly up on a month previously. The Bank of England/NOP Inflation

Attitudes Survey conducted between 13 and 18 November had shown that 71% of the members of the

public interviewed had expected interest rates to increase over the coming year, up from 36% in

August. In the euro area and the United States, where economic data releases were generally stronger

than the market had expected, short-term market interest rates had risen. At longer maturities, ten-year

nominal forward rates had risen by around 15 basis points in the United Kingdom and by around

5 basis points in the euro area. In the United States, by contrast, they had fallen by around 15 basis

points. These falls had been difficult to explain, given the stronger-than-expected US economic data.

Some market participants had attributed them to a change in market positioning by dealers and

speculators.

A15 International ten-year break-even inflation rates in the United States and the euro area had been

broadly unchanged on the month. In the United Kingdom, forward RPI inflation expectations, as

implied by index-linked and nominal gilt yields, had risen since the previous MPC meeting at

maturities between 5 and 15 years but had fallen slightly at longer maturities. There had also been a

slight fall in implied RPI inflation expectations two and a half years ahead, although survey-based

measures of inflation expectations had risen. The Bank’s quarterly survey of members of the public

had shown that expectations for year-ahead inflation had risen by 0.4 percentage points, to 2.6%; and

the quarterly HMT medium-term survey of economic forecasters had indicated that expected RPIX

inflation for 2004 had risen by 0.3 percentage points, to 2.6%.

A16 Between 5 November and 3 December, the sterling effective exchange rate had depreciated by

1.5%, to 100.1. It had remained within a range of 97 to 102 since February 2003. Sterling had

depreciated by 2.6% against the euro but appreciated by 2.7% against the US dollar. The US dollar

had depreciated by 1.6% against the yen and by 5.1% against the euro. The US dollar effective

exchange rate had fallen by 3.2% over the period. This was broadly consistent with changes in relative

longer-term interest rate differentials, but market contacts had also reported concerns about the

sustainability of the US current account deficit.

A17 US and European equity indices had risen between 5 November and 3 December. The Japanese

Topix index, however, had fallen by 4.4%. Rises in the FTSE All-Share index had been broadly based

across economic sectors. The Non-Cyclical Services sector had risen the most, mainly because of


-----

5

increases in the share prices of mobile phone companies. The General Industrials sector had fallen

furthest.

A18 There had been little news about corporate credit conditions on the month. Profit warnings had

remained near recent lows in the United Kingdom and the United States. Sterling investment-grade

spreads had been broadly unchanged, while spreads on US dollar and euro-denominated non
government bonds had fallen slightly. Sterling and euro high-yield bond spreads had also fallen

slightly; US dollar high-yield bond spreads had fallen more markedly. All bond spreads had remained

low compared with their averages since 1997.

**III** **Money and credit**

A19 The annual growth rate of notes and coin (adjusted for special factors) had risen to 7.5% in

November, compared with 7.3% in October. Annual M4 growth had fallen slightly in October, to

6.6%, from 6.8% in September. The annual growth rate of M4 lending (excluding the effects of

securitisations) had risen to 11.7% in October, compared with 11.3% in September. Excluding other

financial corporations (OFCs), annual M4 growth had fallen slightly in October, to 8.1%, from 8.2% in

September, and annual M4 lending growth (excluding the effects of securitisations) had fallen by

0.1 percentage points, to 13.4%.

A20 The annual growth rate of households’ M4 had increased to 8.2% in October, from 8.1% in

September. The annual growth rate of households’ M4 borrowing (excluding the effects of

securitisations) had risen to 15.1% in October, from 15.0% in September. Within total net lending to

individuals – a measure that included household borrowing from a broader set of institutions than just

banks and building societies – the annual growth rate of secured lending had increased to 14.4% in

October, from 14.2% in September, while the annual growth rate of unsecured lending had fallen

further, to 12.8% in October, from 13.4% in September.

A21 The average two-year fixed mortgage rate had risen by 15 basis points, and the average two-year

discounted mortgage rate had increased by 18 basis points, in November. Based on the

announcements of mortgage lenders in November, the average standard variable mortgage rate (SVR)

quoted for existing borrowers had been set to rise by 26 basis points to 5.58% in December. The

average quoted rates on personal loans in excess of £10,000 had risen by only 5 basis points in


-----

6

November, and rates on credit cards and overdrafts had been unchanged. Based on announcements in

November, average quoted rates on household deposits had been set to rise in December, by 19 basis

points for time deposits and by 9 basis points for instant access accounts.

A22 Mortgage lenders had approved 115,000 loans for house purchase in October (adjusting for the

number of working days in the month). The corresponding figure for September had been revised

down to 115,000, from 131,000. And these data had been revised downwards for all months since

February 2003. The House Builders Federation monthly survey had shown that the balance of

members reporting an increase in net reservations compared with the corresponding month of the

previous year had fallen in October compared with September, after allowing for seasonal factors. The

number of particulars delivered had risen slightly in October, to 108,000, from 106,000 in September.

A23 The annual rate of growth of private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs’) M4 deposits had

fallen to 7.6% in October, from 8.5% in September. The annual growth rate of PNFCs’ M4 lending

(excluding the effects of securitisations) had fallen to 8.4% in October, from 9.5% in September.

PNFCs had raised £2.7 billion of total external finance in October, compared with an average of

£2.1 billion in the preceding three months.

A24 Data from the major British banking groups (MBBG) had shown that manufacturing companies

had made £48 million of net repayments on sterling loans in October, lower than average net

repayments of £234 million over the previous six months. MBBG net sterling lending to real estate

companies had only been £214 million in October, significantly lower than the average of £1.0 billion

over the preceding six months.

A25 The annual growth rate of other financial corporations’ (OFCs’) M4 deposits had fallen to 1.3%

in October, from 2.0% in September. The twelve-month growth rate of OFCs’ M4 lending (excluding

the effects of securitisations) had risen to 5.6% in October, from 3.4% in September.

**IV** **Demand and output**

A26 Estimated real GDP growth at market prices in 2003 Q3 had been revised up by 0.1 percentage

points, to 0.7%, in the Output, Income and Expenditure release. The annual growth rate had also been

revised up, by 0.1 percentage points, to 2.0%.

A27 Service sector output growth had been revised up by 0.1 percentage points, to 0.8%, in Q3.

Within the service sector, output growth of the distribution, hotels and catering sector had been revised

up by 0.2 percentage points, to 0.7%. Output in the transport, storage and communication sector had

grown by 0.4%, while output in the business services and finance sector had risen by 1.0%. Output

growth in the production sector in Q3 had been revised down, by 0.2 percentage points, from the

estimate in the preliminary release, to –0.2%. Manufacturing output had been flat on the quarter.

Construction output had risen by 2.5% in Q3, following a rise of 4.4% in 2003 Q2.

A28 On the expenditure measure, real private sector consumption (including that of non-profit

institutions serving households) had grown by 0.8% in Q3. Real government consumption had risen

by 0.6%, while whole-economy investment had fallen by 1.3%. Within whole-economy investment,

business investment had fallen by 1.6% in Q3, reflecting falls in services, manufacturing and other

categories.

A29 Total exports had risen by 0.1% in 2003 Q3, while total imports had risen by 1.0%, so that net

trade had reduced GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points on the quarter. After adjusting imports and

exports to take account of the impact of missing trader intra-community (MTIC) VAT fraud, exports

had risen by 0.6%, and imports by 1.6%, on the quarter.

A30 Final domestic demand had risen by 0.4% in 2003 Q3. The change in inventories (including the

alignment adjustment) had made a 0.6 percentage point contribution to GDP growth in Q3, so

domestic demand had risen by 1.0% on the quarter.

A31 Turning to indicators of expenditure in 2003 Q4, retail sales volumes had risen by 0.6% in

October, following a rise of 0.7% in September. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI)

Distributive Trades survey had pointed to a fall in annual retail sales volumes growth in November:

the reported retailing sales balance had fallen to +19, from +35 in October.

A32 The headline GfK consumer confidence indicator had fallen in November to –6, from –3 in

October. This was driven by a fall in the balance of respondents thinking it was a good time to make a

major purchase. The Nationwide and Halifax house price indices had risen by 1.2% and 1.0%

respectively on the month in November, and the three-month on three-month growth rates had been

3.8% and 4.3% respectively.

A33 Turning to indicators of output in Q4, the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply (CIPS)

services activity balance had risen to 59.6 in November, from 59.1 in October. The incoming new

business index had also picked up, to 60.1, from 58.4 in October. Both balances had reached their

highest levels since mid-1997.

A34 The CIPS manufacturing output index had fallen to 58.0 in November, from 58.8 in October.

The new orders index had risen to 57.9, from 57.2 in October. The November CBI Monthly Trends

Enquiry had suggested continued weakness in the manufacturing sector. The total orders balance had

risen to –24, from –40 in October, and the balance on expected output had also picked up slightly, to –

2, in November, from –4 in October.

**V** **The labour market**

A35 According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), employment had increased by 28,000 in 2003 Q3,

compared with 2003 Q2. The working-age employment rate had fallen by 0.1 percentage points on the

quarter, to 74.6%, but had risen by 0.3 percentage points from a year earlier. Average hours worked

had increased by 0.1% on the quarter, to 32.2 hours per week, but were down 0.6% compared with

2002 Q3.

A36 The CIPS employment survey for November had confirmed recent indications of stronger

employment growth. According to the Recruitment and Employment Confederation survey, the

demand for staff from agencies had also increased, and the availability of agency staff had started to

fall.

A37 The LFS measure of unemployment had risen by 12,000 in 2003 Q3, while the unemployment

rate had remained at 5.0%. But the claimant count measure had fallen by 3,300 in October and the rate

had fallen by 0.1 percentage points, the first change for 21 months. Both outflows and inflows from

the claimant count had fallen back in October, reversing September’s slight increase. Inactivity

amongst those of working age had risen by 33,000 in 2003 Q3, with the rate up by 0.1 percentage

points at 21.3%.

A38 Whole economy average earnings (including bonuses) had increased by 3.6% in 2003 Q3 over

the same period a year earlier, up 0.6 percentage points from the 2003 Q2 figure. Average annual

earnings growth in the public sector had been 5.6%, up 0.5 percentage points ; and in private sector

services, annual earnings growth had been 3.1%, up 0.7 percentage points. After excluding bonuses,

the annual growth of average earnings in the economy as a whole had increased by 0.3 percentage

points, to 3.7%, in the third quarter.

A39 According to the settlements information available to the Bank, the mean whole-economy

settlement (weighted to match the sectoral composition of the average earnings index) had been 3.2%

in the year to October, 0.1 percentage points higher than in the year to September.

**VI** **Prices**

A40 Sterling oil prices had been broadly unchanged since the November MPC meeting but, on

average, had been lower in November compared with October.

A41 Manufacturing input prices had risen by 1.6% in October, mainly because of higher oil prices.

This meant that their annual inflation rate had risen to 1.8%, from 0.7% in September. And the CIPS

manufacturing survey had pointed to further rises in input prices: the input price balance had risen to

55.2 in November, from 53.3 in October.

A42 Manufacturing output prices excluding duties (PPIY) had been unchanged in October, while the

annual inflation rate had fallen to 1.2%, from 1.4% in September. Survey data had continued to point

to downward pressure on output prices. The balance on expected output prices from the CBI Monthly

Trends survey had fallen to –15 in November, from –7 in October.

A43 The ONS’s experimental corporate services price index (CSPI) had suggested that annual

corporate services price inflation had risen to 3.4% in Q3, from 3.1% in Q2. The CIPS services survey

had pointed to rising output prices in November: the average prices charged balance rose to 52.3, from

51.4 in October.

A44 According to the ONS’s Output, Income and Expenditure release, the annual inflation rate of the

GDP deflator at market prices had fallen to 2.8% in Q3, from 3.1% in Q2. Within this, the annual rate

of inflation of the household consumption deflator had risen by 0.1 percentage points, to 1.4% in Q3.

The annual inflation rate of the government consumption deflator had fallen to 7.2% in Q3, from 7.6%

in Q2. The annual inflation rates of the imports and exports deflators had been 0.3% and 1.4%

respectively.

A45 Annual RPIX inflation had fallen to 2.7% in October, from 2.8% in September. Within this,

annual goods price inflation had risen by 0.1 percentage points to 0.6%, and annual services price

inflation had fallen by 0.2 percentage points, to 3.4%. Annual RPI and RPIY inflation had also fallen

in October, to 2.6% and 2.4% respectively. But annual HICP inflation was unchanged in October, at

1.4%.

**VII Reports by the Bank’s Agents**

A46 The Bank's regional Agents reported that investment intentions had continued to recover,

especially in the service sector where intentions had perhaps been at their most buoyant level since

early 2001. The most important factor behind that improvement had been greater confidence in the

economic outlook. While intentions had also improved in manufacturing, it appeared that firms had

still been planning to reduce slightly the level of their investment.

A47 Deflationary pressures on manufacturers’ domestic output prices had eased since the first half of

2003, although prices had continued to fall slightly. Price increases had in general only been possible

either for new products or in niche markets. There had continued to be strong competitive pressures

on manufacturers to cut costs, so as to allow price reductions for customers without damaging profit

margins. Costs of materials had been rising. And while annual wage increases had been fairly steady,

at around 3%, labour costs had increased - mostly because of higher employer National Insurance and

pension contributions.

A48 The annual growth of retail sales values had perhaps eased slightly in the past two months. On

balance, it seemed that retailers had been positive about the prospects for the Christmas trading period,

although it had appeared that some price discounting had been necessary to clear an overhang of stock

from the autumn. There had been some concern amongst retailers that consumer confidence could

diminish in the first quarter of 2004.
