#### MINUTES OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 9-10 APRIL 2003

1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed the world economy;

money, credit and financial market prices; demand and output; the labour market; prices and costs;

and some other considerations. The Committee noted a letter from the Chancellor (attached as an

Annex) setting out the remit for the Committee over the following year, in accordance with section 12

of the Bank of England Act 1998.

**The world economy**

2 Oil prices had dropped sharply over the past month, falling by nearly $10 per barrel. This had

been surprising, as most advance scenarios of the economic consequences of hostilities in Iraq – even

those of a short war – had envisaged a pronounced upward spike in oil prices, at least in the initial

phase. The price falls probably reflected there being less apparent damage to Iraqi oil fields than

feared, increased oil production by OPEC, and better prospects for oil production in Venezuela and

Nigeria. In any event, the price reductions unwound the increases since early December and were

likely to benefit the United States in particular, given the strong pass-through from crude oil prices to

retail gasoline prices there. Most major equity market indices had risen over the month, except in

Japan: for example, the Wilshire was up over 4% and the Euro Stoxx up over 8%. Their movement

during the month suggested that events in Iraq had played a part, with indices rising as uncertainty

about events diminished in the run-up to hostilities, and then temporarily reversing when it looked as if

the war might last longer than first thought. Higher equity prices suggested that investors had either

revised upwards their assessment of future corporate earnings, or downwards the equity risk premium,

or both. Higher short-term interest rates and bond yields also pointed to the same conclusion. Most

increases in yields had been due more to increases in real rates than to higher inflation expectations,

possibly reflecting portfolio shifts into equities.

3 In contrast to developments in financial markets, news on the month about output, demand, and


-----

the United States, industrial production had increased by only 0.1% in February. The Institute for

Supply Management (ISM) indices for manufacturing and non-manufacturing had fallen sharply in

March. In principle, the ISM indices reflected hard evidence about production, new orders,

employment, inventories and supplier deliveries, although it was still possible that the responses to the

ISM surveys had been coloured by wider worries about the prospect of war in Iraq. Most of the

responses had been gathered prior to the outbreak of hostilities and the rise in equity markets.

Consumption spending had been weak. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimate of monthly

consumption had fallen 0.4% in February, after a reduction of 0.2% in January, although bad weather

on the east coast may have been partly responsible. Weekly data suggested that retail sales had faded

in the second half of March, after a pick-up in the first half. Consumer confidence had dropped on

both the Conference Board measure (based on responses prior to the start of the war) and the Michigan

measure, although there were signs of a rebound in the latter amongst those polled after the

commencement of hostilities. Although there was still some scope for more mortgage equity

withdrawal via refinancing, mortgage rates had edged up. It seemed less likely than it had in February

that consumer spending would sustain US domestic demand until investment began to pick up. Labour

market developments reinforced this doubt. Taking February and March together, non-farm payrolls

fell by nearly half a million, and claims for unemployment insurance had increased slightly. Only a

minority of the decline in non-farm payrolls was accounted for by the call-up of reservists in the armed

forces (over 200,000 by mid-March, not all of whom would have been on those payrolls beforehand).

According to the Conference Board survey, a higher proportion of households than at any time since

1994 reported that jobs were hard to find. Labour market weakness now seemed more likely to persist.

The Consensus forecast for US GDP growth in 2003 had dipped 0.2 percentage points in March, to

2.4%, and the most recent IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast was 2.2%, down from 2.6%

last September.

4 The Consensus forecast for euro-area GDP growth in 2003 also fell 0.2 percentage points in

March, to 1.1%, the same as the latest WEO forecast. GDP in 2002 Q4, at 0.2% on the first release,

had been a little higher than expected, but it had probably been boosted to a greater extent than

previously thought by temporary factors such as the impact of tax incentives on investment and the

purchase of new cars in Italy, and flood-related construction spending in Germany. As in the United

States, the latest indicators of activity had fallen back, with declines in the Purchasing Managers

Indices for both manufacturing and services in March: both were now below the 50 level. The


-----

data showed a more mixed picture. There had been an increase of over 1% in January in the euro area

as a whole, but the figures may have been exaggerated by seasonal factors; production had fallen

sharply the month before. In February, German industrial production had fallen by 0.4%. Retail sales

had followed a similar pattern, with euro-area sales bouncing back in January but German sales falling

off in February. Euro-area consumer confidence had declined for the sixth month running in March,

reflecting concerns about both the general economic situation and individual job prospects;

unemployment had risen in February. It remained difficult to identify what would give rise to a

recovery in EU domestic demand in the near term, and the appreciation of the euro since the end of

2000 would tend to weaken external demand.

5 The indications from Japan were that the reported 0.5% growth of GDP in 2002 Q4 might indeed

have marked some improvement in the Japanese economy. The METI ‘all-activity’ index rose 1.7% in

January, more than reversing its December fall. The Consensus forecast for GDP growth in 2003 had

risen 0.2 percentage points in March, to 0.6%. The likely economic impact of the emergence of

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the rest of East Asia could not yet be assessed,

although it was clear that air travel in the region had dropped off sharply.

**Money, credit and financial market prices**

6 In the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, equity prices had been volatile, but indices had on average

risen over the month, with, for example, the FTSE-All Share index up around 7% since the

Committee’s March meeting. Short-term movements had been positively correlated with changes in

market interest rates, with both seeming to follow day-to-day news about developments in Iraq. There

appeared to have been domestic as well as international influences affecting UK interest rates: one
year forward rates had increased significantly more than in the United States and the euro area. In

particular, UK interest rates rose on publication of the minutes of the Committee’s March meeting.

Market anecdote suggested that the trigger had been the discussion in the minutes of the arguments for

an increase in the repo rate, even though no member had supported such a move. That had contrasted

with the fall in short-term money market rates that had taken place immediately after the February

reduction in the repo rate. Judging by implied forward interest rates, participants now expected the

turning point in the repo rate to arrive earlier than previously thought. Nevertheless, transactions

volatility suggested that the sterling money market curve in early March might not have been as good a


-----

7 The greater rise in short-maturity money market interest rates in the United Kingdom than

elsewhere might have been expected to have encouraged an appreciation of sterling. But in fact

sterling had depreciated further – by around 1% on the effective measure. Last month, the Committee

had considered three possible, not mutually exclusive, explanations for sterling’s fall: first, a

reassessment by market participants of how the Committee reacted to economic news; second, a

downward revision in their estimates of the equilibrium real exchange rate expected in the medium

term; and, third, a reduction in confidence due to assessments of the likely consequences of war in

Iraq. The further fall in sterling this month, juxtaposed against the rise in UK interest rates relative to

those abroad, provided evidence against the first hypothesis. And the increases in equity prices and

short-term interest rates weighed against there having been a persistent ‘Iraq’ effect, and therefore

against the third hypothesis. An explanation in terms of a lower expected equilibrium real exchange

rate seemed more likely. It was suggested that the fall could have been due to a perceived worsening

of the outlook for UK domestic demand (relative to other countries). There had indeed recently been

more discussion of this possibility, for example in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook. Such a shift

would mean that a lower real exchange rate was necessary to boost external demand and hence bring

total demand back into line with the United Kingdom’s supply capacity, as would be expected in the

long run in the absence of further shocks. Another possible reason for a lower equilibrium real

exchange rate was that the share of UK domestic demand spent on imports might be increasing faster

than ONS statistics reported (putting downward pressure on sterling via the current account); in this

context, it was notable that the rest of the EU reported more exports to the United Kingdom than the

ONS recorded as UK imports, although it was unclear why any perception that UK imports were being

underreported would have affected sterling suddenly in the recent past. Several ways in which an

adjustment in the real exchange rate could be brought about were considered. One mechanism was

through the adjustment of capital flows. For example, overseas investors might have been anticipating

the lower growth of domestic demand and the resulting lower profits (at least in the short run) by

reducing direct investment. Or, there might have been an increased demand from the UK for foreign

financial assets. Even without a shock to domestic demand, investors might have reduced the desired

weight of sterling assets (including direct investment) in their portfolios, perhaps because of a general

tendency to repatriate capital at a time of international uncertainty. In any event, the likelihood that

the recent depreciation of sterling would persist was probably higher than had been thought last month.


-----

8 The growth rate of broad money had picked up a little in February, as had that of narrow money

in March. There had been some signs of a decline in bank borrowing by non-financial firms.

Although the annual growth rate of non-financial corporate borrowing had increased, the monthly flow

had eased back compared with the average monthly flow in 2002 Q4. It looked likely that total new

external finance by companies would be lower in 2003 Q1 than in the previous quarter. That could

have reflected some combination of lower costs, lower investment, lower dividends, higher revenues

and, conceivably, the impact of tighter borrowing constraints imposed by lenders. Firms had been

strengthening their balance sheets and the corporate sector as a whole ran a financial surplus last year.

Eventually, stronger balance sheets might encourage investment, but in the near future firms might

want to increase their net saving further, for example to offset the widespread increase in deficits in

company defined-benefit pension funds, and that might mean further cuts in planned investment,

dividends and employment. Companies in declining sectors of the economy had particularly tough

challenges in financing defined-benefit pension funds. Outside the oil sector, there had been few signs

of an increase in gross trading profits.

9 The monthly flow of new borrowing by households – both secured and unsecured – had also

fallen back a little from the average in the fourth quarter last year. But these rates were still high by

historical standards. Mortgage equity withdrawal as a proportion of personal disposable income was

almost as high at the end of last year as in the housing boom of the late 1980s. Two-year fixed-rate

mortgage rates were lower than they had been in February. There were few signs from the borrowing

data that consumption growth would be weak. However, the path of total household borrowing was

not necessarily a good guide to the path of consumption in the short term, not least because of the

heterogeneity of households; for example, borrowing had accelerated in 2002 while consumption

growth had fallen slightly. Borrowing could be used to finance the purchase of assets by households

as well as consumption of goods and services. Borrowing could also be undertaken to maintain

consumption in the face of slower growth in disposable incomes. The Committee’s February central

projection had indeed envisaged a fall in the household sector’s saving ratio in the short run.

10 So far this year, house price inflation had fallen a little more than the Committee had projected at

the time of the February Inflation Report, with the three-month-on-three-month rates of increase of

house prices running at between 4% and 4½% according to the Halifax and Nationwide indices. The

Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors survey indicated that price increases had moderated further


-----

and were likely to decline even more. Indicators of the volume of activity also suggested that a

slowdown was under way in the housing market.

**Demand and output**

11 The estimate of GDP growth in the final quarter of 2002 was unchanged in the latest ONS

release. As a result of data revisions, it now looked as if consumption and business investment had

been higher than previously thought, and it seemed more likely that investment might have stabilised.

The upward revisions to domestic demand were offset by an upward revision to imports.

12 Output in 2003 Q1 was likely to have been lower than expected at the time of the February

_Inflation Report. In March, the CIPS private services activity index had dropped below 50, after_

several months of falls, and it was likely that private services sector growth had been considerably

weaker in the first quarter of this year than in 2002 Q4. The picture for manufacturing was more

confused. According to the index of production, manufacturing output growth had held up, increasing

by 0.2% in January (largely because of production of computers) and by 0.3% in February (with

increases more broadly based across sectors). But both the CIPS and CBI surveys for March

suggested that there had been a sharp deterioration subsequently. These surveys asked respondents

about output and orders, not business sentiment, so in principle they should not have been biased by

any concern about the increase in international political tension unless reflected in reduced or delayed

activity. In the past, the CIPS responses had sometimes given a misleading signal about output, but

more because of inadequate industry coverage (such as under-representation of expanding ICT firms

during the slowdown of the late ’90s) than because of bias due to confidence effects.

13 There had been further signs of a slowdown in household spending. Retail sales had fallen by

0.1% in February, suggesting that the reported weakness in January was not due simply to difficulties

in applying seasonal adjustment to the data around Christmas. VAT receipts had been unexpectedly

low in February. CIPS survey data pointed to a fall in output of manufactured consumption goods in

March. The CBI Distributive Trades survey’s balance for retail volumes fell sharply in March,

although this might to some extent have reflected the fact that Easter falls later this year than last, so

that the holiday spending period falls in April instead of March. Private sales of cars were relatively

strong in March. Consumer confidence had changed little in March after its decline in recent months,


-----

households’ own economic circumstances, although the latter had also weakened somewhat. Publicity

given to the slowdown in house prices since Christmas may have contributed to the weakness. The

impact of the war in Iraq was uncertain. The path of consumption had been little affected by the

earlier Gulf War and the Falklands campaign, but it was possible that there was more concern over

security, especially in city centres, during the present hostilities. Consistent with this, sales within the

M25 appeared to have fallen disproportionately.

14 Overall, it now seemed likely that consumption growth in 2003 Q1 had been considerably lower

than envisaged in the February _Inflation Report, and below its long-run trend. The question was,_

looking forward, what were the implications of the apparent weakness of consumption in the first

quarter? There were three possibilities. First, the weakness might have been erratic, and might

quickly reverse as some of the uncertainties about the consequences of the war in Iraq were resolved.

Second, consumption had been expected to slow from the second quarter onwards as higher National

Insurance contributions and Council Tax reduced disposable income growth. It was possible that the

weakness might simply have reflected an earlier-than-predicted arrival of this expected slowdown, as

consumers anticipated the imminent reduction in the growth of their disposable income. Third, it

could have been the sign of a downward revision to consumers’ estimates of their income over the

long run for some other reasons, in which case further falls could be expected later when the higher

National Insurance contributions and Council Tax affected disposable income. Assessing the outlook

for consumption was complicated by the difficulty in forecasting real disposable income due to the

divergence between the personal consumption deflator and RPIX.

15 Turning to the other components of demand, the Treasury briefing suggested that the Budget had

relatively mild implications for the expected profile of government spending, but a more thorough

analysis would be possible during the forthcoming forecast round. A range of measures to raise

potential output had also been announced in the Budget, but any effects were likely to be modest over

the time horizon relevant to the Committee’s decision. Export demand had been significantly weaker

than expected in February, especially to non-EU countries. This was consistent with the weak data on

demand in the United Kingdom’s major trading partners, and perhaps made earlier falls in reported

exports more plausible. But it was clear that the puzzles surrounding the trade data remained.


-----

**The labour market**

16 In general, the labour market appeared to remain reasonably robust. The unemployment rate on

the Labour Force Survey measure had fallen to 5.0% in the three months to January, and it was likely

that it would turn out to have been lower in the first quarter than assumed in the Committee’s central

projection in February. Employment had increased by 57,000 in the same period. The CIPS

employment survey suggested that there had continued to be net job losses from the private sector in

March, but the Workforce Jobs data showed that public sector employment had continued to grow in

2002 Q4. Labour supply also depended on the hours worked by members of the labour force. Total

and average hours worked had fallen in Q4. A special survey by the Bank’s regional Agents had

reported a trend across all sectors for average weekly hours worked to fall, partly because of the

impact of legislation, and partly because of pressure from existing and prospective employees. The

fall thus did not seem to be a purely cyclical effect, the consequence of firms hoarding labour in the

expectation of an early recovery in demand. Hence any shake-out of labour in the event of a

protracted period of lower-than-expected growth was likely to be less than might previously have been

forecast. The impact on wage costs was unclear; it depended on whether the fall in average hours

pushed up average hourly pay (as it would, for example, if weekly pay was not affected) or reduced it

(as it would tend to if fewer hours were worked at overtime rates).

17 The growth of pay (excluding bonuses) was much the same in the year to January as in the year

to December, and wage settlements, at 2.9% in February, continued to be remarkably stable. The

increases in National Insurance contributions came into effect this month, and data on April

settlements were likely to help in assessing their impact. So far, there had been little sign of

employees trying to compensate for their increased contributions by demanding higher pay

settlements. Nor did there seem to have been a reaction to the upward movement in RPI inflation over

recent months. That might be because of confidence that the inflation rate would be anchored at

around 2½% by monetary policy. There was also a possibility that employers would have agreed

higher settlements had it not been for the increase in their National Insurance contributions.

**Prices and costs**

18 The annual rate of RPIX inflation was 3% in February, a little higher than had been expected by


-----

expected for a couple of months now. Last month, the increases could be regarded as spurious, the

likely result of a change in the collection date for RPI data relative to the timing of post-Christmas

sales, but it was now more difficult to dismiss them.

19 As the Committee had noted previously, the profile of RPIX inflation in the near term would be

raised by a number of temporary factors. The impact of higher retail petrol prices discussed last month

was now likely to be short-lived given that sterling oil prices had fallen by around 25% since the

Committee’s March meeting. That fall would reduce inflation projections (relative to last month’s) by

around 0.2 percentage points in the near term, but, because the two-year-ahead futures price of oil had

remained unchanged, there was now likely to be a higher mechanical contribution to the annual rate of

inflation further out. However, because of sterling depreciation during the first quarter, this year’s

large Council Tax increases and the temporarily high housing depreciation component, annual RPIX

inflation was still likely to increase over the forthcoming quarter. Thereafter, it was likely to fall

gradually, as house price increases moderated and the price level effect of the Council Tax fell out of

annual comparisons.

20 One of the major uncertainties over the forecast horizon was how large and how long-lasting the

impact on retail prices of the 5% depreciation in sterling since the February Inflation Report would be.

A purely mechanical simulation with the Bank’s medium-term macroeconometric model suggested

that it could add somewhere between a half and one percentage point to inflation during 2004. But

that depended on several factors, including the impact on the wholesale prices of imports, the pass
through from wholesale import prices to retail prices, the effect of any price increases on wage

bargainers’ and price setters’ inflation expectations, and the size of the stimulus to UK net exports.

Threshold effects might be important, with little change in prices for moderate falls in sterling. Recent

international evidence suggested that the pass-through to retail prices might be less now than in the

past. Direct price effects were likely to be the most important factors in the short run, while indirect

effects via the impact on aggregate demand and inflation expectations would tend to build up more

gradually. The overall effect on the price level might be spread out over a lengthy period.

21 Two other issues relating to price setting were discussed. First, wage bargainers’ and price

setters’ reactions to movements in the components of RPIX might depend on the particular

components in question. For example, changes in Council Tax and petrol prices might be more visible


-----

Although RPI was widely used as a benchmark for wage negotiations, in practice it was not clear that

it was the most relevant index to help explain actual wage settlements; the link had become weaker

since the beginning of the 1990s. Second, reactions to changes in inflation also depended on how

wage bargainers and price setters thought that the monetary policy authorities would react. In

particular, the degree to which the Committee was expected to accommodate apparently temporary

shocks to inflation (but permanent shocks to the price level) would be important.

**Other considerations**

22 The Reuters poll of economists suggested that there were slightly higher expectations of a rate

change this month than last, but a mean probability of just over 60% was attached to there being no

change in the repo rate. Most expected a reduction in May. Market anecdote was that a reduction this

month might be taken as an indication that interest rates would follow a lower path than previously

thought. As the Committee’s meeting was taking place immediately after the Budget, there was also a

possibility that any change in the repo rate would mistakenly be seen as a commentary on the Budget

rather than as a response to a wide range of data.

**The immediate policy decision**

23 Although a gradual recovery in the world economy was still likely in the medium term, the

Committee agreed that the global outlook currently seemed somewhat weaker than at the time of the

February Inflation Report. Economic forecasts of GDP growth in 2003 had been revised down.

Surveys of business and consumer confidence had been particularly pessimistic about the near-term

outlook. They may have been affected by increased uncertainty due to the situation in Iraq. However,

not all the news on the month had been bad for the world outlook. In particular, the drop in oil prices

and the increases in equity prices around the world in the second half of the month would tend to

stimulate activity. It was not yet clear to what extent there might be a rebound in confidence as a

result of the likely early conclusion of the war in Iraq. In the United Kingdom, evidence was

accumulating that the anticipated slowdown in consumption growth was under way, although its extent

was still uncertain. The question was whether investment, external demand and public sector spending

would pick up fast enough to keep aggregate demand broadly in line with potential supply. The

depreciation of sterling would help in this regard, as would stronger equities and lower oil prices. In


-----

above target, albeit as a result of a range of temporary factors likely to unwind in the coming year, and

growth might be below trend.

24 In the light of the evidence about global and domestic demand and prices, the Committee

considered arguments for reducing the repo rate or maintaining it at the current level. Committee

members differed in how persuasive they found each of these to be.

25 There were a number of possible reasons for a reduction. First, the world economy had been

weaker than expected and the outlook seemed to have deteriorated. In particular, data from the United

States had been weaker. It was difficult to know what weight to put on survey data at the current

conjuncture because of the war in Iraq, but, arguably, it was unlikely that the downturn in indicators

was all war-related. Demand for euro-area exports, for example, would be affected by the recent past

appreciation of the euro for some time. Second, it looked likely that UK output had been lower in the

first quarter than expected and the signs were that demand for UK goods and services was slowing.

Consumer spending was likely to reflect the weakness of retail sales, the slightly faster-than-expected

slowing of house prices, and the fact that the rate of consumer borrowing had apparently passed its

peak. Although firms seemed to be strengthening their balance sheets, there was no guarantee that this

would be reflected in increased investment in the near term. Reported exports had been repeatedly

weaker than expected. In the context of weak global demand, it was not clear that the fall in the

exchange rate would boost net trade sufficiently to keep aggregate demand growing broadly in line

with potential supply. This news about output and demand contained valuable information about the

level of inflation in the future, and it was particularly desirable for the Committee to react promptly.

Third, given the likely behaviour of house and oil prices, the contribution of these factors to measured

inflation was likely to fall significantly over the next year. Fourth, pay settlements, particularly in the

private sector, implied lower increases in real wages. Fifth, the risks to inflation entailed by

maintaining an interest rate that was too tight were greater at present than the risks entailed by

reducing rates, given the degree of spare capacity in the economy thought to exist by some Committee

members.

26 There were also arguments in favour of maintaining the current repo rate and, for most

Committee members, these, taken together, were more convincing. First, the news about output and

demand was ambiguous. Consumption and business investment had been higher than expected in


-----

in February. The export data had been weak but were difficult to reconcile with other sources of

information. The fall in the price of oil would tend to stimulate activity. The rise in equity markets

would help to sustain consumption, which was not necessarily slowing faster than the Committee had

expected: the retail sales position was complicated by the lateness of Easter this year; the deceleration

in house prices had been tentative and rates of increase were still high in many regions; and household

borrowing was still at historically high levels, supported by further increases in house prices and by the

low real interest rates facing consumers. The war in Iraq had increased the difficulty of interpreting

survey responses, probably making them unduly pessimistic but to an unknown extent. It looked

likely at the moment that the war would be over quickly, so that uncertainty from this source would be

less next month; hence, on this occasion, a delay should help clarify the underlying picture for the

Committee. Second, the decline in the sterling exchange rate had persisted, despite an increase during

the month in UK interest rates relative to the rest of the world, and largely independently of

movements in the dollar-euro rate. This would tend to raise prices both directly, even though the

speed and degree of pass-through to retail prices was uncertain, and indirectly, via the boost it would

give to net external demand. Third, it was important not to let inflation expectations drift upwards

away from the target. While there was little sign of this happening at the moment, the expected

increase in inflation in the short run, even though it was largely due to transient factors, might affect

expectations of inflation further ahead. There was more of a risk that any impact of sterling’s

depreciation would be amplified by further wage and price adjustments if the credibility of the target

were dented. Policy would be less effective if reductions in the repo rate were to trigger rises in

inflation expectations and hence rises in the yield curve further out, as might have happened to a

limited extent after the February reduction. Fourth, there were a number of issues that would benefit

from further analysis in the context of the forecast round leading up to the May Inflation Report, such

as the probable extent of exchange-rate pass-through, the quality of trade statistics, the impact of the

Budget, and the implications of the decline in average hours worked. It was not clear at this stage

what the Committee would conclude about these issues, and hence what the consequences would be

for the inflation projection.

27 The Governor invited members to vote on the proposition that the repo rate should be maintained

at 3.75%. Seven members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, Andrew Large, Kate

Barker, Charles Bean, Stephen Nickell and Paul Tucker) voted in favour. Christopher Allsopp and

Marian Bell voted against, preferring a reduction in the repo rate of 25 basis points.

#### ANNEX: SUMMARY OF DATA PRESENTED BY BANK STAFF

A1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee

on 4 April 2003, in advance of its meeting on 9-10 April. At the start of the Committee meeting itself,

members were made aware of the information that had subsequently become available, and that

information is included in this Annex.

**I** **The international environment**

A2 According to the final estimate, US GDP had increased by 0.3% on a quarter earlier in 2002 Q4,

compared with the preliminary estimate of 0.4%. The estimates of quarterly consumption and

investment growth were unchanged, at 0.4% and 1.1% respectively, while estimated quarterly growth

in government spending had been revised down from 1.2% to 1.1%. The estimated stockbuilding and

net trade contributions had remained unchanged, at 0.1 and –0.4 percentage points respectively.

Pre-tax corporate profits (including an adjustment for inventory valuation and capital consumption)

had risen by 3.3% in Q4 compared with a quarter earlier. Non-farm business sector labour

productivity had risen by 0.2% and unit labour costs had risen by 1.0% over the same period.

A3 Industrial production in the United States had risen by 0.1% in February compared with a month

earlier, but manufacturing output had fallen by 0.1%, and total industry capacity utilisation was

unchanged at 75.6%. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing index had fallen to

46.2 in March, from 50.5 in February, while the ISM non-manufacturing index had fallen to 47.9, from

53.9. Non-farm payrolls had fallen by 108,000 in March, following a fall of 357,000 in February.

The unemployment rate had remained unchanged at 5.8% in March.

A4 Real consumption in the United States had fallen by 0.4% in February compared with a month

earlier, following a 0.2% monthly fall in January. Real personal disposable income had fallen by

0.2%, following an increase of 0.2% in January. Nominal retail sales had fallen by 1.6%, following a

monthly rise of 0.3% in January. Excluding sales of automobiles, retail sales by value had fallen by

1.0%, following an increase of 1.2% in January. The final release of the University of Michigan

measure of consumer confidence had shown a decline to 77.6 in March, from 79.9 in February, and the

Conference Board index had declined to 62.5, from 64.8 in February. The falls in both indices had


-----

had narrowed in January to $41.1 billion, from $44.9 billion in December. Export volumes had risen

by 1.5% in January compared with a month earlier, and import volumes had fallen by 3.0% over the

same period. The current account deficit had widened to 5.2% of GDP in Q4, compared with

4.8% in Q3.

A5 Euro-area GDP had grown by 0.2% on a quarter earlier in 2002 Q4, compared with a quarterly

increase of 0.4% in 2002 Q3. Quarterly private consumption growth had remained unchanged, at

0.4%, while quarterly growth in government expenditure had risen to 0.6%, from 0.3% in the previous

quarter. Stockbuilding had contributed 0.1 percentage points to quarterly growth and net trade had

reduced it by 0.2 percentage points. Industrial production in the euro area had increased by 1.1% in

January compared with a month earlier. In Germany and France, industrial production had increased

by 2.0% and 1.5% respectively over the same period. German manufacturing orders had fallen by

0.6% in February compared with a month earlier, following a 4.1% increase in January. The volume

of retail sales in the euro area had increased by 2.5% on a month earlier in January, after a fall of 0.7%

in December. German retail sales had fallen by 1.1% on the month in February, following a 3.3%

increase in January. Consumer spending on manufactured goods in France had fallen by 0.5% in

February compared with a month earlier, following a 0.6% increase in January. The euro-area

unemployment rate (ILO measure) had increased to 8.7% in February, from 8.6% in January, while

German and French unemployment rates had increased by 0.1 percentage points, to 8.7% and 9.1%

respectively.

A6 The euro-area manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) had fallen to 48.4 in March,

from 50.1 in February. In Germany, the manufacturing PMI had fallen to 47.8 in March, from 49.9 in

February, while in France it had fallen to 48.1, from 51.5 in February. The euro-area services PMI had

fallen to 47.7 in March, from 48.9 in February. The German IFO index had fallen to 88.1 in March,

from 88.9 in February; the fall had been attributable to declines in both the current conditions and the

future expectations components of the index. The French INSEE measure of manufacturing

confidence had fallen to 94 in March, from 97 in February.  The European Commission measure of

euro-area consumer confidence had fallen by 2 points in March, to –21, while the measure of industrial

confidence had decreased by 1 point, to –12.

A7 Japanese worker households’ real expenditure had fallen by 1.6% in February compared with a


-----

Industrial production had fallen by 1.7% in February compared with a month earlier. Domestic private

sector machinery orders (excluding volatile items) had fallen by 9.6% in February compared with a

month earlier, after increasing by 7.0% in January. The Japanese tertiary activity index had risen by

1.8% on the month in January and the all-industry activity index by 1.7%. Export volumes had

increased by 10.2% in February compared with a year earlier. Export volumes to the United States

had fallen by 5.9% over this period, while export volumes to Asia had increased by 23.8%. Import

volumes had risen by 1.6% in February compared with a year earlier. The Bank of Japan’s Tankan

large manufacturers’ diffusion index had fallen by 1 point, to –10, but the large non-manufacturers’

diffusion index had increased by 2 points, to –14. Firms’ outlook for sales and profits in the financial

year 2003 had been more optimistic than their assessment of the financial year 2002.

The all-household survey had reported an annual decline of 1.0% in real spending in February,

compared with a 1.5% annual decline in January. The unemployment rate had fallen to 5.2% in

February, from 5.5% in January.

A8 The price of physical Brent crude oil had fallen to around $25 per barrel, a decrease of around

$9 per barrel from the price at the time of the Committee’s previous meeting. The Economist

industrial metals dollar price index had fallen by 7.2% since the Committee’s previous meeting, while

the non-food agricultural commodities index had fallen by 4.1% and the dollar food index by 3.6%

over the same period.

A9 In the United States, annual producer price inflation had risen to 3.5% in February, from 2.8% in

January. Annual core producer price inflation (excluding food and energy prices) had fallen to 0.1% in

February, compared with 0.5% a month earlier. Annual consumer price inflation had increased to

3.0% in February compared with 2.6% in January. Annual core consumer price inflation had fallen to

1.7% in February, from 1.9% in January. The euro-area harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP)

had increased by 2.4% in the year to February, compared with a 2.2% increase in the year to January;

the flash estimate for the twelve months to March had been 2.4%. The preliminary estimate for the

German HICP had been an increase of 1.3% in the year to March. In Japan, consumer prices had

fallen by 0.1% in the year to February, compared with a fall of 0.5% in the year to January.

A10 Most major international equity indices had risen since the Committee’s March meeting. In local

currency terms, the Wilshire 5000 had risen by 4.4%, the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx by 8.5%. The

**II** **Monetary and financial conditions**

A11 The twelve-month growth rate of notes and coin had continued to increase, to 6.6% in March

from 6.2% in February. Annual growth of M4 had increased slightly to 6.7% in February, from 6.5%

in January. The twelve-month growth rate of M4 lending (excluding the effects of securitisations) had

increased to 11.0% in February, from 10.4% in January.

A12 The twelve-month growth rate of households’ M4 had fallen slightly, to 8.6% in February from

8.7% in January. The twelve-month growth rate of households’ M4 borrowing (excluding the effects

of securitisations) had been unchanged at 14.5% in February. Annual growth of total net lending to

individuals, a broader measure, had also been unchanged, at 13.7%. But the three-month annualised

growth rate had fallen slightly further, to 13.8% in February from 13.9% in January, having peaked at

14.6% in October 2002. Within total lending to individuals, the annual growth rate of secured lending

had risen to 13.6% in February, from 13.5% in January. The annual growth rate of unsecured lending

to individuals had fallen to 14.2% in February, from 14.6% in January.

A13 The number of loan approvals for house purchase, after adjusting for the number of working

days in the month, had been unchanged at 108,000 in February. The number of particulars delivered

had fallen to 124,000 in February, from 127,000 in January. The House Builders Federation’s monthly

survey had shown that the balance of members reporting an increase in net reservations in February

compared with a year earlier had increased after a sharp drop (to –34) in January, but had remained

negative, at –18. And the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) survey had shown that the

balance of respondents expecting an increase in sales over the next three months had fallen from +1 in

January to –19 in February, the lowest since the start of the series in 1998.

A14 Mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW) had risen to £13.3 billion in 2002 Q4, or 7.2% of personal

disposable income (PDI), compared with £10.7 billion, or 5.9% of PDI, in 2002 Q3. Total unsecured

lending to individuals had fallen to 2.7% of PDI in 2002 Q4, from 3.2% of PDI in 2002 Q3. Overall,

therefore, total lending for consumption had been 9.9% of PDI in 2002 Q4, compared with 9.1% in

2002 Q3.

A15 The twelve-month growth rate of private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs’) M4 deposits had


-----

The twelve-month growth rate of PNFCs’ M4 borrowing (excluding the effects of securitisations) had

increased further, to 8.5% in February from 7.5% in January. PNFCs had raised £2.1 billion of total

external finance (excluding the effects of securitisations) in February, compared with an average

monthly flow of £4.6 billion over the previous six months. Within external finance other than

M4 borrowing, moderate sterling bond and equity issuance had been more than offset by net

repayments of foreign currency bank borrowing and net redemption of securities in foreign currency.

A16 Data from the major British banking groups (MBBG) on the breakdown of sterling lending had

shown that the twelve-month growth rate of their lending to manufacturing companies had become

slightly less negative in February. The annual growth rate of borrowing by construction companies

had risen sharply, while that of other sectors’ borrowing had changed little on the month.

A17 The annual growth rate of M4 deposits of other financial corporations (OFCs) had increased, to

2.6% in February from 2.2% in January. The twelve-month growth rate of OFCs’ M4 borrowing

(excluding the effects of securitisations) had bounced back, to 4.2% in February from 2.9% in January.

A18 The FTSE 100 index had risen by 8.4% between 5 March and 9 April. The FTSE All-Share

index had risen by 7.5% over the same period, but the FTSE Small Cap had fallen by 0.3%. All

sectoral indices within the FTSE had risen, apart from Information Technology, which had declined by

4.0%. Uncertainty about the future level of the FTSE 100, as measured by the volatility implied by

options prices, had fallen over the month, although it had remained above its average over the past ten

years. But the skew to expectations for the index, an indicator of perceptions of the balance of risk,

had become less negative. The number of downward profit warnings by UK companies in March

2003 had been slightly higher than in March 2002.

A19 Nominal forward rates had risen at all horizons between 5 March and 9 April, by 57 basis points

at two years and 20 basis points at 15 years. The standard deviation of six-month sterling interest rate

expectations, a measure of uncertainty, had risen over the month. This rise had been larger than in the

euro area and the United States. Real forward rates had risen by 40 basis points at two years and

20 basis points at ten years. They had, however, fallen at maturities beyond 19 years, by 9 basis points

at 25 years. Ten-year real spot rates had risen internationally.


-----

A20 Between 5 March and 9 April, forward implied inflation expectations had been broadly

unchanged at horizons between five and ten years, but had risen at longer horizons: by 12 basis points

at 15 years, and 23 basis points at 25 years. Mean RPIX inflation expectations in HM Treasury’s

survey for 2003 Q4 had risen, to 2.6% in March from 2.4% in February; and in the Consensus

Economics survey, mean RPIX inflation expectations for 2003 as a whole had also risen, to 2.7% in

March, from 2.6% in February, 2.5% in January and 2.4% in December 2002. Mean RPIX inflation

expectations in both HM Treasury’s survey for 2004 Q4 and the Consensus forecast for 2004 as a

whole had been unchanged at 2.4% in March.

A21 The average two-year discounted mortgage rate quoted for new customers had increased by

1 basis point in March. But the average standard variable mortgage rate (SVR) quoted for existing

borrowers had fallen by 13 basis points, while the average two-year fixed mortgage rate had fallen by

16 basis points in March. Quoted rates on household savings deposits had also fallen in March.

A22 The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) had depreciated further since the Committee’s

previous meeting. It stood at 99.7 on 9 April, compared with 100.4 on 5 March. Sterling had

depreciated by 2.9% against the dollar and by 0.3% against the euro. While movements in sterling

exchange rates since the Committee’s February meeting could not be accounted for by changes in

relative interest rates, there had been some evidence of a rise in the risk premium and lower two-year

expectations for sterling’s ERI up to 10 March, the day of the latest Consensus Economics survey.

Consensus forecasts had continued to point to a fall in the sterling ERI, with an expected depreciation

of sterling against both the euro and the dollar.

**III** **Demand and output**

A23 In the Q4 National Accounts release, the estimate of quarterly GDP growth at constant market

prices in 2002 Q4 had been unrevised, at 0.4%. Estimated annual growth had been revised up, by

0.1 percentage points, to 2.2%. The release had included revisions to estimated GDP for 2001 and

2002 (as well as small revisions to income data from 1999). The net impact of these revisions had

been to raise the estimated level of GDP at market prices in 2002 Q4 by 0.4%.

A24 On the output measure, estimated quarterly GDP growth at basic prices had been unrevised from


-----

unrevised at 0.5%, estimated manufacturing output growth had been revised down by 0.1 percentage

points, to –1.0%, and estimated construction output growth had been revised up, to 1.9%, from 1.1% in

the previous release.

A25 On the expenditure measure, estimated quarterly final domestic demand growth in the fourth

quarter had been revised up, to 0.9%, from 0.6% in the previous release. Estimated household

consumption growth (including non-profit institutions serving households) had also been revised up, to

1.1%, from 1.0% in the previous release. Within this, consumption of retail goods and of services had

been the main contributors to overall consumption growth. Estimated whole-economy investment

growth (including valuables) in 2002 Q4 had been revised up, to –0.2%, from –1.3% in the previous

release. Within this, estimated business investment growth had been revised up, to 0.4%, from –1.1%

in the previous release. Government investment also rose in 2002 Q4, by 3.4%.

A26 The estimated contribution of inventories to GDP growth in 2002 Q4 had been revised up, to

0.8 percentage points, from 0.7 percentage points in the previous release. Excluding the alignment

adjustment, inventories had contributed 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth. The Q4 alignment

adjustment had been the largest positive adjustment since adjustments of this type had been introduced

in 1983. The ONS had suggested that this had reflected issues relating to the consistency of data on

domestic output and demand and overseas trade. Estimated domestic demand growth had been revised

up, to 1.6% in 2002 Q4, from 1.3% in the previous release.

A27 Estimated export growth in 2002 Q4 had been revised down a little, to –3.6%, from –3.4% in the

previous release. Estimated import growth had been revised up, to 0.2%, from –0.3% in the previous

release. Within exports, there had been a 5.8% fall in goods exports, which had been partially offset

by a 2.7% rise in services exports. The estimated contribution of net trade to quarterly GDP growth in

2002 Q4 had been revised down, to –1.3 percentage points, from –1.0 percentage point in the previous

release.

A28 On the income side of the accounts, households’ real post-tax income had risen by 0.9% in

2002 Q4. This had reflected increases in both households’ real post-tax labour income (which

excludes dividends and other non-labour income), which had risen by 0.6%, and non-labour income,

which had risen by 2.2%. The saving ratio had fallen by 0.2 percentage points, to 4.9% in 2002 Q4.


-----

The estimate of households’ net financial balance for Q3 had been revised down in Q3, with the deficit

widening to –0.7% of GDP in Q4, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of financial deficit.

A29 The gross operating surplus of private corporations (excluding the alignment adjustment) had

risen by 0.8% in 2002 Q4, following a fall of 0.7% in Q3. Private corporations’ financial balance

(excluding the alignment adjustment) had been in surplus for the fourth consecutive quarter in

2002 Q4. This had broadly offset the financial deficit of households, such that the private sector as a

whole had been close to financial balance in 2002 Q4. The public sector net financial deficit had

widened in 2002 Q4.

A30 The current account deficit had widened to £3.1 billion in 2002 Q4, following a deficit of

£1.1 billion in Q3. The widening had been driven primarily by an increase in the trade deficit.

A31 Turning to indicators of expenditure in 2003 Q1, retail sales volumes had fallen by 0.1% in

February, following a 1.0% fall in January. The March CBI Distributive Trades survey had pointed to

a sharp fall in annual retail sales volumes growth, with the reported sales balance falling to –13, from

+2 in February. According to data supplied by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders

(SMMT), new car registrations had been 3.4% higher than a year earlier in March. In Q1 as a

whole, total new registrations had fallen by 1.4% on the same period a year earlier. The Nationwide

house price index had risen by 1.9%, and the Halifax index by 1.1% on the month in March; their

respective annual growth rates had also risen slightly, to 26.2% and 23.8% respectively. The GfK

consumer confidence aggregate indicator had fallen to –10 in March, from –9 in February. The

constituent balances had remained broadly unchanged in March, with both forward- and backward
looking balances relating to the general economic situation remaining significantly negative.

A32 Overseas trade data in February had indicated that goods export volumes had fallen by 5.6% on

the month, reversing the 5.2% increase in January. Exports to non-EU countries had fallen particularly

sharply. Goods import volumes had also fallen, by 1.7% in February, following a rise of 4.3% in

January. The trade in goods deficit had widened to £3.7 billion, whereas the trade in services surplus

had narrowed slightly, to £1.2 billion. Overall, the total deficit in goods and services had widened to

£2.4 billion in February, from £1.8 billion in January.


-----

A33 On the output side, the CIPS services survey activity index had fallen, to 49.0 in March, from

50.2 in February. This had been the lowest activity balance since December 2001. The incoming new

business index had also fallen, to 48.8 in March, from 49.9 in February. Manufacturing output had

been estimated to have risen by 0.3% in February, and by 0.2% in January. However, the CIPS

manufacturing survey output index had fallen sharply in March, to 45.6, from 49.7 in February, and

the new orders index had also fallen, to 44.9 in March, from 48.5 in February. These balances had

been at their lowest levels since December and September 2001 respectively. The CBI Monthly

Trends survey total orders balance had been broadly unchanged at –30 in March.

**IV** **The labour market**

A34 According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), employment had increased by 57,000 in the three

months to January, compared with the previous three months. This had followed a rise of 150,000 in

2002 Q4, and a 106,000 rise in the previous non-overlapping quarter. The rise in employment in the

three months to January had been more than accounted for by full-timers (up by 121,000). The

working-age employment rate had increased by 0.1 percentage points on the previous quarter, and by

0.3 percentage points on the year, to 74.6%. Workforce Jobs had increased by 47,000 in 2002 Q4,

with the biggest source of employment growth in public administration, education and health.

A35 Total hours worked in the three months to January had fallen by 0.2% compared with the

previous non-overlapping quarter. Average hours had declined by 0.4% in the three months to

January, reflecting a 0.6% fall in average hours for full-time workers to below levels seen at the time

of the Golden Jubilee last year.

A36 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted an informal survey of 194 firms (covering around

280,000 employees) on the prospects for average hours over the medium term. Overall, the survey

responses had suggested that average hours had been likely to continue to decline. But the large

number of respondents expecting no change in average hours had implied that the downward trend had

been unlikely to increase. A number of factors had been identified as being behind the decline in

average hours, including legislation (mainly the Working Time Directive) and pressure from both

existing and prospective employees.


-----

A37 The overall CIPS employment index for March had been broadly unchanged on the previous

month, and had remained below the ‘no-change’ level of 50. The rate of implied job losses in

manufacturing had slowed slightly, but had risen in services. Recent surveys of employment

intentions had been consistent with some moderate growth in employment in 2003 Q2. The

Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) survey had shown that availability of both

temporary and permanent staff had increased more rapidly in March, and the latest CBI services sector

survey had shown some evidence of labour shortages easing in some sectors.

A38 LFS unemployment had fallen by 73,000 in the three months to January and had been 28,000

lower than a year earlier. The unemployment rate had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 5.0%. The

claimant count had risen by 2,600 in February after a (revised) increase of 700 in January. Working
age inactivity had risen by 57,000 in the three months to January. This had been more than accounted

for by the 119,000 increase in those who did not want a job. The working-age inactivity rate had

increased by 0.1 percentage points to 21.4%.

A39 Annual productivity on the official ONS measure had grown by 2.1% in 2002 Q4, 0.1 percentage

points higher than annual growth in the previous quarter. Productivity growth calculated using

LFS heads employment had, however, fallen back by 0.3 percentage points, to 1.0%. Annual growth

in the official ONS measure of whole-economy unit wage costs had ticked up 0.2 percentage points, to

1.9%, in 2002 Q4.

A40 Headline (three-month average) whole-economy annual average earnings growth had eased by

0.1 percentage points, to 3.6% in January. Headline earnings growth in the public sector had picked

up by 0.4 percentage points, to 5.0%, and headline earnings growth in the private sector had fallen by

0.3 percentage points, to 3.2%. Actual whole-economy earnings growth had fallen by 0.1 percentage

points, to 3.3%, in January. Whole-economy regular pay growth (not seasonally adjusted) had fallen

by 0.1 percentage points, to 4.0%, in January. Bonuses had made a negative contribution to overall

earnings growth of 0.7 percentage points.

A41 The Bank’s twelve-month, Average Earnings Index weighted, whole-economy mean measure of

pay settlements had remained unchanged, at 2.9% in February.


-----

**V** **Prices**

A42 Sterling oil prices had fallen by around 23% since the March MPC meeting, but were slightly

higher on average in March than had been expected at the time of the February Inflation Report.

A43 Manufacturing input prices had risen by 1.4% in February, and the annual inflation rate had risen

to 5.9% in February, from 4.6% in January. The March CIPS manufacturing survey had pointed to

further increases in input prices, with the input price balance rising to 61.9 in March, from 55.2 in

February.

A44 Manufacturing output prices excluding duties (PPIY) had risen by 0.2% in February, while the

annual inflation rate had risen to 1.4%, from 1.3% in January. Looking ahead, survey data had

continued to point to downward pressure on output prices. The expected output price balance from the

CBI Monthly Trends survey had fallen to –19 in March, from –14 in February.

A45 The GDP deflator at factor cost had risen by 0.9% in 2002 Q4, and the annual inflation rate had

fallen to 3.0%, from 4.0% in 2002 Q3. Within this, the household consumption deflator had risen by

0.3% in 2002 Q4 and the government consumption deflator by 0.6%. The exports deflator had risen

by 1.1% in 2002 Q4, while the imports deflator had fallen by 1.3%. Consequently, the terms of trade

had risen by 2.4% in Q4, to a level which had been high by historical standards.

A46 Annual RPIX inflation had risen by 0.3 percentage points to 3.0% in February. Within this,

annual goods price inflation had risen by 0.4 percentage points to 0.1% in February, while annual

services price inflation had fallen by 0.1 percentage points to 4.5% in February. Annual RPI and RPIY

inflation had both risen in February, to 3.2% and 3.1% respectively. Annual HICP inflation had risen

by 0.2 percentage points, to 1.6%, in February.

**VI** **Reports by the Bank’s Agents**

A47 The Bank’s regional Agents reported that the outbreak of war had exacerbated a weakening in

corporate confidence. Contacts had reported lower business expenditure on services, including

advertising, consultancy and business relocation services, and lead times had shortened as customers

had deferred decisions. Many professional firms, including recruitment and property consultants, had


-----

A48 Demand for international air travel had fallen sharply on the outbreak of war. Airline contacts

had reported that passengers had begun to make reservations very close to the time of travel. Overseas

holiday bookings had been weak in previous months and bookings had fallen further since the war had

started.

A49 Weaker consumer confidence had been reflected in lower growth in retail sales in all regions.

New car sales had also slowed, despite increased use of incentives to boost sales when the new

registration plates had come out. Consumer services activity had been more positive, although

contacts had reported that discretionary spending in bars and restaurants had been cut back. Concerns

over foreign travel had been expected to boost domestic tourism, but some companies would be

adversely affected by the expected continued low number of visitors from North America.

A50 Average increases in house prices had slowed across most regions. More properties had been on

the market and they had been taking longer to sell. House builders had continued to report that the

volume of output had remained constrained by shortages of land with planning permission. But there

had also been reports of a lower number of site visits since the start of 2003.

A51 Contacts had reported that the forthcoming increase in employee National Insurance

contributions had not generally been an issue in pay negotiations. The increase in employer

contributions had been viewed by many in the same way as any other additional costs. Pensions had

remained a more serious issue for many companies.

**VII** **Market intelligence**

A52 Changes in asset prices, interest rates and major exchange rates had been closely correlated

across markets and countries during the period: market contacts had suggested that the prospect, and

subsequently the progress, of the war in Iraq had been the main determining factor. Rapid unwinding

of risk positions may have contributed to the sharpness of some of those moves.

A53 On 9 April, interest rates implied by short sterling futures contracts had been significantly higher

than on 5 March. The rate implied by the June 2003 contract had been 12 basis points higher at


-----

developments had been the main influence on interest rate expectations, although UK implied rates

had risen by more than international implied rates following the publication of the minutes of the

March MPC meeting. Market participants had generally expected the Committee not to change the

Bank’s official repo rate at its April meeting. Economists polled by Reuters between 1 and 3 April had

attached a mean probability of 62% to no change in the Bank’s repo rate at the April meeting, and a

mean probability of 36% to a decrease of 25 basis points. The mean expectation for the level of the

repo rate at end-2003 had fallen by 19 basis points since the previous poll, to 3.55%.

A54 Between 5 March and 9 April, sterling’s effective exchange rate had fallen by 0.7%, reflecting

depreciations of 2.9% against the dollar and 0.3% against the euro. Market participants had suggested

a number of UK-specific factors that may have weakened sterling independently during the period:

UK participation in the Iraq war; reported comments by MPC members about the UK conjuncture and

the exchange rate; and a perceived weakening of consumption growth.
