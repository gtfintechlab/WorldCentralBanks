##### These are the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting held on 6 and 7 June 2000.

 They are also available on the Internet

(http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/mpc/mpc0006.pdf).

##### The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The Committee meets on a regular monthly basis and minutes of its meetings are released on the Wednesday of the second week after the meeting takes place. Accordingly, the minutes of the Committee meeting held on 5 and 6 July will be published on 19 July 2000.

#### MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE HELD ON 6-7 JUNE 2000

1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed the world economic

outlook; exchange rates; money and asset prices; demand and output; the labour market; prices

and costs; tactical considerations; and the overall conjuncture. The Committee had also received a

[letter from the Chancellor (attached as an annex) setting out the inflation target at which the](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press/2000/p69_00.htm)

Committee should aim in accordance with section 12 of the Bank of England Act 1998.

**The world economy**

2 The latest estimates of growth in the euro area had been broadly in line with the Committee’s

forecast. In the United States, there had been a rise in consumer confidence in May. Non-farm

payrolls had risen in May, although this may be a temporary effect because the rise was entirely

accounted for by an increase in the number of those working on the national census. The

unemployment rate had risen by 0.2 percentage points in May. There had also been a rise in equity

prices over the past month. But the purchasing managers’ index in April and the latest data on retail

sales seemed to be a little weaker. Developments on prices and costs appeared more benign than in

recent months. The reaction of some analysts, and in press reports, to the latest US data seemed quite

marked and was perhaps a little surprising in the light of these mixed indicators. Commentators no

longer expected a sharp rise in interest rates – and this could explain why equity prices had risen.

But the latest indicators might be interpreted as suggesting that the US economy was returning to the

previous pattern of strong demand growth and benign price pressures. The imbalances in the US

economy – for example between domestic demand and net trade – remained, and so the question was

still whether the economy would experience a ‘soft’ or ‘hard’ landing.

3 Since the previous meeting, the OECD had published its latest forecasts. These projections were

for slightly stronger growth overall in the G7 compared with the December projections. The broad

picture was for stronger growth in 2000 and slightly weaker growth in 2001 than the Committee had

assumed in producing the May Inflation Report projections. But these differences were not

particularly large. However, the latest OECD projections of slower growth in 2001 than in 2000 did


-----

highlight the broader question of whether 2000 would prove to be the peak in world growth during

the current cycle. Over the past six months there had been significant monetary policy tightening in a

number of countries, and that might support a view that world growth would slow. Looking at

financial market conditions more generally, there had been a rise in shorter-dated bond yields in

many of the major industrial countries, although not the US, and equity prices had fallen somewhat

since the peaks reached in the first quarter. Of course, it was possible that a rise in bond yields

reflected market expectations of higher inflation, rather than a view that monetary authorities would

tighten real interest rates more than previously thought. There were also signs that growth was

slowing in various countries in Asia, and any further tightening by the US Federal Reserve was likely

to have some effect on many developing economies, especially in Latin America.

4 The oil price had risen over the past month, but this did not seem primarily to reflect a stronger

world demand picture. The Committee noted that there was an OPEC meeting towards the end of

June. The rise in oil prices would put some upward pressure on UK inflation in the near term,

relative to what had been assumed in preparing the May Inflation Report projections.

**The exchange rate**

5 The sterling effective exchange rate had fallen by around 5% compared with the profile assumed

in the May Inflation Report, which used a 15 day average as its starting point. Since the time of the

May meeting, there had been a larger fall of more than 7½%, reversing the rise in sterling over the

previous six months. Apart from the period when sterling left the Exchange Rate Mechanism in

1992, it was the largest one-month change in the ERI since 1986. It was noted that the risks of a

large or rapid depreciation in the exchange rate had been explicitly recognised, but not been built into

the May fan chart projections.

6 Staff analysis suggested that the size of the depreciation over the month could not be accounted

for by a change in interest rate differentials. The markets now expected no change in UK interest

rates this month and there remained some expectation of interest rate increases in the euro area and in

the United States. Looking along the yield curve as a whole however suggested that there was little

monetary news over the month. It was possible that the decision not to raise interest rates in May

would have lowered short-run interest rate expectations, but that this might have been masked

because the large fall in sterling led to expectations of higher interest rates further out. Large


-----

transactions related to mergers and acquisitions could have pushed sterling down at least temporarily

on the day of the MPC decision, and the no change decision might have triggered further

momentum-based sales, which might account for the size of the depreciation.

7 The Committee agreed that there could be no mechanical link between changes in the exchange

rate and the decision on interest rates. The exchange rate change had to be taken into account,

however, when assessing the prospects for inflation. Calibrating the magnitude of what appeared to

be a real exchange rate depreciation on inflation over the next two years was difficult, just as it had

been difficult to calibrate the effects of sterling’s earlier appreciation. To the extent that the earlier

rise in the exchange rate had not yet fed through to domestic prices, the recent fall might likewise

have correspondingly less effect on prices.

8 In its May projections the Committee had taken into account the rise in the exchange rate and had

assumed that the pass-through to retail prices would be somewhat slower than its historical average –

although the eventual effect on the price level would be the same. There was great uncertainty about

this, but applying the same procedure to the recent fall would on the face of it imply a rise in the

inflation projection two years ahead on account of the exchange rate shift – of around half of a

percentage point compared with the May Report projections. If the comparison was with the level of

the exchange rate immediately prior to the Committee’s May meeting rather than the 15 day average

used in the forecast then the impact on future inflation would be correspondingly larger. However,

these estimates were extremely sensitive to the assumptions made and it was possible that the effect

on inflation would be smaller or larger than this. In particular it was suggested that, given the

depreciation, the Committee might review the assumptions earlier made on overseas exporters’

margins to the UK, and on retail margins in the UK. Some members thought that the recent

depreciation was likely to have a smaller effect on prospective inflation, since overseas producers’

margins to the UK might fall back faster than had previously been assumed. These issues would be

reviewed in the August Inflation Report round.

**Money and asset prices**

9 Both the Halifax and Nationwide measures of house prices had fallen by 0.4% in May, and

suggested that house price inflation was slowing at least as rapidly as had been assumed in the

_Inflation Report projections. This reduced the risk that domestic demand would grow faster than had_


-----

been built into the central projection. The latest provisional Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors’

(RICS) survey pointed to a further reduction in the balance of estate agents reporting price increases

in May, although the balance remained strongly positive. The recent pattern of slower growth in

southern regions relative to the north had continued, in contrast with the picture a few months ago.

10 The mortgage approvals data had weakened in April. However, the figures might be affected by

the number of working days in April and, therefore, the fall might be reversed in May, just as the

weakness in December had been reversed in January. The House Builders’ Federation survey of site

visits and reservations still pointed to a slight fall in particulars delivered later in the year. The

provisional estimate of mortgage equity withdrawal for Q1 was weaker than in Q4, and was

consistent with some slowdown in consumption growth.

11 Corporate borrowing growth had again been strong, but it was unclear quite why this was so.

One possibility was that it reflected a shift between sources of financing, away from bonds and

equities towards bank lending. Another possibility was that the higher borrowing could also reflect a

squeeze on profits and hence a tighter liquidity position. Profits had fallen in the first quarter

according to the preliminary estimate by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). A fall in final

demand, and hence company income, could be consistent with a rise in stocks – but the relationship

between the stock-output ratio and corporate borrowing had not been particularly close over recent

quarters. In addition, the recent special survey by the Bank’s regional Agents had found little

evidence of higher borrowing because of worse cash flow. A third possibility was that higher

borrowing was being used to finance current or prospective investment. Although total investment

had been a little weaker than expected in Q1, business investment had grown quite strongly.

**Demand and output**

12 Final domestic demand in Q1 had been weaker than expected at the time of the Report. The

annualised six month growth rate was now running at around 3½% compared with about 4½% at the

same time last year – a significant slowdown but still robust. The weakness was broadly based

across consumption, investment and government spending. The key question was how persistent the

slowdown in the Q1 figures would prove to be.


-----

13 In the case of consumption, the Q1 figures looked a little low in the light of the retail sales data

and other indicators, although the continuing weakness of car registrations through Q1 might explain

part of the difference between retail sales and total consumption growth. At some point household

spending on vehicles would recover, and hence the current growth rate might be erratically low.

More recently, retail sales had been weak in April. But the latest CBI distributive trades survey and

evidence from the British Retail Consortium suggested that retail sales in May would be stronger.

The Bank’s regional Agents’ contacts reported early signs of an easing in retail sales growth while

consumer services growth remained strong. Both the GfK and MORI consumer confidence

indicators had risen slightly – though they were not far from their long run averages once seasonal

factors were taken into account. Although slower house price growth and recent movements in

equity prices suggested a prospective weaker contribution from household wealth to consumption

growth than had been the case over the past few years, this had already been incorporated into the

Committee’s projections. Real earnings growth continued to support consumption growth.

14 On government spending, some weakness in the first quarter had been expected in the light of

recent monthly data, and a return to positive growth would be needed if Government spending plans

were to be met. There had, more generally, been some recent revisions to the fiscal numbers, with

spending having undershot and revenue having overshot the projections made in the March Budget.

More revisions to the estimates of real and nominal government spending were possible when the

National Accounts are published on 29 June. The revised data and any possible implications for

future government spending and revenue projections would need to be incorporated into the August

_Inflation Report forecast._

15 Inventories had made a much stronger than expected contribution to GDP growth in Q1, and this

had been broadly spread across the manufacturing, wholesale and distribution sectors. It could

reflect weaker-than-expected demand and indicate weaker output growth ahead, but it was too early

to say. There were no signs of widespread stockbuilding from either the Agents’ contacts or surveys.

No details of the alignment adjustments had yet been published by the ONS, but it was possible that

these adjustments, or other temporary factors, were contributing to a stronger contribution from

inventories in Q1. If so, the positive contribution might well be reversed in Q2, with little

consequence for output growth in the first half of the year as a whole.


-----

16 The positive contribution from net trade to GDP growth was only slightly weaker than expected

in Q1, although both export and import volumes had been stronger than expected. There seemed to

be little news on the month and the puzzle remained of why net trade was so strong given the

previous strength of sterling. The quarterly figures were nonetheless volatile from quarter to quarter,

so that caution was needed in placing weight on the Q1 figures.

17 The picture for GDP growth was further complicated by the weakness of energy output in the

first quarter, which may have reflected the weather. This suggested that the underlying pace of

output growth was stronger than recorded in headline GDP growth. The industrial production

numbers for April showed manufacturing moving broadly in line with expectations, but there had

been a sharp rise in energy output. That seemed consistent with stronger Q2 GDP growth, all other

things being equal.

18 There were significant discrepancies between the estimated Q1 growth rates of the output,

income and expenditure measures of GDP, which were difficult to reconcile. The release of the

National Accounts for Q1 and the annual rebalancing exercise for the ONS Blue Book might help

resolve this.

19 Overall, the pace of final domestic demand had slowed more than expected in Q1, but it was too

early to judge whether this would be sustained into Q2.

**The labour market**

20 There had been a slight moderation in employment growth, and it seemed likely that average

hours worked had fallen in the first quarter. But other data pointed to a slight tightening in labour

market conditions. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation survey had shown an

intensification of labour market shortages. While the Labour Force Survey measure of

unemployment had been unchanged, there had been a further fall in the claimant count measure.

21 There had been a slight pick up in pay settlements, with the three-month mean measure rising to

3.0% in April. The twelve-month mean measure had, however, continued to fall and was now at

3.2%. Average earnings growth had fallen back to 5.8% in March on the headline measure, and was

below the figure for Q1 in the May Inflation Report central projection. If the fall persisted it might


-----

imply a slightly lower profile for earnings growth and hence a slightly lower central projection for

inflation over the next two years. At the least, it appeared that the upside risks to the May projection

had diminished. However, taken at face value, the latest hours data implied that hourly earnings were

rising even more rapidly in Q1, by around 7¼% at an annual rate, although it was recognised that this

calculation was particularly subject to considerable measurement error.

22 Productivity growth had been rising, and the annual rate of growth of output per head had

probably risen to around 1¾% in Q1, while the estimate of growth in productivity per hour was

around 3%. This month’s special survey by the Bank’s regional Agents suggested that many

companies planned to purchase and sell on the internet over the next few years, and this might

support future productivity growth.

23 The real product wage (on the basis of the GDP deflator) was growing at around 2½% and was

currently above estimates of average historical productivity growth. Whole economy unit labour

costs had been rising by around 4% per annum, and were rising in real terms. This entailed a

continuing squeeze on the profit share of GDP over recent years, which was unsustainable in the long

run. On these measures the labour market continued to look tight. One way in which the tension

could be resolved would be a continued fall in earnings growth.

**Prices and costs**

24 RPIX inflation had fallen to 1.9%, consistent with the central projection in the May Inflation

_Report. The gap between goods and services inflation had narrowed, primarily due to the reductions_

in utility prices and the timing of duty increases on goods. The latest Bank estimates suggested that

there had been a further squeeze on both manufacturing and retail margins. That was supported by

the Bank’s regional Agents’ contacts reporting that they were still having difficulty passing through

rises in input costs to their output prices. In the case of manufacturing, in particular, the squeeze on

margins was reported as having increased the pressures on firms to raise productivity growth over

recent quarters.

25 The short-term outlook was for rather higher RPIX inflation than at the time of the Inflation

_Report. This was partly on account of the rise in the oil price, but this had no obvious implications_

for the medium term projections. But the main news on the month had been the sharp fall in the


-----

exchange rate, which would tend to push inflation back up towards the 2½% target faster than had

been expected in May.

26 The British Retail Consortium’s shop price index showed retail prices falling 1.2% in the year to

May. The CBI Distributive Trades survey quarterly questions on reported and expected movements

in retail prices also showed a marked decline in the balances between February and May, and the

level of the balances was now at a record low. However, these indicators primarily related to retail

goods price inflation, which continued to be much weaker than that for services. The latest Chartered

Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) services survey indicated a sharp rise in the price index in

May. But since the CIPS services survey primarily reflected business-to-business transactions, such

strength might take some time to feed through to retail prices.

**Tactical considerations**

27 There was little expectation in financial markets that the Committee would raise interest rates this

month, although there was still an expectation of higher rates in the future. So a decision to raise

interest rates this month would come as a surprise to the markets and might change expectations. In

such circumstances it would be necessary to consider possible effects on the exchange rate and hence

the likely consequences for inflation in the medium term.

28 Previously when the markets had been surprised by a change in interest rates, there had

sometimes been a marked change in the exchange rate in the weeks that followed. This might

suggest that the exchange rate would appreciate significantly even in response to a 25 basis point rise

in interest rates this month. But, in these past examples, it was difficult to isolate the effects of the

interest rate decision from the flow of other news affecting market perceptions. It also mattered what

market expectations were concerning the decisions at the next ECB and FOMC meetings. If one, or

both, surprised the market by raising interest rates more than expected, and UK interest rates were

not changed this month, then sterling might depreciate further.

**The overall conjuncture**

29 An important question was how far the evidence over the month suggested that a rebalancing of

the economy was in prospect. There were signs of slowing domestic demand and stronger net trade


-----

in the first quarter. There was also the prospect of somewhat stronger net trade in the future given

the depreciation of sterling over the past month. So the depreciation of sterling from an

unsustainable level was welcome. The important issue for the Committee was what this past and

prospective rebalancing of the economy implied for inflation over the next two years or so. How

large an effect on inflation would be caused by the exchange rate depreciation? This was especially

difficult to know given the uncertainty in gauging pressures on profit margins. Were the signs of

slower domestic demand and lower earnings growth sufficient to indicate that domestic inflationary

pressures were weaker than previously thought?

30 The effects of real exchange rate changes would typically first be seen on prices and only later on

net trade. A weakening in domestic demand would take some time to feed through to lower inflation.

So, taken at face value, the recent rebalancing might, other things being equal, raise the prospect of

inflation moving closer to target over the next few quarters, assuming the fall in sterling was

sustained. Further out, the effects on inflation of the exchange rate depreciation and a possible

weakening of domestic demand would need to be carefully weighed.

31 Other indicators, such as the gap between service sector and industrial production growth in the

first quarter, suggested that the economy was far from being in balance. Indeed, the sterling ERI had

only fallen back to its November 1999 level. There was also uncertainty about whether sterling had

truly decoupled from the dollar and hence was being influenced by domestic factors, and therefore

about how far it would move if the dollar/euro exchange rate changed significantly. The evidence

from options markets suggested that the implied correlation between the dollar and sterling was

expected to be stronger twelve months ahead than one month ahead, suggesting that the markets

anticipated a degree of recoupling.

**The immediate policy decision**

32 One view was that interest rates should be maintained at 6% this month. The most significant

development over the month had been the fall in sterling. Treating the recent exchange rate

depreciation in the same way as the previous appreciation suggested that inflation would be higher

than projected in May. However, in the view of some, not all of the fall in sterling should be treated

as an exogenous fall in the real exchange rate, and some of the depreciation might be attributed to

changes in the market’s expectation of future UK inflation. The overall effect of the exchange rate


-----

depreciation on inflation was highly uncertain, especially if overseas exporters’ margins to the UK

fell more sharply than previously expected and if retail margins were squeezed further. Raising

interest rates this month might push sterling up again and exacerbate the undershoot of inflation

against the target in the near-term, while simultaneously aggravating the potential size of the

inflationary shock further out as sterling would fall from a more elevated level.

33 Some of the other indicators suggested that domestic inflationary pressures might be showing

signs of easing more than expected. For example, final domestic demand growth had been weaker

than previously expected in Q1. Retail sales had also been weak in April, although indicators pointed

to a resumption in growth in May. The housing market seemed to have slowed, which appeared

consistent with slowing consumption growth. The release of the National Accounts data for Q1 on

29 June might help clarify the extent of the slowdown. Earnings growth had so far turned out weaker

than in the central projection – although other indicators suggested that the labour market remained

tight. While the depreciation would, other things being equal, lead to higher inflation looking further

out, inflation was still below target and likely to be so for some time. There was no need for a rise in

interest rates this month, and for some members no presumption that a further rise would be needed.

The depreciation of sterling would help bring about a rebalancing of the economy, and that was

welcome even if it meant that at some point higher interest rates were needed. Even those members

who thought that a further rise in interest rates might eventually be necessary noted that the costs

associated with waiting were low in comparison to the costs that would be incurred by moving now

and potentially exacerbating sterling’s overvaluation.

34 The alternative view was that, on balance, the data this month required a rise in interest rates of

25 basis points. The effect of the depreciation of the exchange rate on prospective inflation was

significant and was not offset by the other news. The slowdown in final domestic demand in the first

quarter was probably partly erratic and should not significantly change the outlook, although the

upside risks seemed to have diminished since the May Report. The bounce-back in industrial

production at the start of Q2 was consistent with a recovery in demand and output growth in Q2. The

latest evidence was still consistent with consumption growing close to trend, as projected in May.

The labour market was tight on most measures. It was not sensible to place too much weight on the

fall in earnings growth in March and there was still a risk that earnings could turn out stronger than

the deceleration in the May central projection. Given the recent depreciation of sterling, the

downward pressure on retail prices from the past appreciation of sterling would cease. Although


-----

measures of domestically generated inflation had fallen they remained above the 2 ½% target, so that

a slowdown in private sector domestic demand growth was still required. Against this background,

the data pointed to higher inflation than thought a month ago. Were there, nevertheless, reasons for

waiting? The exchange rate depreciation could reverse; there was a risk that a rise in interest rates

would be misinterpreted as being linked to the exchange rate depreciation in a mechanical way; a

rise in rates might lead to an appreciation of sterling if it surprised the markets; and some of the

demand and output puzzles might get resolved through the release of the Blue Book data. While

these outcomes were all possible, none seemed sufficiently compelling to delay action warranted by

the data. For these reasons a rise in interest rates of 25 basis points was desirable this month.

35 The Governor invited members to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be maintained

at 6.0%. Six members of the Committee (the Governor, David Clementi, Christopher Allsopp,

DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and Sushil Wadhwani) voted for the proposition. Mervyn King,

Stephen Nickell and John Vickers voted against, preferring a rise in rates of 25 basis points.

**ANNEX: SUMMARY OF DATA PRESENTED BY BANK STAFF**

A1 This annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy

Committee on 1 June in advance of its meeting on 6-7 June 2000. Bank staff also briefed the

Committee on the latest outside forecasts available as of 1 June. At the start of the Committee

meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become

available, and that information is included in this Annex.

**I** **The international environment**

A2 US industrial production had grown strongly during April, and consumer confidence in

May had been strong. The National Association of Purchasing Managers’ (NAPM) index had

fallen in May, largely because of a sharp fall in the new orders component of the index from

56.3 to 51.1, though the production index had also fallen. The indices for inventories and

employment had risen slightly in the month. Retail sales had fallen slightly in April, the first

monthly fall since August 1998. The US trade deficit had widened further in March. Trade

volumes had risen strongly, with export growth slightly higher than import growth. The

unemployment rate in May had risen to 4.1%, from 3.9% in April. Non-farm payrolls had risen

by 231,000, although this had been boosted by an additional 357,000 workers recruited for the

Census. Unit labour costs had increased in the first quarter, partly due to a slowing in

productivity growth.

A3 GDP in Germany and France had grown by 0.7% in Q1. In the euro area as a whole

both business and consumer confidence had remained at historically high levels. The euro-area

unemployment rate had fallen to 9.2% in April, its lowest rate since September 1992.

A4 In Japan, many estimates of GDP in Q1 had pointed towards strong growth, following

negative growth in Q3 and Q4 of 1999. In April, industrial production had risen by 7.8% on a

year earlier. A sharp fall in public construction orders during April had indicated that the fiscal

package may have been front-loaded into Q1. Nominal retail sales had declined in the year to

April. The trade surplus had widened in April. Exports had risen slightly faster than imports,


-----

driven by strong demand in Asia and the United States. On an unadjusted basis, nominal wages

had increased in the year to April by 1.4%. The unemployment rate had fallen to 4.8% in April,

but inactivity had risen as employment fell.

A5 Oil prices had risen during the month, with Brent crude oil trading within a $25-$30

range. Prices for non-oil commodities had also risen in the month.

A6 In the United States, the CPI price index had remained unchanged on the month in April

although the annual rate of CPI inflation had fallen from 3.7% to 3.0%, mainly reflecting a fall

in energy prices. Core CPI inflation (which excludes food and energy) had fallen to 2.2%,

while headline producer price inflation had fallen to 3.9%. The level of average hourly earnings

had increased by 0.1% in May, following a 0.4% increase in April. Euro-area headline inflation

had fallen to 1.9%, although core inflation (which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco)

had risen slightly. Euro-area headline producer price inflation had risen to 6.2% in March. In

April, Japanese consumer price inflation fell to -0.8%.

A7 M3 in the euro area had remained buoyant in April, increasing by 6.5% on the year,

while credit to the private sector had increased by 11.4%. The three-month moving average of

M3 growth had reached its highest rate since the introduction of the euro. Japanese M2

including CDs had increased by 2.9% in the year to April, a pick-up from March, partly due to a

slight reversal in the decline of bank lending.

A8 Since 3 May, the euro and yen effective exchange rate indices had appreciated by around

6% and 1% respectively, while the dollar effective exchange rate index had depreciated by

around 3%. Over the same period the Wilshire 5000 index – a broad measure of the US stock

market – had increased by just under 3% and the NASDAQ index, which has a higher

proportion of technology stocks, ended the month close to its value on 3 May. In Japan the

Topix index had fallen by over 6%. Interest rates implied by futures contracts had fallen on the

month in the United States. In the euro area, there had been little change in rates implied by

futures contracts maturing this year.


-----

**II** **Monetary and financial conditions**

A9 The twelve-month growth rate of notes and coin had continued to fall slightly from 8.2%

in April to 7.9% in May. This figure was just below the underlying 8%-9% range that had been

observed over recent months.

A10 M4 had risen by £5.1 billion (0.6%) in April, compared with £13.8 billion (1.7%) in

March, remaining strong despite the unwinding of large repo transactions that took place in

March. The increase had been driven by continued growth in M4 excluding Other Financial

Corporations (OFCs). Aggregate M4 lending (excluding the effects of securitisations) had also

been strong in April, rising by £6.7 billion (0.7%), despite the unwinding of March reverse

repos.

A11 The gap between M4 lending and M4 had continued to rise in April and was close to

historical highs at just under 6% of GDP. The main factor financing this rising gap had been net

inflows from overseas residents.

A12 Household M4 lending (excluding the effects of securitisations) increased by

£4.2 billion (0.7%) in April, compared with an average monthly increase of £4.8 billion in 2000

Q1. Both loan approvals and net secured lending to individuals had declined markedly in April.

A13 Provisional estimates by Bank staff had suggested that mortgage equity withdrawal in

2000 Q1 was down slightly from the estimates for the previous few quarters. Total lending for

consumption (mortgage equity withdrawal plus unsecured lending) was also estimated to have

fallen.

A14 Net new bank borrowing (bank borrowing minus bank deposits) by PNFCs (private

non-financial corporations) had been negligible in April, although there had been significant

increases in both deposits and borrowing. A broader measure of PNFCs’ external borrowing

(including capital issues and foreign currency borrowing) had increased further in April

following the strong borrowing in 2000 Q1.

A15 Since the previous MPC meeting, short interest rate expectations, as measured by the

two-week gilt repo curve, had fallen slightly at the very short end. Longer nominal interest


-----

rates had remained broadly unchanged. Corporate bond spreads had continued to widen this

month, with corporate bond yields up at all maturities.

A16 There had been little change in short or medium-term inflation expectations. Fixed

end-point surveys of expected inflation for 2000-04 had remained slightly below the inflation

target.

A17 The FTSE All-Share index had risen by 5.4% since the previous MPC meeting. The rise

on the month had been mainly attributable to the non-cyclical services, resources and financials

sectors. Despite declining significantly since the beginning of the year, the FTSE IT sectoral

index had outperformed the All-Share over the previous twelve months.

A18 Since the previous MPC meeting, sterling had depreciated by 9.3% against the euro and

by 2.5% against the dollar. The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) had fallen by 7.7%.

The recent declines in the sterling-euro and sterling-dollar exchange rates could not be

accounted for by changes in interest rate differentials over the month.

**III** **Demand and output**

A19 GDP growth in Q1 had been revised up to 0.5% (from 0.4%). The annual growth rate

had risen to 3.1%, the fastest rate since 1997 Q4. Total industrial production had fallen by 0.8%

in 2000 Q1, with manufacturing output down by 0.5%. Service sector output had risen by 0.8%

and construction output by 0.5%. Agricultural output growth had fallen by 1.1%.

A20 The expenditure breakdown showed that domestic demand had risen by 0.4% in Q1.

Final domestic demand had risen by 0.3%.

A21 There had been an unusually large discrepancy in Q1 between the growth of GDP as

measured by expenditure compared with the average measure, with the expenditure measure

stronger.

A22 Private consumption (including that of non-profit institutions serving households) had

grown by 0.6% in Q1 and had increased by 3.2% in the year to 2000 Q1. Government


-----

consumption had fallen by 0.4% in Q1. Total investment (including acquisitions less disposals

of valuables) had decreased by 0.1%. Business investment had increased by 1.9%. Within this,

manufacturing investment had increased by 4.9% in Q1, while private service sector investment

had risen by 2.7%. By implication the government and private sector dwellings components of

investment had been weak. The gross operating surplus of corporations had decreased by 1.8%.

A23 Inventories had made a small positive contribution to GDP growth in 2000 Q1.

Including the alignment adjustment, inventories had risen by £0.6 billion. Most sectors had

experienced an increase in their inventories. The CBI Monthly Trends survey in May had

reported that manufacturers still perceived their stocks to be more than adequate, though their

balance was below the long-run average.

A24 Net trade had contributed 0.3% to GDP growth in 2000 Q1. Total exports of goods and

services had increased by 3.2%, and imports had increased by 2.0% in Q1. Exports of goods

had risen by 2.3% in March, and imports were also 2.3% higher. Goods exports to and imports

from non-EU countries had both risen by around 3% in April.

A25 Turning to indicators of Q2 activity, manufacturing output had fallen by 0.2% in April.

But total industrial production had risen by 0.8%, reflecting a large rise in energy sector output.

Retail sales volumes had fallen by 0.3% in April but had risen by 4.5% on a year earlier in the

three months to April. The CBI Distributive Trades survey had shown a total balance of +45

retailing respondents reporting higher sales in April compared with a year ago and further

growth was expected in May. The British Retail Consortium survey had reported an increase in

May. The MORI measure of consumer confidence had risen to -11 in May while the GfK

confidence index had increased to +2.7 from -3.8 in April. Private new car registrations in the

three months to April had fallen by 3.5% on a year earlier, while total new registrations had

increased by 1.1%.

A26 The housing market indicators had shown signs of a slowdown. Both the Halifax and

Nationwide Prices indices had fallen by 0.4% in May. Annual rates, though still high, had

fallen, as had three-month rates. The Nationwide three-month rate had only fallen a little and

remained high at 5.0%, but the Halifax three-month rate had fallen sharply to zero. A preview

of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) survey of estate agents for May had shown


-----

a fall in the balance reporting house price rises. The balance in April had fallen to 37 from 60 in

March. The House Builders’ Federation (HBF) survey balance for house price inflation had

shown a fall to 33 in April from 52 in March. Particulars delivered had fallen by 8.7% in April

and were 3.3% on a year earlier. HBF site visits and reservations had fallen in April. Private

housing starts had risen by 5.3% in March, but completions had fallen by 1.4%.

A27 The public sector net cash requirement had been -£6.7 billion in April (a surplus). Net

investment and net borrowing had been revised down by £2.2 billion for 1999/00.

A28 The manufacturing output expectations balance in the CBI Monthly Trends survey had

decreased to -6 in May from +1 in April. The total orders balance had increased to -10 in May

but the export orders balance had decreased to -35.

A29 The headline index of Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS)

manufacturing survey output had been 50.9 in May. The growth in new orders had slowed to

51. The DHL survey had eased to +34 in May from +38 in February. The headline CIPS

services survey balance had been +59.2 in May. The CIPS construction index had risen to 62.2

in May.

**IV** **Labour market**

A30 Employment had continued to grow steadily. Labour Force Survey (LFS) employment

had increased by 55,000 (0.2%) in 2000 Q1 compared with 1999 Q4. The increase had been

accounted for by higher part-time employment, which had risen by 54,000. So employment

growth had been lower in full-time equivalent terms. The working-age employment rate had

risen by 0.1 percentage points to 74.4%.

A31 Hours worked by full-timers had fallen steeply in Q1 (by 1.1%), though those of

part-time workers were broadly unchanged. Average hours worked had fallen by 1.0%. Total

hours worked had fallen by 0.8%, despite the increase in the headcount, and were 0.3% lower

than in the same period a year earlier.


-----

A32 The CIPS surveys in May had indicated continued strong employment growth in both

services and construction, and a slower decline in manufacturing employment. The

Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) survey had indicated that shortages of both

temporary and permanent agency staff had intensified in May. According to the Bank’s

regional Agents skill shortages remained a concern, especially in the Greater London area.

A33 Unemployment had fallen on both the ILO and claimant count measures. LFS

unemployment had fallen by 20,000 in Q1, with the rate down 0.1 percentage points to 5.8%.

Claimant count unemployment had fallen by 28,800 in April, lowering the rate to 3.9%. The

fall in ILO unemployment had been more than accounted for by lower long-term

unemployment: short-term unemployment had risen by 17,000.

A34 Inactivity had been broadly flat, rising by only 1,000 in Q1 compared with the previous

three months. An increase of 24,000 in male inactivity had offset a fall of 23,000 in female

inactivity. Female working-age inactivity had fallen steadily since 1995, while male inactivity

had been broadly stable for the previous two years.

A35 Annual manufacturing productivity growth had slowed to 3.8% in March. Unit wage

costs in manufacturing had started to increase again. Annual growth in whole-economy

productivity and unit wage costs in 2000 Q1 was estimated, using LFS data, to be 1.7% and

4.0% respectively.

A36 Earnings growth as measured by the average earnings index (AEI) had fallen back

slightly. Whole-economy headline earnings growth (three-month average of annual growth

rates) had fallen by 0.2 percentage points in March to 5.8%. The private sector accounted for

all of this decrease (down 0.3 percentage points to 6.2%). Headline earnings growth had fallen

in both private services and manufacturing, to 6.6% and 4.9% respectively. Headline public

sector earnings growth had been unchanged at 4.2%.

A37 Annual earnings growth had edged down by 0.1 percentage points to 5.4% in March.

This was accounted for entirely by public sector earnings growth, which had returned to

pre change in millennium rates. Growth excluding bonuses (not seasonally adjusted) was 4.7%,

down from 5.1% in February, with a bonus contribution of 0.9 percentage points. The Bank’s


-----

estimate of annual growth in earnings per hour had continued to rise in Q1 and was now above

7%. The widening gap with the headline earnings growth figure was accounted for by the fall

in average hours worked, which were 1.3% lower than the previous year.

A38 The REC survey had pointed to a slowdown in the rate of growth of permanent

placement salaries in May. Growth rates for temporary staff had picked up a little.

A39 Settlements had picked up but remained lower than a year ago. The Bank’s three-month

AEI-weighted whole-economy mean had risen by 0.2 percentage points to 3.0% in April,

reflecting a rise in private sector settlements. Settlements in Q1 had generally been lower than

during the same period last year: of the 56 settlements that could be matched, 18 had been

higher, 11 had been the same and 27 had been lower. The Bank’s twelve-month mean had

fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 3.1%. Public and private sector means were also 3.1%.

**V** **Prices**

A40 The Bank oil-inclusive commodity price index had fallen by 7.0% in April, the largest

fall since the start of the series in 1990, taking the annual inflation rate from 20.5% down to

8.9%. The large monthly decrease had reflected large falls in the prices of fuels and metals.

The fuels component of the index had fallen by 11.9% in April, largely accounted for by the fall

of around 15% in the oil price in April. Non-oil commodity prices had fallen by 3.1% in April,

and by 0.2% over the past year.

A41 Seasonally adjusted manufacturing input prices had fallen by 3.2% in April, taking the

annual inflation rate from 13.1% to 7.1%. The large monthly fall had mainly reflected the

decline in the price of crude oil in April. There had also been falls in the prices of metals and of

imported materials as a whole. The CIPS manufacturing survey input price index had fallen

significantly in May. Seasonally adjusted total output prices excluding excise duties (PPIY) had

fallen by 0.1% in April. The annual inflation rate had been 1.6%, slightly down from 1.8% in

March. As in previous months, petroleum product prices had risen, but this had been more than

offset by small falls in the prices of a large number of components. May’s CBI Industrial

Trends Survey output price balance had fallen significantly from -13 to -21. The Corporate

Services Price Index had risen by 0.7% in 2000 Q1 compared with a rise of 1.1% in 1999 Q4,

taking the annual inflation rate to 3.6%, slightly down from 3.9% in the previous quarter.


-----

A42 The prices of imported and exported goods had risen by 1.1% and 0.3% respectively in

the three months to March compared with the previous three months. Excluding oil, the price of

imported goods had risen by 0.5%, while the price of exported goods had fallen by 0.9% over

the same period.

A43 RPIX inflation had fallen to 1.9% in April, down from 2.0% in the previous month.

This had largely reflected lower petrol price inflation and cuts in utilities prices. RPI inflation

had risen from 2.6% to 3.0%, following the abolition of MIRAS in April. RPIY inflation had

fallen to 1.6% in April, while HICP (harmonised index of consumer prices) inflation had fallen

from 0.7% to 0.6%. The difference between RPIX and HICP inflation had remained constant at

1.3 percentage points.

A44 The British Retail Consortium (BRC) Shop Price Index had fallen by 0.2% in May,

taking the annual inflation rate to -1.2%, down from -0.7% in April. The CBI Distributive

Trades retailers' reported average selling price balance had fallen from -4 in February to -6 in

May, its lowest on record.

**VI** **Reports by the Bank’s Agents**

A45 The Bank’s regional Agents had reported that growth in manufacturing output and

orders, although still continuing, had slowed further. Service sector output growth had

remained strong, particularly in professional services, IT and telecommunications. Moderate

export growth was still being recorded. In contrast to recent official data, the Agents reported

that import growth had continued to strengthen. Construction activity remained strong,

although growth had eased slightly in recent months. Within the sector, demand for housing

and industrial property was reported to have eased. Agents had reported early signs of an easing

in annual retail sales growth, although the sector remained difficult to read in many regions.

Manufacturing investment intentions had weakened further, but those in the services sector had

remained strong.

A46 Downward pressure on manufacturers’ output prices and margins had continued,

particularly in export markets. But stronger pay pressures in some areas of the service sector


-----

had been passed through to prices. Retail goods prices were reported to have continued to fall

slightly. The Agents suggested that house price growth in the southern regions of the United

Kingdom had slowed markedly recently, although in other regions (where the pace of house

price growth had been relatively slower), growth remained stable. Contacts remained

concerned about skill shortages in the labour market, although the incidence of shortages had

remained broadly unchanged in recent months.

A47 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted a survey of UK firms regarding e-commerce.

More than 80% of firms reported that they already had a web site, and all others were planning

to develop one within two years. Most companies commented that their site was used as a

marketing tool and was not used to conduct sales. Only a small proportion of firms reported

that any of their input purchases were conducted via the Internet at the moment, but many

reported that they already used EDI (electronic data interchange) technology. Of existing

Internet sales, business-to-business (B2B) volumes were reported to vastly outweigh those of

business-to-consumer (B2C). Purchases and sales over the Internet were expected to increase

over the next two years, particularly in areas such as purchases of construction and

manufacturing materials and business travel. However many firms stated that transactions

would continue to take place in the conventional way.

**VII** **Market intelligence**

A48 Expectations of short-term UK interest rates in the rest of 2000 and for 2001, implied by

short sterling futures, had fallen by 5-13 basis points since the May MPC meeting and by 17-20

basis points for contracts maturing in 2002 and 2003. Weaker-than-expected domestic and

international data had contributed to the fall. The market consensus was for UK official rates to

be left unchanged in June. In reaching this view, most market participants had referred to the

weaker-than-expected average earnings and retail sales data for March and April respectively,

as well as survey evidence suggesting a slowdown in house price inflation. But the market

continued to expect at least one more 25 basis point rate rise, perhaps two, in 2000. The fall in

sterling, higher oil and commodity prices and the continued high level of average earnings

growth lay behind these expectations.


-----

A49 Sterling’s effective exchange rate had fallen by 7.7% since the previous MPC meeting,

to below its level at the start of the year. Sterling had depreciated against both the dollar and the

euro. Changes in UK interest rate expectations this month had not been significantly different

from those in the euro area and the United States, indicating that other factors lay behind the

sharp movement in sterling. Economic prospects in the United States and euro area had

remained strong, and the market may have regarded the level of sterling reached in early May as

an aberration. There were also shorter-term factors cited by market participants. First, merger

and acquisition flows had, on balance, been negative for sterling this month. Second, it

appeared that some overseas investors may have had overweight positions in sterling and

reduced them slightly. Third, technical and momentum traders may have accelerated the fall in

sterling once the change in direction of the currency was clear, having previously accelerated

the rise.
