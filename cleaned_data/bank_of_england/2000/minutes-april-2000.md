#### MINUTES OF MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING ON 5-6 APRIL 2000

1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed the Budget; money

and asset prices; demand and output; the labour market; prices and costs; the world economy; and

other considerations relevant to its decision.

**The Budget**

2 Prior to its previous meeting, the Committee had been briefed by Treasury officials on the broad

shape of the Budget’s macroeconomic projections and the prospects for the public finances. It had

agreed that more analysis would be needed once the full details of the Budget were known.

3 Since then the Budget had been finalised. The broad shape of the projections for the public

finances was unchanged from the Committee’s previous meeting. In 1999/2000 the net borrowing

figure was nearly 1% of GDP lower than assumed in the November Pre-Budget Report (PBR), with

the surplus now put at £11 billion as against £2 billion in November. The net borrowing figures in

the Budget for the following two years were also lower than in the PBR, although the difference

between the Budget and the PBR numbers was smaller than for 1999/2000. By the third year

(2002/2003) net borrowing was higher than in the PBR.

4 The figures for real government consumption and investment over the next two years were

higher in the Budget than the assumptions made in the February Inflation Report, but little different

from those in the November Inflation Report. This principally reflected the conventions employed in

the Committee’s forecasts, not announcements in the Budget. Between November and February the

government expenditure deflator had been revised up which, when projected forward, had implied

lower public spending in real terms given the government’s nominal spending plans. The higher

nominal profile for public spending in the Budget would need to be reflected in the May

_Inflation Report, but the February Inflation Report had, in effect, already incorporated much of the_

recorded increase in tax revenue in 1999/2000, and this had influenced the private sector

consumption and investment estimates for 1999/2000.


-----

5 There were, as always, uncertainties in the projections of future government revenue and

spending, and in assessing the effects of the Budget more generally. The sustained real growth in

public spending on goods and services meant that private spending would have to be constrained.

However, spending by departments might increase more slowly than projected, as it had done

recently, and tax revenues might continue to be above the levels projected by the Treasury,

particularly if their past buoyancy reflected structural rather than cyclical factors. But since the

reasons for higher tax revenues were not well understood, it was uncertain how far recent trends

could safely be extrapolated into the future. It was noted, though, that the Treasury’s Budget

projections were prepared using what seemed to be prudent assumptions. All in all, most members

of the Committee thought that the impact on future activity and inflation from the Budget seemed

unlikely to be large over the next two years.

6 The Committee then discussed the effect on the public finances of the spectrum auctions for the

Third Generation mobile telephone licences. While the auction receipts would boost the

government’s cash flow straightaway, the immediate impact on the Public Sector Net Borrowing

measure would be much less marked, since for these purposes the revenue would be accrued over the

life of the licences, ie until December 2021. On balance, even though the proceeds were likely to be

substantially higher than initially expected the macroeconomic effect should not be large, unless any

adjustment in taxes or government spending were brought forward rather than accrued over the life

of the licences. More immediately, if foreign bidders bought rather than borrowed sterling to pay for

the licences there could be a temporary effect on the exchange rate.

**Money and asset prices**

7 M0 and M4 lending were both increasing at 8%-9% a year, consistent with robust consumption

growth. Loan approvals for house purchase had bounced back strongly in February, suggesting that

the slowdown around the turn of the year had reflected seasonal effects. Competition in the

mortgage market remained intense. House price indicators in March were mixed, with the Halifax

index declining while the Nationwide index had risen strongly. Data on site visits and net

reservations from the House Builders’ Federation pointed to a possible easing in activity later in the

year, but it was too early to say whether house price increases would moderate to the extent projected

in the February Inflation Report.


-----

8 Monetary and financial data, together with recent surveys, suggested a rather stronger outlook

for business investment, with capital gearing (as measured by market values) falling as equity prices

rose. The financial deficit of the private non-financial corporate sector in 1999, however, was at its

highest as a percentage of GDP for almost ten years, although there was little sign that this was

holding back planned investment. Much of the deficit had been financed either by foreign currency

borrowing or by sterling capital market issuance. Corporate bond spreads over gilts remained wide,

perhaps reflecting relative supply, with heavy long-dated corporate bond issuance over the last year.

9 The Committee discussed the implications of the recent movements in global equity prices for

the economic outlook. While so-called ‘new economy’ shares had fallen significantly in price over

the month, with the NASDAQ index in the US down around 15%, this had not had a contagious

effect on other sectors, and ‘old economy’ share prices showed a significant rise over the same

period. In both cases these moves represented a reversal of the price changes seen earlier in the year,

and were not necessarily evidence of increased fragility in the market as a whole, although the extent

of recent volatility could alternatively be seen as a sign of a forthcoming downturn, particularly if it

should lead to an increase in the equity risk premium.

10 The weakness of the euro continued, although over the month as a whole sterling was little

changed despite intra-month volatility. While the decline in the euro might reflect the cyclical

strength of the US economy or pessimistic views on structural reform within the euro area, this had

not been mirrored in European equity markets, which had risen strongly over recent months. Nor did

such hypotheses do much to explain why the euro had fallen by more than 10% against the yen since

September.

**Demand and output**

11 The latest national accounts data for 1999 Q4 included upwards revisions to all of the major

components of final domestic demand, which was estimated to have risen by 1.3% in the quarter, and

by 4.4% on a year earlier. Stockbuilding was now thought to be lower than earlier estimated, while

the contribution of net trade to GDP growth in the quarter was unchanged, at -1.2 percentage points.

12 Industrial production had fallen in February for the third month in succession, although the size

of the fall, at -0.6%, had been affected by a sharp decline in energy production, reflecting relatively


-----

mild weather for the time of year. Manufacturing production had also fallen and was now below its

August level. When taken together with the net trade figures for Q4, this suggested that the

internationally exposed sectors were coming under renewed pressure, reflecting in part the effects of

sterling’s appreciation against the euro. The fall in output was quite broadly based, with chemicals

and engineering (which had contributed significantly to manufacturing output growth in 1999)

declining in February.

13 Survey data were not entirely in line with this picture. The purchasing managers’ index for

manufacturing, produced by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS), had risen

slightly in March, and had last been below the neutral level of 50 in April, nearly a year ago; the

output index was also higher, while new orders were little changed. In the Engineering Employers’

Federation survey, the output balance remained at +9 in Q1, with new orders again little changed.

Reports from the Bank’s regional Agents had suggested a resumption in manufacturing growth in

February. It was possible that in some sectors volumes were being maintained only through a further

reduction in margins, and that there would be limits on how much further that process could go.

14 While any slowdown in parts of manufacturing might feed through into the rest of the economy,

either directly or through its impact on consumer confidence, at present the services sector appeared

to be buoyant. The CIPS services index for business activity had risen to 59.6 in March, its highest

level since June 1997. The CIPS construction index also pointed to continuing growth in activity

and new orders.

15 The picture for retail sales was mixed. In February volumes had fallen back from their

unusually high January levels, but on a three-monthly basis growth was unchanged, at 1.8%. The

CBI Distributive Trades Survey had shown quite a marked slowdown in the growth of retail sales

volumes and orders placed in March, but expectations for April remained strong. The GfK consumer

confidence index was sharply down in March. The evidence suggested that while household

spending remained strong, it might no longer be accelerating, although real disposable incomes still

seemed to be growing rapidly. But a slowdown in consumption growth was built into the central

projection in the February Inflation Report, and it was too early to say whether this would

materialise.


-----

16 Taking all the evidence together, there was still a sharp contrast between the rapid growth in the

services sector, and the less robust performance of manufacturing. On balance it seemed likely that

growth in 2000 Q1 would be little different from the central projection in the February

_Inflation Report._

**Labour market**

17 Whole-economy productivity growth, defined by comparing GDP with the Workforce Jobs

measure of employment, had picked up to 1.8% in the year to 1999 Q4, and to 2.7% on an

annualised basis between 1999 Q2 and Q4. Figures based on the Labour Force Survey (LFS)

employment measure suggested slightly lower figures, at 1.6% and 2.1% respectively. This took

annual productivity growth back towards trend, but it was too early to say whether it represented

anything more than a normal cyclical response of productivity to a recovery in output growth.

18 The labour market remained tight, with employment growth on the LFS measure up 0.3% in the

three months to January. Unemployment had risen on the LFS (but not the claimant-count) measure,

reflecting – in an accounting sense – a fall in inactivity, with the LFS unemployment rate unchanged

for the past seven months. Survey data were consistent with this picture, and the Recruitment and

Employers’ Confederation (REC) survey showed a significant strengthening in the demand for staff,

in line with the reports of skills shortages from the Bank’s regional Agents. It was suggested that the

labour market measures in the Budget, when taken together with previously announced reforms,

might have a small positive effect on future labour supply.

19 Whole-economy average earnings growth, as measured by the headline rate, had risen to 5.9%

in the year to January. Much of the increase seemed to reflect bonus and other payments, in part

related to the new millennium. A survey by the Bank’s regional Agents suggested that further bonus

payments were due to be made in subsequent months, particularly in March, and that this might

further complicate the analysis of the data.

20 Some members of the Committee considered that the pricing response by firms to an increase in

earnings would depend on whether these took the form of higher settlements or faster ‘wage drift’,

(including bonuses and other payments that might be linked to productivity or profits), with some

evidence suggesting that ‘wage drift’ had a smaller effect on prices. Others believed that the effects


-----

of one-off increases in earnings would tend to feed through into final prices on a smoothed basis, and

it was quite unclear whether in the longer term prices reacted differently to increases in earnings

stemming from higher settlements, and those reflecting greater wage drift.

21 Data collected by the Bank suggested that on a matched sample basis, settlements in January

were if anything lower than a year previously. But the Bank’s regional Agents had noted that this

was not the case in services, and that pay pressures were building in some areas, with concern about

settlements later in the year both in services and some parts of manufacturing.

22 The Committee agreed that the labour market remained tight. While it would be wrong to react

to every fluctuation in the average earnings index, given the volatility of that series and the possible

distortions resulting from millennium-related factors, it was likely that the starting point for earnings

in the Committee’s May forecast would be above that in the February Inflation Report.

**Prices and costs**

23 In recent months retail prices had increased by slightly more than had been expected. Part of the

reason was the increase in oil prices, but now that OPEC had decided to increase production, and

aimed to stabilise oil prices at around $20-$25 per barrel, the upside risks to inflation from this

source had diminished. The oil price now was no higher than that incorporated into the February

_Inflation Report for Q1. How far earlier price increases had been passed through was difficult to_

determine, and it was possible that firms would base their pricing decisions on the new (lower) oil

price rather than passing on all of the earlier increases.

24 The CBI Monthly Industrial Trends Survey for March showed more respondents now expecting

a fall in manufacturing output prices, perhaps reflecting competitive pressures linked to the rise in

sterling against the euro. By contrast, higher oil prices had led to an increase in input prices reported

in the latest CIPS manufacturing survey. The Bank’s regional Agents reported that service price

inflation remained relatively high, but variable across sub-sectors.

**The world economy**

25 Prospects for world economic activity had strengthened further since the February

_Inflation Report, with output in the US accelerating in 1999 Q4 and activity indicators remaining_


-----

buoyant in the early part of 2000. The prospects for the euro area had improved, particularly in

Germany and France, while East Asia had recovered rapidly from its downturn, and there were also

some signs of a recovery in Japan. Official interest rates had risen in the previous month in most

OECD economies, and market rates suggested expectations of further increases in official rates later

in the year, for instance in the US and the euro area. The prospects for inflation in the global

economy would depend not only on the strength of demand growth and the reaction of monetary

policy, but also on the size and distribution of world productive capacity relative to demand.

26 The strength of the US economy, and uncertainty about the balance between domestic demand

and supply in that country, remained important factors in any assessment of the world economy. The

target Federal funds rate had been raised again in March, for the second time this year, and while

there had been considerable volatility in the various US equity price indices, on balance these were

now not much changed from their levels at the start of the year. To some members this suggested an

increased chance of a gradual slowdown in US growth closer to trend.

**Other considerations**

27 Although a majority of market participants did not expect the Committee to move rates this

month, an increase in the Bank’s repo rate during Q2 was widely forecast. The Committee had

agreed in March, when a change in the repo rate would have been more of a surprise, that this of

itself should not be a constraint on the Committee’s decision, and that remained the case. The

Committee also agreed that, while the May Inflation Report provided an opportunity to analyse the

latest developments in more detail, and to set out the reasons for any change in official rates at

greater length, that also did not preclude a change in rates this month.

28 The Committee discussed a suggestion that it should intervene in the foreign exchange markets.

The argument advanced in favour was that this could, if successful, not only be profitable but also

improve the balance in the economy between the internationally exposed sectors of the economy and

other sectors which were growing very rapidly, reducing the risk that the Committee would need to

adjust monetary policy sharply later. Some members were not at all attracted to this view, believing

that intervention would be unsuccessful and would cause confusion in the markets about the

Committee’s reaction function and its priorities. Some others thought that intervention in the foreign

exchange market was unlikely to be successful at present, though they did not wish to rule out the


-----

possibility in appropriate circumstances in the future. Sterling’s current strength in effective terms

reflected a more general weakness of the euro against most other major currencies, and there was

little evidence that the present level of sterling was seen as unsustainable or fragile by the market, at

least in the short term. On this view, intervention would be effective in current circumstances only if

it was accompanied by an easing of monetary policy, which would not be appropriate in the present

conjuncture, and to intervene ineffectively could be counterproductive.

**The immediate policy decision**

29 The Committee discussed the case for leaving rates unchanged, and for increasing the repo rate

by 25 basis points. For many members, the choice was finely balanced.

30 Final domestic demand was growing rapidly, although in Q4 this had been offset in part by a

large negative contribution from net trade. Some members thought that such an imbalance was not

sustainable over the medium term. Although retail sales and consumer confidence had fallen back

more recently, consumption still seemed robust, and while there were indications that house prices

were no longer accelerating, there was little evidence of a slowdown in the housing market.

Business investment growth was moderate but public investment was likely to grow rapidly.

Government consumption would also boost total demand for the indefinite future. The net trade

picture was more mixed, with the rise in sterling against the euro working in one direction, and

stronger world demand in the other. While the services sector remained robust, manufacturing

output had fallen in recent months, although survey evidence suggested a rather more resilient

picture. The labour market remained tight and, whether or not higher earnings fed through into

firms’ prices directly, they would add to disposable incomes and hence to demand pressures. While

oil prices were now easing back, input costs continued to rise, though there was little evidence of

much acceleration in final prices.

31 On one view, it would be better not to raise rates this month. The news over the month as a

whole was inconclusive, with falls in manufacturing production, retail sales and consumer

confidence, and oil prices, but with the determinants of domestic demand, both private and public,

remaining robust. Against that background other factors were also important. First, the extent of

price pressures stemming from the labour market required further analysis, not least in disentangling

the effects of bonuses and other elements of wage drift from that of settlements. Second, the analysis


-----

undertaken for the Inflation Report, and the opportunity this provided to set out the Committee’s

thinking in detail, were valid reasons not to move this month unless there was a strong case to do so.

Third, for some, the volatility in equity markets introduced a possible downside risk which might

mean that any increase in rates this month would need to be reversed soon afterwards. Finally, the

imbalances in the economy, manifested in another fall in manufacturing production, seemed to have

worsened. An increase might exacerbate these imbalances and it was possible that the weakness in

some sectors might feed through into the rest of the economy. With inflation running below target,

and expected to continue to do so for a while, there was no pressing reason to raise rates

straightaway. For these members, no change in the repo rate was needed this month, although for

some of them it was more likely than not that there would need to be an increase in rates in due

course.

32 On a second view, although the news over the month was mixed, it had on balance pointed to

somewhat higher prospective inflation, which was sufficient to tip the balance for some who had

been close to voting for higher rates in March. The fog surrounding some of the data around the

millennium date change had begun to clear. A rise in rates would no longer come as a big surprise to

the market and might not lead to much change either in short-term interest rate expectations or in the

exchange rate. To delay moving rates could lead to expectations that more would need to be done

later, to rein back the unsustainable growth of domestic demand. While the Inflation Report would

provide an opportunity to analyse recent developments in more detail, and set out the thinking of the

Committee at greater length, this argument was not by itself a conclusive reason for delay. Finally,

the Committee had decided in March that the timing of the Budget would not be a constraint on

moving rates either that month or this. On balance therefore a rise in the repo rate of 25 basis points

was needed this month.

33 The Governor invited members to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate be

maintained at 6.0%. Six members of the Committee (the Governor, David Clementi,

Charles Goodhart, DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and Sushil Wadhwani) voted for the proposition.

Mervyn King, Willem Buiter and John Vickers voted against, preferring a rise in rates of 25 basis

points.

#### ANNEX: SUMMARY OF DATA PRESENTED BY BANK STAFF

A1 This annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy

Committee on 31 March, in advance of the meeting on 5-6 April 2000. At the start of the Committee

meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available,

and that information is included in this Annex.

**I   The international environment**

A2 Overall, the world economy had continued to strengthen and industrial production for a wide

range of countries had remained strong in January, though there were signs of a slowing in annual

growth. Producer and consumer price inflation had risen a little since the end of the year in the

United States and the euro area, largely reflecting increased energy costs. OPEC’s decision to

increase oil production had eased the pressures on oil prices since March, as had evidence of lower

compliance with output quotas in the latest quarter. Interest rates had been raised in the United

States and the euro area in March, and rates implied by futures contracts had pointed to further

tightening in 2000.

A3 Final estimates for US GDP had shown 4.2% growth for 1999 as a whole. US GDP growth

had been revised up by 0.1 percentage point in Q4 to 1.8% for the quarter. The revisions had mainly

affected net trade, with higher exports and lower imports than in the preliminary profile. However,

in January, US export volumes had fallen by 3.4% over the month, partly due to a fall in aircraft

sales, and the US trade deficit had widened to a record $28 billion. US industrial production had

slowed slightly in February to 5.6% on a year earlier, largely because of a fall in automobile

production. Retail sales, which had grown by 1.1% in February, pointed to strong underlying growth

of consumption in Q1, though consumer confidence indicators in March had fallen further from

January’s record levels. Producer price inflation had been strong in February, rising to 4% over the

year, mainly reflecting energy and tobacco price increases. Headline consumer price inflation (CPI)

had also risen, to 3.2% in the year to February, and core CPI inflation had risen to 2.1%.

A4 The picture of stronger activity in the euro area in the second half of the year had been

confirmed by Q4 results. GDP had grown by 0.9% in Q4 and by 2.2% in 1999. Net trade had made

a negative contribution to growth in Q4, but domestic demand had been strong, reflecting the growth


-----

in private consumption, and reported stockbuilding. Industrial production had continued to grow

strongly in Q4 and in January was 3.8% higher than a year earlier. Business and consumer

confidence had reached the peak levels previously seen in 1998 and so had pointed to a continued

strengthening of activity. M3 growth had increased by 6.2% in February, above the January rate of

5.2%. Euro-area PPI inflation had risen again in March. Consumer price inflation was 2.0% in

February. As with the United States, energy effects had mainly accounted for the stronger PPI and

headline CPI inflation.

A5 The first estimate of Japanese GDP in Q4 had shown a decline of 1.4% on the previous

quarter; private consumption had fallen by 1.6%. Investment, mainly non-residential, had

contributed positively to growth in Q4. Rising corporate profits and orders had pointed to further

investment growth. The March Tankan survey pointed to a slow recovery in output. Japanese

workers’ household expenditure had increased by 3.9% in the year to February, boosted by the extra

day in February 2000, but nonetheless pointed to higher private consumption in Q1. Net trade had

been supported by intra-Asian exports and this was also likely to be a strong component in Q1

growth. Exports had increased by 15% in the year to February while import growth had remained

above 10%. In February, consumer prices had fallen by 0.6% compared with a year earlier, as the

effects of the earlier appreciation of the yen continued to feed through.

**II   Monetary and financial conditions**

A6 The twelve-month growth rate of notes and coin in March had remained strong at 8.4%, the

same as in February. Bank staff noted that the velocity of narrow money had fallen in recent years,

partly as the result of a gradual adjustment to lower nominal interest rates.

A7 The stock of M4 had risen by £2.2 billion (0.3%) in February leaving the twelve-month

growth rate at its historic low of 2.7%. The weak M4 figures had continued to be dominated by

other financial corporations’ (OFCs’) deposits, but private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs’) and

households’ deposits had also been weak in recent months. Aggregate M4 lending (excluding the

effects of securitisations) had been stronger in February, rising by £7.5 billion (0.8%) compared with

£3.9 billion in January. The twelve-month rate had risen by 0.3 percentage points and remained

robust at 8.9%.


-----

A8 Households’ M4 deposits had risen by £2 billion (0.4%) in February. But the twelve-month

growth rate, at 5.3%, had remained low when compared with rates seen in 1999. Households’ M4

lending (excluding the effects of securitisations) had remained robust, increasing by £4.3 billion

(0.8%) in February, with the twelve-month rate at 9.7%.

A9 Data on mortgage approvals had pointed to continuing buoyancy in housing market activity.

The number and value of mortgage approvals had risen by 11,000 and £0.6 billion respectively in

February, reversing the downward trend of the previous two months. This had suggested that

secured lending could rise in the coming months. Revised estimates by Bank staff had suggested

that mortgage equity withdrawal had been strong in 1999 Q4 at around £2.5 billion, although it had

been weaker than provisional estimates, which had put the figure at around £3 billion. Total real

lending for consumption (real mortgage equity withdrawal plus real unsecured lending) in 1999 was

estimated to have been at its highest level since 1990.

A10 Net bank borrowing (borrowing minus deposits) by PNFCs had risen again in January and

February. PNFCs’ M4 deposits had fallen by £0.5 billion on average over the first two months of the

year whereas PNFCs’ M4 lending (excluding the effects of securitisations) had risen by £0.6 billion

on average. Non-bank borrowing by PNFCs (and foreign currency capital issues in particular) had

been strong in the first two months of the year. In 1999 the PNFCs' financial deficit had stood at

£20 billion, which, at 2.4% of GDP, had been at its highest level since 1990. Unlike the previous

economic cycle, a relatively small proportion of this debt had been raised via the banking system.

A11 OFCs’ M4 had fallen by £1.2 billion (-0.7%) in February, and was 4.5% lower than a year

earlier, down from -3.8% in January. OFCs’ M4 lending rose by £2.3 billion (1.1%) in February, a

10% increase on a year earlier.

A12 Since the previous MPC meeting, short interest rate expectations around one year out, as

measured by the gilt repo curve, had risen by around 5 basis points. Medium-term yields (5-12

years) had risen by around 10-15 basis points.

A13 The February increase in interest rates of 25 basis points had been fully passed through to the

average standard variable mortgage rate, but there had been a continued trend for lenders to provide

greater discounts for new mortgages. Fixed-rate mortgages had also fallen.


-----

A14 The average of inflation expectations reported in the Treasury survey of independent

forecasters had fallen slightly to 2.3% in 2001 Q4. Survey-based measures of inflation expectations

for the next two years had also fallen slightly. Trade union expectations had fallen to 2.8% from

2.9% in December 1999. The inflation expectations of the general public had fallen slightly to 4.4%,

but these were still well above the inflation target.

A15 Equity prices in the United Kingdom had been relatively volatile since the previous meeting.

The FTSE All-Share index had fallen by 2% since the previous MPC meeting, with the IT sector

down 29% from its peak in early March. Since October 1999, however, the FTSE IT sector had

nearly doubled in value, while the FTSE All-Share had risen by around 8%.

A16 Since the previous MPC meeting, sterling had appreciated by 0.6% against the US dollar (to

$1.5915), but had depreciated by 0.3% against the euro (to 60.67p) and by 1.1% against the yen. The

sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) had depreciated by 0.3% since the previous MPC

meeting. This month, movements in sterling against the US dollar had been consistent with

‘monetary news’, though movements in sterling against the euro had not. The sterling ERI was 0.3%

below the February Inflation Report’s modal projection.

**III   The Budget**

A17 Staff presented a summary of the March 2000 Budget, which had focused on changes in the

Treasury’s projections compared with the November 1999 Pre-Budget Report. The policy changes

announced for 2000/01 and 2001/02 had increased discretionary spending in particular, but had been

more than offset by non-discretionary changes to spending and revenues. Much of the

weaker-than-expected spending and stronger-than-expected revenue outturns in 1999/2000 had been

considered to be structural by the Treasury, and were therefore assumed to continue to reduce

borrowing over the forecast period.

A18 The net effect of the changes to the projections had been to reduce projected borrowing in

2000/01 and 2001/02. A surplus of around £5 billion was now projected for 2000/01, £4 billion

more than in the Pre-Budget Report, while a surplus £2 billion higher than in the Pre-Budget Report

was projected for 2001/02. So in the near term, the Budget represented a modest tightening in the

fiscal stance relative to the Pre-Budget Report. From 2002/03 onwards, higher borrowing had been


-----

forecast. The Budget projections had been dependent on the Treasury's 2¼% trend growth

assumption.

A19 The figures for cyclically adjusted net borrowing had been similar to those for the unadjusted

deficit, because an output gap of close to zero had been projected. Very little of the change since the

_Pre-Budget Report had been ascribed by the Treasury to the cycle. Cyclically adjusted net_

borrowing in the Budget had been estimated at -1.2% of GDP in 1999/2000, and projected at -0.5%

in 2000/01, -0.3% in 2001/02, and +0.5% in 2002/03.

A20 The Treasury had expected that the Golden Rule would be met throughout the next five years

with a small margin of safety, with the cyclically adjusted surplus on current budget declining to

0.7% in 2004/05 from 1.8% in 1999/2000. The ratio of net debt to GDP had already been below

40%, the Treasury’s benchmark, and had been projected to fall to around 33% in 2002/03 and

2003/04.

**IV   Demand and output**

A21 Quarterly GDP growth had been unrevised at 0.8% in Q4 but the level of GDP had been

revised up by just under 0.1%. Final domestic demand growth had been revised up to 1.3% in Q4

and the annual growth of final domestic demand had been revised up to 4.4%. Stockbuilding had

been revised down; it contributed 0.6 percentage points to GDP growth in Q4, down from the

1 percentage point reported in the previous GDP release. The net trade contribution had been

unchanged at -1.2 percentage points. Revisions had brought the expenditure, output, and income

measures of GDP closer together.

A22 Household consumption growth in Q4 had been revised up to 1.1%, but there had been some

downward revisions to earlier quarters so that the level of consumption in 1999 Q4 was broadly

unchanged. Within the total, services had grown by 2.2% on the quarter, and spending on durable

goods had risen by 0.3%, while spending on non-durable goods had risen by 0.2%. Cars had

contributed little to durables growth in 1999 but spending on other durables had grown by 12.9% in

the year to Q4. Real government consumption had been revised up by more than £1 billion by

1999 Q4 with similar-sized revisions to nominal government spending. The estimates of whole
economy investment had been little changed for 1999 Q4 but general government investment had


-----

been revised up and business investment had been revised down. Quarterly manufacturing

investment growth had been revised up to 4.3% in Q4, the first positive growth rate since 1998 Q4.

Other plant and machinery investment had fallen by 0.4%, which could be consistent with a pause in

IT investment around the millennium. Revisions had reduced the volatility of inventories between

Q3 and Q4.

A23 There had been upward revisions to the level of both imports and exports during 1999,

although the timing of revisions differed. The net trade contribution had been slightly more negative

in 1999 H2. The trade deficit had increased to around 2% of GDP in Q4 but this had been more than

offset by increases in investment income and so the current account deficit had narrowed to 1.3% of

GDP.

A24 The gross operating surplus of all corporations had fallen by 0.9% in Q4 but the level had

been revised up by 1.5%. The half-yearly growth rates had been volatile. PNFCs’ net borrowing

had been little changed in Q4, at 2.4% of GDP. Household compensation of employees had grown

strongly, by 1.8% in Q4. The annual household savings ratio had been around 6% over the past two

years. It had been low compared with the recent past but did not look so low when compared with

the 1960s.

A25 Retail sales had fallen by 1.2% in February following growth of 1.6% in January. The

three-month rates had still been strong. The BRC weekly data for March had pointed to further retail

sales growth and the Bank’s regional Agents had reported little change in the growth rate, although

there was a further rise in the dispersion across regions. The CBI distributive trades survey had

reported lower sales volume growth in March but a rise in expected growth for April. The GfK

measure of consumer confidence had weakened across all categories to -2 in March.

A26 Analysis by Bank staff had shown close links between housing market surveys and housing

market activity and prices. Loan approvals and the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)

sales survey had strengthened in February and had suggested stronger activity in the short term. But

the House Builders’ Federation survey had shown falling growth in site visits and net reservations

which pointed to an easing in activity in the summer. House price indicators had been mixed. The

Nationwide index had been very strong at 2.3% in March with annual growth rising to 16.2%. By

contrast, the Halifax index fell by 0.4% in March and the annual rate of house price inflation eased a


-----

little to 13.5%. The RICS prices data seemed consistent with house price inflation of around 4% per

quarter.

A27 Exports had been flat in January and there had been evidence that the upward trend in imports

was attenuating slightly. There had been a strengthening in exports to non-EU countries in February.

A28 Industrial output had fallen by 0.6% in February and manufacturing output had fallen by

0.2%, the third month in a row that manufacturing output had declined. Output had fallen across

most industries in the latest three months. The weaker-than-expected manufacturing data had led to

a fall in the National Institute’s projection of GDP growth for the latest three months to 0.5% from

0.8% the previous month. However, surveys had pointed to a rise in manufacturing output in March.

The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) manufacturing survey output balance had

been 54.1 in March, suggesting a moderate expansion of output in Q1. Though still pointing to an

expansion of output, the growth of new orders had moderated to 51.7, with firms citing

post-millennium destocking as a factor. CBI Industrial Trends output expectations had been stronger

in March at +17; total orders had dipped to -16 but had been broadly flat over the past six months.

The Engineering Employers’ Federation output balance had been flat at +9 in Q1 and orders had

risen slightly. By contrast, the CIPS services survey had risen to 59.6 in March, indicating relatively

strong service sector output growth. The CIPS construction trends survey had continued to point to

growth of current and future construction activity.

**V** **Labour market**

A29 According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS) employment had risen by 83,000 (or 0.3%) in

the three months to January compared with the previous three months, a little stronger than the

growth rate in each of the previous three releases. Within the total, full-time employment had risen

by 88,000 and part-time employment had fallen by 5,000. The 0.3% rise in the number of people in

employment in the three months to January had been offset by a 0.3% fall in average hours worked.

So total hours worked had been broadly unchanged in the latest quarter.

A30 The number of Workforce Jobs had risen by 70,000 (or 0.3%) in Q4. Within the total, the

number of jobs in the production sector had continued to fall, though by less than on average over

the past year. There had been a further sharp rise in the number of service sector jobs. The level of


-----

Workforce Jobs in Q3 had been revised, so that the number of jobs was estimated to have fallen by

just 1,000 during the third quarter, rather than 51,000 as reported in the previous release of the

Labour Market Statistics.

A31 Survey data had been consistent with further increases in employment in Q1. According to

the CIPS, the reading on construction sector employment was 60.8 in March, well above the neutral

50 level and the strongest figure since May 1997. Other CIPS surveys suggested a small rise in

service sector employment and a small fall in manufacturing employment in March.

A32 There had been a sharp increase in whole-economy productivity growth. One measure, based

on the change in the ratio of GDP to Workforce Jobs, had risen from 1.0% in the year to Q3 to 1.8%

in the year to Q4. Another measure, based on the change in the ratio of GDP to LFS employment,

had risen from 0.8% in the year to Q3 to 1.6% in the year to Q4. Survey data from the Institute of

Management Services confirmed the pick-up in productivity growth during the second half of 1999,

and suggested that productivity growth had remained firm during the first quarter of this year.

A33 There was little new information on labour shortages. The Recruitment and Employers’

Confederation (REC) survey showed a further reduction in the availability of both permanent and

temporary staff in March. According to reports from the Bank’s regional Agents, skill shortages had

remained a serious concern, particularly in southern England.

A34 LFS unemployment had risen by 21,000 in the three months to January compared with the

previous three months. Most of the rise had been accounted for by those unemployed for less than

six months. The claimant count measure had fallen by 42,000 in the three months to January, and by

a further 6,700 in February. Inactivity had fallen by 68,000 in the three months to January compared

with the previous three months, reflecting similar reductions in the number who reported that they

wanted jobs and those who did not.

A35 There had been a further sharp increase in the headline rate of earnings growth for the whole

economy as measured by the Average Earnings Index (AEI), from 5.5% in December to 5.9% in

January. The January headline figure was an average of the annual rates for November, December

and January. These were 5.1%, 6.2% and 6.4% respectively.


-----

A36 Within the total, annual growth in manufacturing earnings had fallen by 0.2 percentage points

to 5.6% in January. At the same time, annual growth in service sector earnings had risen by 0.4

percentage points to 6.7%.

A37 The latest earnings figures had been affected by millennium-related and other bonus

payments. These had included overtime payments to police and health sector workers, and on-call

allowances in transport, storage and communication and the utilities sectors. Overtime payments

were reported to have risen in the manufacturing sector as firms sought to make up lost output after

the prolonged holiday season.

A38 The Bank’s regional Agents had asked around 160 of their business contacts to comment on

any bonus payments which they had made, or planned to make, during the period November 1999 to

April 2000. Around 50% of all respondents had stated that the share of bonus payments in the total

wage bill would be higher this year than last year. This proportion was slightly higher in the

financial services sector than in manufacturing. Looking at those firms that had reported a higher

bonus share for this year, the most common explanation was higher productivity and profits, with

around 70% citing this as either an ‘important’ or a ‘very important’ factor. The need to retain and

recruit staff was a close second in most sectors, though not in manufacturing where employment had

been falling. The millennium was seen as ‘important’ or ‘very important’ by fewer than one third of

those firms reporting a higher bonus share this year. On balance, roughly the same proportion of

respondents had expected to make significant bonus payments in March as had done so in January,

though it looked as if March bonuses would be concentrated in the financial services sector.

A39 Consistent with the AEI, the REC survey showed a sharp pick-up in the growth rate of

salaries for permanent staff around the turn of the year. There had been a more moderate increase in

the growth rate of pay for temporary (or contract) staff. Wages and salaries per head rose by 5.0%

over the year to 1999 Q4, 0.5 percentage points below the headline growth in the AEI for December.

Growth in unit wage costs fell from 3.8% in the year to Q3 to 3.2% in the year to Q4, reflecting the

sharp increase in productivity growth.

A40 According to the latest available data, the Bank’s AEI-weighted twelve-month mean

settlement was 3.3% in February, the same as the January figure. On balance, settlements were


-----

turning out lower this year than last year: of the 110 settlements that could be matched 25 were

higher, 11 the same and 74 lower in January 2000 than in January 1999.

**VI   Prices**

A41 The Bank oil-inclusive commodity price index had risen by 3.4% in February, taking the

annual inflation rate from 18.9% to 22.7%. The monthly increase had reflected price rises in all the

major components of the index, except for non-indigenous food. In particular, the price of fuels had

risen quite sharply, by 5.1%. This had been mainly due to the 9% rise in crude oil prices in

February. Excluding oil, commodity prices had risen by 1.8% in February to give an annual inflation

rate of 2.9%.

A42 Seasonally adjusted manufacturing input prices had risen by 3.1% in February, taking the

annual inflation rate from 10.8% to 14.5%, the highest since the mid-1980s. This had again mainly

reflected the large monthly rise in the price of crude oil. There had also been rises in the prices of

imported materials as a whole and of domestically produced food. According to March’s CIPS

manufacturing survey, the input price index had risen to its highest level since August 1995.

Seasonally adjusted total output prices excluding excise duties (PPIY) had risen by 0.1% in

February, to give an annual inflation rate of 1.6%, slightly down from 1.7% in the previous month.

March’s CBI survey output price balance had fallen sharply to -11 from -4.

A43 Prices of imported and exported goods had risen by 1.1% and 0.5% respectively in the three

months to January compared with the previous three months. Excluding oil, the price of imported

goods had risen by 0.5%, while the price of exported goods had fallen by 0.5% over the same period.

A44 RPIX inflation had risen to 2.2% in February, up from 2.1% in the previous month. RPI

inflation had risen to 2.3% in February from 2.0% in January. RPIY inflation had remained

unchanged for the second consecutive month in February at 1.8%. Large monthly rises in the prices

of clothing, used cars and tobacco had been partly offset by price falls for pharmaceuticals and

toiletries, and vehicle insurance. HICP inflation had risen from 0.8% to 1.0% in February. As a

result, the difference between HICP and RPIX inflation had narrowed slightly to 1.2% in February

from 1.3% in January. Much of this reduction in the difference had been accounted for by a rise in

February in the price of new cars, which are not included in RPIX.


-----

A45 The basket and weights of the RPI had been updated, with goods receiving a lower weight

and services a higher one. The weights for petrol and depreciation had also risen.

**VII   Reports by the Bank’s Agents**

A46 The Bank’s regional Agents had reported a continued moderate recovery in manufacturing

activity, although significant sectoral differences remained. The outlook for the sector was reported

to be heavily dependent on future movements in the exchange rate. Service sector output growth had

remained stable at a strong rate, and there had been some evidence of a strengthening in business

services growth. Construction output growth had remained broadly stable, although wide regional

variations persisted. The Agents suggested that export volumes had been maintained, but that the

strength of sterling continued to result in intense pressure on margins. Concerns regarding the

strength of import penetration appeared to have increased further.

A47 Agents had reported a slight easing in annual retail sales growth in February, following

stronger Christmas/millennium sales, consistent with ONS retail sales data. New car sales had

remained unchanged, while there had been further evidence of a pick-up in the used car market.

A48 Manufacturers had continued to find it difficult to pass on increases in input prices. There

had been further downward pressure on retail goods prices, while service sector inflation was

thought to have remained stable. Contacts had remained concerned about skill shortages in the

labour market, and there had been signs that expectations regarding pay settlements later in the year

had increased in manufacturing and services.

**VIII** **Market intelligence**

A49 Expectations of UK interest rates implied by short sterling futures had risen slightly since the

previous MPC meeting. But the unexpected weakness of the February retail sales and manufacturing

output data, and the sustained strength of sterling since the previous MPC meeting, had limited

expectations of a rise in the official interest rate in April. Ahead of the meeting, the markets had

attached a probability of up to a half to a rise in the official rate of 25 basis points. The latest poll of

economists’ expectations reported by Reuters suggested about a 40% chance of a rate rise, and an

expected peak of 6.5% by the third quarter.


-----

A50 In the United States, the FOMC had raised the official rate by 25 basis points on 21 March.

This move had been widely anticipated and there had been little market reaction to it. Following the

publication of the February FOMC minutes on 23 March, in which a discussion of a 50 basis point

rate rise was reported, US interest rate futures had risen sharply, but had since fallen back. The ECB

raised their official rate by 25 basis points on 16 March and, following that change, interest rate

expectations in the euro area had fallen.

A51 Since the previous Committee meeting there had been some volatility in US equity markets,

with a 15% fall in the US NASDAQ index and a 12% rise in the Dow Jones index (the FTSE

All-Share index had fallen by 2% over the same period). Market participants had reported that the

movements had been caused by a fall in demand for technology stocks and a corresponding rise in

demand for ‘blue-chip’ stocks. In recent days there had been a notable rise in volatility, with the

NASDAQ having fallen by 16% between 24 March and 5 April and the Dow Jones having fallen by

0.7% over the same period. Increased volatility had been attributed to uncertainty about the

valuation of technology stocks.

A52 Sterling’s effective exchange rate index had fallen slightly from 109.3 to 108.9 since the

previous Committee meeting, reflecting a small depreciation against the euro and the yen, but a

slight appreciation against the US dollar.  Risk reversals traded in the foreign exchange market were

close to neutral for sterling exchange rates. Since the previous Committee meeting there had been a

number of mergers and acquisition deals (both confirmed and rumoured) which had, or were

expected to, involve purchases of sterling. That had helped to support sterling, both against the

US dollar and the euro.
