**MINUTES OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON**
**6-7 FEBRUARY 2002**

1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision and against the background of its latest

projections for output and inflation, the Committee discussed the world economy; money, credit and

asset prices; demand and output; labour market conditions; prices and costs; and some possible

tactical considerations.

**The world economy**

2 The latest US indicators suggested some further improvement relative to expectations a few

months ago. After falling by 0.3 percentage points in 2001 Q3, output was estimated to have grown

very slightly in Q4. Consumption had been stronger than expected, largely reflecting spending on cars

encouraged by heavy price discounting. A substantial part of this demand had, however, been met by

running down inventories, reducing its net contribution to output growth. Investment in information

and communication technology had in Q4 risen for the first time in over a year. While employment

had fallen in December, the rate of unemployment had also dropped, implying that some people had

moved out of the workforce. Looking forward, most of the recent US survey evidence was positive.

Measures of consumer confidence had continued to rise, and were now well above post-11 September

troughs. The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index had risen

again, to 49.9. The non-manufacturing index had fallen only slightly on the month – from 50.1 to 49.6

– but by rather more when compared with the original estimate for December of 54.1. It was still,

though, considerably higher than immediately after 11 September.

3 In the euro area – probably the most important region for assessing the impact of global

conditions on the UK economy – there was a disjunction between the backward-looking data and more

forward-looking surveys. Demand and output growth had remained weak – somewhat more so than

had been built into the Committee’s November projections. But business confidence measures were

stronger, and purchasing manager indices had risen for the third consecutive month for both

manufacturing and services. Consumer confidence indices had been broadly flat on the month.

Compared with the November Inflation Report assumptions, however, the immediate outlook for euro
area activity was somewhat weaker There was also a downside risk to domestic demand but


-----

imbalances. It was conceivable that the current debate about the Stability and Growth Pact would

cause fiscal policy to be tightened relative to current plans, but that seemed unlikely.

4 Conditions continued to be difficult in Japan. Industrial production had fallen sharply over the

past year. Deflation persisted. Looking forward, there were downside risks associated with the

problems in the financial sector and uncertainty about their resolution. The significance of this for the

overall world economic outlook was, however, unclear as Japan’s difficulties seemed not to have had a

big impact on global conditions over recent years; for example, world trade growth had been very

strong in 2000.

5 Against this background, the Committee discussed the risks to the US economic outlook since

that was the source of greatest uncertainty affecting global prospects. The underlying position in the

United States might be less strong than would perhaps appear from a near-term recovery in growth

associated with firms completing their inventory corrections and a rebound from the dip in demand

immediately after 11 September. What would matter more in the period ahead was the strength of

final domestic demand. While business surveys suggested that investment would not continue falling,

they did not yet point to a sustained pick up. There might still be an investment overhang, in which

case company spending would be weaker than otherwise. Perhaps more significantly, there were

downside risks to consumption from the build up of household debt. Even at low official interest rates,

the debt servicing burden was historically high relative to income. If saving were to rise sharply, there

might also be a fall in the dollar’s exchange rate, which would in turn tend to reduce the real spending

power of household incomes. Separately, the Enron case seemed to be affecting the equity market’s

valuation of other companies. Increased uncertainty about the integrity of published earnings might

perhaps be causing a rise in the risk premium; and looking forward, more conservative accounting

practices might reduce future growth in published earnings. However, the impact seemed so far to be

localised rather than across company share prices generally; and the effect on wealth and demand

would plausibly be smaller than would be the case if, say, the expected rate of return on capital

generally were revised down.

6 To the extent that weight was given to these possible downside risks, an important question was

how well monetary authorities would be able to respond if any of them crystallised. On the one hand,

while US headline inflation had fallen, reflecting lower oil prices, measures of ‘core’ inflation (which

stripped out food and energy prices) had gradually edged up from around 2% to nearly 3% over the


-----

it was suggested that it was not unusual, given the lags in the economy, for core inflation to continue

rising during a slowdown in output growth and then to fall back as the economy recovered, so that

there was little reason to think that interest rates could not be cut further if the recovery stalled.

7 Overall, the Committee concluded that the international news on the month was positive. The

outlook was for world economic growth to recover during this year, but with somewhat weaker

activity in the near term than had been built into its November Inflation Report projections. The

balance of risks was modestly on the downside.

**Money, credit and asset prices**

8 The global conjuncture implied considerable uncertainty about the sustainability of the current

constellation of exchange rates. The US dollar had strengthened again over the past month and, on an

effective rate basis, was at a 15-year high. But the internal and external imbalances in the US

economy, associated with the build up of debt, posed downside risks. It was difficult to envisage

recovery in the Japanese economy without some further yen weakness. The euro had weakened again,

and might be restrained by the subdued outlook for euro-area growth and by public commentary on

possible tensions between monetary and fiscal policy. But obviously not all of these major currencies

could fall at the same time.

9 Compared with the three main currency blocs, sterling’s exchange rate was relatively more

important for domestic monetary policy given that the United Kingdom was a smaller, more open

economy. In effective terms, sterling was broadly unchanged over the month, having fallen against the

US dollar and risen against the euro. On balance the Committee judged that the risks to sterling were

weighted on the downside, although some members found that difficult to square with the possibility

of a more general realignment of bilateral exchange rates given the international conjuncture.

10 Recent UK monetary, credit and housing market data had been robust. The annual rate of broad

money (M4) growth had slowed slightly, to just under 7%, in December. But the household measures

were generally strong. Notes and coin had risen by 10% on an annualised basis in the latest three

months. Household Divisia money – a broader measure of transactions balances – had grown by over

9% in the year to end-December. Total household borrowing growth remained very strong: around

11% in the year to December Secured borrowing growth had been over 10% House prices were up


-----

had risen by 1.6% in January. According to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the balance

of estate agents across the country expecting house prices to rise had increased from +29 in December

to +48 in January.

11 The Committee discussed some of the possible implications of a substantial cumulative rise in

household debt relative to income and of the position of household finances more generally. Capital

gearing had also risen, but was still below the levels prevailing through much of the 1990s. Income

gearing was low at current interest rates by historical standards; other things being equal, interest rates

would have to rise substantially for income gearing to reach early-1990s levels.

12 It was not clear, however, whether the early 1990s provided a sensible benchmark of

sustainability. On the one hand, in an environment of greater macroeconomic stability, households

might be able to sustain higher levels of debt relative to income than in the past. They might simply be

making that adjustment; the debt-to-income ratio in the United Kingdom was not out of line with that

in many other developed economies. Official interest rates had risen by seven percentage points, from

8% to 15%, over a short period in the late-1980s/early-1990s. A similar absolute rise was now

unlikely. ‘Affordability’ measures of housing – for example, the interest cost of servicing a mortgage

relative to income – were, it was suggested, reassuring. Nor was the level of household saving directly

comparable with past episodes; it was stronger than implied by the headline numbers. Measures of

the household saving ratio which adjusted for inflation were not markedly below the long-term

average; and adjusting for spending on durables – on the grounds that they yield a flow of services

over time – would, other things being equal, increase the ratio. Furthermore, it was not clear that

policy would need to be tightened sharply to restrain demand if rapid borrowing growth continued.

Other things being equal, higher debt – as well as the abolition of mortgage interest tax relief – might

mean that, compared with the past, smaller changes in official interest rates would be required for a

given desired effect on spending and saving decisions.

13 On the other hand, the high levels of debt in the late 1980s had made households vulnerable,

compounding the subsequent downturn. Was it clear that borrowers and lenders remembered the

lessons of that episode? The more stable monetary environment did not point unambiguously in the

direction of more debt being safe. The unexpected rise in inflation in the late 1980s had eroded the

real burden of household debt; that was also now less likely. In addition, the lower nominal interest

rates implied by lower medium term inflation expectations meant that the real burden of servicing and


-----

1980s, when it had been concentrated in the early years of a loan. Related to that, measures of income

gearing based only on interest payments might, by ignoring principal repayments, underestimate the

household sector’s overall debt burden, although some members thought that the quantitative

significance of this adjustment for most housing-related loans was likely to be small. Finally, it was

possible that the effect on household behaviour of any increase in interest rates would also depend on

the proportional change rather than just on the absolute change.

14 Persistently rising debt levels potentially increased the probability that any adjustment to

household balance sheets would be abrupt rather than smooth, with an attendant risk of a fall in asset

prices and, thus, in the value of collateral. In those circumstances, there might also be implications for

financial sector behaviour and associated constraints on household credit availability, which could feed

back into spending and so somewhat amplify the effect on aggregate demand. In the view of some

members, therefore, rising debt levels risked increasing the volatility of output and so of inflation in

the medium term, potentially making future inflation outturns more uncertain. Other members placed

little or no weight on this.

**Demand and output**

15 The imbalances in the economy had for some time been reflected in quite different outturns for

manufacturing and services sector output, and for consumption and investment. Manufacturing output

had fallen by 1.7% in Q4, and was 5.6% below the level of a year earlier. Services output had, by

contrast, risen by 0.9%, and was up 3.6% on twelve months before. The gap between the annual

growth rates had not been as big since 1981.

16 Retail sales had risen by 1.3% in Q4 and by 6.2% on 2000 Q4. The implications of the data for

December itself were, however, unclear. On an unadjusted basis, sales had grown by 23.5% in

December. But the seasonal adjustment factor was a massive -23.8%. On a seasonally adjusted basis,

retail spending had, therefore, fallen by 0.3%. Since there was unavoidable uncertainty about the

precise size of so large a seasonal adjustment, it would be premature to give much weight to this

month’s data.

17 Consumption growth, while remaining strong, seemed likely, on the basis of available

information to have eased back in Q4: from an average quarterly rate of around 1% in the first three


-----

might in part reflect temporary 11 September effects. Looking ahead, it was possible that durables

spending would slow. As a share of total consumption, it had reached historical highs during 2001, but

had typically declined relatively quickly during previous economic slowdowns. Given the recovery in

consumer confidence, the buoyancy of the housing market and the robust household money and credit

numbers, there was not yet conclusive evidence that consumption growth would continue to slow in

the near term. The Committee still expected it to slow further ahead, reflecting earlier falls in wealth

and the prospect of weaker real income growth.

18 The outlook for investment would be affected by corporate profitability, amongst other factors.

Manufacturing profitability (as measured by the annual post-tax rate of return on capital) had been

only around 4¼% in Q3, the latest period for which there were data: the lowest rate since early 1992.

Services sector profitability remained much higher, but had now declined from a peak of around 18%

in 1998 to about 12½% in 2001 Q3.

19 According to the British Chambers of Commerce’s Q4 survey, investment intentions in both

manufacturing and services were weak. But more generally, recent business surveys had been more

encouraging. For example, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing Supply services business activity

index had risen; and for manufacturing, the CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends survey was slightly

stronger than three months ago. More optimism in the corporate sector might improve investment

prospects in due course.

20 Overall, the Committee expected investment gradually to recover in line with aggregate demand

and output. But the immediate outlook was weak. In the view of some members, while in the short

run the balance of risks to consumption was on the upside, it was on the downside for investment.

Further ahead, the balance of risks to aggregate private sector spending was on the downside.

**Labour market conditions**

21 Although employment, on the Labour Force Survey measure, had increased by 0.2% in the three

months to November, hours worked had fallen by 0.6%, largely due to less overtime work.

Unemployment had risen slightly. It seemed, therefore, that firms were still hiring workers, coping

with shifts in demand by adjusting hours worked. The implications of this looking forward were

uncertain On the one hand if output growth remained reasonably robust overtime and hours worked


-----

workers, unwinding the recent rise in unemployment and leading to a re-tightening of labour market

conditions. In that case, consumption might not soften as much as expected. If, on the other hand,

hours worked recovered to earlier levels but growth stalled, unemployment might rise quite sharply.

The path of earnings growth could differ considerably between these scenarios.

22 Earnings growth had eased back slightly in the three months to November compared with the

previous three months. Regular pay growth had also slowed; on a non-seasonally-adjusted basis, the

twelve month rate had fallen back from 5.0% to 4.6%. Given that overtime pay rates were typically

higher than pay for normal hours, the fall might be explained by lower overtime. Bonuses remained

significantly lower than last year. Together with uncertainty about the timing of bonuses at some firms

over the next few months, this could make the earnings data difficult to interpret.

23 The survey data on employment intentions suggested that demand for labour had recently fallen

in services as well as manufacturing. Intelligence from the Bank’s regional Agents was consistent

with this, and also suggested that on balance their contacts expected pay settlements and, to a lesser

extent, earnings growth to be lower in 2002 than in 2001.

**Prices and costs**

24 At a little over $19 per barrel, oil prices had been fairly stable over the month and, indeed, since

the Committee’s November Inflation Report. While some other commodity prices had risen, world

price pressures remained weak. It was noted that consumer prices had been falling in each of China,

Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong, which together accounted for approaching one fifth of world GDP

weighted at purchasing power parity exchange rates.

25 During its meeting, the Committee received the ONS’s preliminary estimate of January RPIX

inflation. At 2.6%, this was much higher than expected. It would represent a sharp rise from 1.9% in

December, and was well above the increase which could be accounted for by the unwinding of low

petrol prices a year ago. Some of the unexpected increase reflected seasonal food prices, but on a first

reading some of the other contributory factors were not so obviously erratic. The Committee agreed

that a full analysis of the data would be needed before its March meeting. The data underlined the

volatility of annual RPIX inflation from month to month. The short-term risks to RPIX inflation

appeared to lie on the upside in Q1 and on the downside in Q2


-----

**The February GDP growth and inflation projections**

26 The Committee reached its policy decision in the light of the projections to be published in the

_Inflation Report on Wednesday 13 February._

27 On the assumption of an unchanged official repo rate of 4% over the next two years, the central

projection was for the annual rate of GDP growth to ease back slightly during the first half of 2002,

before recovering to around trend. The central projection for inflation was below target over the next

year or so, after which it rose back towards the 2½% target by the two-year horizon, when it was still

slightly below the target but rising. In the Inflation Report fan charts, the balance of risks to growth

was on the downside, reflecting the risks to the world economic outlook and to private sector domestic

demand. The risks to inflation were weighted slightly to the upside, largely due to the effect on import

prices of a possible sterling depreciation.

28 Some members preferred different assumptions for both the central projections and risks. Some

thought that the most likely outlook for inflation was a little higher. Others thought that it could be up

to a quarter of a percentage point lower – a smaller difference than in recent quarters – reflecting views

that there would be a greater-than-assumed disinflationary effect from weak world price inflation and

that the economy’s supply potential was higher than assumed; this was shown in Table 6.B of the

_Inflation Report. On risks, some members placed greater weight on upside risks to both output and_

inflation. Others judged that the overall balance of risks around the central projection was weighted to

the downside for both output and inflation, and in particular did not place much weight on the

possibility of a sterling depreciation or on its estimated effect on inflation.

**Possible tactical considerations**

29 The Committee noted that there was a firm expectation, in financial markets and amongst

commentators, that the repo rate would be unchanged this month.

30 The Committee noted that some commentators had advocated intervention in the foreign

exchange markets in an attempt to moderate the strength of sterling’s exchange rate. The Committee

was clearly of the view that intervention was not likely on its own to be effective in the present


-----

31 The Committee reviewed a range of possible general considerations bearing on the relationship

between its fan chart projections and its policy decisions. First, it was important to place weight not

just on the central (modal) projection but also on the risks, and – just as important – on the economic

factors and analysis behind the fan charts. Second, the fan charts sometimes reflected some low

probability, high impact events, which there was no need for policy to anticipate because the

Committee could respond to them if and when they crystallised. Third, there were some eventualities

(for example, an oil price rise) for which, if they occurred, the appropriate course might be for the

Committee to accommodate the first round effects on the price level (and so measured inflation),

depending on the economic circumstances prevailing. Fourth, the weight placed on the projection of

inflation at the two-year horizon should reflect the nature of the economic influences underlying that

projection and whether, in consequence, inflation was projected to be stable, rising or falling then.

Fifth, the Committee might sometimes give weight to the expected variability of output and inflation;

for example, to whether there were factors which might affect the risks of missing the inflation target,

in either direction, by a material amount in the medium term. How much weight should properly be

given to these different considerations would vary with the circumstances. The constant factor was the

need, under the Government’s remit, to set policy in order to achieve the inflation target. The

Committee’s projections were, therefore, a vital input to its decisions since they were forward looking.

**The immediate policy decision**

32 Various arguments – given different weights by different members – were identified for leaving

the repo rate unchanged. First, with the central projection for inflation at the two year horizon only

slightly below the 2½% target and rising, for some members the Committee’s projections were in

principle consistent with leaving the repo rate unchanged, cutting it slightly or even with raising it

slightly. As things currently stood, the outlook was sufficiently close to target that the forecast did not

help inform the choice between marginally different policy settings, as a range of interest rate paths

could be consistent with achieving the inflation target over the medium term. But in the current

conjuncture, cutting rates would undesirably stimulate an already buoyant household sector; and with

price pressures currently so benign, a rate increase would be premature. The best course was to leave

rates unchanged. Second, some members emphasised the prospect that inflation would be rising at the

two year horizon. There would be a risk to the effectiveness of policy if the Committee were to cut

rates now only to have to increase them quite shortly afterwards even in the absence of news It was


-----

would persist unless economic circumstances changed. That way, repo rate changes would tend to

have a bigger impact on longer-term interest rates, the exchange rate and other asset prices, aiding the

effectiveness of policy. Third, some members placed weight on upside risks to the inflation outlook.

Two main risks to inflation were emphasised: from the possibility of a depreciation of sterling’s

exchange rate and from the possibility that consumption would not slow as much as projected. These

risks were connected, given the imbalances in the economy. There was evidence that the exchange

rate was overvalued. The skew to the exchange rate built into the published fan charts was reasonable:

it was, for example, fairly close to the profile which would be implied by uncovered-interest-rate

parity, which was a conditioning assumption in some outside forecasts. Other members placed less

weight on the exchange rate risk in the published fan charts – either because they thought the

probability of a depreciation was low or because the pass through to prices would be small or because

policy could react if and when sterling fell. But they shared a concern about over-stimulating

household spending. A fourth reason identified for maintaining the Bank’s repo rate at 4% arose,

therefore, from the possibility, suggested by recent outturns, that consumption growth now responded

more strongly and more quickly to interest rate changes than in the past. Since consumption growth

was not expected to moderate until the second half of the year, cutting interest rates now would

stimulate household spending too much in the short run. A preferable course would be to leave rates

unchanged for now, cutting them if necessary later in the year as and when domestic demand growth

slowed and when the path of the international economy was clearer. Fifth, some members placed

weight on risks to the future variance of inflation from high and rising levels of household debt. A cut

in rates would encourage further borrowing, increasing the risk of a subsequent abrupt downward

adjustment in household spending – and perhaps in asset prices – at some point, which in turn would

increase the volatility of inflation around the target. Finally, the news that the January RPIX inflation

outturn was expected to be 2.6% raised the possibility that inflationary pressures might not, in fact, be

as benign as had been thought. The data would need to be analysed carefully in order to form a

judgment on how erratic they were.

33 Various arguments – again given different weights by different members – were also identified

for cutting the repo rate. First, the central projection for inflation was below the 2½% target

throughout the two-year forecast period. That created a prima facie case for a rate cut, especially

given the need for symmetry in policy reactions. Second, it was possible that the US economy might

not recover steadily this year given the possibility of a continuing investment overhang, of households

and firms repairing balance sheets stretched by the build up of debt and of a further equity market


-----

Irish Bank losses, and from Japan – of somewhat greater financial fragility, which might dampen asset

prices, reducing wealth and increasing the cost of capital. Fourth, for some members the central

projections for output and inflation were too high, as reported in Table 6.B of the Inflation Report; and

the balance of risks for both was clearly on the downside. There was too much uncertainty for weight

to be given to the implied projection beyond two years and thus to the slope of the projection at the

two-year horizon. The arguments for delay did not appear convincing given that, despite the buoyancy

of consumption, GDP was expected in the short term to remain growing at below trend and that the

main risk to consumption further out was on the downside. The upside risk to inflation from a possible

sterling depreciation built into the published fan charts was not relevant to the immediate policy

decision. The risks to sterling might not even be on the downside and the associated inflationary

implications had almost certainly been overestimated. Moreover, if sterling did fall, there would be

time to assess and react to the potential medium-term inflationary implications. The implications of

imbalances for policy were not clear-cut. For example, not cutting rates because of concerns about

growing household indebtedness might imply a higher exchange rate than otherwise, which could

increase future inflation volatility. It would, therefore, be a mistake to keep interest rates higher

because of the imbalances, as there was no compelling, commonly agreed reason to do so, and there

was, therefore, a risk of compromising the transparency and predictability of policy. On that view, a

further modest cut was, therefore, needed now in order to meet the inflation target, and there were no

good tactical reasons for delay.

34 The Governor invited members to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate should be

maintained at 4%. Seven members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King, David Clementi,

Kate Barker, Charles Bean, Stephen Nickell and Ian Plenderleith) voted in favour. Christopher

Allsopp and Sushil Wadhwani voted against, preferring a reduction in the repo rate of 25 basis points.

**ANNEX: SUMMARY OF DATA PRESENTED BY BANK STAFF**

A1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee

on 1 February 2002, in advance of its meeting on 6-7 February. At the start of the Committee meeting

itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that

information is included in this Annex.

**I** **The international environment**

A2 According to the advance estimate, US GDP in 2001 Q4 had grown by 0.1% on a quarter

earlier, following a fall of 0.3% in Q3. Consumption had grown by 1.3% on a quarter earlier, with

sales of motor vehicles having risen by 16%. Investment had fallen by 2.9% in Q4, though investment

in information and communications technology (ICT) goods had risen by 0.1% on a quarter earlier, the

first increase for four quarters. Declining inventories had made a further negative contribution to GDP

growth, of -0.6 percentage points. Both imports and exports had continued to fall, with net trade

contributing -0.2 percentage points to GDP growth in Q4. Non-farm business sector productivity had

grown by 0.9% on the previous quarter.

A3 The Conference Board and University of Michigan measures of US consumer confidence had

risen in January. The Conference Board measure had risen to 97.3, from 94.6 in December, while the

Michigan measure had risen to 93.0, from 88.8. Both rises had been accounted for by increases in the

future expectations components of the indices. New orders for non-defence capital goods had

increased for the third consecutive month in December, by 0.9% on a month earlier. The Institute for

Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing sector purchasing managers’ index had also increased, to

49.9 in January from 48.2 in December. The headline business activity index for the

non-manufacturing ISM survey had fallen to 49.6 in January, from 50.1 in December. Non-farm

payrolls had fallen by 89,000 in January, following a 130,000 fall in December. The unemployment

rate had fallen to 5.6% in January from 5.8% in December. Initial unemployment insurance claims had

declined again in January.

A4 The Federal Statistics Office in Germany had released an initial (working-day adjusted)

estimate for GDP growth in 2001 of 0.8%, down from 3.2% in 2000. The Bank of France had released

an estimate for French GDP growth of 2 1% in 2001 In the euro area industrial production had fallen


-----

in November by 0.8% on a month earlier. Euro-area retail sales had increased by 1.2% in the same

month, reversing the 1.0% fall that had occurred in October.

A5 The euro-area purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector had risen to 46.2

in January from 44.1 in December, the third consecutive monthly increase. The service sector PMI had

also increased, to 51.0 in January from 49.2 in December. The confidence indicator in the European

Commission business survey had risen in January, to -14 from -17 in December. The confidence

indicator in the consumer survey had weakened slightly over the same period. In France, the National

Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) manufacturers’ confidence index had increased in

January, due to an improvement in the expectations of future conditions sub-index. The Italian Institute

of Economic Studies (ISAE) business confidence index had also improved in December. In Germany,

the IFO index of business confidence in western Germany had increased to 86.3 in January from 85.8

in December, with the increase concentrated in the manufacturing sector. The Centre for European

Economic Research (ZEW) index of economic sentiment had risen to 35.9 in January from 25.8 in

December. The German unemployment rate had increased in January to 9.6%, from 9.5% in

December.

A6 In Japan, industrial production had increased by 2.1% in December on a month earlier. The

level of industrial production in 2001 Q4 had been 2.4% below that in Q3. Inventories had also

declined in Q4, by 3.4%. Electrical machinery production had increased in December by 3.5% on a

month earlier, the first monthly rise since December 2000. Electrical machinery inventories had

continued to decline, falling by 4.4% in December. Export volumes had declined by 15.3% in the year

to December. Real retail sales (deflated by the consumer price index) had fallen by 1.9% in 2001 Q4.

A7 South Korean industrial production had grown in December by 3.3% on a year earlier, while the

rate of decline in industrial production in Taiwan had continued to slow. The Consensus Economics

survey of GDP growth forecasts for South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia in 2002 had been

revised up in January. The 2002 Consensus forecast for China had remained unchanged between

December and January, at 7.2%. Industrial production in Argentina had fallen in December by 18.3%

on a year earlier. The Consensus forecast for growth in 2002 in Argentina had been revised down to

-8.2% in January from -3.3% in December, while the forecast for Brazil had remained unchanged at

2.1%.


-----

A8 The spot price for Brent crude oil had remained little changed from the time of the Committee’s

previous meeting, at around $20 per barrel. The Economist all-item dollar price index had also been

little changed from the Committee’s previous meeting. The industrial metals index had fallen by 4%

over the same period, but remained 10% above its mid-November level. The Economist non-food

agricultural commodities price index had risen by 6%; the food commodity index had fallen by 1%.

The price of computer memory chips had fallen since the Committee’s previous meeting, but remained

substantially above the low point in prices reached in the autumn.

A9 In the United States, producer prices had fallen by 1.8% in the year to December, following a

1.1% fall in the year to November. The fall had been largely attributable to weaker energy prices. Core

producer prices, excluding food and energy, had risen by 0.7% in the year to December. Annual

consumer price inflation in the United States had fallen to 1.6% in December from 1.9% in November,

which had again been attributable to the decline in energy prices. Annual core consumer price inflation

had fallen to 2.7% in December from 2.8% in November. Producer prices in the euro area had fallen

by 1.3% in the year to November and by 1.1% in the year to December. German producer prices had

risen by 0.1% in the year to December. The euro-area harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP)

had risen by 2.1% in the year to December, unchanged from November. The preliminary estimate for

annual euro-area HICP inflation in January suggested a rise to 2.5%. Preliminary annual German HICP

inflation had been 2.2% in January, up from 1.5% in December. The rise had been attributable to

increases in indirect taxes and seasonal food prices.

A10 Major international equity indices had fallen since 9 January. In the United States, the S&P 500

had fallen by 6.2%; in the euro area, the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx index had fallen by 5.7%; and, in

Japan, the Topix had fallen by 10.0%. Spreads over government bonds in the Merrill Lynch aggregate

indices of investment-grade corporate bonds had risen for dollar and euro issuance.

**II** **Monetary and financial conditions**

A11 The twelve-month growth rate of notes and coin had fallen slightly to 8.0% in January from (a

revised) 8.2% in December. The three-month annualised growth rate had risen to 10.1% in January,

compared with 8.6% in December. The twelve-month growth rate of M4 had fallen substantially, to

6.7% in December compared with 8.0% in November. The twelve-month growth rate of M4 lending

(excluding the effects of securitisations) had fallen to 8 9% in December


-----

A12 The twelve-month growth rate of households’ M4 had fallen to 8.0% in December. The

twelve-month growth rate of households’ Divisia had remained above that of households’ M4 growth,

at 9.2% in 2001 Q4. The twelve-month growth rate of households’ M4 lending (excluding the effects

of securitisations) had risen to 11.0% in December.

A13 Within total lending to individuals, annual growth of secured lending had risen to 10.2% in

December. The number of loan approvals for house purchases had risen slightly, and the annual

growth rate of unsecured lending had risen to 14.0% in December.

A14 The twelve-month growth rate of private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs’) M4 deposits had

risen to 6.8% in December. The twelve-month growth rate of PNFCs’ M4 lending (excluding the

effects of securitisations) had fallen to 8.5%. The average monthly flow of total external corporate

finance had fallen to £3.3 billion in 2001 Q4. Growth of sterling lending to the manufacturing sector

had contracted rapidly in 2001 Q4, although growth of lending to the real estate, construction and

services sectors had remained strong. Corporates’ net recourse (calculated using M4 lending adjusted

for the effects of securitisations) was positive in 2001 Q4 at £0.5 billion.

A15 The twelve-month growth rate of other financial corporations’ (OFCs’) M4 deposits had fallen

sharply in December, to 3.4%. The twelve-month growth rate of OFCs’ M4 lending (excluding the

effects of securitisations) had also fallen sharply in December, to 4.1%.

A16 Short-term nominal interest rates had fallen at all but the very shortest maturities since the

Committee’s previous meeting. The general collateral repo two-week forward rate had fallen by

around 35 basis points six months ahead. The rate one year ahead had fallen since the Committee’s

previous meeting, but remained much higher than the official repo rate and higher than it had been in

November. The spread between this forward rate and the official repo rate had been close to

1 percentage point for most of the period since late December – close to the peaks seen in 1996 and

1999/2000, but below the peak of 1994. The high spread had been consistent with market expectations

of a rise in the repo rate and a pick-up in GDP growth even though, on average in the past, actual

official repo rates had tended to be lower than the rates suggested by earlier forward rates. Longer
term nominal forward rates at all maturities had also fallen over the month. Real yields had risen at


-----

maturities beyond ten years. This may partly have reflected the impact of the index-linked gilt auction

on 24 January.

A17 Inflation expectations derived from gilts at all maturities had fallen since the Committee’s

previous meeting. The size of the falls may have been exaggerated to the extent that there had been

any effect on real yields from the index-linked gilt auction.  Monthly inflation expectations of

participants in HMT’s survey for 2002 Q4 had remained unchanged at 2.1%, while the Consensus

Economics year-average forecast for 2002 had fallen to 2.0% in January. Inflation expectations for

2003 from these surveys had been a Q4 value of 2.4% from the HMT survey and a year-average of

2.3% from the Consensus Economics survey.

A18 Quoted credit card rates had fallen by 27 basis points in January. The standard variable rate for

mortgages had remained unchanged in January. The two-year discounted rate had fallen by 1 basis

point. The two-year fixed mortgage rate had risen by 19 basis points, and the spread over two-year

swaps had narrowed.

A19 Spreads over gilts of investment-grade corporate bonds issued in sterling in the Merrill Lynch

aggregate index had fallen since the Committee’s previous meeting. Non-gilt sterling bond issuance

had been less strong in January than in December. Retail lending rates to PNFCs had continued to fall

in December.

A20 The FTSE All-Share and FTSE 100 indices had fallen by 3.4% and 3.0% respectively since the

Committee’s previous meeting, but were little changed since the end of October. The FTSE Small Cap

and FTSE 250 indices had fallen by 6.2% and 5.3% respectively over the same period. The

information technology and non-cyclical services sectors had been particularly weak. The number of

profit warnings issued in January had fallen slightly compared with December, and had been less than

in January 2001. A decomposition of changes in the FTSE 100 had suggested that, over the previous

six months, the fall of around 5% had been accounted for primarily by weaker reported and prospective

profits. There was little change in the estimate of the equity risk premium over this period as a whole.

The picture was similar for the S&P 500 in the United States.

A21 Since 9 January, the sterling exchange rate index (ERI) had fallen by 0.1% to 106.8. This

reflected a 1 7% depreciation of sterling against the US dollar and a 0 5% appreciation of sterling


-----

against the euro. Relative movements in nominal yields at shorter maturities would have suggested a

larger depreciation in effective terms, concentrated against the euro.

**III** **Demand and output**

A22 The preliminary ONS estimate of GDP growth in 2001 Q4 had shown quarterly growth easing

to 0.2%, from 0.5% in Q3. Annual GDP growth had slowed to 1.9% in 2001 Q4 from 2.2% in Q3.

Service sector output had risen by 0.9% in Q4, compared with growth of 0.6% in Q3. Within services,

output in the distribution, hotels and catering sector had increased by 0.4% in Q4, down from 1.3% in

Q3.

A23 The December industrial production data had been made available to the Committee in time for

its meeting. Manufacturing output had fallen by 0.5% in December, and by 1.7% in 2001 Q4. The

quarterly fall mainly reflected a sharp fall in the output of the electrical and optical equipment, and

basic metal and metal products, industries.

A24 Retail sales had declined by 0.3% in December. They had risen by 1.3% in 2001 Q4, and by

6.2% in Q4 compared with a year earlier. Looking forward, the Confederation of British Industry

(CBI) survey of distributive trades had suggested that retail sales would continue to be strong over

coming months: the expected sales balance had risen to +25 in February from +19 in January. New

private car registrations had been 25.8% higher in 2001 Q4 than a year earlier, and were 5.1% higher in

January than a year earlier.

A25 The GfK consumer confidence index had risen to +6.4 in January from -0.6 in December. The

MORI measure of consumer confidence had risen to -20 in January from -29 in November. On

business confidence, the CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends business optimism balance had increased

from -54 in October to -31 in January.

A26 The Nationwide house price index had risen by 0.2% in January, and by 2.7% in the three

months to January compared with the three months to October. The Halifax house price index had

risen by 1.6% on the month in January and prices on a three-month basis had been 4.6% higher. The

Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ (RICS) balance of estate agents reporting increased prices

over the previous three months had risen from +29 in December to +46 in January Particulars


-----

delivered had fallen by 6,000 to 125,000 in December but were 11.6% higher than a year ago. Loan

approvals had risen slightly to 111,000 in December from 110,000 in the previous month.

A27 Annual net rates of return for PNFCs were broadly unchanged at 12.2% in Q3. Within these,

annual net rates of return for the manufacturing and services sectors were 4.3% and 12.5% respectively

in 2001 Q3. Investment intentions in the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) Q4 survey for both

service sector and manufacturing firms had continued to decline and had been around the lowest since

the early 1990s. The CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey for 2001 Q4 had indicated that

investment intentions had not bounced back after 11 September: the balance of firms expecting to

increase investment in plant and machinery was unchanged at -28 in the January survey compared with

October.

A28 Export and import volume growth for goods had fallen in November: goods exports had fallen

by 4.4% and goods imports by 3.5% in the three months to November compared with the previous

three months. In 2001 Q4, exports of goods to the non-EU had risen by 1.7% on the previous quarter

whilst imports of goods from the non-EU had fallen by 0.1%.

A29 Forward-looking survey data on the service sector had been mixed. The BCC service sector

orders balances had fallen in 2001 Q4: home orders had decreased to +10 from +14 in Q3, whilst

export orders had fallen to -8 from +1 over the same period. The headline Chartered Institute of

Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) services index had risen to 51.4 in December, from 49.4 in November.

The CIPS services incoming new business balance had increased to 51.9 in January from 50.5 in

December.

A30 In manufacturing, the CIPS manufacturing survey in January had shown signs of improvement

in both output and new orders, although both indices had remained below 50. The CBI Quarterly

Industrial Trends survey had indicated an improvement in orders compared with three months ago: the

expected balance had risen to -12 in January from -25 in October. The BCC home order balance had

also shown an improvement: the balance had increased to -6 in 2001 Q4 from -12 in Q3. The CIPS

construction index had risen to 54.0 in January from 52.9 in December.


-----

**IV** **Labour market**

A31 Labour Force Survey (LFS) employment had increased by 65,000 (0.2%) in the three months to

November 2001, compared with the previous three months. This had reflected rises in both female

employment (37,000) and part-time employment (43,000). At 74.6%, the working-age employment

rate had remained unchanged on the quarter, but had been 0.1 percentage points higher than a year ago.

A32 Despite the growth in employment, the total number of hours worked had fallen by 0.6% in the

September to November period, compared with three months before. Average weekly hours worked

per person employed had fallen by 0.7% in the latest quarter. The fall in hours had largely reflected

lower overtime working.

A33 The CIPS employment surveys for January had suggested that overall employment had

continued to decline at the same pace as in December. This had reflected continued employment falls

in both manufacturing and services, while employment in construction had continued to rise, although

at a slower pace than in December. Forward-looking surveys by the BCC and CBI had suggested a

further weakening of employment intentions in manufacturing and services.

A34 Survey evidence on skill shortages had suggested a mixed picture. The CBI Industrial Trends

survey had reported a sharp fall in manufacturing skill shortages in 2001 Q4, to below its long-run

average. On the other hand, the CBI/PwC survey had suggested that shortages of professionals in

financial services intensified in December and the BCC survey had indicated that the proportion of

firms who faced recruitment difficulties remained high. The latest reports by the Bank's regional

Agents had suggested that skill shortages had been unchanged.

A35 The LFS measure of unemployment had increased by 15,000 in the three months to November

compared with three months earlier, though the rate had remained unchanged at 5.1%. Claimant count

unemployment had been broadly flat over the same period but had risen by 3,200 in December. The

claimant rate had remained unchanged at 3.2%. Claimant outflows had picked up a little in December,

while inflows had remained flat.

A36 Inactivity amongst those of working age had fallen by 15,000 (0.2%) in the three months to

November compared with the previous three months


-----

A37 Whole-economy headline earnings growth, a three-month moving average of the annual

monthly rates, had been 4.2% in November, down 0.1 percentage points from October. This easing in

the headline rate had largely reflected slower headline pay growth in the public (-0.3 percentage points)

and manufacturing (-0.7 percentage points) sectors which had offset higher earnings growth in private

sector services (+0.2 percentage points). The twelve-month growth rate of earnings had fallen back to

3.9% from 4.4% in October. Whole-economy regular pay growth (not seasonally adjusted) had also

fallen, from 5% in October to 4.6% in November. The contribution of bonuses reduced whole
economy earnings growth by 0.9 percentage points (not seasonally adjusted) in November.

A38 The Bank's AEI-weighted twelve-month mean measure of whole-economy settlements had been

unchanged in December at 3.3%. It had been unchanged since April. On the basis of information

available at the time of the meeting, it had appeared that settlements for January were turning out to be

a little lower than the December figures.

A39 Details of the 2002-03 settlement for teachers in England and Wales covered by the School

Teachers' Review Body had been announced on 23 January. The average settlement had been an

increase of 3.5% in 2002-03 compared with 3.7% last year. The settlement for those members of the

Armed Forces covered by the Armed Forces Pay Review Board had been announced on 29 January.

The average settlement had been an increase of 3.7%, the same as last year. Both settlements were due

to take effect on 1 April.

**V** **Prices**

A40 The Bank’s sterling commodity price index had risen by 0.8% between November and

December. Prices of metals had fallen by 4.6% in December but this had been more than offset by a

1.2% rise in the prices of domestic food and a 1.0% rise in the price of fuels. The annual inflation rate

of the commodity price index had picked up to -6.8% in December from -11.8% in November.

A41 Oil prices had been volatile over recent months, but had remained at low levels following the

sharp fall at the end of September 2001. In January, average sterling oil prices had been about 6%

higher than their average level in December.


-----

A42 Manufacturing input prices had fallen by 0.7% in December, as a 4.7% fall in crude oil prices

had more than offset a 1.2% rise in domestic food prices. Annual input price deflation had eased

sharply because of base effects, but prices were still 6.6% lower than a year earlier. Looking ahead, the

CIPS manufacturing survey had continued to point to falling input prices. The input price balance had

fallen to 39.3 in January, from 40.8 in December.

A43 Manufacturing output prices both including and excluding duties (PPIY) had been unchanged

between November and December. The annual inflation rate of total output prices had risen to -1.2%

and that of PPIY had been unchanged at -0.4% in December.

A44 Output prices had risen by less than manufacturers’ total weighted costs since mid-1997. In

2001, weighted costs growth had eased significantly as falls in input prices had been offset by rises in

unit labour costs. The CBI Quarterly Trends survey had shown that both average unit costs and output

prices were expected to fall in 2002 Q1 – the balances had been -11 and -23 respectively.

A45 The CIPS service sector survey had shown a rise in the average prices charged index to 51.1 in

January from 49.8 in December, and a rise in the average input prices to 53.7 in January from 51.1 in

December.

A46 Annual RPIX inflation had risen by 0.1 percentage points to 1.9% in December. The rise had

mainly reflected rises of 0.2 percentage points in annual goods price inflation to -0.3%, and 0.1

percentage points in annual services price inflation, to 4.1%. There were no major changes in the

contributions of any of the individual components. Annual RPI inflation had fallen by 0.2 percentage

points to 0.7% in December. Annual RPIY inflation had risen to 2.3% in December from 2.2% in

November, while annual HICP inflation had risen by 0.2 percentage points to 1.0% in December.

**VI** **Reports by the Bank’s Agents**

A47 The Bank’s regional Agents had reported that manufacturing output and orders had continued to

fall, and that there had been no clear sign of any slowing in the rate of decline. Aerospace output had

fallen further and there had been no signs of recovery in the ICT sector. Manufacturers supplying to


-----

the consumer market had continued to report modest growth in output. The trend to moving production

away from the United Kingdom had intensified.

A48 Overall, there had been an improvement in activity in the service sector. Growth in consumer

services output had remained robust. There had been a recovery in overseas holiday bookings, except

to the United States. Contacts had also reported an increase in demand for domestic holidays. There

had been a slight recovery in output growth in the business services sector, following a particularly

sharp decline in growth after 11 September.

A49 Construction output growth had stabilised at a high level. Within this, there had been an easing

in commercial and industrial construction. But demand for retail construction had remained robust, and

there had been continued strong growth in demand from the public sector. The housing market had

remained strong, although house price inflation had begun to ease for properties at the top end of the

market.

A50 Growth in retail sales had continued to increase. Contacts had reported that spending

immediately before Christmas and in the ‘sales’ afterwards had been higher than during the same

period in 2000. Sales of new and used cars had remained very strong.

A51 Raw materials costs had continued to fall, offsetting increases in the price of non-material costs,

particularly insurance. Falls in raw material prices had generally fed through to manufacturers’ output

prices. Retail prices had been stable. There were reports that January discounting had been on a

narrower range of stock in 2002 than in 2001, due to better stock control by retailers.

A52 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted an informal survey of around 280 firms on the

prospects for earnings growth in 2002. Of the firms sampled that had a company-wide settlement, 15%

had expected it to be higher in percentage terms in 2002 than in 2001, while 33% had expected their

settlement to be lower. Growth in total pay per employee in 2002 compared with 2001 had been

expected to be higher by 28% of the respondents, while 34% had expected it to be lower. The outlook

for inflation had been highlighted as the main downward pressure on pay growth in 2002. The main

source of upward pressures cited was the recruitment and retention of staff, especially in the retail and

construction sectors.


-----

A53 In reports outside the survey, Agents had noted falls in manufacturing employment and a further

easing in service sector employment. But recruitment had remained strong in the public sector and in

the leisure services and construction industries.

**VII** **Market intelligence**

A54 Since the previous Committee meeting, rates implied by short sterling futures contracts had

fallen. Rates implied by the contract expiring in March 2002 had fallen by 16 basis points over the

period, and those by the December 2002 contract by 48 basis points, to 5.03%. These falls partly

reflected lower-than-expected retail sales data, and also perhaps some reversal of technical factors after

the year-end. In common with rates implied by eurodollar and euribor contracts, implied rates had

fallen following Chairman Greenspan’s comments on 11 January. Following Chairman Greenspan’s

comments on 24 January and higher-than-expected UK GDP data on 25 January, some of the fall in

implied rates had been reversed. Towards the end of the period, implied rates had fallen in response to

falls in world equity prices, and weaker-than-expected non-farm payrolls and ISM data.

A55 Market participants had generally expected the Committee not to change the Bank’s official

repo rate in February. Similarly, economists polled by Reuters between 29 and 31 January had

attached a mean probability of only 22% to a reduction in the Bank’s official repo rate. In line with

information from short sterling futures contracts, a majority of traders had expected the official rate to

increase before the end of 2002.

A56 The US dollar had appreciated in effective terms by 1.3% since the Committee’s previous

meeting and had reached a new 15-year high of 124.9 on 25 January. Market participants had

attributed the dollar’s rise to an improved outlook for the US economy in comparison with other areas.

Sterling had depreciated by 0.1% in effective terms and had traded in the top half of its range for last

year of 104 to 108; it had risen by 0.5% against the euro but had fallen by 1.7% against the dollar.

Sterling’s movements had appeared to be influenced mainly by external factors, as there had been

relatively little reaction from the foreign exchange market to UK domestic news.
