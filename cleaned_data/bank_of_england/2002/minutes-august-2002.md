#### MINUTES OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 31 JULY AND 1 AUGUST 2002

1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, and against the background of its latest

projections for output and inflation, the Committee discussed the world economy; money, credit and

the exchange rate; demand and output; the labour market; prices and costs; and some other

considerations.

**The world economy**

2 Over the month since the July MPC meeting, there had been further substantial falls in equity

prices around the world. In domestic currency terms, the Wilshire index had fallen 4%, the Dow

Jones Eurostoxx index 8%, the Topix index 7½% and the FTSE All-Share index 4%. Major indices

(apart from Japan’s) were some 20% below the average levels used as a starting point in the May

_Inflation Report; and some of the ‘high tech’ indices were 30% or so lower. Indices had been more_

volatile, too, and uncertainty about future prices had risen, judging by the expected volatility implied

by options prices.

3 According to the first estimate of US GDP in 2002 Q2, the quarterly growth rate was 0.3%,

slightly lower than expected. The growth rate of private investment, at 0.1%, although modest, was

the first positive figure in seven quarters, and suggested that the divergence between consumption

and investment growth might be narrowing a little. Substantial revisions to past data meant that

GDP growth was now estimated to have fallen in the first three quarters of 2001, not just in the third

quarter, and the estimated level of GDP in 2002 Q1 had been revised down by 1.3%. As a result, the

implied growth rate of productivity in 2001 was now significantly lower. Both consumption and

investment were affected by the revisions, but the revision to the estimate of firms’ spending on

computers – a reduction of 16% – was particularly marked. Any ‘capital overhang’ from excessive

investment in ICT was consequently likely to be less than previously thought, so the prospects for

investment might to that extent have improved. Forward-looking indicators in July, however,

suggested some deterioration in the economic outlook. For example, the Conference Board measure

of consumer confidence had fallen to 97.1, from 106.3 in June, and the Michigan measure to 88.1,

from 92.4 in the previous month – for both measures, the second monthly fall in a row. While these

data pointed to a more gradual and subdued recovery, it was important to remember that some


-----

slowing from the sharply higher rate of GDP growth in 2002 Q1, now estimated to have been 1.2%,

had been expected, given the one-off boost in that quarter from the turnaround in the inventory cycle.

4 News from the euro area was not reassuring about the robustness of the recovery there. There

had been signs that activity had been lower than previously suggested by surveys, and now those

forward-looking indicators were weakening too. Based on April and May data, it seemed likely that

euro-area industrial production had fallen slightly in 2002 Q2, after rising 0.6% in Q1. Both

consumer and industrial confidence in the euro area had fallen in June (the latest month for which

comprehensive data were available). German, French, Italian and Belgian industrial confidence had

fallen in July. Moreover, the outlook for external demand was likely to have deteriorated because of

the rise in the euro’s effective exchange rate during the second quarter. One factor behind the

particular weakness of output in Germany might have been relatively high costs and output prices; if

that were the case, activity might continue to be relatively weak while the German price level fell

relative to the levels in other countries, including those in the euro area, leading to a depreciation of

Germany’s real exchange rate. But German labour costs had always been relatively high, and that

had not prevented net external demand making an important contribution to German growth.

5 Against this background, the Committee discussed the probable causes and implications of the

falls in equity prices. The news about real economic activity since the May Inflation Report had

perhaps suggested that the global recovery was marginally less robust than previously expected, but

that did not seem to be sufficient to explain the size of the equity price adjustments. It was puzzling

now that the falls had been relatively uniform across most industrial countries, just as it had been

puzzling that equity prices outside the United States had increased as much as they had in the second

half of the 1990s, given the relative rates of productivity growth. In the United States, the continuing

debate about corporate governance, the reliability of corporate accounts and events such as

WorldCom’s filing for protection under Chapter 11 on 21 July might have led to a view that the

outlook for corporate profitability was weaker than previously priced into the equity market. The

increase in the implied volatility of share prices suggested that uncertainty about corporate earnings

had increased, and that would have reinforced the impact on those prices of any adverse shock to the

outlook for profits. It was difficult to identify comparable factors affecting profit expectations

outside the United States, so the size of the equity price falls elsewhere was perhaps surprising.

Conventional valuation methods suggested that, even allowing for factors that might have increased

equilibrium price earnings ratios equity prices in the United States might still embody unduly


-----

optimistic expectations of corporate earnings growth. Nevertheless, over the week before the MPC

meeting, the US market had proved quite resilient to disappointing data releases (such as the

Q2 US GDP numbers), and market movements had been less correlated with the dollar, perhaps

suggesting that domestic and foreign investors might have become more confident about valuation

levels recently. It was also notable that US markets had reacted favourably to the signing into law on

30 July of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, designed to protect investors by improving the accuracy and

reliability of corporate disclosures, and addressing many of the perceived corporate malpractices

recently in the public eye.

6 Given the uncertainty about why equity markets had fallen, it was difficult to estimate the

likely impact of these falls on economic activity. But in broad terms, they were likely to depress

both investment, by increasing the cost of capital, and consumption, by reducing household wealth.

The impact on consumption was likely to differ across households, depending on the level and

composition of their financial wealth. Direct holders of equities were likely to see a clear and

immediate change in their wealth. The impact on households whose exposures to equities were less

direct, for example through pension funds and life insurance, was likely to be slower and less certain,

to an extent that would depend on the nature of the saving products held. It could reinforce other

factors, such as increasing life expectancy, that might encourage people to save more. But it was

noted that long-standing projections of increased funding problems for state pension schemes in

several countries, which might also have been expected to stimulate higher saving, appeared to have

had little effect on consumers’ behaviour.

7 The deterioration in the prospects for some Latin American countries’ finances did not appear

to have had a substantial effect on international financial markets over the past month. Argentina’s

problems had not been resolved, Brazilian sovereign debt spreads had increased sharply, and there

had been pressure on the Uruguayan banking system from deposit withdrawals. But investors still

did not seem to regard these difficulties as symptomatic of a broader problem; unlike in 1997-98,

there was no sign yet that this might trigger a generalised reduction in appetite for emerging-market

assets, or for risky assets generally. Recent developments in Latin America were unlikely to have a

significant impact on the US recovery; and in contrast, the Canadian economy, which was more

important for US trade, was performing better than expected.


-----

8 The economic recovery in non-Japan Asia remained strong, although it was likely to be

particularly dependent on future US developments. There was little reason to change the

Committee’s judgment that the short-term prospects for Japan remained subdued.

**Money, credit and the exchange rate**

9 The UK monetary data over the past month were consistent with continuing robust economic

growth. Household M4 borrowing had stayed strong, growing at an annual rate of 12.5% in June,

but had not materially accelerated further. On the corporate side, the divergence between the

borrowing behaviour of the manufacturing and the non-financial services sectors had widened over

the past year, with the former, in aggregate, repaying sterling bank loans at a faster rate in recent

quarters, while the latter continued to be net borrowers. Committee members thought it unlikely that

this reflected any change in the relative willingness of banks to supply finance to manufacturing.

The net repayment of loans might suggest that manufacturers still saw few opportunities for

profitable investment; rates of return in manufacturing remained much lower on average than in

services, and indeed new estimates of manufacturing profitability had revealed that it had been lower

than previously thought. Another possibility was that some manufacturers might have been

substituting funds borrowed on the capital markets (including in foreign currencies) for bank loans,

for example, to help finance investment overseas.

10 Sterling had appreciated by 2½% in effective terms over the past month, and was now at a

level similar to the 15 working-day average used as a starting point in the May Inflation Report. The

appreciation had taken place at a time when bilateral rates between the dollar, euro and yen had been

relatively stable (in contrast to May and June). In principle, it could have reflected an increase in the

attractiveness of investing in the production of tradable services in the United Kingdom relative to

elsewhere, but there was little evidence to corroborate that hypothesis at the moment. Anecdote in

the foreign exchange market suggested that, to many market participants, the economic performance

of the United Kingdom appeared relatively stronger, partly as a result of the strong preliminary

estimate for the growth of GDP in 2002 Q2, and there was more confidence about the UK

authorities’ likely policy responses to economic shocks. However, if that were the case, it was

puzzling that the performance of the UK stock market had not also been better.


-----

**Demand and output**

11 According to the ONS’ first estimate, GDP in 2002 Q2 grew by 0.9% over the previous

quarter. That broadly confirmed earlier signals from surveys of a pick-up in growth. But the special

factors of the Jubilee long weekend, the World Cup, and the movement of a Bank Holiday from May

to June made it difficult to assess the underlying pattern of demand and output; as well as the

arithmetic impact of changes in the number of working days, there may have been temporary

changes in firms’ and households’ behaviour. At a sectoral level, manufacturing output had been a

little higher than expected in April and May; but the growth of services output had been a little

lower than expected in Q2 as a whole. The most recent CIPS survey evidence, for July, suggested

that new orders in manufacturing were falling and output was flat, but that services output and new

business were continuing to grow. The Bank’s regional Agents’ contacts had reported a gradual, but

patchy, recovery in manufacturing.

12 The Bank’s Agents had reported that investment intentions had stalled recently but had not so

far been significantly affected by the earlier falls in equity markets. Consumption growth appeared

to have picked up in Q2. There were some signs from the June retail sales figures and the latest CBI

distributive trades survey that it might have eased a little around the end of the quarter, but consumer

confidence on the GfK measure was little changed in July after seasonal adjustment, and household

borrowing growth had hardly slackened. The Agents’ contacts suggested that consumption remained

fairly firm, with some signs of a rebound in July from a weaker June. The recently announced

details of the Government’s public spending plans, in the Comprehensive Spending Review, did not

materially change the fiscal outlook.

13 The drop in equity prices already experienced was likely to affect investment and consumption.

Consumers might save more to attempt to restore their financial wealth, including the value of

prospective pensions. In the case of corporate defined-benefit pension schemes, the wealth effect

would be borne by the shareholders of the sponsoring firms rather than by the scheme members; but

it might take some time for the implications of equity market developments to become clear to those

shareholders. The implementation of accounting standard FRS17 in the United Kingdom was

making any funding shortfalls more visible. The possibility of increased precautionary saving as a

result of doubts about the permanence of existing pension scheme arrangements on the part of

scheme members was a downside risk to consumption In the United States a similar proportion of


-----

pension scheme assets was held in defined-contribution plans as in defined-benefit schemes, a much

higher share than in the United Kingdom, where defined-benefit schemes still dominated the pension

component of household financial wealth; in continental Europe, assets in private pension schemes

of either sort tended to be much lower. That was one of the factors pointing to the likelihood of a

bigger impact of the equity price falls on consumption in the short run in the United States than

elsewhere. The financial wealth of consumers in the United Kingdom, compared with much of the

rest of Europe, was probably more sensitive to the price falls, because of the greater exposure to

equities through with-profits life insurance policies (including those embodied in endowment

mortgages) and equity mutual funds. The Committee expected only a modest rise in the UK saving

ratio, but acknowledged that recent asset price developments had increased the uncertainty about this

projection.

14 One factor continuing to bolster consumption was the strength of the housing market. The

latest house price data from both the Nationwide and Halifax showed an acceleration over the past

three months; both now pointed to an annual rate of increase of over 20%. Looking forward,

however, Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ data on new buyer enquiries and house price

expectations and a special survey by the Bank’s regional Agents suggested that more people were

expecting the market to slow in the second half of the year. Demand in the buy-to-let market

appeared to be weakening, although the summer holiday season could have been at least partly

responsible, and some indicators of housing market activity, such as particulars delivered, had fallen.

This was consistent with what would be expected if the demand for housing had started to decelerate.

But mortgage approvals were still running at a high rate, after allowing for the number of working

days in June, and this apparent slowdown in housing market activity could prove short-lived, as had

some pauses in the past.

15 The Committee reviewed the question of whether or not the current level of house prices was

unsustainable. There were several reasons why the ratio of house prices to earnings might now be

higher in the long run. First, in an environment of lower inflation, the real value of initial mortgage

payments for first-time buyers was lower for any given term and interest rate (less ‘front loading’ of

mortgage payments), making housing more affordable for liquidity-constrained households. Second,

the supply of houses had fallen relative to the number of households. And, third, continuing

financial liberalisation and competition had relaxed quantitative limits on mortgage lending.


-----

16 Overall, the prospect continued to be for a modest strengthening of aggregate demand. But the

falls in equity markets around the world were likely to bring about lower growth in both investment

and consumption than expected in May and constituted a source of significant uncertainty about the

outlook.

**The labour market**

17 There was little news on the month to suggest that labour market pressures had changed

significantly. On the LFS measure, unemployment stood at 5.2% in May, and had been broadly flat

for some time. Regular pay growth had been 3.9% in the year to May, much the same as in April.

Looking forward, it was likely that the large wedge between the growth rates of the consumption

wage – average earnings compared with the tax and price index (TPI) – and the product wage –

employers’ wage costs compared with the GDP deflator – would diminish. Import prices were

expected to edge up a little faster and the planned National Insurance increases would lead to an

increase in the tax element of the TPI. Indeed, TPI inflation, which had been negative for several

months, had picked up and, since April, had been close to the rate of increase of the RPI. The

expected slowdown in the growth of the consumption wage was consistent with the outlook for

slower consumption growth. It might also increase upward pressure on nominal wages in the future

to the extent that workers tried to maintain real wage growth; that was an upside risk to cost

pressures.

18 Wage settlements had varied across sectors. Public sector settlements had exceeded those in

the private sector since early 1999, but there were few signs of any spillovers. It seemed less likely

that the public sector pay pressures would affect manufacturing than services, given the type of skills

in demand in the public sector and the fact that, where the same type of skills were in demand, wages

still tended to be higher in manufacturing than in private services.

**Prices and costs**

19 Annual RPIX inflation was 1.5% in June. This was lower than had been expected at the time

of the May inflation projection. The Committee discussed the reasons for the June outturn and the

prospects for the annual inflation rate over the next few months. First, most of the weakness of

annual RPIX inflation in June reflected the historically low contribution of two volatile components


-----

of the RPI: seasonal food and petrol prices. That reflected a fall of around 15% in seasonal food

prices from their flood-related high levels last year, together with a significant fall in oil prices,

which in June were around 20% lower than a year earlier. The annual inflation rate of RPIX

excluding seasonal food and petrol was 2.2% in June. Second, annual RPIX inflation had fallen by

1.1 percentage points since its recent peak in January. This fall was entirely accounted for by sharply

lower annual goods price inflation, which had fallen by around 2 percentage points since January to

-1.6% in June, the lowest rate since the start of the series in 1975. Around half of that fall reflected a

significantly lower contribution from seasonal food prices due to movements in those prices twelve

months earlier (so-called ‘base effects’) and the recent sharp price falls. These falls had been

partially offset by a small rise in annual services price inflation.

20 The outturn in June still seemed likely to represent a low point for RPIX inflation, as had been

expected at the turn of the year. Base effects over the coming months, mainly relating to seasonal

food and petrol prices, would, other things equal, lead to increases in annual RPIX inflation over the

remainder of this year. The two most significant of these would be in July and November. In July,

last year’s fall between June and July of almost 10% in seasonal food prices would no longer

contribute to the annual comparison, and in November, last year’s fall between October and

November of over 5% in petrol prices would no longer reduce the inflation figure; each of these

base effects would add 0.2 percentage points to annual RPIX inflation in the relevant months. Past

rapid rises in UK house prices were also likely to put upward pressure on the twelve-month inflation

rate via the element of the RPI capturing housing depreciation.

21 One feature of the current conjuncture was the size of the gap between annual goods and

services price inflation – over six percentage points in June. That was much greater than was likely

to be sustainable, given historical differences in productivity growth in goods and services

production, which implied a long-run gap closer to 2%-2½%. Base effects were likely to narrow the

gap over the rest of the year. But the low level of goods price inflation was a worldwide

phenomenon, possibly reflecting the global slowdown last year. That might change as the global

recovery proceeded. Oil prices had remained surprisingly stable.


-----

**Other considerations**

22 The Committee noted that all the economists polled by Reuters expected no change in the repo

rate this month. Short-term market interest rates had fallen, suggesting that the likely date of an

increase in the repo rate had receded in the view of financial market participants.

**The August GDP growth and inflation projections**

23 The Committee reached its policy decision in the light of the projections to be published in the

_Inflation Report on Wednesday 7 August._

24 Based on the assumption of an unchanged official repo rate of 4% over the next two years,

according to the central projection, the annual rate of GDP growth would rise over the next year or so

to around its long-run trend, and remain close to that level thereafter; the twelve-month RPIX

inflation rate would increase to 2%-2¼% by the end of this year and would then rise gently, reaching

the 2½% target in around two years’ time. Inflation would be increasing less rapidly at the end of the

forecast period than envisaged in May. In the Inflation Report fan charts, the balance of risks to

growth was symmetric in the first year and weighted marginally to the downside in the second year.

The risks to inflation were also evenly balanced in the first year, but were weighted to the upside in

the second year. There were some differences among the Committee about the overall balance of

risks, but the spread of opinion was relatively small. The Committee noted that these projections

were similar to the consensus of outside forecasts.

**The immediate policy decision**

25 Committee members agreed that the latest economic data broadly confirmed that a gradual

increase in the pace of global economic activity was under way. There had, however, been some

signs of greater weakness than expected in the euro area. Also, estimates of US GDP had been

revised downwards and growth in 2002 Q2 had been a little lower than expected. In the

United Kingdom, growth was estimated to have picked up sharply in Q2, though it was unlikely to

sustain that rate in the near term. Interpreting the latest UK activity data was difficult, however,

because this June had been atypical on account of the Jubilee long weekend and other factors. The

inflation outturn in June had been unexpectedly low, largely because of erratic factors that were


-----

likely to unwind. The main news on the month had been in asset prices: the sharp falls in equity

markets around the world and, to a lesser extent, the rise in sterling’s effective exchange rate. These

developments, if they persisted, would tend to reduce the growth of consumption and investment and

reduce cost pressures; but they were also a source of considerable uncertainty about the outlook for

output and inflation.

26 The Committee considered what level of interest rates was appropriate in the light of

prospective RPIX inflation. At recent meetings, the Committee had discussed the case for an interest

rate increase. The declines in equity prices had moderated the outlook for inflation and the case for a

rise in rates was, at the very least, less urgent. Indeed, given recent developments, there were several

factors now suggesting that a reduction in interest rates might be warranted. First, as the new

inflation projection was below 2½% for most of the forecast period, a small reduction in rates might

be appropriate, given the Committee’s mandate to aim for 2½% inflation at all times. Second, the

global recovery was fragile; domestic demand in the euro area remained weak, and imbalances in

the US economy might still exert more of a drag on output than currently expected; the shortfall in

Q2 GDP growth relative to expectations could point in that direction. In the United States, at least,

equity valuations still looked high by historical standards on some calculations; and, judging by

recent experience, any further falls there were likely to be reflected in UK equity prices, at least in

the short run. Market participants might also have doubts about the capacity of policymakers in the

United States and the euro area to respond to further falls, given the already low level of interest

rates, the recent loosening of fiscal policy in the United States, and the constraints on fiscal policy in

the euro area. Third, in the view of some members, there was also a risk, not reflected in the central

projection, of continuing deflation of world goods prices, which had persistently turned out lower

than expected.

27 There were, however, arguments against reducing the repo rate, and these were seen as more

compelling. First, the analysis embodied in the new _Inflation Report projection of inflation did not_

suggest that a reduction in the repo rate from its current level of 4% was needed in order to meet the

target over the medium term. The decline in equity markets since the projections published in the

May Inflation Report had moderated the outlook for inflation. At unchanged official interest rates,

RPIX inflation was expected to return towards the 2½% target over the next two years, rising slightly

above it at the forecast horizon. Second, over the previous week, equity markets had moved above

the 15 working day average for equity prices used as the starting point for the forecast It was


-----

sensible to wait and see whether markets settled in their current range before adjusting the repo rate.

Third, house prices had continued to increase rapidly, and this would sustain the strong growth of

consumption, at least for some time. Moreover, households could more easily than in the past

increase their withdrawal of mortgage equity. In these circumstances, a reduction in interest rates

now risked further stimulating the housing market, increasing the risk of a sharp correction later.

Fourth, there were upside risks to inflation from the planned increases in National Insurance

contributions and, in the view of some Committee members, from the sterling exchange rate.

Finally, reducing the repo rate would risk denting confidence by implying that conditions were worse

than the Committee believed them to be.

28 The Governor invited members to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate should be

maintained at 4.0%. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the proposition.

29 Finally, on the occasion of David Clementi’s last Committee meeting, the Governor expressed

his appreciation of the contribution he had made to the Committee. The Treasury representative

added the Chancellor’s thanks for the way in which Mr Clementi had fulfilled his responsibilities.

#### ANNEX: SUMMARY OF DATA PRESENTED BY BANK STAFF

A1 This annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee

on 26 July 2002, in advance of the meeting on 31 July-1 August. At the start of the Committee

meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available,

and that information is included in this annex.

**I** **The international environment**

A2 According to the advance estimate, US GDP in 2002 Q2 had grown by 0.3% on a quarter

earlier, following a rise of 1.2% in Q1. The estimated level of GDP in 2002 Q1 had been revised

down by 1.3%, mainly because of revisions to GDP growth in 2001. Manufacturing output had

increased by 0.8% in June compared with May, and output in the information and communication

technology (ICT) sector had increased by 1.7% in June. New orders for non-defence capital goods

had fallen by 8.5% in June. The ISM manufacturing index had fallen from 56.2 in June to 50.9 in

July.

A3 Retail sales values had risen by 1.1% in June compared with a month earlier. The University

of Michigan consumer confidence index had fallen to 88.1 in July, from 92.4 in June.

A4 Non-farm payrolls had risen by 36,000 in June. The unemployment rate had risen slightly, to

5.9% in June from 5.8% in May, but initial claims for unemployment insurance had fallen during the

month.

A5 Annual consumer price inflation in the United States had fallen to 1.1% in June, from 1.2% in

May. Annual core consumer price inflation, excluding food and energy, had also fallen, to 2.3% in

June from 2.5% in May. The overseas trade deficit had widened in May, with an increase in import

values more than offsetting a rise in exports.

A6 Industrial production in the euro area had risen by 0.1% in May compared with a month earlier.

It had fallen in Germany and France, but had risen in Italy. Germany manufacturing orders had

increased by 3.1% compared with the previous month. Domestic orders had fallen by 2.3% but

foreign orders had risen by 9.6%. Indicators of business confidence had continued to decline: the


-----

Italian ISAE and the Belgian BNB industrial confidence indices had both fallen in July, as had the

German IFO index, which had fallen to 89.9 in July from 91.3 in June. The euro-area manufacturing

PMI had declined slightly in July, falling to 51.6 from 51.8 in June.

A7 The European Commission measure of consumer confidence for the euro area had fallen

slightly in June; national indicators for Italy and the Netherlands recorded sharp falls in July.

French consumer spending had increased by 1.0% in June, after falling by 1.3% in May. The overall

indicator of French consumer confidence had, however, deteriorated further in July, falling to -17

from -13 in June. The euro-area harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) had risen by 1.8% in

the year to June, down from 2.0% in May. The preliminary estimate for euro-area HICP inflation

had indicated a rate of 1.9% in the year to July. Core inflation had fallen to 2.5% in the year to June,

down from 2.6% in May.

A8 Japanese industrial production had fallen by 0.7% in June compared with a month earlier,

although in Q2 as a whole industrial production had increased by 3.6% compared with a quarter

earlier. The index of tertiary activity had risen by 1.0% in May, bringing the annual rate of decline

to 0.7%, the smallest since November 2001. Export volumes had increased by 12.4% in the year to

June. Exports to other Asian countries had shown particular strength, increasing by 25.1% in the

year to June.

A9 The Wilshire 5000 index had fallen by 4.2% since Wednesday 3 July, at the time of the

previous Committee meeting. The FTSE All-Share, Topix and Dow Jones Eurostoxx indices had

fallen by 4.2%, 7.6% and 7.9% respectively over the same period. Among equity indices with a

higher concentration of information and communications technology (ICT) sector firms, the Nasdaq,

the Japanese Telecom and the FTSE Techmark indices had fallen by 3.8%, 6.7% and 2.6%

respectively, while the German Nemax 50 index had risen by 2.3% over the same period.

A10 The dollar spot price for Brent crude oil was little changed since 3 July, and the Economist

all-items dollar price index had risen by 1.4%. The industrial metals sub-index and the non-food

agricultural sub-index had fallen by 3.1% and 4.2% respectively over that period, while the food

sub-index had risen by 5.1% over the same period.

**II** **Monetary and financial conditions**

A11 On the basis of partial data, the twelve-month growth rate of notes and coin in circulation had

fallen to 8.6% in July, from 9.4% in June, as the effects of the Jubilee Bank Holiday had unwound.

The twelve-month growth rate of M4 had ticked up slightly to 6.4% in June, from 6.1% in May. The

twelve-month growth rate of M4 lending (excluding the effects of securitisations) had fallen to 8.2%

in June, from 8.9% in May. Excluding other financial corporations (OFCs), the annual growth rate

of both M4 deposits and M4 lending had fallen slightly in June.

A12 The twelve-month growth rate of households’ M4 had fallen to 8.5% in June, from 8.7% in

May. The twelve-month growth rate of households’ M4 lending (excluding the effects of

securitisations) had risen slightly, to 12.5% in June from 12.4% in May. Within total net lending to

individuals, the annual growth rate of secured lending had remained buoyant at 11.4% in June. The

annual growth rate of unsecured lending had continued to decline in June, falling to 14.7%. The

growth of household Divisia, an aggregate of household money holdings, weighted by the liquidity

of different types of holding, had increased in 2002 Q2. The estimated number of loan approvals for

house purchase, adjusted for the number of working days, had fallen slightly in June, but remained

historically high.

A13 The twelve-month growth rate of private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs) M4 deposits had

fallen to 4.3% in June, from 7.3% in May. The twelve-month growth rate of PNFCs’ M4 lending

(excluding the effects of securitisations) had fallen to 3.3% in May, from 5.9% in April. A

breakdown of bank lending by industry showed that the fall in the growth of M4 lending to PNFCs

was broadly based. Total external finance fell to an average of £2.6 billion per month in 2002 Q2,

compared with an average monthly flow of £3.5 billion in 2002 Q1.

A14 Corporate capital gearing at replacement cost had ticked up to 30.3% in 2002 Q1.

A15 The twelve-month growth rate of OFCs’ M4 deposits had risen to 2.4% in June, from -1.3% in

May. The twelve-month growth rate of OFCs’ M4 lending (excluding the effects of securitisations)

had fallen to 2.2% in June, from 3.0% in May.

A16 Quoted retail deposit and mortgage rates were broadly unchanged in July.


-----

A17 Between 3 and 31 July, the FTSE All-Share index had fallen by 4.2%. Equity market

uncertainty, as measured by volatilities implied by options prices, had increased, but skews from

equity options had become less negative since 3 July, suggesting some reduction in perceptions of

downside risk. Prices in all sectors except non-cyclical services had fallen. There had been only a

small downward movement in IBES earnings forecasts between June and July, and the number of

profit warnings issued in July was higher than in June, but was lower than a year earlier. The

Merrill Lynch index of investment-grade sterling corporate bond spreads had risen by 15 basis points

since 3 July. The Merrill Lynch sterling high-yield index had risen by more, but investment-grade

corporate yields had fallen by 5 basis points since 3 July. Telecom sector spreads had narrowed by

16 basis points on the month, but remained relatively high.

A18 Short-term nominal interest rates had declined substantially since 3 July. Uncertainty from

options about future interest rates had increased slightly. Ten-year nominal forward rates had

increased by 7 basis points. Forward real rates derived from index-linked gilts had increased by

18 basis points at three years, but had increased by less further along the curve. Implied inflation

rates derived from conventional and index-linked gilts had fallen since 3 July by 31 basis points at

three years, and six basis points at ten years, reversing some of the increases seen earlier in the year.

Average inflation expectations, for both 2002 and 2003, as measured by Consensus Economics’

monthly survey, had fallen by ten basis points in July, to 2.2% and 2.3% respectively.

A19 Between 3 and 31 July, the sterling effective exchange rate index had appreciated by 2.5% to

106.9, reflecting sterling’s appreciation of 2.3% against the dollar and 2.4% against the euro.

Relative movements in nominal UK and US interest rates were consistent with the movement of

sterling against the dollar.

**III** **Demand and output**

A20 The ONS’ preliminary estimate of quarterly growth of GDP at constant market prices in

2002 Q2 had been 0.9%, following 0.1% growth in each of the previous two quarters. Annual GDP

growth had picked up to 1.5%, from 1.1% in 2002 Q1. The Q2 quarterly rate had been the highest

since the end of 1999.


-----

A21 The preliminary estimate of services sector quarterly output growth had been 0.6% in 2002 Q2,

following growth of 0.2% in 2002 Q1. Within this, output in the distribution, hotels and catering

sector was estimated to have risen by 1.1%. Manufacturing output had grown by 0.7% in May

compared with a month earlier, following growth of 1.1% in April.

A22 The ONS had indicated that the unusual pattern of Bank Holidays in 2002 had made seasonal

adjustment of the index of production data in May and June problematic: because of the Jubilee,

there had been one fewer Bank Holiday in May and two extra in June. The ONS had made no

adjustment to the May data to reflect the change in timing of the late Spring Bank Holiday. This had

created difficulties for the interpretation of monthly changes in output in these months.

A23 Retail sales had fallen by 0.7% in June. They had risen by 1.7% in 2002 Q2, up from 1.0% in

2002 Q1. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) survey of distributive trades had suggested

that annual retail sales growth was unchanged in July. Annual growth in new private car

registrations had also risen in Q2, increasing by 10.4% compared with 5.2% in Q1. This had pointed

to a further quarterly rise in the ONS’ measure of household expenditure on vehicles in Q2.

A24 The CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends survey had suggested that the manufacturing sector had

continued to run down their stocks in Q2, with the balance on reported stocks negative in all

reporting sectors. The CBI survey in July had indicated that the level of stocks in the manufacturing

sector had been close to its long-run average relative to demand.

A25 Volumes of goods exports had increased by 5.3% in the three months to May compared with

the previous three months. Volumes of goods imports had also increased, but at a more moderate

2.2%. This had suggested that net trade was likely to make a positive contribution to GDP growth in

2002 Q2, following a 0.7pp negative contribution in Q1.

A26 The Nationwide house index had risen by a further 2.5% in July, increasing the annual rate of

increase by 1.2 percentage points to 21.0%. The Halifax index had risen by a further 1.8% in July,

increasing the annual rate of increase by 1.5 percentage points to 20.8%. Looking forward, the

Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) survey in June had reported another fall in expected

house price inflation over the next three months, with the seasonally unadjusted reported balance

falling to +27 from +56 in May, a larger fall than seasonal factors could typically account for. The


-----

RICS survey had also suggested a fall in June in the underlying numbers of enquiries from new

buyers. Moreover, the Woolwich Mortgage Index, a monthly survey of UK households, had

suggested a fall in expectations of house price inflation over the next twelve months.

A27 The GfK consumer confidence index had fallen to +2.2 in July from +5.6 in June. Business

confidence as measured by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) 2002 Q2 surveys had picked

up slightly for both service sector and manufacturing firms. The CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends

Survey for 2002 Q2, conducted up to 10 July, had indicated some easing in business confidence in

the manufacturing sector, with the balance falling to +4 in Q2 from +21 in Q1.

A28 The BCC survey balance for service sector investment intentions had remained broadly

unchanged in Q2 at around its long-term average. In contrast, the BCC survey had reported a rise in

manufacturing investment intentions in Q2, with the survey balance rising to +7, from -3 in 2002 Q1,

but it had still been below its long-term average. The July CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends survey

for 2002 Q2 had similarly shown a strong rise in investment intentions: the balance of

manufacturing firms expecting to increase investment in plant and machinery had increased to -13,

from -25 in the April survey. The CBI survey had suggested low capacity utilisation in the

manufacturing sector, at odds with the BCC measure of capacity utilisation in the manufacturing

sector, which had increased to +38 in Q2 from +33 in Q1, above its long-run average of +32.

A29 In Q2, the BCC survey balance for services sector domestic orders had eased to +19, from +20

in 2002Q1. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) services sector survey for June

had shown the new orders balance increasing to +55.5 in Q2 from +52.9 in Q1.

A30 The BCC domestic new orders survey balance had eased to +9 in 2002 Q2, from +12 in Q1.

The CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends survey had shown the expected output survey balance falling to

+9 in Q2, from +14 in Q1 survey. The CIPS manufacturing survey for July had pointed to orders

rising in Q2: the balance of reported new orders had increased to +55.2 from +51.4 in Q1, but this

balance had fallen back in July to +48.8.

A31 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted a special survey of recent developments and

near-term prospects in the housing and rental market. A total of 140 mortgage lenders, housebuilders

and estate agents had responded. Respondents were asked three questions. Two concerned their


-----

expectations about the prospects for house prices and residential rents over the next six months. The

third asked for their views about the main factor responsible for the recent rapid increase in house

prices. The responses had been weighted according to the respondents’ typical number of

transactions. Mortgage lenders overwhelmingly pointed to lower interest rates as the reason for the

rapid increases in house prices. Estate agents concurred, but also placed more weight on investment

demand as a key factor, while housebuilders emphasised lack of new supply. Looking at the regional

picture, investment and low supply were more significant in London and the South East, while low

interest rates and credit availability were more significant elsewhere. House prices were expected by

most respondents to increase at a slower rate in the second half of this year than they had in the first;

this was true of entry-level and other properties, and for all regions. House-price inflation was

perceived to have slowed over the previous four to six weeks. On balance, residential rents were

expected to fall slightly over the coming six months, with the falls expected to be a little less for

entry-level properties.

**IV** **Labour market**

A32 According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), employment had risen by 91,000 (0.3%) in the

three months to May 2002, compared with 29,000 in the previous non-overlapping quarter. The

working-age employment rate had increased by 0.1 percentage points to 74.7%. Average hours had

increased by 0.3% in the three months to May, though they were still lower than in the first half of

2001.

A33 Surveys of employment intentions for Q3 had been little changed on the previous quarter,

suggesting that employment would continue to grow broadly in line with recent outturns. Surveys of

labour shortages had indicated a sharp increase in shortages reported in consumer services and a fall

in clerical shortages reported in financial services. Shortages elsewhere were little changed, though

lower than they had been in 2001. The Bank’s Agents had reported an increase in shortages of some

skills and that shortages of others had persisted.

A34 LFS unemployment had risen by 52,000 in the three months to May, compared with a fall of

15,000 in the previous non-overlapping quarter. The LFS unemployment rate had been unchanged,

at 5.2%. Claimant count unemployment had risen by 1,300 in June but the claimant count rate had

remained at 3.2%. Working-age inactivity had fallen by 66,000 in the three months to May, and the


-----

rate had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 21.1%. The fall in inactivity had been entirely accounted

for by lower female inactivity.

A35 Headline (three-month average) whole-economy average earnings growth had been 3.8% in the

year to May, up 0.5 percentage points on the previous month. Headline earnings growth in the

private sector had increased by 0.7 percentage points, to 3.8%. In the public sector, headline

earnings growth had fallen by 0.3 percentage points, to 3.8%. The pick-up in the whole-economy

and private sector headline figures had largely reflected weak earnings data in February dropping out

of the three-month average.

A36 Regular pay growth had been 3.9% (not seasonally adjusted) in the year to May, down

0.1 percentage points on April. The recent slowdown in regular pay growth had in part reflected

falling average hours on a year earlier, especially overtime hours. Bonuses had reduced

whole-economy earnings growth by 0.1 percentage points in the year to May.

A37 The Bank’s twelve-month Average Earnings Index (AEI)-weighted, whole-economy mean

measure of pay settlements had been 3.1% in June, unchanged from the May figure. The three
month AEI-weighted mean settlement had risen 0.1 percentage points to 2.9%. The small pick-up in

the three-month measure had reflected two large deals in construction, one of which was the third

year of a three-year deal.

**V** **Prices**

A38 Sterling oil prices had fallen by around 2% since the July MPC meeting, but on average were

somewhat higher in July than they had been in June.

A39 Manufacturing input prices had fallen by 0.9% in June. This fall had mainly reflected falls in

the price of crude oil. Annual input price inflation had fallen in June to -7.2%, from -6.5% in May.

But the CIPS manufacturing survey had continued to suggest that input price pressures might not be

so subdued going forward. The input price balance had risen for the second consecutive month, to

56.9 in July from 53.1 in June.


-----

A40 Manufacturing output prices excluding duties (PPIY) had been unchanged in June, while the

annual inflation rate had fallen by 0.1 percentage points to 0.1%. Survey data had continued to point

to subdued output price inflation going forward. The CBI Industrial Trends survey expected output

price balance, at -10 in July, had been unchanged from the previous month.

A41 Annual RPIX inflation had fallen by 0.3 percentage points to 1.5% in June, the lowest annual

inflation rate since the series began in January 1975. Compared with annual RPI inflation before

1975, June’s outturn had been the lowest annual inflation rate since September 1967. Within this,

annual goods price inflation had fallen sharply to -1.6%, from -0.9% in May. Annual services price

inflation had remained unchanged at 4.5% in June. Annual RPIY inflation had fallen by

0.4 percentage points to 1.4% in June. Annual RPI inflation had fallen 0.1 percentage points to 1.0%

in June, while annual HICP inflation had fallen to 0.6%, down from 0.8% in the previous month.

**VI** **Reports by the Bank’s Agents**

A42 The Bank’s regional Agents reported that the underlying trend in manufacturing was of

continued slow recovery in domestic and external markets, although there had been some weakness

in June. Some vehicle manufacturing companies had closed plants for up to a week at the time of the

early June Bank Holidays. Production had, however, caught up quickly thereafter. Aerospace had

remained weak but growth was reported in food processing, pharmaceuticals and construction
related manufacturing. Although Agents' contacts had thought that output in the electrical and

optical engineering sector had bottomed out, they expected the sector to act as a drag on the pace of

recovery in manufacturing.

A43 The improvement in investment intentions in both services and manufacturing had stalled over

the past month or two. Equity price falls appeared to have damaged confidence, leading to increased

caution amongst companies with regard to investment. Manufacturing investment had continued to

be primarily in overseas locations.

A44 Growth in retail sales had been easing slightly since the turn of the year. Sales in June had

been particularly affected by the World Cup, the Jubilee weekend and by poor weather. But reports

from the first two weeks of July had suggested that growth had picked up again. Retailers had

appeared mostly to be expecting a slight moderation in growth in the second half of the year. Car


-----

sales and some consumer services had also recovered quite strongly, following a lull at the time of

the World Cup.

**VII** **Market intelligence**

A45 Between 3 and 31 July, interest rates implied by short sterling futures contracts had fallen.

Rates implied by the contract for September 2002 had fallen by 36 basis points and those implied by

the contract for September 2003 had fallen by 60 basis points. Short-term interest rate expectations

had moved down following falls in equity markets and weaker-than-expected RPIX data.

Movements in short-term interest rate expectations had been highly correlated with changes in the

FTSE 100 equity index.

A46 Market participants had generally expected the Committee not to change the Bank’s official

repo rate at its August meeting. Economists polled by Reuters on 23-25 July had attached a mean

probability of 83% to no change in the Bank’s repo rate at the August meeting, a probability of 7% to

an increase of 25 basis points and a probability of 9% to a reduction of 25 basis points.

A47 The period since the Committee’s previous meeting had been marked by sterling strength

independent of moves in other exchange rates. Reports suggested that this was associated in part

with the unwinding of EMU convergence trades, especially against the Swedish krona. Over the

period, sterling had appreciated by 2.3% against the dollar and by 2.4% against the euro, and was

2.5% higher on an effective basis. The dollar had first depreciated against the euro, sterling and the

yen, before recovering towards the end of the period. The correlation of the euro-dollar exchange

rate with the level of US equity indices, which had been high for most of the year, had been lower

during the fortnight before the Committee’s meeting. Market contacts reported two-way repatriation

flows by US and European asset managers during the period.
