##### These are the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting held on 8 and 9 September 2004.

 They are also available on the Internet

(http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/mpc/mpc0409.pdf).

##### The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The Committee meets on a regular monthly basis and minutes of its meetings are released on the Wednesday of the second week after the meeting takes place. Accordingly, the minutes of the Committee meeting held on 6 and 7 October will be published on 20 October 2004.

#### MINUTES OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 8-9 SEPTEMBER 2004

1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed developments in

financial markets; the international economy; money, credit, demand and output; and the labour

market, costs and prices.

**Financial markets**

2 Price movements in financial markets had been more significant than in recent months, with

falls in short-term market interest rates and a depreciation of sterling against other major currencies.

3 In addition to international factors, short-term sterling market interest rates had moved lower in

response to the statement accompanying the August MPC decision and the Minutes, and in the light of

UK data and surveys relating to the housing market, consumer spending and industrial production.

Forward sterling interest rates pointed to a strong expectation that the Committee would leave the repo

rate unchanged this month and expectations of any further rise before the end of the year seemed to

have become less firmly held.  None of the respondents to the Reuters survey of economists had

expected a change in rates this month and the average of their expected rates for the end of the year

had fallen slightly, to just under 5%.

4 In contrast to the falls at shorter maturities, implied forward sterling real interest rates and

inflation expectations had changed little on the month at maturities beyond five years.

5 Since the previous meeting, the sterling effective exchange rate had fallen by nearly 3% to its

lowest level since February. Market contacts had attributed the fall mainly to downward revisions to

the expected path of sterling official interest rates. But movements in sterling market interest rates

relative to overseas rates had been small and could account only for a small part of the steady

depreciation over the month. At this stage the Committee found it difficult to assess what lay behind

the depreciation and therefore whether it was likely to persist.

6 Major equity markets had risen over the month, apparently partly in response to the fall in oil

prices.

**The international economy**

7 The broadly based global upswing looked set to continue, more or less in line with the August

_Inflation Report projections. Growth in the United States and Japan had slowed in Q2 from the brisk_

pace in Q1, but seemed likely to pick up again in the second half of the year. In the euro area, overall

growth appeared steady at near its trend rate. However, the news over the past month was consistent

with some increased downside risks to global growth.

8 In the euro area, GDP growth in Q2 had been estimated at 0.5%. The expenditure breakdown

suggested that net trade had made a larger-than-expected contribution to growth. Final domestic

demand had continued to contract in Germany but had grown strongly in France and expanded in the

euro area as a whole, although at a slower rate than in Q1. Euro-area retail sales growth in June and

July had suggested that private consumption would continue to grow in Q3. Although the Purchasing

Managers Indices for manufacturing and services had fallen a little in August, they were consistent

with further expansion. Headline CPI inflation had been unchanged in August but had eased from

May and June.

9 Final domestic demand growth in Germany had been relatively weak since early 1999. One

likely explanation was that German real household disposable income had been flat since 2001, partly

reflecting falling employment. Much of the decline in employment had been in the construction

sector, and construction investment had also been falling as a percentage of GDP since the mid-1990s,

in part still a hangover from the construction boom following reunification. Another factor was likely

to be uncertainty about various proposed structural reforms; this might lie behind the rise in the

German household saving ratio in recent years. Recovery in German domestic demand growth

remained uncertain, although continued weakness in Germany seemed unlikely to undermine the

upturn in the rest of the euro area.

10 In the United States, estimated Q2 GDP growth had been revised downwards to 0.7%, below the

pace of growth in recent quarters. A marked slowdown in private consumption growth was perhaps in

part related to the impact of higher oil prices on disposable incomes. But other factors might also have

been important, including a slowing in the growth rates of both housing and net financial wealth, and

temporary effects such as wet weather in June and reduced incentives to buy motor vehicles. Real

consumption and retail sales had both risen in July following falls in June, with increased spending

across many categories, including motor vehicles, but some of the indicators for August were more

mixed. The rate of future consumption growth seemed likely to pick up in Q3, although not at the

brisk pace of Q1. Survey-based measures of consumer confidence had weakened in August compared

with July, and the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book had reported that consumption growth might have

eased in August from July. In part this might have been in response to the weak growth in non-farm

payrolls in July, with consumers having a slightly less confident assessment of current labour market

conditions. Non-farm payrolls had, however, risen by 144,000 in August and the estimated July

increase had been revised upwards. But this rate of increase was still barely sufficient to keep pace

with the growth in the US population of working age. Partly depending on the strength of the labour

market, downside risks to future consumption growth had probably increased, although growth would

remain underpinned by the continuing highly stimulatory stance of monetary and fiscal policies, and

the steady rise in house prices.

11 On the output side, US indicators were consistent with continuing robust growth. Both the

manufacturing and non-manufacturing headline Institute for Supply Management indices had fallen

back a little in August from July, as had their new order components. But they remained well above

‘no change’ levels. Business investment had grown strongly in the first half of the year.

12 In Asia, Japanese GDP growth in Q2 had also been weak, and heavily dependent on net trade,

but again this slowdown seemed likely to be transitory. A pickup in machinery orders might signal

stronger investment growth in the second half of the year. From the perspective of demand for UK

goods and services, weaker growth in Japan in Q2 had been more than offset by rapid rates of

expansion elsewhere in Asia, with inflationary pressures building in some of these economies.

13 Despite the sharp rise during August, oil prices had declined somewhat over the month. OPEC

oil supply had risen in July and there had been a build-up in US gasoline stocks as a result of weaker
than-expected US demand. The oil futures curve continued to point to a fall in prices to below US$35

per barrel. But the implied distribution of future oil prices derived from options markets remained

skewed towards higher prices, suggesting a perceived risk of a more pronounced rise in oil prices.

And oil prices had risen steadily since the beginning of 2004. If the current level was sustained, it

would depress global economic growth to some extent, although the major economies were less

sensitive to high oil prices than in previous decades.

**Money, credit, demand and output**

14 In the United Kingdom, output and demand growth had been above trend in Q2. Continued

robust GDP growth was likely in the second half of the year, although there were signs that the pace of

growth might slow a little in Q3 and be slightly weaker than in the August Inflation Report projections.

In particular, growth of consumer spending appeared to be slowing in Q3. There had been more signs

that the housing market was starting to cool.

15 The ONS had estimated GDP growth in Q2 of 0.9%, unchanged from its preliminary estimate

and in line with what the Committee had expected.  Output growth had been broadly based, with the

output of services and the production industries increasing at similar rates.

16 There were, however, signs of a slight easing in the pace of growth in Q3. Manufacturing output

was estimated to have fallen by 0.2% in July, although upward revisions to estimated growth in the

first half of the year had left the reported level of manufacturing output 0.6% higher than previously

estimated. Business surveys had presented a mixed picture.  For manufacturing, the output and new

orders balances in the CIPS purchasing managers index had fallen sharply in August from July,

although still indicating continuing expansion. But the CBI Monthly Trends Inquiry and the Bank’s

Agents had suggested a pickup in orders and output expectations. In the services sector, the CIPS

index of business activity had risen in August, having fallen in the previous three months, but the

index of incoming new business had continued to edge a little lower while remaining consistent with

continuing growth. The Bank’s regional Agents had reported an acceleration of activity in business

services but a modest deceleration in consumer services.

17 On the demand side, private consumption was estimated by the ONS to have grown strongly, by

1.1%, in Q2 following the weaker growth of 0.6% in Q1. This profile might have reflected a pickup of

estimated growth in consumption of services and net tourism in the second quarter. The Committee

judged that consumption growth over the first half of the year was likely to have been smoother than

currently reflected in the official data.

18 There were signs that consumption growth might have slowed in Q3. Retail sales volumes had

fallen in July, the first monthly fall since May 2003. The Bank’s Agents had reported some easing in

household spending. The CBI Distributive Trades Survey and BRC retail sales monitor had indicated


-----

5

that the annual growth rate of retail sales had fallen again in August. The GfK survey in August had

suggested that consumer confidence had ticked down, with a reduction in willingness to make a major

purchase. Private car sales had been lower than in the equivalent month in 2003 for five consecutive

months to August. The flow of secured and unsecured lending to individuals had fallen in July.

Growth of notes and coins had also declined, although the twelve-month growth rate of households’

holdings of broad money (M4) had increased.

19 It was unclear to what extent any easing in consumption growth might be temporary, perhaps

connected to the unusually wet weather. The Committee had been expecting some slowing, reflecting

in part that official interest rates had risen by 1.25 percentage points since November 2003.

20 An increasing weight of evidence suggested that the housing market might be cooling, with a

range of indicators pointing in the same direction. House price inflation had been lower on both

lenders’ indices in August, with the Halifax index falling 0.6% compared with the previous month.

The July RICS survey of estate agents had shown a further fall in the balance of survey respondents

reporting price rises in the previous three months. Indicators of housing market activity had also

continued to weaken: new mortgage approvals for house purchase had fallen sharply in July and the

July RICS survey had indicated a further fall in the ratio of respondents’ sales to stocks. But even if

the market had begun to cool, it remained highly uncertain how rapidly and by how much house price

inflation would moderate, or indeed if it might pick up again for a time. The impact of any given

change in house prices on consumption was also uncertain. The Committee judged that a turnaround

in the housing market would restrain consumer spending to some extent. But as explained in the

August Inflation Report, the weaker association between house prices and consumption in the past few

years had led the Committee to judge that the relationship might also be less strong in the future as

house price inflation slowed.

21 Of the other components of domestic demand, growth in business investment had been estimated

at 0.5% in Q2. But this was a volatile series. The Committee continued to expect robust growth in

business investment as indicators of investment intentions suggested. Bank borrowing by private non
financial corporations had risen sharply in July, possibly linked to financing of investment plans.  The

twelve-month growth rate of M4, at 8.8%, was the highest since 2001. If sustained, this might be

consistent with continued strong growth of nominal GDP.

**The labour market, costs and prices**

22 The news from the labour market over the past month had been on the weak side. Although still

tight, it was unclear that the market was tightening further.

23 Employment had fallen in Q2, with the employment rate falling 0.2 percentage points, back to its

level in 2003 Q2. The counterpart had been mainly a rise in inactivity, but unemployment had also

increased. It was possible that these fluctuations reflected sampling error, with the pickup in the

employment rate in Q1 being erratically strong and the underlying picture one of more stable

employment over the recent past. Employment surveys continued to point to growth in the demand for

labour. But the Bank’s Agents had reported that growth in demand for workers in the private sector

had eased slightly.

24 It was puzzling that pay pressures had so far remained subdued given continued robust output

growth and the apparently tight labour market. Whole economy wage settlements had been unchanged

at 3.3% in July; annual growth in regular pay and overall earnings growth had been flat in June.

Three-month on three-month growth in regular pay, a measure of current pay pressures, had fallen in

June to an annualised rate of 4.1%, which was lower than the increase over the same three months a

year earlier.

25 CPI inflation had fallen to 1.4% in July from 1.6% in June, as the contribution from higher petrol

prices had moderated and the ‘base effect’ from falls in petrol prices in June 2003 had dropped away.

In line with the pre-release arrangements, an advance estimate of CPI inflation in August had been

provided to the Governor 3½ working days ahead of publication, and this had suggested a further fall

in the rate to 1.3%, which was in line with the Committee’s expectations.

26 Inflationary pressures continued to be felt along the supply chain, as rising demand for goods

and services put pressure on firms’ capacity to produce them. Producer output prices had been rising

and manufacturers appeared to have widened margins. Surveys in August had indicated a larger

balance of respondents in services and manufacturing expecting to increase output prices than in any

period since 2000 and 1997 respectively. But these pressures had not fed through into consumer prices

yet. Partly this might have reflected a squeeze on distributors’ margins, but it was not clear whether

this would persist or go further or whether it might to some extent prove to have been a cyclical

phenomenon that would reverse.

**The immediate policy decision**

27 There had been quite a lot of news on the month. The picture of a broadly based world recovery

and a robust UK GDP growth outlook drawn in the August Inflation Report remained intact. But it

seemed that the pace of UK growth in Q3 might be a little slower than had been envisaged, although it

was too soon to judge with any certainty at this stage. The recent labour market data had also been

surprisingly weak, though inflationary pressures were still evident in the supply chain. Some

downside risks had perhaps increased. First, future US economic growth might be weaker if

consumption growth picked up less briskly from the second quarter. Second, the further signs that the

UK housing market was cooling might mean a greater risk of a more abrupt correction to house price

inflation and the Committee may have underestimated the potential for an associated downward

impact on consumption. Sterling had depreciated over the month. If that persisted, it would be likely

to add to inflationary pressures, which would tend to offset the slightly weaker news about economic

activity.

28 The Committee considered the arguments for keeping the repo rate unchanged at 4.75%, to

which different members gave different weights. The August Inflation Report central projection,

based on the market yield curve, had been for CPI inflation to remain below the target for the

immediate future, picking up steadily to meet the target around the two-year point. The 25 basis points

increase in the repo rate in August reflected a movement at least as fast as that implied by the market

rate curve on which the August projections had been based and the news about economic activity was,

on balance, slightly weaker on the month. Medium-term inflation expectations appeared to remain

well anchored to the target. So there was no case for a further rise in rates at this meeting.

29 Some members also considered arguments for raising the repo rate by 25 basis points. The

economy was, most probably, set to continue to grow at or above trend, and so to put gathering

pressures on supply with little or no remaining spare capacity. Inflationary pressures would have been

increased by a lower exchange rate and a shift down in the money market yield curve. If the lower

level of market yields persisted, this might rekindle unwelcome strength in the household sector.

Taken as a whole, the Committee did not find these arguments sufficient to justify a rise in the repo

rate.

#### ANNEX: SUMMARY OF DATA PRESENTED BY BANK STAFF

A1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee

on 3 September 2004, in advance of its meeting on 8-9 September. At the start of the Committee

meeting itself, members were made aware of the information that had subsequently become available,

and that information is included in this Annex.

**I** **Financial markets**

A2 Short-term interest rates in the United Kingdom and the United States had fallen since the

Committee’s previous meeting, but had changed little in the euro area. Internationally, the most

significant falls in short-term interest rates had followed the weaker-than-expected July US non-farm

payrolls report on 6 August. In the United Kingdom, short-term interest rates had also fallen following

the MPC decision on 5 August, the release of the MPC Minutes on 18 August and on weaker-than
expected housing market data. Economists polled by Reuters had not expected the MPC to raise rates

at the September meeting, consistent with anecdote from the Bank’s market contacts. On the month,

the average of economists’ expectations for policy rates at the end of this year had edged down, by

5 basis points to 4.98%. Market expectations of future three-month interest rates, implied by short

sterling futures contracts, for December 2004 and December 2005 had also fallen, by 18 basis points to

5.09% and 31 basis points to 5.25% respectively.

A3 Overall, ten-year forward nominal government bond yields had remained broadly unchanged in

the euro area and the United Kingdom, while they had fallen in the United States. International

nominal forward rates had initially fallen following the weaker-than-expected July US non-farm

payrolls report. Rates had decreased further in the United States following other US data releases. In

the United Kingdom, the largest changes in nominal gilt yields had been at the shorter end of the

curve, with forward rates at two to four-year horizons falling by 13 to 22 basis points. These moves

seemed to have been accounted for mostly by falls in real interest rates. UK inflation expectations,

both survey-based and as implied by comparison of nominal and index-linked gilt yields, had been

broadly unchanged since the Committee’s previous meeting, remaining close to levels consistent with

the 2% CPI inflation target.

A4 The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) had fallen by 2.9%, to 103.3, since the

Committee’s previous meeting. It had remained within the range in which it had traded since February

this year, although it had approached the lower edge of this range. Sterling had depreciated by 2.3%,

2.8% and 4.0% against the dollar, the euro and the yen respectively. Market commentary had related

the depreciation of sterling to lower expectations of future UK monetary tightening and the release of

weaker-than-expected housing market data. According to market contacts, a concentrated unwinding

of long speculative positions in sterling (notably against the dollar) and establishment of short

speculative positions in sterling versus the euro had possibly contributed further to the weakening of

sterling. Despite the depreciation, sterling uncertainty, as measured by implied volatility from option

prices, had changed little, remaining at relatively low levels. Since the Committee’s previous meeting,

the dollar ERI had fallen by 1.0%. The dollar had fallen by 0.6% against the euro and by 1.8% against

the yen. It had depreciated in the first part of the period, following weaker-than-expected economic

data, most notably the July non-farm payrolls report, and concerns about the effect of high oil prices

on the US recovery. In the latter part of the period, the dollar had risen, following the decline in oil

prices and the release of the August non-farm payrolls report. However, the rise in the dollar had been

reversed after FOMC Chairman Greenspan’s testimony before the House Budget Committee on

8 September.

A5 The major international equity indices had risen over the month. In local-currency terms, the

FTSE All-Share had increased by 3.6%, the S&P 500 by 1.6%, the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 300 by

2.4% and the Topix by 2.6%. Uncertainty about the future level of the FTSE 100, as measured by

three and twelve-month implied volatilities from options, had fallen over the period. Sterling, dollar

and euro-denominated investment-grade option-adjusted spreads had narrowed.

**II** **The international environment**

A6 According to the preliminary estimate, US GDP had risen by 0.7% on the quarter in 2004 Q2,

revised down from the advance estimate of 0.8%. Within this total, the estimate for private

consumption growth had been revised up to 0.4%, from 0.3% in the advance estimate. Private fixed

investment growth had also been revised up, to 3.1%, from 2.7% in the advance estimate. Government

spending growth had been unrevised in the preliminary estimate, at 0.6%. Stocks had contributed

0.2 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth, revised up from the advance estimate of 0.1 percentage

points. The net trade contribution to GDP growth in 2004 Q2 had been revised down, to –0.3

percentage points, from zero in the advance estimate. Non-farm business sector labour productivity

July, reflecting falls in both the present situation index and the expectations index. The University of

Michigan headline index of consumer confidence had fallen to 95.9 in August (revised up from 94.0 in

the preliminary release), from 96.7 in July.

A10 US producer prices for finished goods had increased by 4.0% in the year to July. Annual

headline consumer price inflation had been 3.0% in July, compared with 3.3% in June. Annual core

consumer price inflation (which excludes food and energy prices) had been 1.8% in July, compared

with 1.9% in June. The core measure of the private consumption expenditures deflator had risen by

1.5% in Q2 compared with a year earlier.

A11 According to the first release, euro-area GDP had increased by 0.5% on the quarter in 2004 Q2,

following an increase of 0.6% on the quarter in Q1. Within this total, private consumption had

increased by 0.3%, investment had increased by 0.1% and government consumption had increased by

0.6%. Net trade had contributed 0.4 percentage points to growth in 2004 Q2, while inventories had

subtracted 0.1 percentage points.

A21 The average standard variable rate on mortgages quoted for existing customers had risen by

1 basis point in August, to 6.33%, and the average two-year fixed rate on mortgages had fallen by

5 basis points, to 5.48%. Announcements by mortgage lenders since the August repo rate rise had

suggested that this rise would be passed through nearly fully to mortgage borrowers on variable-rate

mortgages. According to the latest data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders, the share of new

mortgages (by volume) that had fixed rates had risen to 38% in July, from 34% in June.

A22 The average instant-access deposit rate had risen by 1 basis point in August, to 1.02%. The

average quoted interest rate on credit card borrowing had risen by 16 basis points. Interest rates on

personal loans and overdrafts quoted by banks and building societies had changed little in August.

The average quoted rate for a personal loan of £10,000 had fallen by 97 basis points between the end

of October 2003 and the end of August 2004, to 7.43%. This fall had continued a trend of narrower

spreads over the Bank repo rate on unsecured debt.

A23 The number of loan approvals for house purchase had fallen to 97,000 in July, from 112,000 in

June. The number of loan approvals for purposes other than house purchase or remortgaging had also

fallen, to 94,000 in July, from 97,000 in June. Unsold stocks of properties, measured by the Royal

statistical alignment adjustment) had contributed –0.2 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth in

Q2, so that domestic demand had risen by 0.9% on the quarter.

A30 Total exports had risen by 2.2%, while imports had risen by 1.9% in 2004 Q2. Overall, the

contribution of net trade to quarterly GDP growth had been zero. Adjusting for the effects of missing

trader intra-community (MTIC) VAT fraud, export and import growth had been estimated at 2.4% and

2.2% respectively.

A31 Turning to indicators of expenditure in 2004 Q3, retail sales had fallen by 0.4% on the month in

**VII Reports by the Bank’s Agents**

A45 The Bank’s regional Agents reported that there was further evidence that annual growth in retail

sales had continued to ease in the past month. New car sales had remained weak and contacts had

expected sales in September to be at best unchanged on a year earlier. And there had been signs of

slower growth in spending on consumer services. Underlying trends in consumer spending had been

difficult to discern, because of earlier-than-usual summer sales and because the recent wet weather had

affected spending patterns. Even so, with many retailers having to discount by more than usual to

attract consumers, it appeared that consumer sentiment had weakened.

A46 Evidence from contacts suggested that employment had continued to increase but that its growth

rate had slowed, with many employers expressing caution regarding the short-term outlook for activity

and profits. For some of those contacts, labour costs had been reduced either by relocating work

overseas or investing in labour-saving technology. Export orders and sales had continued to grow.

But, according to contacts, the depreciation of the US dollar in 2002 and 2003 had reduced price

competitiveness and profit margins, particularly in those markets where demand growth had been

strongest recently, notably Asia, the Middle East and the United States.
