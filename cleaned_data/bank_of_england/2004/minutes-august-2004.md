#### MINUTES OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 4-5 AUGUST 2004

1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, and against the background of its latest

projections for output and inflation, the Committee discussed developments in financial markets; the

international economy; money, credit, demand and output; and the labour market, costs and prices.

**Financial markets**

2 Price movements in financial markets had been small over the past month, suggesting that

market participants had not found the news about economic prospects and official interest rates

particularly surprising. Short-term market interest rates had risen somewhat in US dollar, euro and

sterling markets, apparently influenced by Chairman Greenspan’s Congressional testimony, but had

fallen back after the release of the preliminary data for US GDP growth in the second quarter, leaving

US dollar and sterling rates up only slightly on the month. The forward sterling interest rates implied

by the market yield curve pointed to a strong expectation that the Committee would raise the repo rate

this month. So did the Reuters survey of economists: 44 out of 45 respondents expected a 25 basis

point increase, attaching a mean probability of 75% to a rise of that size. Longer-term market interest

rates and, judging by the prices in the markets for index-linked bonds, inflation rates expected over the

next ten years were little changed at home or abroad.

3 Exchange rate movements over the month had been small. The sterling effective rate had

appreciated by around 0.5%, broadly consistent with the movements in market interest rates.

The sterling effective rate was now some two percentage points above the level at the time of the May

_Inflation Report._

4 Most major equity market price indices had dropped a little over the month, although the

FTSE-All Share index was up slightly. Indices with heavy representation of information technology

stocks had tended to fall the most. All the main market indices were a few per cent below their levels

at the time of the May Inflation Report; only some of these falls could be explained by the movements

in interest rates over the period.

**The international economy**

5 The news over the past month had left the broad picture of a robust and broadly based global

recovery largely intact, although the US economy had been a little weaker than expected.

6 In the euro area, the latest data had been consistent with overall growth near its trend rate.

The estimate of 0.6% GDP growth in the first quarter had not been revised, although revisions to

estimates of expenditure components suggested that final domestic demand had been stronger last year

than previously thought. Indicators of output pointed to growth at a similar pace in the second quarter

and the beginning of the third. Industrial production had increased in May for the fourth successive

month and the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for manufacturing had risen slightly in July,

although the PMI for services had remained unchanged. The evidence about consumers’ demand was

more mixed. Euro-area consumer confidence was unchanged in July, remaining below its long-run

average, but retail sales had increased strongly in June, after a weak figure for May. Inflation on the

HICP measure remained above the levels implied by the ECB’s definition of price stability.

7 The pattern of recovery in Germany was still different from that in the euro area as a whole.

Whereas final domestic demand growth had picked up in the rest of the euro area, the German

recovery had relied more heavily on the growth of exports. Past experience suggested that export

growth would eventually stimulate the growth of German domestic demand, but this did not appear to

have happened yet. German domestic demand growth might be being held back by uncertainty about

the timing, extent and consequences of various proposed structural reforms and about their possible

implications for unemployment and the future tax burden.

8 For the United States, the main news was the weaker-than-expected estimate for second-quarter

growth, of 0.8%. Consumption growth had eased markedly, primarily because of a slowing in

spending on non-durable goods, although car sales had been particularly weak in June. It seemed

likely that consumption growth would pick up in Q3; the main measures of consumer confidence had

risen in the summer. Although the June non-farm payrolls figure had been weak, these data were

prone to revision; unemployment claims had remained at a low level, which might help to support


-----

consumer confidence. Indicators of output also suggested that growth would be robust in Q3; both the

manufacturing and non-manufacturing ISM indices had risen in July, the latter sharply, and the

weakness of industrial production in June had probably been due to a temporary weather-related fall in

the output of the utilities sector. The headline annual measure of CPI inflation had ticked up in June,

and so had the annual core CPI inflation measure that excludes (volatile) energy costs, suggesting that

underlying inflationary pressures had risen during the second quarter.

9 In Asia, the data suggested that the Japanese recovery was continuing. Industrial production in

June had been around 8% higher than a year earlier. Nominal GDP growth had now been increasing

for four consecutive quarters and the consumer price index was unchanged over the year to June.

The Chinese economy might have slowed a little in Q2, but there had been no sign of a ‘hard landing’

so far.

10 The most striking development in the past month had been the sharp rise in the price of oil:

up over 17% in sterling terms. The Economist non-oil commodities index, in contrast, had fallen.

The oil price rise reflected a range of factors, including the continuing concerns about the security of

Middle East supplies, renewed worries about terrorism in the United States and uncertainty about

Russian supplies in the light of the threat of bankruptcy to Yukos, a major producer. OPEC had

increased production in June, but the margin of spare capacity in the short run was now very low.

Unlike in some other recent episodes of oil price rises, longer-term futures prices had also moved

upwards significantly. The risk of a much more pronounced rise in oil prices, with possibly adverse

consequences for world demand, had probably increased. If oil prices remained at their current levels,

the direct consequences for activity, income and retail prices in the United Kingdom would probably

not be great, given relatively low UK reliance on oil imports, the prevalence of less oil-intensive

production methods than two decades ago and the large tax wedge between crude oil prices and retail

petrol prices.

**Money, credit, demand and output**

11 The ONS preliminary estimate of 0.9% for GDP growth in the second quarter was broadly in line

with what the Committee had expected, as were the relative contributions of services and the

production industries, which had expanded at similar rates. BCC and CBI surveys had shown a sharp

increase in capacity utilisation in the quarter.

12 There were, however, some signs of a possible easing in the pace of growth. The twelve-month

growth rates of broad money (M4) and M4 lending had fallen a little in June (the latest month for

which data were available), and that of narrow money in July. According to the CBI quarterly

Industrial Trends Survey, business optimism had been lower in July than in April, although it remained

above its historical average. The CIPS indices of business activity and incoming new business for the

services sector had eased during Q2 and had been lower in July than in the preceding three months,

while the Bank’s regional Agents had reported that, according to their contacts, the growth of

consumer services might have slowed. However, the Bank’s Agents also reported that the growth of

manufacturing output had become more broadly based, and the CIPS Purchasing Managers Index for

manufacturing in July had reached its highest level since 1994 (though other surveys of manufacturing

gave more mixed signals). Given the greater weight of services in total output, these indicators were

consistent with a slight slowdown in overall growth in July. But they also suggested that there had

been some rebalancing of growth; that might – as suggested by the Agents’ contacts – reflect some

improvement in export prospects for manufacturers as a consequence of the global economic recovery.

13 On the demand side, there had been mixed signals about the strength of consumption. In the

light of the service sector output data and surveys of consumer services as well as retail sales, the

Committee continued to be of the view that there had been more momentum in consumption in Q1

than currently reflected in the official data. Retail sales growth had been rapid in June, giving a

growth rate for the second quarter of 1.9%, very similar to that in Q1. As the Q1 data demonstrated,

retail sales were not always a good guide to what the ONS measure of overall consumption would be;

one reason was that the growth of items of consumption not included in retail sales, such as tourism

and car sales, could be very different. Indicators suggested that new car sales had slowed significantly

in the second quarter. In July, consumer confidence had picked up slightly, partly reflecting an

increase in the balance of respondents planning to make major purchases over the next twelve months.

But the CBI Distributive Trades survey and reports from the Bank’s Agents indicated that the annual

growth of retail sales might have slowed in July; some respondents had suggested that retailers might

have brought forward summer sales to June in response to a perceived weakening in the growth of

consumer demand.

14 There were now more signs that the pace of house price increases was beginning to slacken.

The three-month-on-three-month rate of increase of the average of the Halifax and Nationwide indices

had fallen in July for the second consecutive month. The June RICS survey showed a second


-----

5

consecutive fall in the net balance of estate agents reporting price increases and a fall in the ratio of

house sales to stocks on estate agents’ books: a range of other indicators of housing market activity,

such as those of mortgage approvals and net reservations, had also declined. Agents’ contacts

confirmed this picture. A deceleration in house prices would tend to slow the growth of consumption,

but it was unclear how rapidly and by how much house price inflation would moderate. Also, it was

uncertain how large the impact would be of any given change in house prices on consumption. That

depended on factors such as the proportion of households who were credit constrained and the extent

of demand for housing as an investment asset.

15 One additional complicating factor was the recent rapid growth of the buy-to-let market, raising

the demand for housing as an investment asset. According to an informal survey by the Bank’s

Agents, the growth of this market was now slowing, but there was little evidence of selling in

anticipation of lower future capital gains. Nevertheless, compared with owner-occupiers, buy-to-let

owners’ demand for property might be more sensitive to changes in prospective returns on different

assets, for example because their transactions costs were likely to be lower, as these would not include

the costs of moving house. So, to the extent that house prices were currently out of equilibrium, sales

by buy-to-let owners could help to precipitate a more abrupt adjustment.

16 After two strong quarters of business investment in 2003 Q4 and 2004 Q1, investment intentions

remained at or above their historical averages. However, high capital gearing might make some

companies cautious about taking on more debt.

17 The latest plans for nominal government spending, as published in HM Treasury’s 2004

_Spending Review in July, projected continued rapid growth into 2005, after which it would moderate._

The impact of government spending on the outlook for inflation was best captured by its effect on the

demand for resources in the economy; this too was likely to grow rapidly.

**Wages, costs and prices**

18 The data from the labour market over the past month had been mixed, but were broadly

consistent with a continuing gradual tightening. Surprisingly, the employment rate had fallen

0.2 percentage points in the three months to May compared with the three months to February;

the counterpart had largely been a rise in inactivity rather than in unemployment. But other indicators


-----

6

of the demand for labour had held up: average hours had stayed steady and the unemployment rate

had remained unchanged. Employment surveys continued to point to moderate growth in the demand

for labour. The Agents’ contacts reported that labour markets were tightening slowly and the REC

survey had found that the availability of staff had decreased further in June. So it seemed likely that

the unexpected fall in the employment rate had reflected short-term volatility or sampling error.

Whole-economy and private sector settlements had continued to drift up; so had whole economy

annual regular pay growth. The Agents’ contacts also reported some continuing upward pressure on

pay, mentioning among other factors the pressure to restore differentials in response to earlier

increases in the minimum wage; pay drift was thought to be increasing, and that might be an

indication of higher future pay settlements. But regular pay growth in the private sector had remained

steady, and, indeed, fallen a little on the three-month-on-three-month measure. The growth in regular

pay per hour in the economy as a whole had also remained flat.

19 CPI inflation had picked up to 1.6% in June, half a percentage point above its level three months

earlier. The main factors had been the recent rise in petrol prices and the ‘base effect’ from falls in

petrol prices a year earlier. In the short run, CPI inflation was likely to fall back during the rest of this

year partly because that ‘base effect’ disappeared and the proposed increase in the tax on petrol had

been deferred. In addition, the prices of foodstuffs and miscellaneous services had risen less rapidly

than expected at the time of the May Inflation Report, which also contributed to a lower short-run

projection of the rate of CPI inflation. In line with pre-release arrangements, an advance estimate of

CPI inflation in July had been provided to the Governor 3½ working days ahead of publication, and

this suggested a fall in the rate to 1.4%. However, there was evidence of mounting inflationary

pressure along the supply pipeline, with the rates of increase of input, output and import prices rising

and a number of surveys pointing to higher output price inflation.

20 The Committee noted that CPI inflation had been subdued over the past few years. One reason

might have been that pricing margins had narrowed more than expected, perhaps as a result of a

greater degree of competition. The terms of trade had also moved further in the United Kingdom’s

favour than expected. But it was not clear whether these changes would persist or go further, or

whether they would to some degree turn out to be a cyclical phenomenon that might reverse.

**The immediate policy decision**

21 The Committee reached its policy decision in the light of the projections published in the

_Inflation Report on Wednesday 11 August._

22 The Committee’s central projection, based on the assumption that official interest rates follow a

path implied by the market yield curve, was for four-quarter GDP growth to remain above its long-run

average in the near term, but then to slow during the second year of the projection as final domestic

demand growth moderated. This profile was broadly similar to the one published in the May Inflation

_Report. The Committee’s central projection for CPI inflation, also on the assumption that official_

interest rates follow a path implied by the market yield curve, was for an initial slowdown, after which

it would pick up steadily to meet the target around the two-year point. Thereafter, CPI inflation was

projected to stabilise close to the 2% target. Temporary weakness in some components of the CPI, and

some reduction in the current strong contribution from petrol prices, were responsible for the near-term

slowdown. Subsequently, the impact of domestic demand pressures would become more apparent, and

the effect in the first year of the forecast of the weakness of import prices would die away. For the

first two years, this projection was broadly similar to that published in May.

23 The Committee also examined projections for GDP growth and CPI inflation based on the

assumptions that the official interest rate remained constant at either 4.5% or 4.75%.

These projections showed slightly more rapid demand growth, particularly in the former case, and

lower exchange rate paths; hence they also suggested a slightly higher profile for CPI inflation.

24 The Committee discussed the various risks – in both directions – around these central

projections. There were a number of major downside risks to inflation. A more abrupt house price

correction was possible, associated with a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the growth of

consumption. There might be a slower-than-expected pickup in inflation if wage bargainers and price

setters formed their price expectations by extrapolating recent low inflation rates. The narrowing of

pricing margins might continue. External demand growth might slacken, in particular if oil prices

were to rise even more sharply. And faster-than-expected productivity growth, perhaps as a result of

the late ’90s boom in information, communications and technology investment, might raise the rate of

growth of potential supply. But there were major upside risks to inflation as well. In particular, the

narrowing of goods producers’ margins might reflect cyclical factors and therefore start to reverse.


-----

8

And, given the degree of labour market tightness, wage inflation might rise more rapidly than

expected.

25 Overall, the Committee’s best collective judgment was that the risks to the central projections for

both GDP growth and CPI inflation were broadly balanced. There was a range of views among

members, about both the central projections and the risks around them, but the differences were small.

26 Neither the news on the month, nor since the May Inflation Report, had significantly changed the

picture of a broadly based world recovery and UK GDP growth above trend. Fiscal and monetary

policies in most countries were still stimulatory. The US economy had perhaps been a little weaker

than expected, but the recovery in the euro area now seemed more robust and the major Asian

economies continued to expand strongly. In the United Kingdom, consumption growth seemed a little

weaker than expected, but demand as a whole was likely to grow faster than the supply capacity of the

economy. There was considerable uncertainty about the degree of slack in the labour market and

about the level of capacity utilisation, but it seemed likely that the level of demand for resources was

now high relative to potential supply. The increases in the repo rate since November were likely to

have started to moderate activity, but it was too soon to assess the size of the pass-through to CPI

inflation. The Committee noted that it would be necessary to monitor closely how this uncertainty and

the other major risks, in both directions, evolved.

27 The Committee considered the case for raising the repo rate by 25 basis points. First and

foremost, the Committee’s forecasts, whether based on the market yield curve or the constant interest

rate assumption, suggested that an increase would be consistent with bringing CPI inflation back to its

2% target over the next couple of years. Second, although an argument could be made for bringing

CPI inflation back towards target more rapidly if it could then be stabilised at that level, in practice,

that degree of fine tuning, entailing more volatile demand growth, was neither feasible nor desirable.

Third, for some members, the consequences of the upside risks to the inflation outlook materialising

outweighed those of the downside risks because of their impact on future inflation expectations.

Fourth, for one member, the continuing rapid growth of household debt, well in excess of the growth

of disposable income, was increasing the vulnerability of consumption to the crystallisation of any of

the downside risks to activity; a rise in the repo rate now would help to reduce the difficulties that

could pose for monetary policy in the future.


-----

9

28 The Committee also reviewed some possible arguments against an increase, although they did

not find them persuasive. First, although the projections implied that a rise in rates might be

appropriate at some point, that did not necessarily mean this month. Inflation expectations among

wage bargainers and price setters generally appeared to be well-anchored, so a short delay, during

which the risks to the outlook could be re-evaluated in the light of new information, might not be

costly. Second, the projections for CPI inflation, under both the market and constant rate assumptions,

showed it undershooting the target for a considerable period.

29 The Governor invited members to vote on the proposition that the repo rate should be increased

by 25 basis points to 4.75%. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the proposition.

30 The following members of the Committee were present:

Mervyn King, Governor
Rachel Lomax, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy
Andrew Large, Deputy Governor responsible for financial stability
Kate Barker
Charles Bean
Marian Bell
Richard Lambert
Stephen Nickell
Paul Tucker

Nick Stern was present as the Treasury representative.

#### ANNEX: SUMMARY OF DATA PRESENTED BY BANK STAFF

A1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee

on 30 July 2004, in advance of its meeting on 4-5 August. At the start of the Committee meeting

itself, members were made aware of the information that had subsequently become available, and that

information is included in this Annex.

**I** **Financial markets**

A2 Most market participants had expected the repo rate to be increased in August: only one of the

45 economists surveyed by Reuters had predicted otherwise. Over the period as a whole since the

Committee’s previous meeting, short-term interest rates had been broadly unchanged in the euro

area but up slightly in the United Kingdom and the United States. Intra-month movements,

particularly in the United States, had been more significant. Short-term interest rates in the United

States had fallen initially following weaker-than-expected US CPI data on 16 July, and UK short-term

interest rates had also fallen markedly. Short-term interest rates had then increased following the

testimonies of the Federal Reserve Chairman to the US Congress on 20 and 21 July, and some

stronger-than-expected US and UK data releases. Toward the end of the period, rates had declined

again, most notably in the United States in response to weaker-than-expected second-quarter US

GDP and personal consumption data on 30 July.

A3 US, UK and euro-area longer-term maturity nominal forward rates had changed little since the

Committee’s previous meeting. Ten-year break-even inflation spot rates, which had been falling

before the previous meeting, had fallen slightly in the United Kingdom, the euro area and the United

States. The indicative UK CPI inflation forward curve, as inferred by the Bank from the RPI inflation

forward curve, had fallen slightly at short and longer-term maturities. UK survey-based CPI inflation

expectations had remained unchanged since April.

A4 The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) had risen by 0.5% to 106.3. The first half of the

period had been characterised by low levels of activity in foreign exchange markets, reflected in

relatively low trading volumes. But activity had increased following the Federal Reserve Chairman’s

testimonies on 20 and 21 July. The foreign exchange market had interpreted the comments as

indicating a stronger outlook for the US economy, which had led to an appreciation of the US dollar.

And the US dollar had appreciated further after stronger-than-anticipated US consumer confidence

data on 27 July. Over the period, the US dollar ERI had risen by 1.7%. Against this international

background, sterling had depreciated by 1.6% against the dollar, but had appreciated by 0.9% and

1.0% against the euro and the yen respectively. Over the period, there had been a relatively sharp

decrease in short-term foreign exchange uncertainty, as measured by volatility implied by three-month

option contracts. But the low level of uncertainty was not unprecedented, and longer-maturity implied

volatility measures suggested that exchange rate volatility was expected to rise.

A5 In local currency terms, the FTSE All-Share index had increased by 0.5%, whereas the S&P 500,

Dow Jones Euro Stoxx and Topix indices had fallen by 1.8%, 2.4% and 2.2%, respectively.

The financials and resources sectors had contributed to the rise in the FTSE All-Share index.

By contrast, the financials sector had contributed negatively to the US and euro-area indices, together

with the technology, cyclical services and non-cyclical consumer goods sectors. Market views on

uncertainty about future equity indices, as inferred from forward volatility term structures implied by

the prices of option contracts on FTSE 100 and S&P 500 index futures, had been little changed from

recent low levels. Investment-grade corporate credit spreads had changed little internationally, while

spreads for lower quality corporate debt had fallen slightly.

**II** **The international environment**

A6 According to the advance estimate, US GDP had risen by 0.8% in 2004 Q2, following a rise of

1.1% in 2004 Q1 (revised from the earlier estimate of 1.0%). Compared with a year earlier, GDP had

risen by 4.8%. Private consumption had risen by 0.3% in 2004 Q2 compared with a quarter earlier.

Private investment had increased by 2.7% on the quarter, reflecting a rise of 2.1% in business

investment and a rise of 3.6% in residential investment. Government spending had risen by 0.6% on

the quarter. Net trade had made a zero contribution to quarterly GDP growth and stockbuilding had

contributed 0.1 percentage points. Estimated annual GDP growth in 2003 had been revised to 3.0%,


-----

3

from 3.1% previously, and growth in 2002 to 1.9% from 2.2%. Estimated annual GDP growth in 2001

had been revised up, to 0.8%, from 0.5% previously.

A7 Among the monthly indicators, industrial production had fallen by 0.3% in June compared with a

month earlier, after rising by 0.9% in May. Retail sales had fallen by 1.1% in June, following an

upwardly revised increase of 1.4% in May. Consumption had fallen by 0.9% in June compared with a

month earlier and saving as a percentage of nominal disposable income had increased to 2.0% in June,

from 1.2% in May (previously estimated to be 2.2%). The estimated saving ratio in 2001 had been

revised up from 1.7% to 1.8%; the ratio in 2002 had been revised down from 2.3% to 2.0%; and the

ratio in 2003 from 2.1% to 1.4%. The University of Michigan measure of consumer confidence had

risen to 96.7 in July (revised up from 96.0 in the preliminary release), from 95.6 in June.

The Conference Board measure had risen to 106.1 in July, from 102.8 in June. The Institute for

Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing index had risen to 62.0 in July, from 61.1 in June.

The ISM non-manufacturing index had risen to 64.8 in July, from 59.9 in June.

A8 US producer prices for finished goods had increased by 4.0% in the year to June. The US

headline consumer price index had risen by 3.3% in the year to June, compared with a 3.1% rise in the

year to May. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, had increased by 1.9% in the year to

June, up from 1.7% in the year to May. The core measure of the private consumption expenditures

deflator had risen by 1.6% compared with a year earlier in 2004 Q2, up from 1.4% in 2004 Q1.

Employment costs had risen by 0.9% in 2004 Q2 compared with a quarter earlier, down from 1.1% in

2004 Q1.

A9 In the euro area, the estimate of GDP growth in 2004 Q1 had been unrevised at 0.6% according

to the second release, although there had been offsetting changes to components and revisions to past

data. Quarterly private consumption growth had been revised up by 0.1 percentage points in each

quarter from 2003 Q2 to 2003 Q4, but had been unchanged at 0.6% in 2004 Q1 compared with the first

release. The estimates of gross fixed capital formation growth in each quarter from 2003 Q2 to 2004

Q1 had been revised up. In 2004 Q1, the estimated growth rate had been 0.2%, revised up from –0.1%

previously. Import growth in 2004 Q1 had been revised up to 0.9% compared with a quarter earlier,

from 0.8% previously. Export growth had been revised down to 1.5% in 2004 Q1, from 1.7%

previously. The contribution to GDP growth from stockbuilding had also been revised down in 2003

Q3 and 2003 Q4, but had been unchanged at zero percentage points in 2004 Q1. The contribution


-----

4

from net trade in 2004 Q1 had been revised down to 0.3 percentage points, from 0.4 percentage points

in the first release.

A10 The euro-area Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector had risen to

54.7 in July, from 54.4 in June. The service sector PMI had been 55.3 in July, unchanged from its

level in June. Industrial production in the euro area had risen by 0.7% in May compared with a month

earlier, after rising by 0.3% in April. The European Commission measures of business and consumer

confidence had been –4 and –14 respectively in July, both unchanged from their levels in June.

The German IFO index had risen to 95.6 in July, from 94.6 in June.

A11 The euro-area unemployment rate had been 9.0% in June, unchanged from its level in May.

The unemployment rate in Germany had increased in July to 10.6%, from 10.5% in June. According

to Eurostat, the volume of retail sales in the euro area had risen by 1.8% on a month earlier in June,

following a downwardly revised fall of 2.2% in May. Total German retail sales had increased by 0.4%

in June compared with a month earlier, following a downwardly revised decline of 2.6% in May.

A12 Harmonised twelve-month consumer price inflation in the euro area had fallen to 2.4% in June,

from 2.5% in May. Annual core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, had risen

to 1.9% in June, from 1.8% in May. The Eurostat flash estimate for euro-area HICP inflation had

indicated a rate of 2.4% in the year to July. Annual producer price inflation (excluding construction)

in the euro area had remained unchanged at 2.4% in June.

A13 In Japan, industrial production had fallen by 1.3% in June compared with a month earlier. But it

had increased by 2.6% in 2004 Q2 compared with a quarter earlier. Export volumes had risen by

17.9% in June compared with a year earlier, after having increased by 10.5% in the year to May.

Import volume growth had also picked up, to 10.0% in June compared with a year earlier, from –0.3%

in May. The all-activity index had fallen by 0.7% on the month in May, after rising by 2.3% in April.

A14 GDP in China had grown by 9.6% in the year to 2004 Q2, following growth of 9.8% in the year

to 2004 Q1. Annual consumer price inflation had risen to 5.0% in June, from 4.4% in May.

A15 Since the Committee’s previous meeting, the spot price of Brent crude oil had risen by $5.62 per

barrel, and The Economist dollar non-oil commodity price index had fallen by 6.2%. The indices for


-----

5

metals and food had fallen by 3.0% and 9.9% respectively. The index for non-food agricultural

products had been unchanged since the Committee’s previous meeting.

**III** **Money and credit**

A16 The twelve-month growth rate of notes and coin, adjusted for special factors, had fallen further

in July, to 6.0%. The annualised three-month growth rate had also fallen, to 5.6% in July from 7.4% in

June. Annual growth of aggregate M4 deposits had fallen slightly, to 7.8% in June from 8.0% in May.

Annual growth of M4 lending (excluding the effects of securitisations) had also fallen by

0.2 percentage points, to 12.1%. Excluding other financial corporations, annual M4 deposit growth

had risen slightly, to 9.2%, while annual M4 lending growth (excluding the effects of securitisations)

had fallen slightly, to 11.8%.

A17 The annual growth rate of households’ holdings of M4 had fallen slightly, to 8.5% in June from

8.6% in May, while the annual growth rate of households’ M4 lending (excluding the effects of

securitisations) had risen slightly, to 14.0% from 13.9%. Within total net lending to individuals

growth. All three sector indices (construction, manufacturing, and services) had remained above the

‘no change’ level of 50. Seasonally adjusted information from recent surveys of employment

intentions had generally shown positive percentage balances of employers planning to recruit staff.

The average level of vacancies in the three months to June had increased by 10.4% compared with the

same period a year earlier. The latest CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey had reported an increase

in the percentage of manufacturing firms that had forecast shortages of skilled and other labour.

**VII Reports by the Bank’s Agents**

A40 The Bank’s regional Agents reported that the growth of service sector output had remained

strong, but might have eased recently. Companies providing services to business customers had

mostly reported continuing strong growth of activity, although there had been some signs of weakness

in parts of the financial services sector, possibly related to lower world equity markets. Demand for

consumer services had slowed in July, following a strong June when retail sales may have been

boosted by the Euro 2004 football championships, as well as advanced summer sales. That may have

masked an underlying slowdown in sales in June that had continued into July.

A41 Manufacturers had reported continuing steady growth. But many were cautious about their

future prospects, partly because of perceived downside risks to the world economy and upside risks to

the prices of oil and other commodities.

A42 Contacts’ planned investment had continued to pick up. Many had cited plans to invest in

information technology to improve their cost competitiveness. Relatively few contacts had planned to

increase capacity by investing in new buildings and equipment. The Agents’ reports suggested that

capacity utilisation had risen above normal levels. That could stimulate investment in new capacity if

activity strengthened and business optimism improved.

**VIII The Agents’ special topic**

A43 The Bank’s regional Agents had conducted a special survey of the buy-to-let property market,

questioning around 130 firms involved in the sector. Respondents had been asked to compare

expected investment demand over the next six months with the level of demand over the previous six

months. Respondents had also been asked what they believed would influence investor behaviour over

the second half of 2004.

A44 On balance, respondents thought that the level of buy-to-let activity would fall over the coming

six months relative to the previous six months, reflecting higher interest rates and weaker rents and

property prices. The survey indicated that the majority of respondents had thought that landlords held

long-term views about their investments and so believed that the buy-to-let market would not provide a

significant source of instability over the coming months.
