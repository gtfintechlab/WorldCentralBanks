##### These are the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting held on 7 and 8 March 2001

 They are also available on the Internet

(http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/mpc/mpc0103.pdf).

##### The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The Committee meets on a regular monthly basis and minutes of its meetings are released on the Wednesday of the second week after the meeting takes place. Accordingly, the minutes of the Committee meeting held on 4 and 5 April will be published on 18 April 2001.

#### MINUTES OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 7-8 MARCH 2001

1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed the implications of

the Budget; demand and output; money, credit and asset prices; the world economy; the labour

market; and prices and costs.

**The Budget**

2 The Committee had been briefed by Treasury officials prior to its meeting on the broad outline

of the Chancellor’s Budget, including the current fiscal position, the Treasury’s economic forecast

and the projected implications for government receipts and spending which showed that the

expected path for public sector net borrowing was close to previous projections. By the time the

Committee made its decision, all the details of the Budget had been announced. The main fiscal

impact was from the over-indexation of the starting rate band for income tax, the measures

supporting families with children and the additions to departmental spending. Alcohol duties had

been frozen. Relative to the Pre-Budget Report (PBR) forecast, extra revenue was now expected in

the current fiscal year and the Treasury expected this structural improvement to persist into future

years, broadly offsetting the cost of new measures. So the fiscal stance in the current year had once

again turned out to have been tighter than projected, but the outlook had not been materially

changed in the light of this improvement. To that extent, the Budget differed little from what had

already been built into the Committee’s projections included in the February Inflation Report.

3 In discussion at the Committee’s meeting, it was suggested that the impact of the Budget

measures on the composition of demand might nevertheless have some aggregate economic effects.

The newly-announced measures would tend to redistribute income from higher to lower income

families, which might have a higher propensity to consume out of their income. The more

substantial PBR consultation measures, however, were largely petrol-related and so could tend to

redistribute income in the opposite direction. At the same time, the supply-side measures might help

to reduce the natural rate of unemployment. So both demand and supply could increase as a result

of the Budget, but the net effect was likely to be very modest.


-----

4 Some on the Committee questioned whether the convention of adopting the Treasury’s

nominal projections for government receipts and spending in the Inflation Report projections was

appropriate, given that they were based on deliberately cautious assumptions. In particular, the

strength of receipts, notably income tax, might be related to the current buoyancy of the economy

and so could balance out over a full business cycle, but this should be reviewed in the context of the

projections to be made for the May Inflation Report. There were also uncertainties as to the

prospective rate of growth of real government spending. These included uncertainties relating to its

composition and, for the given nominal profile, to the assumptions made about price deflators in the

Committee’s projections. These questions too would need to be reviewed in the context of the

projections for the next Inflation Report.

**Demand and Output**

5 Turning to the latest GDP data, output growth in the fourth quarter was unrevised at 0.3%.

Revisions to earlier quarters had changed the composition of expenditure somewhat. Consumption

growth had been revised down by 0.1 percentage points for each of the first three quarters of last

year and was 0.7% in the fourth quarter. After these data revisions, consumption was weaker than

expected at the time of the February Inflation Report. On the other hand, the average rate of growth

of business investment during the year had been revised up substantially and had been 3.2% in the

fourth quarter. Its level was 3½% higher in the fourth quarter than had been projected in the

February Inflation Report.

6 The pace of consumption growth appeared to have been maintained into the current year, with

consumer confidence relatively firm and the housing market regaining some momentum after its

recent pause. Retail sales growth had rebounded to 0.7% in January. It was likely that GDP growth

would rebound somewhat in the first quarter, after a weak fourth quarter last year.

7 Though most members regarded these data as indicating a somewhat more robust picture of

domestic demand growth than had been expected, some felt that the downward revisions to

consumption should be given more weight than the revisions to investment: all the quarterly

revisions to consumption growth last year were downwards, and the fourth quarter outturn had been

lower than expected. By contrast, the direction of the revisions to data on investment growth varied


-----

from quarter to quarter. Given the volatility of quarterly investment data, it was too soon to draw

firm conclusions from the apparent recovery of investment growth in the fourth quarter. These

members also noted that GDP growth in the fourth quarter remained a little lower than had been

assumed as the starting point for the Committee’s February projections, although the latest data on

construction output suggested that GDP growth in the fourth quarter might be revised up slightly.

8 The Committee also had available to it at its meeting the latest Index of Production data,

which indicated a fall of 0.9% in manufacturing output in January. This was matched by equivalent

increases in other components which left the index overall unchanged on the month. A sharp fall in

the output of the electrical and optical equipment sector, which had been growing strongly in recent

months, more than accounted for the fall in manufacturing output. These movements could be

erratic, although it was possible that they might reflect a more sustained weakening of the global

technology sector.

**Monetary and financial conditions**

9 The latest monetary data showed robust growth in the main aggregates. Notes and coin, after

allowing for estimates of millennium distortions, had grown by about 8½% in February, the fastest

rate of expansion since September 1988. Though low inflation was likely to be part of the

explanation for the faster growth of this aggregate, it was difficult to believe that this was the whole

story and the figures were consistent with the buoyant data on retail sales. Broad money growth had

increased to about 9½% in January, reversing signs the previous month of easing in the rate of

growth. Total credit had grown rapidly, by 12.7% in the year to January.

10 There were differing interpretations of these data. Some members expected the projected

slowdown in consumption growth to be associated with much weaker growth in credit aggregates, as

households sought to reduce their indebtedness. There was still no sign that this rebalancing was yet

in train, so the rapid growth of money and credit implied upside risks to the outlook for inflation.

Others observed that holdings of notes and coin continued to rise relative to retail sales; and that,

with nominal returns on savings so low and with the improved liquidity of savings instruments

offered outside the M4 sector, substantial household asset reallocations and large swings in M4


-----

aggregates could be expected without any material implications for the inflation outlook.

11 Mortgage loan rates had been falling faster than the Bank’s repo rate, most recently as a result

of more intense competition between mortgage lenders. If savers were similarly facing lower rates,

the average interest rate faced by households would already have fallen relative to the Bank’s repo

rate. This might simply represent anticipation of a further cut in the official rate. But if the spread

between mortgage and saving rates had narrowed, this would - other things being equal - be

reflected in lower profitability and the value of bank shares would fall, with implications for

household wealth. So some members were unsure about the extent to which this represented an

overall easing of monetary conditions for households, with consequent effects on aggregate demand.

12 Short-term market interest rates had eased further over the month, in expectation of further

cuts in the repo rate, and the market repo rate was some 20 basis points further below the Bank’s

repo rate than normal. The market expectation signalled by these rates was for cuts of 50 basis

points over the next few months.

13 A number of medium-rated corporate bond spreads had widened since the start of the year.

This was in large part a reflection of the sharp rise in spreads on telecoms sector bonds. Some

members noted that this could have significant implications for corporate investment. Higher-rated

corporate credit spreads on the other hand had narrowed slightly on the month.

14 Equity prices, both in the United Kingdom and internationally, had fallen sharply in February,

reversing the rises in January. Some members thought that the widespread pattern of equity price

falls indicated investor concern that weakness in the US economy would have a significant effect on

other countries’ growth prospects. By contrast, house prices seemed to be increasing again after a

pause last year. The most recent price balance reported by the Royal Institution of Chartered

Surveyors was back up to the level seen in the second quarter of last year. The latest equity price

falls could be offset in their effects on households’ total wealth by the implied housing wealth gains,

and some members felt it was unlikely that they would yet be sufficient to have made households

more concerned about the balance between their debt and wealth. This could, by allowing

households’ current very low savings rate to persist, weaken their financial positions and so increase

the risk of a sharp adjustment if consumer confidence were to fall. But the nominal costs of


-----

servicing debt were now relatively low and it was suggested by some that a given level of

indebtedness might therefore be less worrying than in the past. On this argument, debt at current

levels would be unlikely to constrain consumption or to prompt households to save more, unless

employment prospects were to worsen.

**The world economy**

15 Outside forecasts for world growth were still being lowered, especially for Japan and the

United States. Economic data for the United States were mixed: the fourth quarter outturn was not

as bad as had been feared, and early indications for the first quarter were similarly somewhat

stronger with retail sales up 0.7% in January. The purchasing managers’ index had recovered

slightly but remained very weak. Consumer confidence indicators had fallen sharply, with the

expectations component of the Conference Board measure having fallen to its lowest level since

October 1993, though the current conditions index had fallen much less. Nor was the inflation

outlook wholly comforting, with CPI inflation at over 3½% and the core rate at best stable. If

worries about inflation prospects were to develop, the authorities could become more cautious about

providing a further stimulus to the economy. But some pointed to the fact that inflation outturns

were a lagging indicator and that various leading indicators of inflation (for example, capacity

utilisation and commodity prices) suggested falling inflation in future.

16 For some, the latest information made it seem more plausible that the slowdown in the

United States would be prolonged rather than short-lived. Though backward-looking and current

indicators of economic conditions had perhaps been stronger than expected, those with a more

forward-looking content continued to weaken. Recent equity market falls had been driven by profit

warnings, which were now no longer associated with predictions of early recovery. The general

picture was of expectations for the first quarter being upgraded somewhat, but with those for the

second quarter being revised down. The outlook for investment was weaker, and industrial sector

capacity utilisation was at its lowest since August 1992.

17 Others noted that, while the trough might now be reached rather later than had previously been

expected, that need not of itself imply that the slowdown would be any more protracted. It was

important to differentiate between what was actually known (which was stronger than expected) and


-----

what remained speculative. Though equity market prices had fallen back in February, they had so

far done no more than return to their levels at the turn of the year.

18 Growth in Japan had been flat through last year and the Consensus forecast for the first quarter

had been lowered. Growth in the euro area overall appeared to be stable, though somewhat lower

than last year. There was recent evidence of weakness in Germany, with revised data suggesting

slowing in the second half of last year and private domestic demand sharply lower, but the French

economy was more robust. It was encouraging that there had been few signs of contagion from the

severe economic problems faced by Turkey and Argentina.

19 In terms of the effects of these world developments on the United Kingdom, the evidence so

far was consistent with the projection in the February _Inflation Report. Business and consumer_

confidence remained strong, and exports to the United States in January had reversed the sharp fall

recorded in the previous month’s data. The Bank’s regional Agents had reported some falls in

orders from the United States, but these were balanced by gains elsewhere. They had also reported

that some investment projects were being deferred. Admittedly, none of the forward-looking UK

surveys asked questions directly related to the United States, although overall export optimism had

fallen in a number of surveys, and so it was perhaps too soon to expect to see evidence of the effects

of a US-related slowdown here. Moreover, recent falls in mortgage interest rates could be

supporting consumer confidence while the decline in sterling against the euro from its peaks of last

year might be supporting business confidence - so masking any effect from the US slowdown. But

it nonetheless remained true that the evidence of a significant impact on the United Kingdom was so

far slight.

**The labour market**

20 Labour market data remained hard to interpret. The sharp fall in employment as measured by

the Labour Force Survey (LFS) was less pronounced in the latest release, covering the fourth

quarter, than it had been in the three months to November. Permanent employment continued to

grow and the recent offsetting falls in temporary employment could be erratic. These LFS data were

not matched by similar falls in survey-based measures of employment such as those compiled for

the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which continued to show overall employment


-----

growth. But the LFS data remained stronger than the available quarterly figures on Workforce Jobs.

Data on unemployment showed a more consistent picture, with both LFS and claimant count

measures falling. The most striking data were those for inactivity, which had risen sharply in recent

months. This increase was concentrated among those who said that they did not want a job. The

Bank’s regional Agents reported some early indications of the labour market becoming less tight,

but the data on quantities showed little sign yet of any significant loosening.

21 The latest data on the Average Earnings Index confirmed the upward trend in earnings growth

which had developed during the second half of last year, and were somewhat stronger than expected.

Earnings growth in private services had been above 5% throughout the fourth quarter and regular

pay growth in the private sector had been rising steadily, from 4.3% in July to 4.9% in December.

Information so far available on pay settlements in January was, however, less worrying and in line

with expectations given the higher level of RPI inflation that month than a year earlier. The slowing

pace of RPI inflation over the coming months should be a helpful moderating influence on

settlements in April, the busiest settlement month of the year.

22 The Government had announced that the adult rate for the National Minimum Wage was to be

increased to £4.10 in October. Initial staff estimates suggested that this could add 0.15 percentage

points to the level of earnings and about 0.1 percentage points to price inflation. If differentials

restoration were to be more extensive than assumed, it could increase these effects. But when the

Minimum Wage was introduced in October 1998, the number of workers directly affected had

turned out smaller than expected. Some sectors of the economy faced intense competitive pressure,

which could further reduce pass-through from wages to prices. And some firms might already have

adjusted wages in anticipation of an increase. Taking all these factors together, it did not seem

likely that the effects on inflation from uprating to this level would be large, although this too would

need to be reviewed in the context of the May Inflation Report.

**Prices and costs**

23 The Bank’s regional Agents had carried out a special survey during February of firms’

expectations of their ability to increase prices this year. This followed survey evidence a month ago

that there had been an increase in such expectations - pointing to greater inflationary pressure in the


-----

year ahead. Price expectations in these other surveys had this month fallen back, and the Agents’

conclusion from their own survey was that firms’ expectations were consistent with gently

increasing inflationary pressures. This was in line with the central projection for RPIX inflation in

the February Inflation Report. Comparing some of those survey responses this year with

expectations a year earlier, however, the proportion of firms expecting to increase prices had fallen.

24 The tax changes in the Budget would lower RPIX inflation in March by about 0.1 percentage

points relative to the Committee’s February projection and the change in the timing of the Budget

(which was a little earlier this year than last) would reduce RPIX inflation by 0.3 percentage points

in April. Against this, utilities prices were likely to contribute an additional 0.3 percentage points to

inflation in the second quarter, as the effects of last year’s price cuts dropped out of the annual

comparison. Initial estimates of the impact on food prices of the foot and mouth outbreak suggested

that it could add 0.1 percentage points to the index, but these estimates were highly uncertain in

timing and extent, and a wide range of outcomes was possible. So while these various effects

together suggested very little net effect on inflation, timing differences could lead to erratic

movements in the index over the coming months which would, the Committee agreed, have no

direct significance for policy.

**The immediate policy decision**

25 The news on the month was mixed. The largest uncertainty for the outlook remained that

surrounding world activity, and especially the outlook for the pace of growth in the United States.

While the weakness evident in recent data was not perhaps as severe as had been feared, forward
looking indicators were less reassuring. But the prospects for domestic demand were if anything a

little stronger than had been expected at the time of the February Inflation Report. The changes

announced in the Budget were in line with what was expected from the PBR and so had little

bearing on the Committee’s decision this month.

26 For most members, the data did not support a further cut in the repo rate this month. The

world economy was turning out broadly in line with the projections made at the time of the February

_Inflation Report. The most likely prospect for output in the United States was perhaps a little_

weaker than a month ago. While some comfort had been taken at last month’s meeting from the


-----

recovery in US equity prices in January, they had fallen back in February - though only to the levels

seen at the start of the year. Confidence there remained very weak and while the slowdown to date

had not been as abrupt as some commentators had feared, the trough might be reached rather later

and the recovery might now be rather less rapid. The US slowdown could impact on the confidence

of businesses and consumers in the United Kingdom, but it had not so far done so. The Japanese

economy was faltering again, and its problems might be more deep-rooted than had previously been

acknowledged: the difficulties were compounded by the fragility of its banking and insurance

sectors. Prospects for growth in the euro area remained reasonably strong overall, though growth

was a little slower than last year, and - so far - appeared little affected by the uncertainties emanating

from the United States. UK exporters appeared to see improved demand from some regions which

broadly offset weakness in US demand.

27 The domestic prospect seemed by contrast to be slightly stronger than a month ago.

Consumption was still growing strongly. Money and credit data were consistent with it continuing

to do so. The downward revisions to consumption growth through last year were small and might

suggest a somewhat lower modal projection, but at the same time these revisions reduced the

downside risk associated with the possible need for households to rebuild their balance sheets. The

housing market seemed to be regaining momentum. Investment growth through much of last year

had been revised up and now seemed to be more consistent both with survey evidence and with a

stronger profile over the forecast horizon. The labour market showed little sign of easing and there

were modest signs of strengthening earnings growth. Inflation remained below target, but not

substantially so. The most striking feature of the UK economy was the strength of demand and

confidence, despite the world outlook.

28 Some of these members noted the difficulties created by the current conjunction of relatively

strong domestic demand and RPIX inflation edging further below target. There was little evidence

yet that households were beginning to moderate their consumption in order to rebuild their balance

sheets, and there were signs that the housing market was picking up again. A cut in rates now,

though in other circumstances desirable in order to move RPIX inflation back to target, might

instead lead to a further stimulus to consumer spending in the short term and a further worsening of

household balance sheet positions, thus increasing the scale of adjustment which would be required

if sentiment were to change. Were these domestic upside risks to diminish, or the downside risks


-----

inherent in the world economic outlook to crystallise, it could become easier to take steps in the

short run to move inflation back to target without adding to the risks in the medium term. For these

members, such considerations were an important factor in their assessment of the appropriate timing

of a change in the repo rate; and it was generally recognised that it would be necessary to respond to

that eventuality if and when it arose.

29 Some other members, while accepting that the news was mixed, concluded that a further cut in

rates was justified this month. The outlook for the world economy had deteriorated, which

reinforced their assessment that world activity would grow less rapidly than the best collective

judgment reflected in the Committee’s February projection. Equities prices in the major markets

had fallen and the number of profit warnings had increased and spread to more sectors. The

slowdown was likely to be more prolonged, and possibly deeper. Domestically, there was news in

both directions. The faster growth of average earnings was worrying, and would be highly relevant

if it were to persist. The pick-up in the housing market was also a potential concern. But the latest

data on manufacturing pointed in the other direction and could be the first sign that the global

slowdown in the information and communications technology sector was also affecting the

United Kingdom.

30 More fundamental on this view was that RPIX inflation had now been below target for 22

months, that it was continuing to slow and that it was not clear that the projected pace of output

growth would bring it back to target over the forecast horizon. In particular, these members thought

it implausible that inflation would return to target at the two-year horizon, as projected in the

February Inflation Report, because they did not share the implicit assumption that output was

currently above its full capacity level. The fiscal stance was slightly contractionary and monetary

policy - with ex post real interest rates at around 4% on the basis of current inflation rates - was

contractionary too. A dynamic monetary conditions index showed that, on this measure and at

current interest and exchange rates, conditions would continue to tighten a little for the rest of this

year and then stabilise. In any case, these members had thought that a 50 basis point cut could have

been justified in February, because they believed that the level of rates needed to be realigned. So

the justification for a cut this month was not merely the most recent news. There was no great

urgency for such a cut, but the risks to inflation lay on the downside and it was preferable to take

steps to bring inflation back to the target level sooner rather than later. Further cuts might be needed


-----

if the downside risks from the world economy materialised.

31 The Governor invited members to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate should be

maintained at 5.75%. Seven members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King,

David Clementi, Christopher Allsopp, Charles Bean, Stephen Nickell and Ian Plenderleith) voted for

the proposition. DeAnne Julius and Sushil Wadhwani voted against, preferring a reduction in the

repo rate of 25 basis points.

#### ANNEX: SUMMARY OF DATA PRESENTED BY BANK STAFF

A1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy Committee on

2 March 2001, in advance of its meeting on 7-8 March 2001. At the start of the Committee meeting itself,

members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available, and that information is

included in this Annex.

**I** **The international environment**

A2 US industrial production in January had decreased by 0.3% from the previous month, the fourth

consecutive month of decline. Some of the fall in January could be attributed to milder weather, which had

led to a fall in utilities output of 6.0% on a month before, following a rise of 7.1% in December.

Manufacturing output had fallen by 0.1% in January as a result of a 6.6% fall in motor vehicle production.

Inventory growth outside the information technology (IT) sector had fallen in response to production

cutbacks. In the IT sector, however, inventory growth had increased slightly. New capital goods orders

(excluding erratic components) had increased by 6.5% in January, although the trend remained one of

slowing growth. The NAPM purchasing managers’ index had recovered slightly in February. Real

consumer spending had grown by 0.2% in January from the previous month, and nominal retail sales by

0.7%. Sales of motor vehicles had picked up strongly, following weak sales in December. Both the

Michigan and the Conference Board measures of consumer confidence had continued to decline in

February; the Conference Board measure had reached its lowest level since June 1996.

A3 World equity prices had fallen during February, reversing the rises seen in January. In the United

States, the Wilshire index had fallen by 9.6% and the NASDAQ index had fallen by 22.4%. Analysts’

expectations of earnings per share in the United States for 2001 had fallen in February. Spreads on short
term commercial paper had narrowed slightly in February, while corporate bond spreads over 10-year

swap rates had been little changed. The Senior Loan Officer Survey had shown that banks had tightened

credit conditions between November and January, and demand for loans had fallen. Aggregate lending

data, however, had shown that commercial and industrial borrowing had increased by 1.4% in January.


-----

A4 In the euro area, GDP in 2000 Q4 had grown by 0.2% in Germany, 0.9% in France and 0.8% in

Italy on the previous quarter. In Germany, domestic demand had been weak, and net trade had made a

negative contribution to GDP growth in the fourth quarter. GDP growth there in the third quarter had been

revised down by 0.3 percentage points, mainly due to a smaller positive contribution from domestic

demand. In France and Italy, preliminary data had suggested that domestic demand growth, particularly

investment, had contributed strongly to output growth at the end of 2000. The German IFO index had

risen for the first time in eight months in January, though the forward-looking sub-component of the index

had continued to decline. German manufacturing orders had fallen in January by 3.9% on the month.

Industrial confidence indicators in France and Italy had continued to fall in February, but remained at high

levels. Industrial and consumer confidence had also fallen slightly in the euro area as a whole. Retail sales

in the euro area in December had risen on the previous month by 0.1%.

A5 Japanese quarterly GDP growth in the third quarter of last year had been revised down from +0.2%

to -0.6%, due to a downward revision in the estimate of non-residential investment growth from 7.8% to

1.5%. In the fourth quarter, both household expenditure and output had remained weak. Industrial

production growth had fallen by 3.9% in January, while construction output and domestic high-tech

machinery orders had also declined. Confidence of smaller businesses had been little changed in February,

following a sharp decline in January. The trade balance for Japan had been negative in January for the first

time since January 1997, due to a sharp fall in export volumes to all of Japan’s major trading partners.

A6 The spot price for Brent crude oil had fallen to $26.64, from $29.99 at the time of the Committee’s

previous meeting, partly due to downward revisions in expectations of world demand. The price of other

industrial commodities had also declined, and the price of foodstuffs had been little changed.

A7 In the United States, producer prices had risen by 4.8% in the year to January, mainly driven by

large increases in the prices of residential gas, tobacco and autos. Annual consumer price inflation had

risen to 3.7% in January, from 3.4% in December. Core consumer price inflation, which excluded energy

and food prices, had remained broadly stable for the past eight months. In the euro area, the harmonised

index of consumer prices had increased by 2.4% in the year to January, while producer prices had

increased by 4.8% in the same period. In Japan, domestic wholesale prices had fallen by 0.3% in the year


-----

to January. Consumer price inflation had risen by 0.1%, but core consumer prices had continued to

decline.

A8 Financial markets had expected a further reduction of official interest rates in the United States.

Expectations of the path of official interest rates in the euro area had firmed slightly. The Bank of Japan

had reduced its official overnight call interest rate from 0.25% to 0.15% on 28 February.

A9 Industrial production growth had risen slightly in Latin America and the Eastern European transition

economies, but industrial production growth in Asia had continued to slow. Emerging market bond

spreads had widened slightly. In Turkey, the spread on dollar-denominated sovereign debt had widened

by about 90 basis points since 16 February.

**II** **Monetary and financial conditions**

A10 The twelve-month growth rate of notes and coin had recovered to 8.3% in February, as most of the

distortion from the millennium echo had faded. The trend decline in the ratio of retail sales to notes and

coin had been relatively stable over recent years, so the fall in the underlying growth of notes and coin

suggested a possible easing in retail sales growth in February.

A11 M4 had risen strongly, by £10.2 billion (1.2%) in January, which had raised the twelve-month

growth rate to 9.4%. The twelve-month growth rate of M4 excluding other financial corporations had

picked up to 7.5%, its highest since December 1997. The twelve-month growth rate of aggregate M4

lending (excluding the effects of securitisations) had risen slightly to 12.7%.

A12 Household M4 growth had been strong in January, despite higher self-assessment tax payments: the

twelve-month growth rate had been 6.9%. Analysis had suggested that the data were consistent with an

upward shock to consumption in 2000 which had caused households to run down money balances. So

some recovery in household M4 had not been unexpected.


-----

A13 The twelve-month growth rate of net secured lending to individuals had been stable at 8.3% in

January, while that of unsecured lending had slowed to 12.0%. The Bank’s preliminary estimate of

mortgage equity withdrawal in 2000 Q4 was £2.4 billion, little changed from 2000 Q3. The number of

loan approvals had risen by 11,000 to 112,000 in January, and the number of outstanding mortgage

approvals had continued to rise.

A14 The one-month flow of private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs’) M4 had been moderate in

January, although the twelve-month growth rate had risen to 10.2%. The twelve-month growth rate of

PNFCs’ borrowing had risen to 14.3%. The monthly flow of total external finance-raising had returned to

the average of its level during 2000. The twelve-month growth rates of OFCs’ M4 and M4 lending

(excluding securitisations) in January had been 15.9% and 19.3% respectively.

A15 Short-term interest rate expectations, as measured by the two-week gilt repo curve, had fallen since

the Committee’s last meeting. Implied volatilities on short sterling contracts suggested that uncertainty

about the immediate future had increased slightly. Nominal gilt yields beyond the three-year horizon had

risen slightly. Corporate bond spreads had risen slightly, but spreads on telecoms sector bonds had risen

sharply, continuing the trend of the last year. Issuance of sterling non-gilt bonds had been fairly strong.

Survey-based measures of short-term inflation expectations had fallen, but longer-term inflation

expectations inferred from gilt yields had increased.

A16 Retail rates had shown little change since the Committee’s previous meeting: following the reduction

in the Bank’s repo rate, the Standard Variable Mortgage Rate (SVR) had fallen by only one basis point in

February. Reductions that had been announced to take place in March were likely to reduce the SVR by

more than 25 basis points. There had been reductions in fixed and discounted mortgage rates.

Remortgaging as a percentage of gross lending had risen in January.

A17 The FTSE All-Share index had declined by 3.4% since the Committee’s previous meeting, while the

Small Cap index had declined by 3.9%. IT, non-cyclical services and financials had been the weakest

sectors. The number of profit warnings made by UK firms in February had been higher than in the same

month in 2000, and had been distributed more widely across sectors than in January.


-----

A18 Since the Committee’s previous meeting, the sterling exchange rate index had risen by 0.7% to

104.5 and the main sterling bilateral exchange rates had been little changed.

**III** **Demand and output**

A19 Quarterly GDP growth at constant market prices had been unrevised at 0.3% in 2000 Q4, though

the annual growth rate had been revised up to 2.5% from 2.4%. Quarterly growth in 2000 Q3 had been

revised up to 0.8% from 0.7%. Total industrial production had fallen by 0.6% in 2000 Q4. Manufacturing

output had grown by 0.5% in 2000 Q4, while service sector output had grown by 0.7%, unrevised from

the preliminary estimate. Agricultural output had fallen by 3.0% in Q4 and construction output had fallen

by 0.1%. DETR data published after the GDP release had shown that construction output grew by 1.5%

in Q4. More recently available data had shown that manufacturing output had fallen sharply by, 0.9%, in

January. That had reflected a very steep decline in optical networking and mobile phones output after a

sharp build-up in December. Utilities output had risen in January following a fall the previous month.

Overall industrial output had therefore been unchanged in January, but had fallen by 0.6% in the latest three

months on the previous three.

A20 The expenditure breakdown of GDP showed that final domestic demand had grown by 0.7% in Q4.

Domestic demand had grown by only 0.1%, however, as the change in inventories had reduced quarterly

growth by 0.6 percentage points.

A21 Private sector consumption (including that of non-profit institutions serving households) had grown by

0.7% in 2000 Q4. There had been downward revisions to consumption growth in 2000, primarily related

to the consumption of services. The level of consumption in 2000 Q3 had been 0.3% lower than

previously thought. Real government consumption had risen by 0.2% in Q4, down from growth of 1.2% in

Q3. Total investment (including acquisitions less disposals of valuables) had grown by 1.2% in 2000 Q4.

There had been significant upward revisions to investment in 2000: the revised level of total investment in

2000 Q3 had been 1.5% higher than previously thought. Business investment had risen by 3.2% in Q4,

and was 4.0% higher than a year earlier. Within this, manufacturing investment had fallen by 5.2% in 2000

Q4, while service sector investment had risen by 4.5%.

A22 Inventories had made a negative contribution to GDP growth in 2000 Q4. Inventories (including the

alignment adjustment) had been estimated to have fallen by £0.2 billion in Q4, compared with a rise of

£1.1 billion in Q3. Excluding the alignment adjustment, inventories had risen by £0.5 billion in Q4.

A23 Net trade had contributed 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth in 2000 Q4, following a

contribution of -0.2 percentage points in Q3. Total exports of goods and services had risen by 1.4%,

while imports had grown by 0.7%.

A24 Turning to indicators of activity in the first quarter of 2001, retail sales volumes had risen by 0.7% in

January, broadly in line with the January CBI Distributive Trades survey, which had shown a total balance

of +36 retailing respondents reporting higher sales in January compared with a year ago. This balance had

fallen slightly to +32 in February. The MORI measure of consumer confidence had risen slightly in

February, while the GfK confidence index had fallen slightly. Households’ confidence about their own

situations remained firm on both measures. Private new car registrations in February had been 15.4%

higher than a year earlier. On the same basis, total new registrations had been 7.3% higher.

A25 Housing indicators had been mixed in February. The Halifax house price index had risen by 1.6%,

but the Nationwide measure had fallen by 0.8%. Annual house price inflation had continued to be

markedly different on these two measures, with the Halifax reporting annual increases of 3.4% compared

with 8.1% on the Nationwide measure. Particulars delivered had fallen by 3,000 to 109,000 in January,

but the number of loan approvals had increased to a record high of 112,000. Private housing starts and

completions had both risen in January.

A26 The manufacturing output expectations balance in the CBI Monthly Industrial Trends survey had

fallen to +9 in February. The total orders balance had fallen to -16 in February, and the export orders

balance had fallen to -24. The headline index of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS)

services survey had remained unchanged at 57.1 in February, and the CIPS construction index had fallen

slightly to 57.5. Construction new orders had fallen by 8.0% in the three months to January compared to

the previous three months. The headline index of the CIPS manufacturing survey had risen very slightly to

52.1 in February. The output index had fallen to 53.3, while total new orders had picked up at the fastest


-----

rate since December 1999, although export orders had risen less strongly.

**IV** **The labour market**

A27 According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), employment had fallen by 5,000 in 2000 Q4.

Changes in female employment had been a key feature of recent outturns, and had accounted for all the

falls in both self-employment and part-time employment. Nevertheless, growth in permanent employee

numbers had continued and the sharp downturn in temporary employees had not persisted.

A28 The part-time share of employment had fallen back from its 2000 Q3 peak. Average (and total)

hours worked had grown by 0.4% in 2000 Q4. This had been more than accounted for by an increase of

2.2% in part-time hours and of 5.8% in second-job hours. The increase in part-time working in recent

years had been concentrated in jobs of around 20 hours per week. This had reduced the share of short
hours jobs in the part-time total.

A29 The CIPS surveys in February had suggested that employment had continued to grow and had

shown no evidence of the 2000 Q4 dip seen in the LFS data. According to the Recruitment and

Employment Confederation, scarcity of agency staff had continued to become less widespread.

A30 LFS unemployment had decreased by 21,000 in 2000 Q4, reversing the increases seen in the

previous two releases. Over the same period, the claimant count had fallen by 14,200 and by a further

25,500 in January, to its lowest level since December 1975. The increased rate of decline in the claimant

count had been accounted for by higher outflows. Over-25s had accounted for the decline in the LFS

unemployment rate, while the recent positive contribution from youth unemployment had moderated.

A31 The working-age inactivity rate had risen by 0.2 percentage points in 2000 Q4. This had been

entirely due to a rise of 0.5 percentage points in the female inactivity rate. The rise in inactivity had

continued to be accounted for by a rise in those who did not want a job. The Bank's measure of weighted

non-employment had been flat in Q4: the increase in inactivity, even when weighted to reflect the lower


-----

transition rate into employment, had offset the decline in unemployment. All durations of unemployment

had contributed to lower weighted non-employment.

A32 Annual manufacturing productivity growth had increased by 1.0 percentage points in December.

The Institute of Management Services (IMS) index had risen in January. The low outturn for GDP growth

in 2000 Q4 had depressed the Bank's LFS-based first estimate of annual whole-economy productivity

growth; and the gap between the heads and hours measures had narrowed as a result of an increase in

average hours worked.

A33 Whole-economy headline earnings growth, as measured by the Average Earnings Index (AEI), had

risen by 0.2 percentage points in December. Headline growth in the private and public sectors had risen

by 0.1 percentage points and 0.4 percentage points, respectively. The sharpest increase in annual earnings

growth had been in private sector services, where it had increased by 0.6 percentage points to 5.1%.

Bonuses had made a positive contribution to earnings growth (not seasonally adjusted) for the first time

since April 2000, with both the public sector and financial services sector bonus contributions substantially

higher in December than in previous months. Regular pay growth (not seasonally adjusted) had continued

to edge upwards in both manufacturing and the public sector. Growth in regular pay in private sector

services had been more than 5% throughout the fourth quarter.

A34 There had been no evidence of any marked increase in settlement levels compared with the previous

year. The Bank’s twelve-month AEI-weighted means for the whole economy and the public sector had

been unchanged in January. The private sector mean had risen by 0.1 percentage points. New data, on

September deals, had resulted in upward revisions to the previous autumn’s three-month mean. There had

been an average increase of 0.33 percentage points in the 70 deals taking effect in January which could be

matched with those firms’ settlements in 2000. Excluding 15 multi-year deals, the matched increase had

been 0.26 percentage points.

A35 Manufacturing unit wage costs had fallen again. Overall annual earnings growth had been higher and

LFS-based productivity growth lower in Q4. Annual growth in unit wage costs had risen to 2.9%, on the

Bank's first estimate.

**V** **Prices**

A36 The Bank’s oil-inclusive commodity price index had fallen by 0.2% in January, but due to base

effects the annual inflation rate had risen slightly to 6.7% in January from 6.5% in December. The monthly

fall had mainly reflected falls in the prices of fuels. The fuels component of the index had fallen by 1.2% in

January, which had been largely accounted for by the fall of around 1.3% in the monthly average sterling oil

price. The oil price had strengthened by around 9% in February. The Bank’s oil-exclusive commodity

price index had risen by 0.3% in January, which had taken its annual inflation rate to 4.6% in January from

4.0% in December.

A37 Manufacturing input prices had risen by 0.5% in January, which had taken the annual inflation rate to

6.3% in January, from 5% in December. After rising sharply to 58.0 in January, the CIPS input price index

had fallen back to 55.8 in February. Output prices excluding excise duties (PPIY) had fallen by 0.2% in

January, and the annual inflation rate had eased to 1.2% in January from 1.5% in December. Looking

forward, the CBI manufacturing survey expected output price balance had fallen back sharply, to -14 in

February from +4 in January.

A38 The GDP deflator at market prices had risen by 0.3% in 2000 Q4. Its annual inflation rate in 2000

Q4 had fallen to 1.2%, after being revised up to 1.8% (from 1.6%) in 2000 Q3. The GDP deflator had

been revised up in the first three quarters of 2000, leaving it 0.2% higher in 2000 Q3 than it had previously

been. The annual inflation rate of the household consumption deflator had fallen slightly to 0.8% in 2000

Q4, after being revised up to 0.9% (from 0.6%) in 2000 Q3. Revisions had raised the level of the

household consumption deflator in 2000 Q3 by 0.3%. The annual inflation rate of the government

expenditure deflator in Q3 had risen to 3.1% in 2000 Q4 from an upwardly-revised 2.5% in 2000 Q3.

The quarterly change in the import price deflator in 2000 Q3 had been revised up to 0.6% from 0.1%.

The import price deflator had risen by 1.2% in 2000 Q4, the largest quarterly rise since 1995 Q3.

A39 RPIX inflation had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 1.8% in January. Both goods and services

price inflation had eased in January: annual goods price inflation had fallen to 0.3% from 0.5%, while

annual services price inflation had fallen to 2.9% from 3.2%. RPI inflation had fallen to 2.7% from 2.9%.


-----

RPIY inflation had also fallen, to 1.5% from 1.7%, while HICP inflation had been unchanged at 0.9%.

Consequently, the gap between RPIX and HICP inflation had narrowed to 0.9 percentage points.

**VI** **Reports by the Bank’s Agents**

A40 Manufacturing contacts had continued to report a further slight strengthening in overall demand from

export markets. There had been more widespread evidence of a slowing in orders as a result of the

downturn in the US economy (notably for automotive and high-technology goods), but any impact had

remained relatively small. Moreover, most manufacturing contacts had suggested that any slowdown in

demand from the United States had been offset by improved conditions in other markets. In contrast,

growth in demand from domestic firms had slowed somewhat in some regions.

A41 Contacts had continued to suggest little recovery in construction output, following the weather
affected downturn reported in earlier months. However, on balance, most Agencies had continued to

suggest that underlying confidence and expectations regarding future construction activity remained robust,

although there had been some suggestions of a slightly softer outlook for residential activity in some regions.

A42 The Agents had stressed that the agricultural sector had not yet recovered from the earlier wet

weather. In particular, contacts had suggested that the supply of domestically-produced potatoes and

cereals would be adversely affected for some time. Moreover, the output of the sector was likely to be

further depressed by the recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease.

A43 Although conditions in the labour market had remained tight, Agencies in London and the Midlands

had noted early signs of an easing in shortages in some sectors (notably financial services).

A44 Materials costs inflation had continued to ease recently, though there had been more reports of

concerns regarding administrative and regulatory costs. In most cases, manufacturing output prices were

now broadly flat, although there had been more reports of price increases being achieved by some firms.


-----

A45 The Agents had conducted a survey of around 170 UK firms regarding expectations of movements

of their prices for 2001. The results had shown that a net balance of 14% of firms surveyed expected to

increase their prices this year by more than last year (or reduce their prices by less than last year). While

price rise expectations had been most common in non-retail services, the magnitude of increases had been

expected to be broadly similar to last year. In contrast, while the survey had indicated that retail goods

prices remained broadly flat overall, upward inflationary pressures were strongest in this sector. There had

been a more mixed picture in manufacturing. Costs of labour, fuel and materials, and regulation had been

the most frequently cited factors causing firms to expect to raise prices by more than last year. In contrast,

those firms which had reported a slower pace of expected inflation this year had suggested that competitive

pressures and productivity had been the main causes.

**VII** **Market intelligence**

A46 Expectations of short-term interest rates implied by short sterling futures contracts had risen slightly

at very short maturities, and had fallen by up to 10 basis points for contracts maturing in late 2001 and

2002. The moderate rise in interest rate expectations had followed the release of average earnings data

and the publication of the Inflation Report on 14 February, and publication of the CBI Distributive Trades

survey in early March. The fall in interest rate expectations at longer maturities had mainly reflected falls in

market interest rates abroad, in particular in the United States. The implied volatility of short sterling futures

had remained low in comparison with levels in 1999 and 2000, and relative to comparable United States

and euro-area interest rate contracts. A majority of market participants did not expect a reduction in the

Bank’s repo rate this month: in the most recent survey of private sector economists conducted by Reuters

in early March, the mean probability attached to a cut in the Bank’s repo rate in March had been around

one third.

A47 The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) had appreciated slightly since the Committee’s

previous meeting. The stability of the ERI so far in 2001 was in contrast to its sharp fall in the fourth

quarter of 2000. Over the same period, the euro had weakened slightly against the dollar. Some

commentators had suggested that this was surprising, given generally stronger-than-expected euro-area

data, greater falls in short-term market interest rates in the United States than in the euro area and the falls


-----

in US equity market indices, which were consistent with concerns about US economic weakness.

However, although the Standard and Poor’s 500 index had fallen in absolute terms, it was if anything higher

relative to the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 index. Another possible explanation of the euro’s depreciation

against the dollar had been that surveys of market positioning had suggested that some participants had

sought to reduce the holdings of euros in their portfolios. There had been indications that pending capital

outflows from the euro area to the United States, which were related to mergers and acquisitions, had

slowed.
