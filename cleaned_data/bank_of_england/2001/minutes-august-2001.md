**MINUTES OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON**
**1-2 AUGUST 2001**

1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, and against the background of its latest

projections for output and inflation, the Committee discussed the world economy; demand and output;

money, credit and asset prices; the labour market; prices and costs; and some possible tactical

considerations.

**The world economy**

2 The outlook for the world economy had deteriorated since the Committee’s May Inflation Report

projections. World industrial production had been falling, and the slowdown was clearly set to be

more prolonged than in 1998-99. In the most recent month, there had been more news about

continental Europe than about Japan or the US.

3 Nevertheless, the forward-looking prospect depended heavily on the US. Perhaps reflecting very

strong growth in investment over recent years, capacity utilisation was now low and corporate

profitability weak. Some parts of the corporate sector were under financial pressure. Investment had

already fallen and seemed set to remain weak. Meanwhile, the household sector had so far been more

resilient than many commentators had expected, with consumption growth remaining robust. GDP

was estimated to have grown by 0.2% in Q2, down from 0.3% in Q1. There had also been material

revisions to data for earlier periods, particularly 2000. GDP growth in 2000 had been revised down

significantly, as had consumption growth, investment in the information and communications

technology (ICT) sector, and corporate profits. In consequence, it now seemed that past productivity

growth – especially for 2000 – was likely to be revised down somewhat. Household income had,

however, been revised up, so the household saving ratio was now estimated to be higher than

previously thought; it was now positive rather than negative and while it had declined steadily in the

late 1990s, it was now estimated to have stabilised early last year.

4 Against that background, the Committee discussed various risks to the US outlook. On the one

hand, downside risks arose from the imbalances in the economy and potentially stretched corporate

and household sector balance sheets, reflecting substantial debt accumulation in recent years. It was

possible that the evident pressures on the corporate sector would, via rising unemployment and

reduced real income growth feed through to the household sector and so to consumption growth in


-----

National Association of Purchasing Managers index) did not suggest an imminent recovery in the

corporate sector, which therefore carried the associated risk of a spillover into weaker consumption,

and yet Consensus forecasts assumed that consumption growth would rise. Although down around

10% since the beginning of the year, on some assumptions equity market valuations remained

elevated, and were GDP growth to be more sluggish than implied by the consensus, there would be a

risk of further falls in equity prices. Also, estimates of trend productivity might be revised down in the

light of the revised GDP data, to a greater or lesser extent depending on how much weight had been

given to the earlier, unrevised data for 2000; some commentators were already doing so. If

productivity growth were lower, the corporate sector might also be weaker than expected.

5 On the other hand, there were some upside risks. Taken together, the easing of monetary policy

and of fiscal policy was large by historical standards and might provide more stimulus than was

reflected in the central projections. In addition, the recent data revisions might imply less need for

households to increase their saving in order to rebuild balance sheets, so consumption might be

stronger than expected.

6 Overall, while the outlook was still highly uncertain, US prospects were judged by most members

to remain broadly in line with the assumptions made by the Committee in its May projections, with the

risks still skewed to the downside; other members preferred a lower central projection for US growth.

7 The outlook in Japan was weak. It seemed to be heading for recession; and the difficult

conjunctural and structural policy issues remained. There had not been much news over the past

month.

8 By contrast, there had been quite a lot of news about the euro area, where the outlook was now

weaker than previously assumed. There were distinct, but interacting, domestic and external

influences at work. In part, the slowdown in domestic demand in recent months might have reflected a

supply shock. In particular, spikes in energy prices and food prices, combined with the fall in the

euro’s exchange rate earlier in the year, had taken consumer price inflation higher than had been

expected. That might have reduced growth in real personal disposable incomes and so weakened

consumption. The effect of the shock on domestic demand should in principle be temporary, although

it might persist for a while, for example if the consequent slowdown in GDP growth prompted the

corporate sector to lay off workers While investment intentions had been stable in recent months


-----

business and consumer confidence had fallen further. As well as the domestic influences, weaker

confidence might reflect the impact on euro area multinational companies of the world economic

slowdown, as well as the effect on the business sector generally of the global fall in demand for ICT.

While ICT industries represented a materially smaller share of output in the euro area than in the US,

their contribution to GDP growth had risen over the past few years. There were other contrasts with

the US. On the one hand, imbalances were less pronounced and, in particular, corporate and

household sector balance sheets were less obviously vulnerable. On the other hand, there was perhaps

less prospect of a pronounced policy easing given the euro area’s fiscal guidelines and inflation having

been above the zone defined by the European Central Bank (ECB) as consistent with price stability.

Overall, while the euro area was less vulnerable to a sharp deterioration than the US, growth could

remain sluggish for some time, although some of the factors slowing growth were temporary. This

was reflected in a downward adjustment to the Committee’s latest projections compared with May.

9 The considerable uncertainties about US and euro area growth prospects were associated with

similar uncertainties about exchange rates. Some members of the Committee placed little weight on

the possibility of the euro recovering against the dollar in the near term, given the deterioration in the

euro area outlook and continuing market uncertainties about ECB policy. Others thought it possible

that a reappraisal of US prospects could affect exchange rates, even if there were no change to the euro

area outlook.

**Demand and output**

10 GDP growth had eased to 0.3% in Q2 from 0.5% in Q1. Excluding utilities, mining and quarrying,

and agriculture – typically, the more volatile components of GDP – output had been up only about

0.1% on the quarter. It was noted that this was the third successive quarter in which growth had been

below trend; and that survey-based measures suggested that growth in Q3 might be below trend too.

Some members noted, however, that in recent quarters growth had been temporarily depressed by

adverse weather, travel disruptions and foot-and-mouth disease.

11 The Committee discussed the possible implications for policy of the imbalances in the UK

economy against the background of divergent pictures of household consumption and corporate

spending.


-----

12 The Committee had for some time been expecting a slowdown in consumption growth that had so

far failed to materialise. There had been – and continued to be – good reasons to expect deceleration.

Given weaker equity prices, there had been a fall in household financial wealth; and the growth of

both employment and real incomes was expected to slow. But it remained unclear how quickly

consumption growth would weaken. While the National Accounts data for Q1 had recorded

softer-than-expected consumption growth, those data sat uneasily with strong growth in retail sales and

private vehicle registrations in Q1 and Q2, and with the narrow and Divisia monetary data.

Forward-looking indicators were also strong. Household borrowing and house prices were both rising

at an annual rate of about 10%. The July CBI Distributive Sales survey had pointed to continuing

robust retail sales. The GfK measure of consumer confidence remained above its average levels and

had softened only slightly in the latest month, although the MORI index was weaker.

13 By contrast, investment spending had weakened. Business investment was estimated to have

fallen sharply, by roughly 5%, in Q1; and while this would to some extent reflect quarter-to-quarter

volatility, taking Q4 and Q1 together showed a distinct softening since earlier last year. Looking

ahead, both surveys and reports from the Bank’s regional Agents pointed to a somewhat weaker

outlook.

14 These contrasting pictures were mirrored in divergent output data for sectors relatively exposed to

the external environment and for those which were relatively sheltered. For 2001 H1, the annualised

rates of growth in services, construction and manufacturing were estimated to be 3%, 5% and minus

3% respectively.

15 Manufacturing – much, but not all, of which was internationally tradeable – was overall in

recession. The pressure on the sector was not just an ICT story. While there had been particularly

pronounced falls in the previously strong electrical and optical equipment sector, growth in the

remainder of manufacturing had been flat for a number of years and reflected structural change rather

than cyclical weakness together with the high exchange rate. Survey indicators all pointed to

continuing weakness in the sector as a whole, although some had improved slightly in the latest month

and the picture was not uniform across the sector.

16 Taken as a whole, services sector growth and profitability had so far remained far stronger than

manufacturing The first estimate of 2001 Q2 service sector output growth had though been 0 6%


-----

account of the effects of the foot-and-mouth epidemic on services such as tourism, hotels and catering.

But the slowdown might be greater than such temporary factors could account for. The CIPS services

survey had fallen in July; at 50.3, the balance of respondents reporting growth in business activity was

at its lowest level since February 1999. It was, therefore, possible that, in addition to temporary

domestic factors, some parts of the business services sector were now being adversely affected by the

global slowdown and by the pressures on domestic manufacturing.

17 The factors behind this contrasting picture were reasonably clear. The externally exposed parts of

the economy were under pressure from the weakening external environment and the persistent strength

of sterling’s exchange rate, which was 1% higher than had been projected in May on account of the

euro’s further depreciation. In order to offset to some degree the prospective negative contribution to

output growth from net trade, the Committee had eased monetary policy by a cumulative 75 basis

points during the first half of the year, buttressing consumption growth. Since then, the external

outlook had deteriorated further, as had business investment in the United Kingdom. There were also

signs of excess stock holdings.

18 In the face of weakening external demand, the Committee had reduced interest rates in order to

maintain aggregate demand in line with the economy’s supply capacity, despite the increasing

imbalances in the economy. The Committee debated whether or not there were risks to the policy of

continuing to stimulate domestic demand to offset a weaker-than-expected world economy. Several

points were noted. First, if consumption were to be stimulated by successive further policy easings, it

might build up momentum which could prove difficult to arrest when the world economy eventually

recovered, requiring a sharper-than-usual policy tightening in due course. Against that, however, it

was noted that if buoyant consumption were accompanied by a substantial further accumulation of

debt in the household sector, its exposure to interest rate changes would be greater, so that a

smaller-than-usual tightening might be needed to slow consumption. Any risk of debt deflation would,

on this view, work in the direction of dampening household spending. Also, not reducing interest rates

in the face of a weakening global economy could hurt investment and thereby depress the UK

economy’s future productive capacity. Second, it was possible that a persistent current account deficit

and the consequent accumulation of external debt could lead to sterling’s exchange rate depreciating

materially. That might also be prompted if persistent weakness in the US economy were eventually to

lead to a fall in the dollar against the euro. If that happened, there could be strong upward pressures on

UK inflation Against that it was noted that an abrupt sterling depreciation would cause a one off rise


-----

effect of a depreciation would be to support net trade, which would be helpful given the assumed

scenario of persistent world economic weakness. On that view, depending on the relative size of

exchange rate depreciation and global economic weakness, interest rates might even have to be

reduced. It was also suggested, however, that the path of the exchange rate might be volatile, but with

a gradual and cumulatively substantial depreciation. That might present a greater challenge to policy,

as it would be less easy to judge at any particular point the extent of the eventual one-off effect on the

price level which should be accommodated.

19 The Committee noted that a persistently weak external environment was only one possible

scenario, the probability of which was very difficult to judge. Moreover, while the imbalances in the

UK economy were uncomfortable, there remained good reasons to expect consumption to weaken as

output and income growth slowed, but with uncertainty about how soon it would do so. Some

members were, in consequence, more concerned about the immediate and more tangible pressures on

the corporate sector.

**Money, credit and asset prices**

20 The disparity between conditions in the household sector and the corporate sector was apparent in

the money and credit data. Annual growth in non-financial corporate sector money holdings had fallen

from around 10% last autumn to 6% or less in the most recent months. Bank lending had decelerated

too, but there was a marked divergence between the manufacturing and service sectors. In the year to

Q2, the manufacturing sector had made net repayments of bank debt, whereas services sector

borrowing from banks had risen over 16%.

21 For households, the growth rate of both money and borrowing had increased. Household M4 had

risen by nearly 9% in the year to June, the strongest rate since September 1991. Divisia money growth

was about 9½%, the strongest since 1990 Q3. Total borrowing continued to grow at around 10%.

22 The annual rate of increase in house prices was around 10% on both the Halifax and Nationwide

measures. Mortgage loan approvals were well up on a year ago; and particulars delivered, while still

slightly lower than a year ago, had risen sharply in June. The FTSE All Share equity index was just

over 1% lower than at the time of the Committee’s July meeting, but well below the level projected in

May


-----

23 Sterling’s exchange rate index was about 1% lower on the month, having fallen against the euro

and risen against the dollar.

**The labour market**

24 In the three months to May, employment had risen by about 90,000, and at a faster rate than the

population of working age. Unemployment had fallen to 4.9% on the Labour Force Survey measure.

Inactivity had again increased. Settlements had continued to edge up slightly, to 3.4%. The headline

measure of earnings growth was 4.5%, easing back from around 5% earlier in the year, which had

reflected unusually high bonus payments.

25 Taken together with a continuing high number of vacancies, these data suggested that the labour

market remained tight. Given the persistent tightness of labour market conditions over the past year or

so, it remained surprising that pay and earnings had not risen more. More recently, as pressure on the

tradeables sector had intensified, it had been a puzzle that the employment rate had continued to rise.

There was anecdotal evidence that, over the past year or so, companies with unsatisfied demand for

labour had not bid up wages to recruit, on the grounds that product market conditions would not have

allowed them to pass increased costs into prices, but that they were now picking up workers shed by

firms in difficulty. It was conceivable that that explained why the pressure on the externally exposed

sectors had not yet led to falling employment or rising unemployment. If so, there might be an

unsatisfied latent demand for labour which was not showing up in the quantity or price data. It was

also possible that firms might be holding on to under-utilised labour if they believed that the slowdown

would be temporary and wished to avoid the costs of first laying off labour but subsequently having to

re-recruit staff with the desired skills.

26 There was, though, some evidence suggesting some easing of labour market conditions.

Survey-based measures of recruitment intentions had fallen, and reports of skill shortages had eased

somewhat.

**Prices and costs**

27 After a sharp rise in May, RPIX inflation had remained at 2.4% in June. Short-term factors –

changes in food prices utility prices tax duty changes were likely to make the path of RPIX volatile


-----

28 Further back in the ‘pipeline’, commodity prices had decelerated. The rate of increase of producer

input prices had fallen. Producer output price inflation had also edged down, but was broadly

unchanged if the effects of falling tax duties were excluded. Forward-looking surveys suggested weak

price pressures. But the magnitude of the impact on RPIX was unclear, as the relationship between

producer output prices and retail prices had been less close since the mid-1990s. In the current

conjuncture, an important influence on retail prices would be the strength of consumption. According

to surveys, retailers were expecting buoyant sales, so it was possible that there would be some cyclical

rise in their margins in the near term, but the projected weakening of consumption built in to the

forecast might reasonably be expected to be associated eventually with some moderation of the price

pressures from this source.

**The August GDP growth and inflation projections**

29 The Committee reached its policy decision in the light of the projections to be published in the

_Inflation Report on Wednesday 8 August._

30 On the assumption of an official repo rate of 5.25% over the next two years, the central projection

would have been for RPIX inflation to be below the 2½% target throughout the forecast period.

31 On the alternative assumption of an official repo rate of 5.0% over the next two years, the central

projection was for GDP growth to be a little below trend – slightly weaker than in May. The central

projection for RPIX inflation edged downwards to around 2% over the next half year or so, before

rising back towards the target towards the end of the two-year forecast period. The path was likely to

be volatile given the range of special factors which would affect the twelve-month measure.

32 Some members preferred different assumptions for the central projection for inflation. Some

thought that it could be a little higher. Others thought that it could be up to ½ percentage point lower,

reflecting views that the world economy would be weaker, that the world slowdown would have a

greater effect on UK inflation, and that there was more spare capacity in the economy than assumed in

the published fan chart central projections; these more substantial differences were reflected in the

calibrations recorded in Table 6.B of the Inflation Report.


-----

33 On the best collective judgment of the Committee, the balance of risks to growth was on the

downside throughout the forecast period, reflecting in particular the possibilities of a weaker world

economic outlook and of a sharper slowdown in private sector final demand in the United Kingdom;

and for RPIX inflation, it was slightly on the downside in the second year of the projections. There

was, though, a range of views on the balance of risks, with some members placing greater weight on

the probability of a significant depreciation in sterling’s exchange rate.

**Possible tactical considerations**

34 The Committee noted that there was a clear expectation, amongst commentators and in financial

markets, that the repo rate would be maintained at 5.25% this month, although some expectation had

developed in the days leading up to the meeting of further easing in the next few months. An

immediate change would, therefore, come as a substantial surprise. It was difficult to know how a cut

might affect financial markets, but it would be unwelcome if sterling rose or if longer-term interest

rates increased.

**The immediate policy decision**

35 For most members, the outlook for inflation, and the balance of risks, were broadly as published in

the Inflation Report fan charts. Given the weaker external environment, and sterling’s further

appreciation against the euro since the May _Report, net trade was set to continue to be a drag on output_

growth. Faced with softening external demand, widespread weakness in ICT-related sectors,

heightened uncertainty about the global outlook, and pressure on the profitability and financial position

of parts of the corporate sector, UK business investment spending was likely to be subdued for a while.

The outlook for household consumption was less clear. On the one hand, it was likely to be restrained

by past falls in equity prices, and by prospective lower labour income growth as the economy slowed.

On the other hand, growth in retail sales and in household sector money and borrowing all remained

robust, consumer confidence was firm, and the housing market was strong. For these members, the

imbalances in the economy presented a dilemma for policy and the immediate choice was finely

balanced between maintaining the Bank’s repo rate at 5.25% and a reduction of 25 basis points.

36 Various arguments – given different weights by different members – were advanced for

maintaining rates at 5 25% First against the Committee’s previous expectations there were still few


-----

on the corporate sector had yet to feed through to employment and unemployment, which if and when

it happened would dampen household confidence and spending. Given that an immediate repo rate cut

would not do much to alleviate the pressures on the corporate sector from abroad, there was advantage

in waiting a month or two to see whether labour market conditions were easing and consumption was

indeed starting to slow. Second, an immediate cut would exacerbate the imbalances in the economy,

by further stimulating consumption in circumstances where the housing market was already buoyant

and household confidence was robust. A cut in mortgage rates would tend to fuel this. There was,

therefore, a risk of increasing the size of the adjustment that would ultimately be necessary, possibly

leading to larger deviations of inflation from the target and undesirable volatility in output. Third and

associated with the imbalances, there was a perceptible risk that sterling could fall, triggered for

example by deteriorating world conditions, by a reappraisal of the sustainability of persistent trade

deficits or by domestic adjustment as UK households tried to strengthen their balance sheets. The

timing of any such fall was, of course, highly uncertain. But it would tend to increase inflation. As

well as any one-off effect on the price level and the consequences for net trade, a depreciation might

well also – given current conditions in the labour market – put upward pressure on nominal earnings as

the consequent rise in the sterling price of imports would reduce the purchasing power of households’

real incomes. Fourth, the full impact of the earlier easing of monetary policy was still to come

through, and the planned rapid rise in government spending was now well underway. Both would help

to underpin domestic demand over the next year or so, and so a further boost from another repo rate

cut was not necessary now. Fifth, although the prospects for the world economy had weakened, the

course of events in the US economy, which was the most important influence on global activity, was

not inconsistent with some recovery in growth towards the end of the year and into the early part of

2002. Sixth, the data on the month did not make a sufficient case for surprising financial markets.

There was a risk that financial markets would overreact to a surprise cut, with a generalised fall in

money market rates and so a greater-than-planned easing in monetary conditions. It might also

conceivably lead, perversely, to a strengthening of the exchange rate if the markets concluded that the

Committee was more committed to sustaining output growth than previously thought, particularly

given market uncertainties about the policies of other central banks. Seventh, if rates were maintained

at 5.25%, the central projection for inflation in the Inflation Report would be below the 2½% target for

the forecast period, which would imply the likelihood of an interest rate reduction later in the year.

That would itself probably lead to lower short-term money market rates and so to easier monetary

conditions, without the Committee so actively bolstering consumption.


-----

37 Various arguments – again given different weights by different members – were advanced for an

immediate reduction of 25 basis points. First, the central projection for inflation, based on an

assumption of unchanged interest rates of 5.25%, was below target for the whole of the two-year

forecast period. That being so, and since there was not much prospect of significant news about

consumption or the labour market in the next month or two, there was little advantage to waiting

before easing policy. Second, the risks to output – and, in the view of most members, to inflation –

were on the downside, given the direct and indirect effects on net trade of the inhospitable

international environment, which recent surveys suggested might now be spreading to the services

sector. That would put further downward pressures on inflation. An immediate reduction in the repo

rate would, therefore, provide a degree of insurance against a further deterioration in the outlook.

Third, the pressures on the corporate sector represented a greater risk to the outlook than the

apparently buoyant conditions in the household sector. In both manufacturing and services, some

firms were capable of switching production from external to domestic markets. But domestic demand

needed to be sustained to support these sectors. Otherwise, output growth might be weaker than in the

central projection, with inflation undershooting the target. Fourth, while some of the indicators of

consumption currently remained strong, the most likely outlook remained for consumption growth to

slow. Given weak net trade and investment, it was therefore appropriate to provide some further

support for consumption by cutting interest rates, in order to maintain aggregate demand in line with

the economy’s supply capacity. Fifth, even if consumption did not slow, the risks to household sector

balance sheets would not be material in the near term. While household debt had risen relative to

income over the past few years, neither income gearing nor debt relative to household wealth appeared

exceptional by historical standards. While the housing market was strong, it was nowhere near as

strong as in the boom conditions of the mid-1970s or the late-1980s. The possibility of consumption

growth not falling back soon would not, therefore, create unacceptable risks. Sixth, if – against

expectations – domestic demand were to remain strong or the international economy were to recover

more quickly than anticipated, policy could be re-tightened. That would be easier to justify after the

event than not easing now but having to do so later in the face of weakening in demand and output

accompanied by an undershoot of the inflation target. Seventh, if sterling were to fall on account of

accumulating economic imbalances, policy would probably be easier rather than harder to operate in

the medium-term, so concerns about the imbalances on that score should not stand in the way of a

further cut in interest rates now.

38 For some other members in addition to the reasons set out the previous paragraph the news on the


-----

question of whether an interest rate cut of more than 25 basis points was merited. In the US, the

National Association of Purchasing Managers survey – especially for new orders – had fallen back;

and the revised GDP data implied somewhat weaker trend growth. In continental Europe, the

deterioration in confidence and in indicators of new orders was worrying. Japan and several other

Asian countries were being badly hit by the global ICT sector problems. Emerging market bond yield

spreads had widened and global equity prices were lower. The international outlook was therefore

gloomy. Domestically, the CIPS services survey had been surprisingly weak. It seemed that services

sector output might be even weaker in Q3 than in Q2. Weakness in the corporate sector was likely to

feed through to the household sector. The outlook for inflation was materially weaker than presented

in the published fan chart. As reflected in Table 6.B of the Inflation Report, different preferred

assumptions could reduce the central projection for inflation two years ahead by about 0.5 percentage

points, to a little below 2%. The balance of risks was also on the downside. That being so, the

immediate policy choice was between a cut of 25 or of 50 basis points. Pre-emption pointed towards a

50 basis point cut immediately. It was unlikely that sterling would perversely strengthen if interest

rates were cut. However, a large cut would be especially surprising and would entail an unnecessary

risk of further stimulating the housing market. In any case, at a time of increased uncertainty, a

gradualist strategy might be preferable. On balance, the better immediate course was a 25 basis point

cut.

39 The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate should be

reduced by 25 basis points to 5.0%. Six members of the Committee (the Governor,

Christopher Allsopp, Kate Barker, Charles Bean, Stephen Nickell and Sushil Wadhwani) voted for the

proposition. Mervyn King, David Clementi and Ian Plenderleith voted against, preferring to maintain

the repo rate at 5.25%.

**ANNEX: SUMMARY OF DATA PRESENTED BY BANK STAFF**

A1 This annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy

Committee on 27 July in advance of its meeting on 1-2 August 2001. At the start of the Committee

meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become available,

and that information is included in this Annex.

**I** **The international environment**

A2 According to the Bank’s latest estimate, world GDP growth had slowed to 2.1% in the year

to 2001 Q1, from 3.4% in 2000. World industrial production had fallen by 1.3% in the year to May

from unchanged in the year to April.

A3 The price of Brent crude oil had stabilised at around $25 per barrel, after a fall early in the

month, slightly below its level at the time of the Committee’s previous meeting. The price had

fallen early in the month, but had risen again following the announcement by OPEC members of a

cut in supply in view of lower world demand. The Economist industrial commodity index had fallen

by 3.0% on the month, but the Economist food index had risen by 4.0%.

A4 In the euro area, orders for German manufactured goods had risen by 4.4% in May, the first

monthly rise since the beginning of the year. German industrial production had continued to follow

the downward trend of 2001 Q1, although the fall in construction sector output had been smaller

than in previous months. The West German IFO business confidence indicator had fallen further in

June, to 89.5 from 90.8 in May, reaching a seven-year low. Results of a European Commission

survey of expectations of investment growth conducted in spring 2001 had shown no change in

investment intentions for this year since autumn 2000 with an expectation of investment growth for

2001 of 3%. After falls in April and May, French consumption of manufactured goods had risen in

June by 1.5%.

A5 Euro-area producer price inflation had fallen to 3.6% in the year to May.  German producer

price inflation had fallen further, to 4.3% in the year to June. Annual HICP inflation had fallen to

3% in June, mainly accounted for by a fall in energy prices. Preliminary German data had suggested

a further fall in July. Annual euro-area unadjusted M3 growth had increased to 6.1% in June.


-----

A6 Headline US GDP growth had slowed to 0.2% in 2000 Q2, from 0.3% in Q1. Consumption

growth had remained strong, though easing to 0.5% in Q2 from 0.7% in Q1, while private

investment had fallen 2.2% in Q2 after a rise of 0.5% in Q1 – the first quarterly fall in six years.

The contributions from both stocks and net trade were zero, with destocking in Q2 continuing at the

same rate as in Q1 and both exports and imports falling in Q2. Substantial revisions to back data

had lowered GDP growth in 2000 by 0.8 percentage points, to 4.2%. Corporate profits had also

been revised down, but household income had been revised up, increasing the household saving rate.

A7 Manufacturing output in the United States had fallen by 0.8% between May and June, which

had brought the cumulative fall since last September to 5%. Production of information and

communications technology (ICT) goods had fallen for the sixth consecutive month. The National

Association of Purchasing Managers’ (NAPM) index had fallen to 43.6 in July from 44.7 in June,

reflecting falls in the new orders and inventories components. Retail sales in the United States had

risen by 0.2% in June, bringing the growth rate in 2001 Q2 to 1.5%. The Conference Board measure

of consumer confidence had fallen to 116.5 in July from 118.9 in June, mainly due to a downward

revision to the ‘present situation’ component.  Non-farm payrolls had fallen by 14,000 in June

following an increase of 8,000 in May. This reflected a further fall in manufacturing employment:

service sector employment had remained little changed.

A8 Headline producer price inflation in the United States had fallen to 2.5% in June from 3.7%

in May, mainly because of a sharp drop in energy prices. Core producer price index (PPI) inflation

had remained unchanged at 1.6%. Weaker energy prices had also contributed to a decline in

headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation to 3.2% in June, from 3.6% in May. Employment

cost growth had slowed in Q2, mainly due to lower benefit costs.

A9 US imports had declined in May, mainly because of a fall in capital goods imports; the

sharpest decline had been registered in imports from Asia, although imports from the United

Kingdom and, to a lesser extent, the euro area, had also fallen.

A10 Exports from Japan and a number of other East Asian economies had continued to fall, as

had industrial production. Japanese inventories had picked up, and had risen by 6% in the year to

May.

A11 There had been little evidence of contagion from Argentina and Turkey to the spreads on

**II** **Monetary and financial conditions**

A12 The twelve-month growth rate of notes and coin had risen slightly, to 7.4% in July, and the

three-month annualised growth rate had risen to 5.3%.

A13 The twelve-month growth rate of M4 had also risen slightly, to 7.6% in June. The twelve
month growth rate of M4 excluding other financial corporations (OFCs) had risen to 8.3% in June,

the highest growth rate since August 1997. The twelve-month growth rate of M4 lending (excluding

the effects of securitisations) including and excluding OFCs had risen to 11.4% and 9.8%

respectively.

A14 The twelve-month growth rate of households’ M4 had continued to rise in June, to 8.8% - its

highest level since September 1991. Household M4 lending (excluding the effects of

securitisations) had remained strong, at 9.7%. Within total lending to individuals, the annual growth

rate of secured lending had remained strong in June, at 8.5%, and the growth rate of unsecured

borrowing had risen slightly, to 11.9%. Total household sector M4 debt had increased to 92% of

total household income in 2001 Q1. Within this total, consumer credit as a percentage of total

disposable income had risen to 15% in 2001 Q1. The number of loan approvals for house purchases

had fallen slightly, to 106,000 in June, but the three-month on three-month growth rate of loan

approvals had remained consistent with a strong outlook for housing market activity.

A15 The twelve-month growth rate of private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs’) M4 had risen

to 6.0% in June. This had partly reflected temporary factors, and the underlying trend in the growth

rate was likely still to be downward. The twelve-month growth rate of PNFCs’ M4 lending

(excluding the effects of securitisations) had risen to 10% in June. Total external corporate finance

(in terms of average monthly flows) had risen to around £6.5 billion in 2001 Q2.

A16 The twelve-month growth rate of OFCs’ M4 had fallen to 5.6% in June. The twelve-month

growth rate of OFCs’ M4 lending (excluding the effects of securitisations) had risen to 16.9%.

A17 Short-term nominal forward rates had fallen since the Committee’s July meeting: by 23

basis points for the December 2001 short sterling contract and by 20 - 35 basis points for 2002

contracts. Long-term forward rates had also fallen since that meeting. Real interest rates had fallen


-----

expectations derived from conventional and index-linked gilt yields had fallen for all maturities,

partly reversing a rise in June.

A18 Survey-based measures of the inflation expectations of professional economists had risen in

July. Given that the surveys had been carried out at around the time of the Committee’s July

meeting, they had reflected the higher-than-expected May RPI data published in June and had been

consistent with the increase observed during June in inflation expectations derived from

conventional and index-linked gilt yields.

A19 The quoted average standard variable mortgage rate had remained virtually unchanged at

6.42% in July. The two-year discounted variable mortgage rate had increased by 15 basis points

while the two-year fixed mortgage rate (without lock-in) had increased by 27 basis points in July.

Interest rates on savings had remained virtually unchanged, while unsecured loan rates had fallen by

42 basis points.

A20 UK corporate spreads over gilts had remained virtually unchanged since the Committee’s

previous meeting. Issuance of non-gilt sterling bonds so far in July had been at levels similar to

those observed in June.

A21 The FTSE All-Share and FTSE 100 indices had fallen by 1.2% and 1.0% respectively since

the Committee’s July meeting. The FTSE Small Cap and the FTSE 250 indices had fallen by 5.5%

and 2.0% respectively over the same period. Information technology (IT) had been the weakest

sector. The number of profit warnings over the previous three months had remained higher than in

the same three-month period of the previous year.

A22 Since the July meeting, the sterling exchange rate index (ERI) had fallen by 1.0%. This

depreciation of the ERI had reflected a 2.0% depreciation of sterling against the euro and an

appreciation of sterling of 1.8% against the US dollar and 1.9% against the Japanese yen.

**III** **Demand and output**

A23 The preliminary estimate of GDP growth in 2001 Q2 had shown growth slowing to 0.3%,

from 0.5% in Q1. Service sector growth had been 0.6% in Q2, down from 0.9% in Q1. Within

services, the distribution, hotels and catering sector had grown by 0.9% in Q2.


-----

A24 Retail sales volumes had been flat in June, but had grown by 1.6% in Q2 as a whole. Annual

growth of retail sales had risen to 6.1% in Q2, its highest rate since 1988. Private vehicle

registrations had been 18% higher in Q2 than a year earlier. In July, the retail sales balance in the

CBI survey of Distributive Trades had increased to +44 from +30 in June. Consumer confidence

had weakened on the GfK index to +4.9 in July from +6.2 in June, while on the MORI index it had

fallen to –15.0 in July from –4.0 in June.

A25 The Nationwide house price index had risen by 1.1% in July, while the Halifax index had

risen by 0.7%. Annual growth on the Nationwide index had been 10.9% in July, while on the

Halifax index had been 9.6%. House price inflation in Greater London had bounced back in Q2.

Particulars delivered had increased by 10,000 in June to 121,000, the highest level for twelve

months.

A26 Central government other current expenditure had been 14% higher in Q2 than a year earlier.

Public sector net investment in 2001 Q2 had increased by £1.1 billion compared with 2000 Q2. The

CBI’s Industrial Trends survey had shown that stocks had fallen in Q2. Total goods export volumes

had fallen by 2.8% and total goods import volumes by 1.9% in the three months to May compared

with the three months to February. In Q2, exports of goods to non-EU countries had fallen by 4%

on the previous quarter, while imports of goods had fallen by 2%.

A27 Surveys conducted in 2001 Q2 had pointed towards some divergence between service sector

and manufacturing sector confidence. The BCC and CIPS surveys had reported broadly unchanged

service sector confidence. In contrast, the BCC survey had reported a fall in manufacturers’

confidence about both profitability and turnover in the second quarter of 2001. In addition, the CBI

July Industrial Trends survey and the Institute of Directors’ June Business Opinion survey both

indicated that manufacturers’ optimism had remained below average.

A28 Forward-looking survey data on services output had weakened. The BCC service sector

home orders balance had fallen to +19 in Q2 from +26 in Q1, and the CIPS services incoming new

business balance had averaged 52.1 in the three months to July, down from 54.9 in the three months

to April.

A29 Manufacturing orders had also fallen. The CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends survey total new

orders balance had weakened in July to –6, down from –1 in April. The BCC manufacturing sector


-----

orders balance had averaged 47.6 in the three months to July, down from 51.0 in the three months to

April.

**IV** **The labour market**

A30 According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), employment had increased by 92,000 (0.3%)

in the period from March to May compared with the previous three months. The quarterly increase

had been more than accounted for by an increase in full-time employment of 109,000 (0.5%). The

rate of LFS employment growth had returned to the level seen before the slowdown last autumn.

A31 Total hours had increased by 0.2% in the three months to May and had increased by 1.4% on

the previous year. Average hours had fallen slightly (-0.1%) in the three months to May but had

been 0.4% higher than a year earlier. Average full-time hours had fallen by 0.3% on the three

months, while part-time hours had increased by 0.6%. Overtime hours calculated from LFS data

had been little changed over the year and had been relatively stable since autumn 1998.

A32 According to LFS longitudinal data, the number of people entering employment had

increased over the past six months, partly offset by increasing numbers leaving employment. These

data also showed that flows to inactivity from employment had continued to rise while those from

unemployment had fallen.

A33 The CIPS employment index for manufacturing had fallen slightly in July and survey

evidence suggested that employment intentions for Q3 had weakened, particularly in the

manufacturing sector. Employment intentions as recorded by the CBI manufacturing survey had

fallen to –28, reflecting the prevalence of manufacturers reducing their staffing demands. The BCC

and Manpower surveys of manufacturers’ employment intentions had also fallen again, and both

were now below their respective averages. These two surveys had also shown declining service

sector employment intentions, although these intentions were still above the average for the series.

A34 Survey evidence had also pointed to some easing of labour shortages. The BCC measure of

recruitment difficulties in manufacturing had declined sharply in Q2, although the services measure

had fallen only slightly. And the CBI survey for Q2 had shown that shortages of skilled labour in

manufacturing had declined further.


-----

A35 The LFS measure of unemployment had fallen by 82,000 in the period from March to May,

compared with the previous three months, pushing the rate 0.3 percentage points lower to 4.9%.

The claimant count had fallen by 21,000 over the same period and by a further 12,000 in June.

Recent movements in LFS unemployment had contrasted with more moderate declines in the

claimant count.

A36 Working-age inactivity had risen by 45,000 in the three months to May, raising the rate by

0.1 percentage points to 21.2%. There had been an increase of 93,000 in the number of inactive

people saying they did not want a job.

A37 Headline annual earnings growth, a three-month average of the actual rate, had been 4.5% in

May, down 0.7 percentage points from April. Headline earnings growth in the public sector had

increased sharply to 5.3%, an increase of 1.0 percentage points, while the private sector had fallen

by an equal amount to 4.4%. Actual whole-economy earnings growth in the year to January had

fallen less sharply, from 4.8% in April to 4.5% in May. Whole-economy regular pay growth (not

seasonally adjusted) fell by 0.2 percentage points to 5.1% in May. Bonus contributions had

continued to reduce aggregate pay growth in May. The effect of lower bonuses in the private sector

had been to lower compensation growth by 1.0 percentage points, with private services showing a

larger reduction of -1.2 percentage points.

A38 The Bank’s twelve-month AEI-weighted mean pay settlement had increased by 0.1

percentage points to 3.4% in June (after a -0.1 percentage point revision to May), while the three
month measure had fallen by 0.1 percentage points to 3.4%. The most important factor on the

month had been a 5.5% settlement for construction workers, the second year of a three-year deal.

A39 Manufacturing productivity had grown by 2.6% in the year to May – the slowest growth rate

since June 1999. This had contributed to a 0.7 percentage point increase in the growth of

manufacturing unit wage costs, to an annual rate of 2.1%.

**V** **Prices**

A40 The Bank’s commodity price index had fallen by 1.5% in June. This had mainly reflected

falls in the prices of natural gas and oil. Domestic food prices rose for the fourth consecutive month.

As last June’s sharp rise in oil prices had dropped out of the annual comparison, the annual inflation


-----

Looking ahead, the monthly average sterling oil price had fallen by 9.4% in July, taking sterling oil

prices to their lowest level since April.

A41 Producer input prices had risen by 0.1% in June, but due to base effects the annual inflation

rate had fallen to 2.6% in June, from 4.5% in May. Annual input price inflation excluding oil had

eased from 5.0% in January to 2.4% in June. Over the period, increases in domestic food input costs

had been more than offset by a slowdown in the annual inflation rate of the sterling prices of

imported materials. Looking ahead, the CIPS input price balance was broadly unchanged in July,

but had been below the no-change level of 50 for four consecutive months.

A42 Producer output prices excluding excise duties (PPIY) had risen by 0.1% in June, but due to

base effects, the annual inflation rate had eased to 0.7% in June, from 1.1% in May. Looking ahead,

the CBI Industrial Trends expected output price balance had fallen to –16 in June, from –13 in April,

and the CIPS manufacturing survey output price balance had fallen to 47.4 in July, from 47.7 in

June.

A43 Annual RPIX inflation had been unchanged at 2.4% in June. Annual services price inflation

had been unchanged at 4.0% and annual goods price inflation had remained unchanged at 0.7% in

June.

A44 On a quarterly basis, annual RPIX inflation had risen to 2.3% in Q2, from 1.9% in Q1.

Between Q1 and Q2, the contribution of food and utilities prices to annual RPIX inflation had risen

by 0.6 percentage points. This had been partly offset by a fall in Q2 of 0.4 percentage points in the

contribution of duties to annual RPIX inflation. Annual RPIY inflation had risen by 1 percentage

point in Q2, to 2.6%, while annual RPI inflation had fallen to 1.9% in Q2, from 2.6% in Q1.

**VI** **Reports by the Bank’s Agents**

A45 The Bank’s regional Agents reported that growth in the service sector had eased slightly.

Business services growth had slowed, driven largely by the ICT sector. There had been tentative

signs of a modest recovery from the declines in demand for leisure services which had resulted from

foot-and-mouth disease, which had led to an improvement in consumer services growth.

A46 Both activity and business confidence within the manufacturing sector had weakened further.


-----

evidence of weakening in other parts of manufacturing. Manufacturing export activity had

deteriorated further, with signs of weaker exports to Europe, particularly Germany.

A47 Construction output growth had eased slightly, following the surge earlier this year when

firms had cleared backlogs caused by earlier weather-related delays. However, construction activity

had remained robust, with further reports of increased public sector demand and continued strong

growth in residential construction.

A48 Agencies reported that investment intentions had weakened overall, driven by sustained

uncertainty about the world slowdown. Manufacturers’ investment intentions had declined further,

with the most significant downward revisions concentrated in the high-tech sectors of

manufacturing. Investment spending plans in the service sector had remained strong, but growth

had eased, driven by further deferrals of ICT expenditure.

A49 There had been continued strong growth in retail sales volumes, and the start to the

mid-season sales had been robust.

A50 Manufacturing employment had declined at a more rapid pace than in the previous month,

due to lower activity in the sector. Employment growth within the service sector had slowed and

there had been continued reports of an easing in ICT recruitment. Skill shortages had continued to

ease and pay growth had been broadly unchanged.

A51 The Agents had conducted a survey of around 170 firms on their exports over the past year

and revisions to export prospects for 2001 as a whole. Contacts had been asked about revisions in

export prospects to the EU and about the factors causing them. About three-quarters of respondents

had reported that exports to the EU in 2001 Q2 had been lower than or the same as a year earlier,

while the proportion for total exports had been about 60%. A net balance of around two-fifth of

firms had reported that they had revised down their expectations for the growth of exports to the EU

since the beginning of the year, while the net balance for overall export growth had been about a

third of firms. This net downward revision had mainly reflected weaker prospects for exporters of

capital goods and services. Respondents had cited the level of sterling and demand conditions

abroad as the most important factors behind the downward revisions. For some contacts, foot-and
mouth disease had dented prospect for exports of food products and had adversely affected prospects

for inward tourism.

**VII** **Market intelligence**

A52 Expectations of official interest rates implied by short sterling futures had fallen since the

Committee’s previous meeting, decreasing by 20 to 55 basis points for contracts maturing between

September 2001 and end-2003. A large reduction in short sterling rates had occurred on 6 July,

following the release of the industrial production data for the United Kingdom and the non-farm

payrolls data for the United States. Both of these data releases were weaker than market participants

had been expecting. Other considerations that had contributed to the decline in rate expectations

over the month were the decline in equity prices and the weaker-than-expected GfK consumer

confidence survey data for the United Kingdom. Fears of much weaker-than-expected UK GDP

data towards the end of the month had also been cited by market participants as having led to a fall

in short-term interest rate expectations. Although the market expectations of much weaker GDP

growth had proved unfounded, interest rate expectations remained lower after publication of the

data.

A53 Most money market traders had expected the Committee to leave the official repo rate

unchanged at its August meeting. Similarly, economists polled by Reuters on 26 July had attached

an 81% mean probability to no change in the Bank’s repo rate on 1 August.

A54 The sterling exchange rate index had fallen to 106.8 from 107.9 at the time of the

Committee's July meeting, reflecting both international developments and UK-specific factors.

Within the month, there had at times been signs of EMU convergence effects leading to a decline in

sterling’s exchange rate.
