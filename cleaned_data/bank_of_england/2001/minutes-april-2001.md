# MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING

## 4 and 5 April 2001

##### These are the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting held on 4 and 5 April 2001

 They are also available on the Internet

(http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/mpc/mpc0104.pdf).

##### The Bank of England Act 1998 gives the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government’s inflation target. Operational decisions are taken by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The Committee meets on a regular monthly basis and minutes of its meetings are released on the Wednesday of the second week after the meeting takes place. Accordingly, the minutes of the Committee meeting held on 9 and 10 May will be published on 23 May 2001.

#### MINUTES OF MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 4-5 APRIL 2001

1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed money, credit and

asset prices; the world economy; demand and output; the labour market; and prices and costs.

**Money, credit and asset prices**

2 Over the past month, equity prices had fallen sharply in the United States, the euro area and the

United Kingdom, although not in Japan. The FTSE All Share index was now more than 8% below

its level at the Committee’s previous meeting, and nearly 12% lower than the starting point used in

the February Inflation Report. Nor were these declines confined to the technology and

telecommunications sectors, either in this country or overseas. Although the Nasdaq index had fallen

by more than a quarter over the past month, broader US indices such as the S&P 500 and the

Wilshire 5000 had also declined by 12%-13%. More generally, the outperformance of the high-tech

sectors since 1997 had now been almost entirely reversed, both in the United States and the

United Kingdom.

3 The size of these falls in equity prices could not plausibly reflect changes in risk-free real

interest rates, but instead indicated lower expected profits and, perhaps, a higher equity risk premium

associated with greater uncertainty about future returns. In the United States, options prices

suggested that market participants now attached a higher probability than before to further sharp falls

in equity prices. The declines already seen would tend to restrain the growth of private consumption

(through the effects on personal sector wealth), of investment (through the effects on the cost of

capital), and of exports, since this was a global phenomenon.

4 Given the volatility of equity prices, the recent falls need not imply that there had been a major

change in longer-term prospects for US productivity growth. They might instead represent a

correction to earlier over-optimistic expectations of earnings growth for individual companies, or

indeed an overshooting on the downside. In the United States, downside risks to equity prices

remained: price to earnings ratios were still above historical averages. UK profit warnings,

meanwhile, remained high compared with a year ago and were widely distributed across sectors,


-----

with an increasing number of firms citing the US slowdown as the reason for the revision downwards

to their expected profits.

5 Over the period since 1995, the technology, media and telecommunications sector had

accounted for all of the increase in UK manufacturing output. With the United Kingdom more

dependent on this sector than many other countries, though much less so than the United States, there

might be a correspondingly greater effect here from the global slowdown in these industries. The

United Kingdom also had a leading position in the financial services industry, where growth might

slow as a result of the downturn in financial markets.

6 In the February Inflation Report, the Committee had considered the risks of a more pronounced

slowdown in world activity than had been incorporated in the central projection. This slowdown was

assumed to originate in the United States and to be associated with lower equity prices and a weaker

dollar. Such an outcome would put downwards pressure on UK inflation. But this was assumed to

be offset in part by a depreciation of the sterling exchange rate index (ERI), with sterling rising by

less than other currencies against the dollar. Despite the equity market correction, however, so far

the dollar had remained strong and in effective terms was at its highest level since 1986. This

strength was puzzling. It might suggest that market participants did not expect the slowdown in the

United States to last for long, or alternatively that they had recently revised down their expectations

about growth in the euro area. This, together with continuing optimism about medium-term US

growth prospects (based on supply-side improvements) might explain the continuing flow into US

equities from the euro area. These explanations were not fully consistent with movements in relative

interest rates between the euro area and the United States. But the strength of the dollar need not be

inconsistent with the falls seen in US equity markets, since the exchange rate was a relative price and

equity prices had fallen sharply as well in many European countries. Dollar strength might also

reflect ‘safe haven’ flows, although to the extent that the slowdown was centred in the United States,

this was not a particularly persuasive explanation.

7 Against this background, although the sterling ERI had fallen back in recent days, it was still

around 1% above the starting point used in the February Inflation Report. As such, it would tend to

dampen upwards pressure on prices by a little more than in the February central projection.

8 Meanwhile, UK money and credit aggregates continued to grow robustly, suggesting little

slackening yet in consumption growth. Household M4 had increased by 7.2% in the year to

February 2001, its fastest rate for three years, while growth in M4 lending to households over the

same period was just below 10%. Against a background of strengthening house prices and lower

mortgage rates, growth in secured lending remained strong and the Bank’s estimate of mortgage

equity withdrawal in 2000 Q4 had been revised up a little. Loan approvals remained robust, if a little

lower than in January, while particulars delivered had begun to increase.

9 Interest rates had also eased. If other lenders followed the reductions in Standard Variable

Mortgage Rates (SVRs) announced the previous month, the effective mortgage rate would as a result

eventually fall by more than the repo rate. Forward interest rates implied by short sterling futures

contracts had also fallen, by between 30 and 45 basis points over the past month. The market had

already priced in a reduction of 25 basis points in the repo rate for the Committee’s April meeting,

with market rates implying further reductions in the repo rate, to 5% or below by 2001 Q3.

10 In summary, the falls in equity prices might over time be expected to restrain demand, and the

strength of sterling would exert a dampening effect on inflation. By contrast, the money and credit

data and the continuing strength in house prices would tend to underpin consumption, as would the

fall in interest rates faced by mortgage borrowers.

**The world economy**

11 In the United States, GDP growth in the first quarter seemed likely to be at or slightly above the

rate assumed in the central projection in the February _Inflation Report, and in that sense earlier fears_

about the downside risks had yet to materialise. But the sharp falls in US equity prices, and the

continuing low levels of the major business and consumer confidence indices (which were in general

only a little higher than a month ago) might signal a rather later, and perhaps more sluggish, recovery

than that incorporated in the February central projection.

12 US retail sales in January had been revised up sharply, although they had fallen back a little in

February. Non-farm payrolls had increased again in February, although other labour market

indicators suggested that unemployment might begin to rise soon, particularly if the US economy

continued to grow significantly below trend. The recent special Senior Loan Officer Survey


-----

4


indicated tighter credit conditions, and also a fall in the demand for funds as a result of lower capital

expenditure. This scaling back of investment plans might reflect a rise in the cost of equity capital,

lower expectations of future demand (borne out by orders data), excess capacity in some sectors

(with industrial sector capacity utilisation at its lowest since 1992) and lower profits, seen both in the

data for 2000 Q4 and in the spate of profit warnings since then. It might suggest a more prolonged

slowdown than would be implied by a purely inventory-led cycle.

13 There were downside risks stemming from the scale of the imbalances in the US economy, and

in particular the size of the private sector financial deficit. A sharp cutback by the corporate sector,

designed to improve its financial position, could lead to higher unemployment and a retrenchment by

the household sector. Separately, the fall in equity prices could in any case prompt a rise in

household savings. These effects might be offset in part by more expansionary fiscal and monetary

policy. Given the continued strength of the dollar, and slower growth in many other countries, the

slowdown in the United States was less likely to result in a narrowing of the current account deficit

than might otherwise have been expected. A sharp correction in these imbalances therefore

remained a possibility, but it was as easy to paint a scenario in which the imbalances persisted for

several years, with the necessary corrections taking place more gradually.

14 The Committee agreed that the changes seen so far in business and consumer confidence and

prospective corporate profitability were not obviously out of line with what might have been

expected from an economy which had slowed suddenly from a growth rate of over 5% a year to little

more than 1% in the fourth quarter of 2000. While this slowdown was so far no greater than

expected, it was possible that the period of slower growth might be more protracted than had earlier

seemed likely.

15 Within the euro area there were some signs of rather slower growth, particularly in Germany.

Orders data for January had fallen sharply, and in February the IFO index had declined again, after

January’s rise. This weakness reflected decelerating domestic demand, in part due to slower growth

in real disposable incomes. But it was important not to focus solely on Germany. Conditions

elsewhere in the euro area were generally rather more robust, although business confidence was less

buoyant even in France and euro-area industrial production had fallen in January; a slowdown in the

telecommunications sector might also hold back growth. Nevertheless, both business and industrial

confidence remained well above their long-run averages and while forward-looking indicators


-----

5


suggested some slowing to come, forecasts of growth for the euro area as a whole had so far been

lowered only modestly.

16 While quarter-on-quarter movements in Japanese GDP remained erratic, there was little sign yet

of any upturn in the economy; if anything, expectations of growth had fallen since February, and the

Tankan survey had shown a sharp fall in business confidence. Elsewhere in Asia, growth in

industrial production was slowing rapidly, in part because of the downturn in US and Japanese

demand for electronic goods from the region.

17 Taken as a whole, the prospects for the world economy appeared rather weaker than at the time

of the February Inflation Report. In March, outside forecasters had lowered their projections for

growth in the United States, Japan and Germany to below the central projection in the February

_Report, and they seemed likely to revise these forecasts down further in April. That said, UK export_

markets, which were principally in Europe, were less affected by the global slowdown than export

markets worldwide.

**Demand and output in the United Kingdom**

18 Quarterly real GDP growth in 2000 Q4 had been revised up from 0.3% to 0.4%, with final

domestic demand now estimated to have increased by 0.9%, as against 0.7% previously. Gross fixed

capital formation was now estimated to have increased by 2.6% in the quarter; within this total

business investment had grown by 5.2%.  These revisions resolved an earlier puzzle, as previous

weak data had appeared inconsistent with the state of company finances and surveys of investment

intentions.

19 Until recently, there had been little sign that the slowdown in the United States was having a

significant impact on the United Kingdom. Survey data taken as a whole suggested that total export

growth was unlikely to slow much in the first half of 2001. This might simply reflect lags: it would

take time to see the effects of a US-related slowdown here. Evidence of these effects might now be

beginning to emerge. Two-thirds of the firms questioned in a survey by the Bank’s Agents had

revised down their expectations for exports to the United States (although these downwards revisions

were partially offset by stronger expected growth in exports to other markets). That survey

suggested that expectations of output growth, and to a lesser extent investment intentions, had also


-----

6


been revised down. Large firms with US parents and those in the information and communications

technology sector were the most significantly affected.  These results were in line with the latest

figures for manufacturing export orders in the survey by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and

Supply (CIPS).

20 The slowdown in the world economy would place pressure on the externally traded sectors of

the economy, including manufacturing, particularly given the continuing resilience of the sterling

exchange rate. For some members, this sharpened the policy dilemma. At some point, private sector

domestic demand growth would need to slow to below trend. The longer this adjustment was

delayed, the greater it might need to be. It could also involve a sharp fall in the sterling exchange

rate.

21 In January, manufacturing output had fallen sharply, reflecting a fall in the output of the

electrical and optical equipment sector, while in February it had risen by only 0.1%. And the CIPS

manufacturing survey showed both output and orders falling sharply, to below 50 in both cases.

These figures might in themselves point to somewhat weaker GDP growth than had earlier been

expected. On the other hand, the business activity index for services, while also falling a little,

remained well above the neutral 50 level, as did the equivalent series for construction.

22 Expenditure-based data suggested a somewhat stronger picture. In recent years, the initial

output-based estimate of GDP has been subject to revision, generally in an upwards direction. In

contrast to the prospective weakening of external demand, final domestic demand continued to grow

strongly, and would be supported going forward by the public spending plans set out in the Budget.

The new figures for business investment growth in Q4 were even stronger than the estimates made

the previous month, and were consistent with continuing growth interrupted by a pause around the

start of 2000. The implications of this strength for future capital spending were less clear.

23 In the February Inflation Report, consumption growth had been expected to moderate. In part

this reflected an expected easing in the labour market (and so in real income growth) which had yet

to happen. While consumption had grown by less than expected in 2000 Q4, at 0.6%, this might

have been a result of weather and transport-related disruption. Retail sales volumes had increased by

1.6% on the latest three-month comparison, which of itself might suggest something of a rebound in

consumption in Q1. While the GfK consumer confidence measure had risen slightly, the more recent


-----

7


(and more volatile) MORI index had fallen sharply, perhaps reflecting the uncertainties caused by

foot and mouth disease and the state of equity markets at the time of the survey.

24 For some, continuing strong growth in consumption remained an upside risk to the forecast,

supported by the buoyancy of the money and credit figures and the pick-up in the housing market

(both in terms of the quantities and prices data). The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors had

noted a continuing increase in the balance of estate agents reporting rises in house prices, and

provisional data indicated a further rise in March, although the forward-looking data suggested that

the pace of increase in house prices might soon begin to moderate. The CBI Distributive Trades

survey reported robust retail sales growth in March, coupled with significant increases for both

wholesaling and the motor trades, although when sales were adjusted for the time of year, this

strength was less apparent, and was not expected to persist into April. Meanwhile, total household

wealth was estimated to have fallen by 4½% in 2001 Q1 (an estimate which included the effects both

of higher house prices and lower equity prices). This reduced the upside risk to consumption and by

itself might eventually reduce the level of consumption by ½%-1% over the medium term.

25 There were, as always, uncertainties about the outlook. In particular, there were downside risks

from the slowdown in the global economy and the associated weakness of equity markets, both here

and overseas, and also from foot and mouth disease. The last of these was difficult to quantify. Not

only was it hard to predict the number of new cases which would emerge in the coming weeks and

months, but there were also indirect effects (especially on tourism) and economy-wide effects (on

business and consumer confidence) which were highly uncertain but could be significant.

26 The short-run effects on the agricultural sector were severe. Agriculture itself accounted for less

than 2% of GDP, with the livestock sector closer to ½% of GDP. The effect would be to reduce both

demand and supply in the agricultural sector. As a result, the direct impact on inflation from lower

agricultural output was likely to be small.

27 The indirect effects, both on businesses further up the supply chain and on tourism and

confidence more widely, would tend to reduce demand relative to supply. However, the size of these

effects was hard to gauge, and would depend on the extent of any substitution effects. For instance,

would those from the United Kingdom who decided not to visit the countryside nevertheless spend

as much as originally planned on other UK goods and services? If so, this would have no


-----

8


implications for aggregate UK consumption. However, such a shift in the geographical pattern of

expenditure might exacerbate existing regional imbalances, which could conceivably have

implications for the outlook for inflation, and hence for policy. There might also be changes in the

timing of expenditure. By contrast, if overseas visitors chose not to visit the United Kingdom, or if

UK residents holidayed overseas, the effect on demand would be unambiguous: UK GDP would be

lower than otherwise, with a more negative contribution to growth from net trade and hence weaker

inflationary pressures.

28 Whatever the impact of the foot and mouth outbreak in the short term, most members of the

Committee thought that unless the tourism and confidence effects proved greater and more persistent

than at present seemed likely, the impact into next year would be relatively moderate.

**The labour market**

29 Quantities data in the labour market were once again relatively buoyant. Employment was

growing faster than the population of working age, after several months in which the Labour Force

Survey (LFS) data had shown a weaker picture, perhaps as a result of travel and weather-related

disruptions in autumn 2000. Unemployment continued to fall, both on the LFS and claimant-count

measures; the LFS measure had declined to 5.2% in the three months to January, while the

claimant-count measure showed unemployment below one million in February 2001 for the first time

in over 25 years. When taken together with the CIPS surveys, and a small fall in the inactivity rate,

there was little sign of any easing yet in the labour market.

30 Forward-looking indicators, however, were rather more mixed. The Report on Jobs from the

Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) pointed to continued increases in permanent

placements in March, but at the slowest rate for two years. The index of national press recruitment

advertising was down on a year ago. Nevertheless the REC survey concluded that the labour market

remained tight by historical standards, with widespread staff shortages. The Bank’s regional Agents

reported that while the labour market remained tight in most parts of the country, there were early

signs of an easing in a few sectors.

31 The Committee agreed that despite the tightness in the labour market, there was little indication

so far of any worrying increase in settlements and earnings growth. Month-by-month figures for


-----

9


average earnings remained erratic, especially when compared with the figures a year ago which had

been distorted by millennium-related payments. But the drift up in regular pay increases

(particularly in the private sector which had moved from 4.3% in July to 4.9% in December), now

seemed to have stopped. The figure for December had now been revised down to 4.8% and that for

January was 3.9% (although this was distorted by the comparison with a year ago). There were

therefore some signs that the rate of unemployment which was consistent with stable earnings

growth was lower than previously believed. Nevertheless, the Committee would continue to monitor

pay growth carefully, particularly given that April was a heavy month for settlements.

**Prices and costs**

32 There would be several erratic influences on RPIX inflation in the coming months, associated

with the timing and nature of the Budget measures, movements in utilities prices last year, and the

impact of foot and mouth disease. While it was possible that these might net out month by month,

this could not be assured, and the data would therefore need to be interpreted accordingly.

33 Some members noted that if the components of RPIX were weighted together on the basis of

their past persistence (with the aim of adjusting for erratic movements) rather than their importance

in household budgets, the resulting measure of ‘core’ inflation was around 1.5%, and was projected

to remain there for the next year. Others observed that the standard errors around such forecasts

were large, and had reservations about using this technique, particularly to project inflation more

than a few months ahead.

34 The Bank’s regional Agents reported that prices continued to be restrained by competition and

consumer pressure, although a few more companies had managed to increase prices modestly over

the past month. But the CIPS surveys suggested diminished price pressures, with input costs in

manufacturing rising at their slowest rate for 20 months and in services for 18 months. Output prices

showed a similar picture. In services these prices had risen at their slowest rate for 18 months, while

in manufacturing, prices had fallen for the first time since the series began in November 1999.

Meanwhile manufacturing output prices excluding excise duties had risen by only 0.9% in the year to

February.

**The immediate policy decision**

35 All members agreed that the prospects for the world economy now appeared rather weaker than

at the Committee’s previous meeting, and that the associated fall in equity prices would also restrain

demand. Taken together with the short-run effects on demand and supply from foot and mouth

disease, the downside risks to UK growth this year had increased. At the same time, price and cost

pressures continued to be subdued, both in product and labour markets. The differences in view

were mainly about the scale of the downside risks. Against this background, it was agreed that a

reduction in the Bank’s repo rate was needed this month to meet the inflation target; the question

was how large that reduction should be.

36 For most members, the repo rate should be reduced this month by 25 basis points. While

recognising the downside risks from the international slowdown, the fall in equity prices and foot

and mouth disease, and while agreeing that it was important to remain forward looking, it was

equally important not to over-react. Final domestic demand growth remained robust. The strength

of the housing market would cushion the effects on consumption of falls in equity prices. Nor were

there signs of weakness in business investment and government consumption; indeed, the reverse.

The buoyancy of the money and credit aggregates, together with a labour market which was if

anything continuing to tighten, suggested an upside risk to demand and inflation. Against this

background, a greater-than-expected cut in interest rates at a time of fragile confidence could even

prove to be counterproductive, by implying that the prospect for the UK economy was seen to be

worse than it was. Lowering interest rates too far also risked exacerbating the imbalances between a

strong domestic sector and weak net trade, imbalances which at some point would need to be

resolved. The balance of risks, when taken together with the still moderate increase in earnings

growth and subdued retail price inflation, suggested that a 25 basis point reduction in the repo rate

was appropriate this month. All of these members agreed that the downside risks would need to be

monitored carefully, and some of them felt that it might not require much additional downside news

to justify a further cut in rates.

37 On a second view, although the decision was very finely balanced, it was better to reduce the

repo rate by 50 basis points this month. While agreeing with the factors cited for a reduction in the

repo rate, the continuing weakness of inflationary pressures against a background of significant

downside risks particularly the risk of a deterioration in confidence argued for going further than


-----

11

25 basis points. With price pressures remaining restrained month after month, it seemed less

probable that inflation would pick up to the target of 2½% during the next two years without further

action on interest rates. Sterling had not fallen back and this, together with competitive pressures,

price resistance from consumers and the benefits from the application of information and

communications technology, was continuing to help restrain inflation. Most measures of

domestically generated inflation were now below 2½%. It was of course possible that a

50 basis point cut in rates might damage confidence, but it was just as likely that a pre-emptive

reduction would help to sustain it. For these reasons, and as an insurance against the downside risks,

the repo rate should be reduced to 5.25% this month.

38 On a third view, the decision to reduce the repo rate by 50 basis points this month was more

clear-cut. In March, members taking this view had voted for a reduction in the repo rate of

25 basis points. More was now required; a 50 basis point reduction was not large either in the UK

context or by comparison with movements elsewhere and, if properly explained, might help bolster

confidence rather than dent it. These members had already been more pessimistic about the global

economy than the central projection in the February Inflation Report and the recent news, together

with developments in financial markets, had reinforced these concerns. Foot and mouth disease

would impact on tourism from overseas (already suffering from the US slowdown and the strong

exchange rate); in addition, the impact on confidence among those in rural areas might be neither

small nor brief. Despite the strength in some backward-looking series, many forward-looking

indicators were beginning to turn down. At the same time, on some measures policy remained

contractionary, with real interest rates still slightly above their ‘neutral’ level and the lagged effects

of past exchange rate and interest rate movements tightening conditions a little further this year. A

‘persistence-weighted’ measure of RPIX inflation was running at around 1½% and was likely to

continue to do so for the rest of the year. Input and output price pressures seemed to be weakening

still further, and RPIX inflation continued its slow and steady decline, to further below the target.

Without further cuts in interest rates the recovery in inflation to 2½%, as set out in the February

_Inflation Report, seemed increasingly unlikely, depending as it did on estimates of capacity_

utilisation indicating that current output was above full capacity. This was not consistent with survey

data or with different conceptual approaches to the measurement of capital inputs. Imbalances in the

economy, such as those between domestic demand and net exports, might eventually cause problems

but these, given the Committee’s remit, were secondary to the need to meet the inflation target. A

demand and improve the prospects of returning inflation to target. It was possible that further

reductions would be needed in future months, even in the absence of further downside news.

39 The Governor invited members to vote on the proposition that the Bank’s repo rate should be

reduced by 25 basis points to 5.5%. Six members of the Committee (the Governor, Mervyn King,

David Clementi, Christopher Allsopp, Charles Bean and Stephen Nickell) voted for the proposition.

DeAnne Julius, Ian Plenderleith and Sushil Wadhwani voted against, preferring a reduction in the

repo rate of 50 basis points.

#### ANNEX: SUMMARY OF DATA PRESENTED BY BANK STAFF

A1 This Annex summarises the analysis presented by Bank staff to the Monetary Policy

Committee on 30 March 2001, in advance of its meeting on 4-5 April 2001. At the start of the

Committee meeting itself, members were made aware of information that had subsequently become

available, and that information is included in this Annex.

**I  The international environment**

A2 The spot price for Brent crude oil had fallen by just over $1 since the Committee’s previous

meeting, to around $25 per barrel. The Economist industrial commodity index had fallen by 1.4% in

March. The Economist soft commodity price index had also fallen (by 1.7%) in March, due to

weaker coffee and sugar prices. World industrial production growth had slowed to 3.3% in the year

to January, from 4.2% in the year to December. Consensus growth forecasts for 2001 had been

revised down in March by 0.1 percentage points for the United States (to 1.9%) and the euro area (to

2.7%), and by 0.2 percentage points for Japan (to 1.2%).

A3 In the United States, post-tax profits had fallen for the first time in six quarters in Q4, but the

fall had been exaggerated by settlements of legal claims by tobacco firms. The latest Senior Loan

Officer Survey had shown that credit conditions had tightened further between January and March.

The survey had shown falling demand for funds, which had been driven mainly by reduced capital

expenditure. But aggregate lending data had shown that bank lending to firms continued to

strengthen in February. Orders growth in capital goods (excluding erratics) had remained on a

downward trend in February.

A4 Business inventory growth had continued to slow in January. Slower growth had also been

indicated by the National Association of Purchasing Managers inventory component, which had

remained below its historic average for the previous six months. Industrial production had fallen

further in February. Industrial capacity utilisation in February had dropped to its lowest level since

1992. Manufacturing output had decreased by 0.5% on the month in February, and high-tech

production growth had slowed further.


-----

A5 Households’ net financial wealth had fallen by 5.7% in 2000 Q4, reflecting falls in the value

of equity holdings over that period. Both the Conference Board and the Michigan measures of

consumer confidence had picked up in March. Retail sales had fallen in February by 0.2% in

nominal terms, but the monthly growth rate in January had been revised up to 1.3% (from 0.7%).

Real consumption had risen 0.1% in February, following a rise of 0.6% in January. Total non-farm

payrolls had continued to grow in February, with strong growth in service sector employment

offsetting falls in the manufacturing sector. But initial unemployment claims had increased in

February and March after a dip in January.

A6 Annual consumer price inflation had fallen to 3.5% in February from 3.7% in January,

reflecting a fall in energy prices. In contrast, core inflation, which excluded food and energy, had

increased to 2.7% in February from 2.6% in January. Annual growth in hourly earnings had

increased to 4.1% in February from 4.0% the month before. Core producer price inflation had fallen

to 1.3%, following a sharp pick-up in January to 2.0%. The Federal Open Market Committee had

reduced policy rates by 50 basis points to 5.0% on 20 March.

A7 In the euro area, GDP had grown by 0.7% in Q4, taking growth in 2000 to 3.4%. Industrial

production had fallen by 1.9% in January after having risen by 1.7% in December. The IFO index

for western Germany had fallen to 94.9 in February from 97.5 in January. Sub-indices on the

assessment of the current business situation and business expectations had both fallen in February.

German manufacturing and foreign orders had declined by 3.0% and 6.1% respectively in January.

Industrial confidence had fallen slightly in March in the euro area, while consumer confidence had

remained unchanged on the month. January and February data on French consumer spending on

manufactured goods had pointed to robust consumption growth there in Q1.

A8 HICP inflation in the euro area had increased to 2.6% in February from 2.4% in January.

Core inflation (excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco) had remained unchanged at 1.7%.

Preliminary German consumer price inflation had fallen to 2.4% in the year to March from 2.5% in

the year to February. Euro-area producer price inflation had fallen to 4.4% in February from 4.8% in

January.

A9 Japanese GDP growth had been 0.8% in Q4 and 1.7% in 2000 as a whole. Private investment

contributed 1.2 percentage points to GDP growth in Q4. Corporate profits had risen by 32% in the


-----

3

year to Q4. The March Tankan survey had shown that corporate confidence had declined since

December. Confidence among large manufacturers had declined by 15 points, from +10 to -5.

Investment indicators had turned down in January. Industrial production had risen by 0.4% in

February, having fallen by 4.2% in January. Japanese export volumes had declined by 5.7% in the

year to February. Import volumes had remained resilient, and had grown at 2.8% over the year.

Real wages had risen by 2.9% (seasonally adjusted) in the year to January, following an increase in

winter bonuses. Retail sales had recovered in February, and had risen by 3.3% over the year in

nominal terms and by 1.7% over the year in real terms.

A10 Domestic wholesale prices had declined by 0.4% over the year in February (compared with a

fall of 0.3% in January). Overall wholesale prices had risen by 0.1% in February (from +1.2% in

January). The Bank of Japan had changed the main operating target for money market operations

from an uncollateralised overnight call rate to the outstanding balance of the current accounts held by

financial institutions at the Bank of Japan.

A11 Most emerging markets’ sovereign bond spreads had risen since the Committee’s previous

meeting. In Argentina the spread on dollar-denominated sovereign debt had risen by about

160 basis points.

**II  Monetary and financial conditions**

A12 The twelve-month growth rate of notes and coin had been unchanged at 8.2% in March.

A13 M4 had risen by £2.1 billion (0.2%) in February, lowering the twelve-month growth rate

slightly to 9.0%. The twelve-month growth rate of M4 excluding other financial corporations

(OFCs) was unchanged at a post-December 1997 peak of 7.5%. The twelve-month growth rate of

aggregate M4 lending (excluding the effects of securitisations) had fallen slightly to 12.5%.

A14 The twelve-month growth rate of household M4 had risen to 7.2% in February, the highest

since February 1998. Following relatively weak outturns in early 2000, some recovery in household

M4 had been expected as households sought to rebuild their deposits. Within total lending to

individuals, the twelve-month growth rate of net secured lending had risen slightly to 8.3% in

February, while that of unsecured lending had slowed to 11.8%, the lowest figure since

February 1995. The Bank’s estimate of mortgage equity withdrawal in 2000 Q4 had been revised up

to £2.8 billion from a preliminary estimate of £2.4 billion. The number of loan approvals had fallen

by 10,000 in February from the strong figure seen in January, but remained robust by recent

standards.

A15 The one-month flow of private non-financial corporations’ (PNFCs’) M4 had been negative

in February, bringing the twelve-month growth rate down to 8.4% from 10.6% in January. The

twelve-month growth rate of PNFCs’ borrowing (excluding securitisations) had fallen to 13.5%.

Total external finance had risen slightly, to £6.0 billion in February. The twelve-month growth rates

of OFCs’ M4 and M4 lending (excluding securitisations) in February had been 14.2% and 18.8%

respectively.

A16 Short-term forward interest rates, as measured by the two-week gilt repo curve, had fallen

significantly since the Committee’s previous meeting. Most survey-based measures of short-term

inflation expectations had fallen in March. The Consensus Economics and HMT surveys for RPIX

inflation in 2001 had both fallen to 1.9%, the lowest level since 1997. The Barclays Basix survey of

RPI inflation expectations by the general public over the next twelve months had also fallen sharply,

to 3.5% from the 4.1% level seen the previous quarter. One year inflation forward rates inferred

from the gilt market had fallen at short maturities, but had risen at medium maturities.

A17 At long maturities, both nominal and real yields had risen earlier in the month, possibly as a

result of the announced abolition of the Minimum Funding Requirement. Over the month as a

whole, nominal yields on maturities of up to eight years had fallen, while yields at medium and long

maturities had risen. Real yields had also risen at medium and long maturities. Swap rates had

moved broadly in line with yields on government debt. Issuance of non-gilt sterling-denominated

bonds had fallen from last month’s strong levels; issuance by UK companies had been particularly

low in the fixed-rate category.

A18 Most variable retail rates had fallen in March, reflecting the reduction in the Bank’s repo rate.

The standard variable mortgage rate (SVR) had fallen even further, by a total of 44 basis points, as

the cuts announced by a number of leading mortgage lenders had taken effect.

A19 Since the Committee’s previous meeting, the sterling exchange rate index (ERI) had risen by

0.5%, to 105.0 at the close of business on 4 April. Sterling had been 1.9% lower against the dollar,

and 0.8% higher against the euro. Changes in nominal interest rate differentials could not account

for sterling’s movements against these currencies.

A20 Equity markets had been turbulent since the Committee’s previous meeting. With the

exception of the Nikkei 225, all major indices had registered significant declines. Among these, the

FTSE All-Share had fallen by 8.2%, the S&P 500 by 12.6% and the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx by 8.4%.

In contrast to previous months, the declines had been widespread and not concentrated in technology

sectors. Greater market uncertainty had been reflected in increased volatilities implied by options

prices. Options prices had suggested that market participants’ expectations were skewed towards

further downward movements in equity prices in the United States, but not in the United Kingdom.

The number of profit warnings issued by UK companies had remained high compared with a year

ago and had been distributed across a range of sectors. A number of firms had cited slower US

demand and foot and mouth disease as the reasons behind their announcement.

A21 Credit spreads on higher-quality US and UK corporate debt had changed little since the

Committee’s previous meeting. Those on lower-rated US corporate debt had widened in March,

following declines seen earlier in the year. Indices on lower-rated corporate debt in the

United Kingdom suggested that credit spreads had been broadly stable during March.

**III  Demand and output**

A22 In the National Accounts, quarterly real GDP growth had been revised up to 0.4% in Q4 from

0.3% in the previous release. Annual growth had also been revised up slightly, to 2.6% from 2.5%.

In addition, revisions back to the beginning of 2000 had resulted in the level of GDP being 0.1%

higher in Q4. The revisions had smoothed GDP growth in 2000: growth in Q1 had been revised up

to 0.4% from 0.3%, and growth in Q2 revised down from 1.0% to 0.9%. The output-based measure

of growth had been rather weaker than the expenditure and income-based measures in Q4.

A23 On the expenditure side of the accounts, quarterly final domestic demand growth had been

revised up to 0.9% in Q4 from the initial estimate of 0.7%. This had largely reflected an upward

revision to whole-economy investment growth.


-----

6

A24 Household consumption growth in Q4 had been revised down slightly to 0.6% from 0.7%.

Within this, growth in spending on services had been weak but spending on durables had grown

strongly.

A25 Government consumption growth in Q4 had been revised up slightly, to 0.3% from 0.2%.

Growth in whole-economy investment had been revised up to 2.6% in Q4 from 1.2%, and the level

of investment in Q4 was 1.2% higher than in the previous release of GDP. Business investment

growth had been very strong in Q4 at 5.2%, but investment in dwellings and general government

investment had both fallen.

A26 In Q4, the contribution to GDP growth from stockbuilding had been revised down to -0.7

percentage points from -0.6 percentage points. However this was more than accounted for by the

alignment adjustment, which had subtracted 0.8 percentage points from growth in Q4.

A27 Revisions to export and import growth in Q4 had resulted in the net trade contribution to

GDP growth being revised down slightly to 0.1 percentage points, from 0.2 percentage points in the

previous release. Total exports of goods and services had risen by 2.3%, while imports had grown

by 1.7%. The current account deficit had narrowed slightly in Q4 to £3.7 billion, compared with

£4.0 billion in Q3.

A28 Households’ nominal post-tax income had grown by 3.5% in Q4. The saving ratio had risen

to 5.5% from 3.4% in Q4, although it had been thought that this partly reflected the timing of

government winter fuel allowance payments. In contrast, the PNFCs’ gross operating surplus had

fallen by some 4.1% in Q4, compared with a rise of 3.1% in Q3. Excluding the alignment

adjustment, the gross operating surplus had declined by 0.6% in Q4.

A29 Turning to Q1, retail sales had risen by 0.6% in February, increasing the three monthly

growth rate to 1.6%. The GfK measure of consumer confidence had risen marginally in March, to

+3 from +2 in the previous month, but the MORI measure had declined sharply to -29.

A30 Staff had updated their analysis of the impact of foot and mouth disease on 2001 Q1 and

beyond. The estimated impact depended on estimates of both direct and indirect effects. It had been


-----

7

thought that the main indirect effect would be through the impact of foot and mouth disease on

tourism. But the precise impact would depend on the size of substitution effects.

A31 The Halifax and Nationwide house price indices had risen by 0.4% and 1.4% respectively in

March. On the activity side, particulars delivered had increased sharply to 117,000 in March, the

highest level since August 2000. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors’ price balance had risen

by 7 points to +32 in February.

A32 Total industrial production had fallen by 0.3% and manufacturing output had grown by 0.1%

in February. Output in the energy sector had fallen by 2.1%, reflecting declines in both the mining

and utilities sectors.

**IV  The labour market**

A33 Employment had grown by 102,000 (0.4%) in November to January compared with the

previous three months, according to the Labour Force Survey (LFS). This rise in employment

contrasted with falling employment in the previous two overlapping quarters. It was consistent with

the unwinding of the effects of recent erratic factors including unusually wet weather and travel

disruption in the autumn.

A34 Workforce Jobs had risen by 48,000 in Q4, continuing the recent pattern of slower growth

than shown by the LFS data. The sectoral breakdown of Workforce Jobs had suggested that growth

continued to be concentrated in (but spread across) the services sector.

A35 Survey evidence had suggested that employment continued to grow steadily in Q1 and that

skill shortages had shown little change overall. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply

(CIPS) survey indicated further expansion in construction and services employment in February,

while manufacturers reducing employment still outnumbered those increasing employment.  The

CBI/Deloittes survey of business and consumer services had shown little change in either

professional or clerical shortages.

A36 Average hours had risen by 1.1% in the three months to January and were now 0.4% higher

than a year ago. Average full-time hours had increased by 0.9% and average part-time hours had


-----

8

increased by 1.2%. It was possible that this increase partly represented catch-up after the autumn

disruptions. Total hours worked had increased by 1.4% in November to January compared with the

previous three months, having fallen in the autumn.

A37 The LFS measure of unemployment had fallen by 81,000 in November to January, pushing

the rate 0.3 percentage points lower to 5.2%. The fall in the unemployment rate had been

concentrated among the short-term unemployed (down 53,000 in the quarter). Claimant

unemployment had fallen by 40,900 over the three months to January compared with the previous

three months and by a further 10,600 in February. This had taken the claimant count below one

million for the first time since December 1975.

A38 The working-age inactivity rate had risen by 35,000 in the three months to January, lowering

the rate by 0.1 percentage points to 21.1%. This rate had been broadly the same as three months ago,

but down sharply from Q4.

A39 Headline annual earnings growth, a three-month average of the actual rate, had been 4.4% in

January, unchanged from December. Headline earnings growth in the public sector had fallen by 0.1

percentage points to 3.8%, while in the private sector it had been unchanged at 4.5%. Actual whole
economy earnings growth in the year to January had fallen sharply, to 3.9% from 4.8% in December,

with this decline largely accounted for by a similar decline in the regular pay component from 4.6%

to 3.8%. This could partly have reflected payments associated with working over the millennium

date change dropping out of the comparison.

A40 The annual growth of wages and salaries per head had risen by 0.1 percentage points in Q4,

to 4.3%. Annual growth in productivity, based on the Workforce Jobs measure of employment, had

fallen by 0.3 percentage points (from a revised rate of 2.5% in Q3). Annual growth in

whole-economy unit wage costs had picked up slightly in Q4, to 1.8%.

A41 The Bank’s twelve-month AEI-weighted mean pay settlement figure had been unchanged at

3.1% in February. Public and private sector means had also been unchanged. The whole-economy

three-month mean settlement had risen by 0.1 percentage points to 3.3% in February.

**V  Prices**

A42 The Bank’s oil-inclusive commodity price index had risen by 3.2% in February, taking its

annual inflation rate to 7% in February from 6.9% in January. The monthly rise had mainly been

accounted for by rises in the prices of fuels. The fuels component of the index had risen by 5.6% in

February, which had largely reflected a rise of around 9% in the monthly average sterling oil price.

The sterling oil price had weakened by around 7% in March. Although spot gas prices had fallen by

around 30% from their peak in December 2000, they remained about 90% higher than a year ago.

A43 Manufacturing input prices had risen by 1.8% in February, but due to base effects the annual

inflation rate had fallen to 6.1% in February from 6.9% in January. The CIPS input price index had

fallen to 52.0 in March from 54.8 in February. Output prices excluding excise duties (PPIY) had

fallen by 0.1% in February. Annual PPIY inflation had fallen to 0.9% in February from 1.2% in

January, the lowest rate since September 1999. Looking ahead, the CBI manufacturing output price

balance had been unchanged at -14 in March.

A44 The National Accounts release had contained revisions to GDP deflators back to 2000 Q1.

The quarterly change in the GDP deflator at market prices in 2000 Q4 had been unrevised at 0.3%,

although other revisions had raised the annual inflation rate to 1.2% (from 1.1%). The annual

inflation rate of the GDP deflator at factor cost had fallen to 1.2% in 2000 Q4, after being revised up

to 1.8% in 2000 Q3 (from 1.3%). The annual inflation rate of the household consumption deflator in

2000 Q4 had been revised down slightly to 0.7% (from 0.8%). Annual growth in the investment

deflator in 2000 Q4 had also been revised down, to 0.3% (from 1.0%). In contrast, the government

expenditure deflator had been revised up in the last three quarters of 2000, leaving it 0.9% higher in

2000 Q4 than it had previously been. The annual inflation rate of the import price deflator in 2000

Q4 had been revised down to 2.6% (from 2.9%), while the annual inflation rate of the export price

deflator had been revised up to 2.3% (from 2.2%).

A45 RPIX inflation had risen by 0.1 percentage points to 1.9% in February. Both goods and

services price inflation had risen by 0.1 percentage points in February, although the main

contribution to the monthly rise had been from the housing depreciation component of the index.

Looking ahead, the effects of foot and mouth disease on retail prices were highly uncertain. Data

from the Meat and Livestock Commission had suggested that retail meat prices had risen by around


-----

10

8% between the February and March RPI collection dates but had since begun to fall back. RPI

inflation was unchanged at 2.7% in February, while RPIY inflation had risen by 0.1 percentage

points to 1.6%. HICP inflation had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 0.8%, thus widening the gap

between it and RPIX inflation.

**VI  Reports by the Bank’s Agents**

A46 Manufacturing contacts had continued to report further moderate growth in output and orders.

However, there had been more widespread evidence of a slowing in orders in the information and

communications technology (ICT) sector. The Agents had reported that manufacturing contacts

were becoming increasingly uncertain about the impact of the downturn in the US economy on

manufacturing activity in the United Kingdom.

A47 The Agents had conducted a survey of around 170 firms (around one third of which had US

parents) regarding the extent to which they had revised their expectations of growth in exports,

output and investment since the beginning of the year as a result of the slowdown in the United

States. A net balance of around two thirds of firms (weighted by turnover) reported that they had

revised down their expectations for exports to the United States, although the majority reported that

expectations had been revised down only slightly. While the overall net balance was similar for

those firms with US parents, the responses had included a significantly higher proportion of firms

reporting that expectations had been revised down ‘significantly’. By sector, responses from the ICT

industries had recorded the largest downward revisions. The responses had been more optimistic for

total exports. But although the results had implied that growth in other export markets had been

revised up, the overall balance remained negative. Expectations of output had also been revised

downwards, by a similar extent to exports. Investment intentions had been least affected, although

the balance of respondents also suggested that they had been revised down slightly.

A48 Contacts had reported a strong pick-up in construction activity in recent weeks, making up

for delays due to poor weather in earlier months.  Most contacts had continued to suggest that

underlying confidence and expectations regarding future construction activity remained robust.

Moreover, some Agencies had noted that earlier expectations of a pick-up in public sector

construction were now beginning to be realised.


-----

11

A49 Growth in business services had remained strong in almost all regions, although growth

continued to slow from the beginning of the year, mostly as a result of weaker corporate finance and

telecommunications activity. Growth in consumer services had also eased slightly. Reports from

tourism-related contacts in some areas had suggested a downturn in activity in recent weeks as a

result of foot and mouth disease. Many contacts were particularly concerned that demand from

overseas visitors could be affected for some time.

A50 Comments from farming contacts had been dominated by the impact of foot and mouth

disease. Many Agents mentioned that signs before the outbreak that confidence in the sector was

beginning to improve had now been reversed. In addition to the direct impact on meat production,

Agencies reported that many businesses further up the supply chain had been significantly affected

(such as abattoirs, hauliers, feedstock suppliers, etc).

A51 Materials cost inflation had continued to ease back recently, though there had been more

reports of concerns regarding administrative/regulation costs. In most cases, manufacturing output

prices were now broadly flat, although there had been increased reports of price increases by some

firms.

A52 Although conditions in the labour market had remained tight, some Agencies had noted early

signs of an easing in shortages in some sectors.  Despite continued upward drift in some wage

settlements, most contacts had suggested that the total wage bill remained under control. Recent

comments had suggested that the overall impact at a national level of the announcement of a 10%

rise in the national minimum wage from October was likely to be small.

**VII  Market intelligence**

A53 Expectations of official interest rates, as implied by short sterling futures, had fallen sharply

since the Committee’s previous meeting, by around 30-45 basis points. This reflected the slowdown

in the world economy, and in particular the United States, together with falls in equity prices both in

the United Kingdom and overseas, weaker-than-expected average earnings data and the uncertain

impact of foot and mouth disease on the UK economy. Some market participants were now

expecting official rates to fall to 5% by 2001 Q3. A similar picture emerged using forward interest

rates implied by gilts. But while traders seemed to be expecting a reduction of 25 basis points at the


-----

12

Committee’s next meeting, a recent Reuters survey of interest rate expectations suggested that

private sector economists’ views on the future path of UK official interest rates were more diverse.

Although forecasts for the level of official rates had softened slightly since the previous survey,

economists attached a mean probability of only just over 50% to a rate reduction at the Committee’s

April meeting.

A54 The sterling ERI had been broadly stable since the Committee’s previous meeting, rising by

0.5% to 105.0. Implied volatilities were now at their lowest level since January 2000. The slight

appreciation of the sterling ERI had coincided with a depreciation of the euro against the dollar. The

dollar had remained strong (the dollar ERI was now at its highest level since 1986) despite falls in

US official interest rates and a decline in both the volume and value of cross-border mergers and

acquisition activity. More recent data had suggested that US equity markets were still experiencing

net capital inflows, although at a more moderate pace than during 2000 Q4.
