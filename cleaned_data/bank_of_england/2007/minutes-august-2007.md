#### MINUTES OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 1-2 AUGUST 2007

1 Before turning to its immediate policy decision, and against the background of its latest

projections for output and inflation, the Committee discussed financial markets developments; the

international economy; money, credit, demand and output; and costs and prices.

**Financial markets**

2 At its previous meeting, the Committee had noted, in the light of concerns about the US sub
prime mortgage market, that risk premia on a range of assets had been unusually compressed for some

years, and, if these returned towards previous levels, there was a risk that many asset prices might fall,

which could have implications for consumption and investment.

3 The main news this month in financial markets had been the sharp deterioration in credit markets

and the associated falls in equity prices and changes in market interest rates. A trigger for this

turbulence appeared to be renewed concerns about the US sub-prime mortgage market, the losses of

some prominent hedge funds, and the revisions to the ratings of some mortgage-backed securities; this

had led to a reduction in demand for products such as sub-prime mortgage-backed securities and

collateralised debt obligations. The movements in markets for sub-prime securities had spread to

corporate credit yields, although corporate default rates remained very low, and particularly to the

leveraged loan markets and collateralised loan obligations. Contributing to that had been nervousness

about the robustness of rating agency assessments of securitised products more generally. There had

been a far less pronounced widening of spreads on lower-rated mortgage-backed securities in the

United Kingdom. Conditions in the leveraged loan and wider corporate credit markets were described

by market contacts as illiquid, and investment banks would have to hold the large number of deals in

the pipeline for longer. It might take a while for all the effects to work through as further downgrades

were made and losses were recognised on instruments that were not frequently traded.

4 The Committee also noted that yields on risk-free assets had declined somewhat. So the rise in

yields on some riskier assets had not been quite as much as the rise in spreads. But not all of the

adjustment might be taking place in yields. It was possible that the quantity of credit – from banks and

capital markets – might also be reduced by more than the fall induced by the observed change in

market yields alone.

5 It was not clear how far the downturn in financial markets would go, nor how long it would

persist. To date, the movements amounted to a sharp correction of the unusual compression of credit

spreads, which had been a source of concern for some time. If it stopped at that, the macroeconomic

effects of events could be limited, and were likely to be more pronounced in the United States than

elsewhere. If the movements gathered momentum, however, there could be a more marked effect on

the wider economy.

6 Equity prices had fallen sharply towards the end of the month, with the FTSE All-Share, Euro

Stoxx and S&P 500 all declining by around 4-6%. The falls in equity prices had been broadly based.

In the case of the FTSE, the late-July falls had unwound all of the gains recorded since the beginning

of the year. Given that risk-free interest rates had fallen, that suggested that the decline in equity

prices might be ascribed to either heightened perceptions of risk, a removal of the takeover premium or

downward revisions to expected earnings. However, there was, as yet, little evidence of a fall in

expected earnings.

7 Short-term market interest rates had fallen by around 15-35 basis points in the United Kingdom,

the United States and the euro area. A further rise in Bank Rate was no longer fully priced into the

market by the end of the year, and, although 60% of City economists responding to a Reuters poll

expected a further rise in Bank Rate by the end of the year, none thought it would occur this month.

There had been steeper falls further along the yield curve, mostly accounted for by falls in real interest

rates. Despite the recent falls, forward interest rates some twelve to eighteen months ahead had

remained around 20-30 basis points higher than at the time of the May Inflation Report.

8 The sterling effective exchange rate index had appreciated a little over the first part of the month,

but had fallen back by the time of the meeting. The dollar had depreciated over the month as a whole.

**The international economy**

9 Aside from the developments in financial markets, there had been relatively little news on the

international economy since the previous meeting. In the euro area, estimated GDP growth in Q1 had

been revised up slightly to 0.7%, reflecting upward revisions to consumption and net trade, partly

offset by downward revisions to investment and stockbuilding. The broad pattern of the expenditure

breakdown of GDP growth had remained unchanged.

10 Beyond the first quarter, the Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) pointed to growth in the

second quarter in the euro area at a similar rate to the first, although the monthly industrial production

and expenditure indicators implied a rather weaker figure. There were declines in both the

manufacturing PMI and the flash estimate for the service sector in July. As yet, there had been little

sign of the diminishing margin of spare capacity pushing up on inflation, with euro-area HICP

inflation edging down to 1.8% in July.

11 In the United States, there had been substantial downward revisions to the estimated level of

GDP for the previous three years. But Q2 GDP growth of 0.8% had been broadly as expected. Non
residential investment had strengthened, and the previous quarter’s weakness in net trade had

unwound. Consumption growth had been subdued, but that might reflect the squeeze on real incomes

from the rise in petrol prices, following a temporary shortage of refining capacity. However, some

commentators had become more pessimistic, particularly about the housing market, where the unsold

stock of new dwellings had risen substantially in recent months. Annual CPI inflation had been

unchanged in June, but the Federal Reserve’s preferred core inflation measure based on the personal

consumption expenditures deflator had fallen slightly.

12 Turning to Asia, four-quarter GDP growth in China had been estimated to have increased to

almost 12% in the second quarter. The monthly indicators in Japan, however, had continued to point

to some slackening in growth in the second quarter. Elsewhere, activity had seemed to be generally

strong in the Middle East and Africa.

13 Spot oil prices had risen on the month by around 2-3% in sterling terms. But futures prices had

been little changed, suggesting that the rise in spot prices was expected to be temporary. The bigger

question was whether the underlying upward trend in oil and other commodity prices was set to


-----

continue, or reverse. That rise in oil and other commodity prices probably reflected the rapid growth

of the global economy pushing up on commodity demand in the face of short-term inelastic supply.

The rise in prices should eventually induce an expansion of supply capacity. However, the latest

projections for the oil market from the International Energy Agency suggested that, if anything, the

gap between available supply and demand would fall further over the next few years.

**Money, credit, demand and output**

14 The Committee then turned to domestic demand, and the question of whether any deceleration

was visible in response to the previous increases in Bank Rate. Retail sales had risen by 1.1% in Q2,

but that had partly reflected the weakness of spending in the first quarter. The average monthly growth

rate over the past three months had been below 0.2%, suggesting that some slowing in household

spending growth might be taking place. However, the monthly data were volatile and the correlation

of retail sales with overall consumption was not strong. Early, and uncertain, estimates of the growth

of distribution, hotels and catering output suggested a slowing in Q2; this might provide some

corroborative evidence, as a similar development had signalled the slowdown in consumption growth

in 2004-05. Further evidence of some softening in consumption growth in recent months had come

from the CBI Distributive Trades Survey and reports from the Bank’s regional Agents.

15 The evidence from the housing market still seemed to be consistent with a gentle slowing. The

Nationwide house price index had risen by just 0.1% in July, while the Halifax index had risen by

0.7%. A preview of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors survey had shown a fall in the price

balances in July. Mortgage approvals had held up in June, but might have been influenced by the

introduction of Home Information Packs. More forward-looking indicators, such as the Home

Builders Federation site visitors and net reservations balances, continued to point to further slowing.

16 The latest investment indicators had remained strong. Although the British Chambers of

Commerce (BCC) measure of investment intentions for the service sector had edged down in the

second quarter, they had risen sharply for the manufacturing sector. The CBI Industrial Trends Survey

had also shown an increase in investment intentions. By contrast, commercial property yields were

currently below the cost of funds and there seemed to be a considerable amount of office building in

the pipeline. The latest CBI and BCC surveys suggested that export orders had remained relatively

strong.

17 Aside from the financial market risks to activity, there was little news in the latest monthly data

on money and credit. The M4 growth rate had slowed to 12.9% in the year to June, while M4 lending

(excluding securitisations) had risen by 13.5% over the same period.

18 Turning to output, the provisional estimate of Q2 GDP growth had been a little weaker than

expected last month, at 0.8%. This was the sixth consecutive quarter in the 0.7-0.8% range. The four
quarter growth rate was 3.0%. Market sector output growth had been rising more strongly than GDP

growth.

19 Some of the pickup in recorded GDP growth between the first and second quarters had reflected

temporary factors affecting manufacturing output. Aircraft production had boosted manufacturing

output in 2006, but dipped sharply in the first quarter, while recorded shipbuilding output had pushed

up in the second quarter. Those temporary factors should abate in the third quarter, which would

therefore reduce manufacturing output growth. The manufacturing CIPS/NTC activity index edged up

in July, while the new orders index rose more strongly. But there had been a decline in the activity

balances of the CBI Industrial Trends Survey. For services, the CIPS/NTC activity and new orders

indices both fell, and the activity index, although well above its neutral level of 50, had been at its

lowest since the previous autumn.

20 The recent floods would have depressed agricultural output and curtailed output of some other

lines of business, such as tourism and leisure services. There could also have been indirect effects as a

result, for example, of travel disruption. Similarly, there could have been depressing effects on

consumers’ expenditure, although that might simply be offset by involuntary stockbuilding by

retailers. Moreover, consumers might make up for any reduction in spending later in the year, or by

spending more elsewhere. In addition, output and expenditure should eventually be boosted by

reconstruction activity and the replacement of damaged property.

**Costs and prices**

21 The Labour Force Survey measure of employment had risen by 93,000 in the three months to

May compared with the previous three months, reversing the downward trend observed over the


-----

6

previous few months. Unemployment had fallen by 35,000, and had been sufficient to edge the

unemployment rate down to 5.4%.

22 Pay settlements in the twelve months to June had averaged 3.2%. Annual pay growth, according

to the Average Earnings Index (AEI), had fallen back in the three months to May, both including and

excluding bonuses. Annual pay growth on the experimental Average Weekly Earnings (AWE)

measure remained around a percentage point higher than the AEI growth rate. According to a

reconciliation table published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), a significant part of the

difference in early 2007 had been accounted for by the different treatment of outlying observations,

although other factors had been important in earlier periods. It remained difficult to know which

earnings measure to put most weight on. The ONS were continuing to do further work to extend the

analysis, by adding to the detail and assessing the sensitivity of the results.

23 Manufacturing input price inflation had picked up slightly to 2.1% in June, partly reflecting

higher oil prices. The CIPS/NTC survey had suggested that manufacturing input price pressures

intensified in July. However, the CIPS/NTC input price index for services had declined a little.

24 The fraction of firms working at full capacity had risen in the CBI Industrial Trends Survey, and

more firms had reported that capacity was a constraint on output. By contrast, capacity utilisation

balances had declined for both manufacturing and service sector companies in the BCC survey. The

picture from the manufacturing surveys on output prices was mixed this month, while the CIPS/NTC

services output price index had fallen.

25 CPI inflation had fallen to 2.4% in June. The near-term outlook remained somewhat uncertain,

particularly given the recent volatility in food, household goods and utility prices. For example, the

recent poor weather and flooding might lead to upward pressure on wholesale food prices. But the size

and timing of any effect at the retail level was difficult to gauge, especially given the decline in food

inflation in recent months.

**The August GDP growth and inflation projections**

26 The Committee reached its policy decision in the light of the projections to be published in the

_Inflation Report on Wednesday 8 August._

27 Conditional on market participants’ expected path of interest rates, and using current ONS

estimates of recent GDP growth, the Committee’s central projection was for UK output growth to

moderate to around its long-term average, as consumer spending and business investment decelerated

in the near term and public spending growth eased further ahead. The GDP profile in the August

_Report was somewhat weaker than in May, reflecting the rise in interest rates and the exchange rate._

Judging by the past pattern of revisions and indicators from business surveys, the Committee

considered it likely that recorded output growth in recent quarters would eventually be revised up.

28 The Committee’s central projection was for inflation to fall back during the second half of this

year, and to settle around the 2% target. Compared with the corresponding projection in the May

_Report, the profile was a little higher in the near term, reflecting higher oil prices and a slightly smaller_

margin of spare capacity in the economy. Further out, it was marginally lower, reflecting the weaker

projections for output growth.

29 There were substantial uncertainties surrounding these projections. These included, in particular:

the prospective impact on domestic demand of past increases in Bank Rate and recent developments in

credit markets; the degree of spare capacity in businesses and the labour market; the likely duration of

the global expansion, and its implications for world prices; and the evolution of inflation expectations.

There remained a greater-than-usual uncertainty about the outlook for inflation, as in May. Overall,

the risks to growth were judged to be balanced. The risks to inflation were weighted slightly to the

upside in the medium term. There was a range of views on the Committee about both the central

projection and the balance of risks.

**The immediate policy decision**

30 There was little, if any, expectation in the markets of a change in Bank Rate this month. The

main news had been the substantial volatility in financial and credit markets in recent days. It was too

early to know whether these movements would be sustained or go further. The changes in equity

prices, yield curves and exchange rates had been factored into the latest Inflation Report projections.

But it was unclear whether, beyond these narrow asset price effects, there would be more substantial

real effects on the economy in the United States, or on the rest of the world. Moreover, it might take

time to see the full extent of these shocks, and for financial market prices to reach new equilibria. At

present, members largely viewed the credit market developments as posing a risk to their projections

for output and inflation, rather than a factor directly influencing their central view. The Committee

would want to monitor closely data on both the price and quantity of credit over the coming period in

order to assess this risk.

31 The world economy had continued to grow briskly. The central assumption was for somewhat

slower UK-weighted world growth in future years, but there were risks in both directions. It remained

particularly difficult to weigh the risks around euro-area consumption growth, and around residential

investment in the United States. The recent strength of the global economy had underpinned the

continuing rises in oil and commodity prices, which were feeding through to the UK’s terms of trade

and could pose an upside risk to inflation.

32 Turning to domestic demand, it was still too early to be confident whether the signs of softening

in some UK consumption indicators were a reaction to the past increases in Bank Rate, or simply

reflected volatility – including unusual weather – with underlying household spending being resilient.

Different members placed different weights on the evidence from the ONS data, the surveys and the

reports from the Bank’s regional Agents. The housing market showed signs of softening this month.

Although business investment had fallen in the first quarter, the surveys suggested that intentions

remained robust in the near term. But, further ahead, investment might also be expected to respond to

the past rises in Bank Rate and recent credit market turbulence.

33 The latest Q2 GDP data had been slightly weaker than anticipated. Although there was a range

of views, the Committee thought that, on balance, estimated output growth was likely to be revised up.

The key issue was by how much growth would slow, given past increases in Bank Rate, and when and

whether that would be sufficient to keep inflation close to the target, since it was not only the size of

the gap between potential supply and demand that mattered, but how that translated into pressure on

inflation.

34 Employment had strengthened in the latest data, and so had lessened somewhat the previous

puzzle of weak employment in the face of robust output growth. There was a range of views about the

margin of spare capacity in the labour market. Survey measures of capacity utilisation within

businesses remained elevated. While some of the output price surveys had eased over the past month,


-----

a number remained above their historical average. Some members thought that these factors remained

an upside risk to inflation.

35 CPI inflation had continued to return towards the target in June, reducing the probability that

inflation expectations would become dislodged. But the near-term outlook was still clouded with

uncertainty, particularly about the path of household goods, food and utility prices. Given the

experience of rising inflation last winter, and the fact that other measures of inflation – such as RPI

and RPIX – remained high, there was a risk that inflation expectations would be particularly sensitive

to further adverse cost shocks. Although there were still more effects to come from the recent rise in

oil prices, some of the earlier rises in energy prices had now largely fed through to retail prices. So it

was possible that there would be a somewhat clearer view of the relationship between the gap between

demand and potential supply and the outlook for inflation than there had been in the recent past.

36 Given all of the above factors, and in the light of the projections for output and inflation,

Committee members favoured leaving Bank Rate unchanged. There was a range of views about the

risks to inflation and growth. The future path of Bank Rate would depend on the evidence in the

months ahead about whether and how the risks were crystallising; most members emphasised that

they had no firm view on whether rates would need to rise further.

37 The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that Bank Rate should be

maintained at 5.75%. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the proposition.

Rachel Lomax, Deputy Governor responsible for monetary policy
