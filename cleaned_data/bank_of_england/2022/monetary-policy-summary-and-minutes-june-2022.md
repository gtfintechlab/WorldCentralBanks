## Monetary Policy Summary, June 2022

The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet
the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At
its meeting ending on 15 June 2022, the MPC voted by a majority of 6-3 to increase
Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 1.25%. Those members in the minority
preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 1.5%.

In the MPC’s central projections in the May Monetary Policy Report, UK GDP growth
was expected to slow sharply over the first half of the forecast period and, although the
labour market was expected to tighten slightly further in the near term, the
unemployment rate was projected to rise to 5½% in three years’ time. CPI inflation was
expected to average slightly over 10% at its peak in 2022 Q4. Conditioned on the rising
market-implied path for Bank Rate at that time and the MPC’s forecasting convention for
future energy prices, CPI inflation was projected to fall to a little above the 2% target in
two years’ time, largely reflecting the waning influence of external factors, and to be well
below the target in three years, mainly reflecting weaker domestic pressures. The risks
to the inflation projection were judged to be skewed to the upside at these points.

There has been relatively little news in global and domestic economic data since the
May Report, although there have been significant movements in financial markets. UKweighted global growth in 2022 Q2 appears to be broadly in line with expectations.
Global inflationary pressures have remained elevated and oil prices have risen further.
Equity markets have ended the period lower, while short and longer-term government
bond yields have continued to rise.

UK GDP was weaker than expected in April, partly reflecting a further decline in Test
and Trace activity. Bank staff now expect GDP to fall by 0.3% in the second quarter as
a whole, weaker than anticipated at the time of the May Report. Consumer confidence
has fallen further, but other indicators of household spending appear to have held up.
Some indicators of business sentiment have weakened, although they have so far
remained more resilient than indicators of consumer confidence and consistent with
positive underlying GDP growth.

In the three months to April, the unemployment rate was 3.8% and employment grew by
0.5%. The inactivity rate has declined a little over recent months but is still higher than
immediately before the pandemic. Recruitment difficulties have remained elevated and
labour demand has remained strong. Underlying nominal earnings growth has also
remained strong, and the Bank’s Agents report that bonus payments have been used to


-----

address recruitment and retention difficulties. All of these indicators remain consistent
with a tight labour market.

Initial Bank staff analysis of the Government’s recent Cost of Living Support package
suggests that, all else equal, it could boost GDP by around 0.3% and raise CPI inflation
by 0.1 percentage points in the first year, with some upside risks around these
estimates given the targeted and front-loaded nature of some of the measures.

Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from 7.0% in March to 9.0% in April, close to
expectations at the time of the May Report, and triggering the exchange of open letters
between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that is being published
alongside this monetary policy announcement. Inflation’s overshoot of the 2% target
mainly reflects previous large increases in global energy and other tradable goods
prices. The former has been greatly exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, which has also
raised significantly the wholesale price of many agricultural commodities. The latter
mainly reflects the impact of the pandemic, which shifted demand towards goods but
also impaired and disrupted supply chains.

However, not all of the excess inflation can be attributed to global events. There has
also been a role for interactions with domestic factors, including the tight labour market
and the pricing strategies of firms. Consumer services price inflation, which is more
influenced by domestic costs than goods price inflation, has strengthened in recent
months. In addition, core consumer goods price inflation is higher in the United
Kingdom than in the euro area and in the United States.

CPI inflation is expected to be over 9% during the next few months and to rise to slightly
above 11% in October. The increase in October reflects higher projected household
energy prices following a prospective additional large increase in the Ofgem price cap.

In the MPC’s latest forecasts in May, upward pressure on CPI inflation was expected to
dissipate over time. In the main, this reflected the stabilisation of the prices of
commodities, albeit at elevated levels, and other tradable goods. It also reflected the
combined impact of weaker real incomes and tighter monetary policy on domestic
demand. Monetary policy is also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations
are anchored at the 2% target.

The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the
primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also
recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a
result of shocks and disturbances. The economy has recently been subject to a
succession of very large shocks. Monetary policy will ensure that, as the adjustment to


-----

these shocks occurs, CPI inflation will return to the 2% target sustainably in the medium
term, while minimising undesirable volatility in output.

In view of continuing signs of robust cost and price pressures, including the current
tightness of the labour market, and the risk that those pressures become more
persistent, the Committee voted to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to
1.25%, at this meeting.

The MPC will take the actions necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably
in the medium term, in line with its remit. The scale, pace and timing of any further
increases in Bank Rate will reflect the Committee’s assessment of the economic outlook
and inflationary pressures. The Committee will be particularly alert to indications of
more persistent inflationary pressures, and will if necessary act forcefully in response.

## Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee

 meeting ending on 15 June 2022

1. Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the
international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and
supply, costs and prices.

### The international economy

2. UK-weighted global growth in 2022 Q2 appeared to be broadly in line with
expectations at the time of the May Monetary Policy Report. Global inflationary
pressures had remained elevated.

3. GDP growth rates in the euro area and in the United States were likely to be
marginally stronger in 2022 Q2 than in the May Report, with quarterly rates of 0.3% and
0.8% now expected respectively. Business and particularly consumer confidence had
fallen back in both regions since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, although some sentiment
indicators had shown signs of stabilising in the euro area in May. The euro-area
unemployment rate had remained unchanged at a record low of 6.8% in April, while the
US unemployment rate had held steady at 3.6% in May, close to pre-pandemic levels.

4. China had experienced Covid-19 (Covid) outbreaks in major cities over recent
months, and the authorities had imposed strict regional lockdowns to control the spread
of the virus. In part reflecting those developments, Chinese activity data had been
weaker in April than had been anticipated at the time of the May Report, and Bank staff
now expected the level of GDP to be broadly flat in 2022 Q2 compared with the 0.8%
quarterly growth that had been incorporated in the May Report. The slowdown had
continued to be most marked in indicators of consumption. Industrial production had
also seen a decline, albeit somewhat smaller relative to the strictness of the lockdowns,
as some companies had continued to operate via so-called closed-loop production
systems. Continued weakness in the property sector had weighed on fixed investment.
Activity was expected to recover as some Covid restrictions had started to be lifted
more recently. PMI indicators in May had shown a slowing in the rate of contraction,
and indicators of supply constraints had started to ease somewhat, with Shanghai’s
major port operating closer to capacity.

5. Developments in commodity prices had been mixed since the MPC’s previous
meeting. The spot price of Brent crude oil had increased by around 15% to $120 per
barrel. European gas prices had ended the period little changed, with the Dutch Title
Transfer Facility spot price, a measure of prices in the continental wholesale market, at


-----

around €100 per MWh. Agricultural commodity and metals prices had been volatile,
and they were now down slightly since the MPC’s previous meeting though still at
elevated levels.

6. Euro-area annual HICP inflation had increased to 8.1% in May according to the
flash release, with core inflation at 3.8%, both of which had been stronger than market
expectations. US annual CPI inflation had rebounded to 8.6% in May, also above
market expectations, while core inflation had fallen slightly to 6.0%. The headline US
CPI figure was consistent with annual PCE inflation remaining stable at 6.3%.
Indicators of wage growth had stabilised at elevated levels over recent months in the
United States and risen in the euro area.

### Monetary and financial conditions

7. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, government bond yields and risky asset prices
had been volatile in major advanced economies. Ten-year government bond yields had
risen by around 40, 55 and 75 basis points in the United States, United Kingdom and
Germany respectively. Equity indices in the major advanced economies had fallen
since the MPC’s previous meeting, with large declines in the S&P 500 and the Euro
Stoxx 50. Spreads on advanced economy corporate bonds had also widened over
recent days.

8. The near-term path for market-implied policy rates in the United States and in the
euro area had risen significantly since the MPC’s previous meeting, reaching around
3.6% and 1.3% respectively by end-2022. At its meeting on 9 June, the ECB Governing
Council had decided to end net asset purchases under its asset purchase programme
as of 1 July 2022 and had left its key policy interest rates unchanged. As set out in the
accompanying statement, the Governing Council had also concluded that the
conditions, according to its forward guidance, for starting to raise the key ECB interest
rates had been satisfied. Therefore, the Governing Council was intending to raise these
rates by 0.25% at its July monetary policy meeting. Looking further ahead, the
Governing Council was expecting to raise them again in September. The calibration of
this rate increase would depend on the updated medium-term inflation outlook and, if
the medium-term inflation outlook persisted or deteriorated, the Governing Council had
indicated that a larger increment would be appropriate.

9. In the United Kingdom, market pricing indicated an expectation of an increase of
0.25 percentage points in Bank Rate, to 1.25%, at this MPC meeting. The marketimplied path for Bank Rate had risen materially since the MPC’s previous meeting,
reaching around 2.9% by end-2022 and peaking at 3.3% in 2023. This path continued
to be higher than the expectations for Bank Rate of respondents to the Bank’s latest


-----

Market Participants Survey, perhaps in part reflecting upside risks to the inflation
outlook domestically and internationally.

10. The sterling effective exchange rate had depreciated by around 2½% since the
previous MPC meeting and by almost 4% compared to the 15-day moving average on
which the May Monetary Policy Report projections had been conditioned. Sterling had
been particularly weak against the US dollar. According to market participants, the
recent movements had in part reflected the rising yield differential between shorter-term
government bond yields in the United States compared to those in the United Kingdom,
and perceptions of the UK growth outlook.

11. Lending rates for new mortgages in the United Kingdom had increased further in
May, reflecting a continuing response to the increases in Bank Rate and risk-free
market rates that had been observed since the autumn of 2021. Lending rates on
mortgages with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at or below 75% had risen by more than
those at higher LTV ratios, such that the spread between the two had narrowed to
below pre-pandemic levels. Interest rates on unsecured borrowing had also increased
slightly overall. As usual, however, households’ unsecured lending rates had continued
to be less sensitive to changes in risk-free rates. Rates on new lending to businesses
were higher in April than in December 2021, reflecting the increases in Bank Rate.

12. Taking together all of the evidence so far, the pass-through of the increases in riskfree rates to mortgage rates since the autumn of 2021 had been greater than in 2017-18
and much closer to the full pass-through that was seen prior to the financial crisis when
interest rates had been further away from the lower bound. Interest rates on instantaccess deposits had also increased since last autumn, though by much less than for
mortgage lending. The further increases in risk-free rates that had occurred since the
May MPC meeting would be expected to feed through to lending and deposit rates in
due course.

### Demand and output

13. According to the ONS’s first quarterly estimate, UK GDP had increased by 0.8% in
2022 Q1, slightly below the expectations incorporated into the May Monetary Policy
Report projection. Within the expenditure components, household consumption had
risen by 0.4% on the quarter and business investment, which was often subject to
substantial revision, had fallen by 0.5%. Total government expenditure had risen by
1.5%.

14. Monthly GDP had fallen by 0.1% in March and by 0.3% in April, the latter weaker
than expectations. Government services output had fallen significantly in April, as NHS
Test and Trace activity had continued to decline. Manufacturing output had also fallen,


-----

below expectations at the time of the May Report. Output in consumer-facing services
had risen by 2.2% in April, broadly in line with expectations.

15. Bank staff now expected GDP to fall by 0.3% in 2022 Q2, below the May Report
projection of 0.1% growth. The downside news had reflected a larger than expected
impact from the scaling back of Test and Trace activity in April, alongside weaker than
expected market sector output growth. Relative to 2022 Q1, the slowing in growth was
still expected primarily to reflect temporary factors such as the additional bank holiday
for the Platinum Jubilee as well as the anticipated fall in Test and Trace activity.
Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents suggested that, although there had been some
early signs of a slowing in underlying growth, demand had remained mostly robust and
broadly in line with projections at the time of the May Report.

16. There had been mixed signs on the extent to which the squeeze on real disposable
incomes was weighing on household sentiment and spending. GfK consumer
confidence had fallen further in May, to below the previous low point for the series in
mid-2008. That weakness had been broad-based across backward and forward-looking
sub-balances that fed into the headline confidence indicator. Other indicators of
consumer spending had held up, however. Retail sales volumes had increased by
1.4% in April, following a decline of 1.2% in March. Faster indicators of spending had
also suggested a continued recovery in previously subdued areas of consumer
services, such as international travel, and resilience in other areas, such as restaurant
reservations. Indicators of house prices had remained robust in the recent period and
housing activity had fallen back.

17. Some indicators of corporate sector sentiment had weakened since the MPC’s
previous meeting, although they had remained more resilient than indicators of
consumer confidence and, based on pre-Covid relationships, were consistent with
positive underlying GDP growth. The S&P Global/CIPS PMI composite output index
had fallen in May, but had remained around its long-run average level. The composite
output expectations series had also fallen. Other business survey indicators had
continued to hold up. The CBI reported output balance and Lloyds trading expectations
balance had both shown little change on the month. In addition, expected sales over
the year ahead had remained strong in the May Decision Maker Panel results, although
this indicator had fallen back somewhat over recent months. According to contacts of
the Bank’s Agents, growth had continued to be held back by supply chain disruptions,
although companies were increasingly taking measures to alleviate the effects of these
disruptions, for example by using alternative inputs and holding more stock.

18. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had announced a £15 billion Cost of Living
Support package on 26 May. This had included: a direct one-off payment of £650 for
households on means-tested benefits; a payment of £300 to pensioners; and a £150


-----

payment to people on disability benefits. There had been a doubling of the universal
rebate through the Energy Bills Support Scheme, providing an additional £200 to
households. The Chancellor had also announced that the original £200 rebate would
no longer have to be repaid in subsequent years. The announced measures took effect
over the second half of this year, with additional payments for households receiving
means-tested benefits starting as soon as July. The payments to benefit recipients
were skewed towards people on lower incomes.

19. Taken together, and using standard fiscal multipliers, initial Bank staff analysis
suggested that these measures were likely to boost GDP by around 0.3% and raise CPI
inflation by 0.1 percentage points in the first year, with some upside risks around these
estimates given the targeted and front-loaded nature of some of the measures. Bank
staff would conduct a detailed assessment of the new measures ahead of the August
Monetary Policy Report.

### Supply, costs and prices

20. Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen to 9.0% in April, close to the May Monetary
Policy Report projection. Energy and core goods inflation had continued to account for
around 80% of the overshoot of CPI inflation relative to the 2% target. Food and
services inflation had risen further and accounted for the remainder of the overshoot,
with an increasing contribution from services prices, which was partly due to the
restoration of the 20% VAT rate on the hospitality sector’s sales. Core CPI inflation,
excluding food, beverages, tobacco and energy, had risen to 6.2%. The April CPI
release had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes.

21. Higher inflation rates had become more widespread within the CPI basket. The
inflation rates of around nine tenths of the 85 class level categories by weight in the CPI
basket had been above their pre-pandemic averages in April, compared to around half
in the summer of 2021.

22. The Committee discussed the strength of UK inflation from a cross-country
perspective. Rates of consumer price inflation in the euro area and in the United States
had also been elevated during the first half of this year. Based on a component level
comparison, the Committee noted that energy price inflation had pushed up on
measures of headline consumer price inflation to a similar extent in both the United
Kingdom and the euro area, consistent with those regions’ greater exposure to
European wholesale gas price increases, with a smaller effect in the United States.
Core goods price inflation had been stronger in the United Kingdom than in other
regions recently. It had risen to 8.0% in April, compared to 3.8% in the euro area for the
same month and 6.4%, on the PCE measure, in the United States. The strength of food


-----

price inflation across the three economies had been similar in the latest data, partly
reflecting the importance of global developments for agricultural prices. Services price
inflation, which reflected domestic labour market conditions to a greater extent than
other components of inflation, had been stronger in the United Kingdom and in the
United States than in the euro area.

23. CPI inflation was expected to rise somewhat further in the near term, to just under
10% in September, reflecting higher food, core goods and services price inflation. The
recent increase in oil prices would also push up on inflation relative to the May Report
projection, by around a quarter of a percentage point. Core CPI inflation was expected
to rise to just under 7% by September.

24. CPI inflation was then expected to rise to slightly above 11% in October, slightly
higher than the monthly peak consistent with the May Report. The projected increase
between September and October was expected to be due largely to the next reset of
Ofgem’s utility price cap. If sustained, the latest wholesale gas futures prices would
mean around a 40% increase in the utility price cap in October, similar to the
expectation at the time of the May Report. Over two-thirds of the six-month observation
window relevant for the reset of the October cap had now passed. Following the recent
consultation, Ofgem’s decision on whether to increase the frequency at which the cap
was reset was forthcoming. One outcome could be around a three-week extension to
the current observation window, which provided some additional uncertainty around the
magnitude of the increases in utility prices in October. For the period beyond October,
staff estimates suggested that resetting the price cap on a quarterly, rather than semiannual basis, had only modest implications for the CPI inflation projections, given the
latest wholesale gas price futures curve.

25. The Government’s Cost of Living Support package had included a doubling of the
universal rebate to households, which was due to take effect from October. The ONS’s
announcement on the treatment of this rebate in economic statistics, including
consumer prices, was forthcoming.

26. Survey indicators of cost and prices had remained elevated. The S&P Global/CIPS
PMI composite input price index had risen to a record high level in May. The
corresponding composite output price index had remained close to its record high.
Contacts of the Bank’s Agents had reported that manufacturing and services companies
had continued to face elevated input prices, which businesses had continued to pass
onto their prices in order to protect their margins.

27. Short-term measures of inflation expectations across households, businesses and
financial markets had remained substantially elevated relative to their historic averages.
The Bank/Ipsos and Citi/YouGov measures of households’ one-year ahead inflation


-----

expectations had been close to their record high levels recently. The Decision Maker
Panel had reported a further increase in expectations for businesses’ year-ahead output
price inflation, to 5.9% in the three months to May.

28. Medium to longer-term measures of inflation expectations had not been as elevated
as their short-term counterparts, although they had, nevertheless, remained above their
historic averages. Within this latter set of indicators, inflation compensation measures
in financial markets had fallen modestly, but they had remained well above their
average levels of the past decade. The expectations of professional forecasters
reported in HM Treasury’s May survey had risen to around ½ percentage point above
the inflation target of 2% at the two to three-year ahead horizons. However, this shift in
the mean appeared to be due largely to the effect of a substantial upward revision by a
single forecaster. The median of the distribution had remained close to 2% at these
forecast horizons. The Committee would continue to monitor measures of inflation
expectations very closely.

29. The ONS’s reweighting of the Labour Force Survey (LFS) with new population
estimates had changed only marginally the composition of the labour market. In the
three months to April, the unemployment rate was 3.8%, equal to its pre-pandemic
trough and slightly lower than in the three months to January. LFS employment had
grown strongly, by 0.5%. The inactivity rate had declined a little over recent months but
was still higher than immediately before the pandemic. These labour market
developments had been broadly consistent with the expectations made at the time of
the May Report and with a tight labour market. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs
(HMRC) employee payrolls had risen by a further 90,000 in May, although these initial
estimates had tended to be revised down somewhat subsequently.

30. Labour demand indicators had remained strong, alongside evidence of persistently
elevated recruitment difficulties. The stock of vacancies had risen further, to 1.3 million
in the three months to May. The vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, a measure of labour
market tightness, remained elevated, within which the stock of vacancies was now
broadly equal to the stock of unemployed people. Growth in the stock of vacancies had
however slowed, from 5.4% in the three months to February to 1.6% in the three
months to May. Recent employment indicators in business surveys and the REC labour
demand index had remained strong. Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents’ contacts
suggested that hiring intentions had continued to be positive and that recruitment
difficulties had remained severe. Contacts had said that they expected recruitment
difficulties to persist for at least the next twelve months, due to structural shortages of
labour and skills.

31. Recent indicators of nominal pay growth had remained elevated, consistent with the
continued effects of a tightening labour market. Nominal private sector regular AWE


-----

growth had been 4.8% in the three months to April, in line with the expectation at the
time of the May Report. Adjusted for the mechanical effects of the changes in
workforce composition and the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, Bank staff
estimated that underlying nominal private sector regular pay growth had remained
above 4%, also consistent with expectations at the time of the May Report and in
excess of pre-pandemic rates of around 3 to 3½%. HMRC PAYE measures of median
pay growth had been in a range of 4 to 6¼% over recent months, also above prepandemic rates. Recent strong growth in bonus payments had been broad based when
compared to pre-pandemic sectoral averages. The Bank’s Agents’ contacts had
reported that one-off bonus payments had been used to address recruitment and
retention difficulties. Given recent developments in market-sector productivity, these
underlying nominal earnings indicators also appeared to be consistent with elevated
rates of unit wage cost growth.

32. The Bank’s Agents had reported that pay settlements continued to be much higher
than a year ago, with deals averaging just over 5%, a little above the 4.8% expected by
companies in the Agents’ pay survey conducted near the beginning of this year. A
significant minority of companies were considering mid-year top-ups to pay settlements.
This recent intelligence reinforced the upside risk to the MPC’s central projections for
pay growth and domestic price pressures highlighted in the May Report.

### The immediate policy decision

33. The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that
helps to sustain growth and employment.

34. In the MPC’s central projections in the May Monetary Policy Report, UK GDP
growth had been expected to slow sharply over the first half of the forecast period and,
although the labour market had been expected to tighten slightly further in the near
term, the unemployment rate had been projected to rise to 5½% in three years’ time.
CPI inflation had been expected to average slightly over 10% at its peak in 2022 Q4.
Conditioned on the rising market-implied path for Bank Rate at that time and the MPC’s
forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation had been projected to fall
to a little above the 2% target in two years’ time, largely reflecting the waning influence
of external factors, and to be well below the target in three years, mainly reflecting
weaker domestic pressures. The risks to the inflation projection had been judged to be
skewed to the upside at these points.

35. The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the
primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also
recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as
a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy had recently been subject to a


-----

succession of very large shocks. These shocks had pushed global energy and other
tradable goods prices to elevated levels. Those price increases had raised UK inflation
and, since the United Kingdom was a net importer of these items, would necessarily
weigh on most UK households’ real incomes and many UK companies’ real profits.
This real economic adjustment was something monetary policy was unable to prevent.
These global shocks could interact with domestic factors, including the tight labour
market and the pricing strategies of firms, and could lead to more persistent inflationary
pressures. The role of monetary policy was to ensure that, as the adjustment in the real
economy occurred, CPI inflation returned to the 2% target sustainably in the medium
term, while minimising undesirable volatility in output. Monetary policy was also acting
to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target.

36. The latest output, business survey and consumer spending indicators had been
mixed, and, taken together, did not suggest a materially different near-term underlying
growth path to that projected in the May Report. The latest official data continued to
suggest that momentum in labour market activity had been sustained, and there had
been no signs from other timelier indicators of employment of an imminent deterioration.
That was not in itself surprising as changes in labour market activity usually lagged
developments in GDP by one or two quarters, but there was a risk that tightness in the
labour market persisted for longer than expected. The Government’s recent fiscal
package would be incorporated into the MPC’s updated projections for consumer
spending and saving behaviour ahead of the August Report, and there were some
reasons for a slightly bigger boost to growth and inflation than a standard multiplier
framework would suggest. Although CPI inflation in April had been close to the MPC’s
expectations at the time of the May Report, inflationary pressures appeared to have
broadened across the major components of consumer prices, including in the services
sector, and other indicators of cost and price pressures had remained robust. A key
question remained about whether some self-sustaining momentum in domestically
generated inflation would persist even as a margin of slack in the economy was
expected to open up in due course.

37. In view of continuing signs of robust cost and price pressures, including the current
tightness of the labour market, and the risk that those pressures became more
persistent, all members of the Committee judged that an increase in Bank Rate was
warranted at this meeting.

38. Six members of the Committee judged that a further 0.25 percentage point increase
in Bank Rate, to 1.25%, was warranted at this meeting. These members noted that the
economic news overall had been fairly limited relative to the May Report projections.
CPI inflation had been projected to be some way below the 2% target in three years’
time in the May Report, and demand might be starting to slow in line with the May


-----

forecast. But the labour market remained tight and indications of broader domestic
inflationary pressure required a response in order to ensure inflation returned
sustainably to the target in the medium term.

39. Three members preferred a 0.5 percentage point increase in Bank Rate at this
meeting. These members put a higher weight on the prospect of more resilience in
demand or shortfalls in supply or both, such that cost and capacity pressures would
remain relatively strong over the forecast period. These members also judged that
monetary policy should lean strongly against risks that recent trends in pay growth,
firms’ pricing decisions, and inflation expectations in the economy more widely would
become more firmly embedded. Faster policy tightening now would help to bring
inflation back to the target sustainably in the medium term, and reduce the risks of a
more extended and costly tightening cycle later.

40. The MPC would take the actions necessary to return inflation to the 2% target
sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit. The scale, pace and timing of any
further increases in Bank Rate would reflect the Committee’s assessment of the
economic outlook and inflationary pressures. The Committee would be particularly alert
to indications of more persistent inflationary pressures, and would if necessary act
forcefully in response.

41. The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that:

Bank Rate should be increased by 0.25 percentage points, to 1.25%.

42. Six members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Huw Pill, Dave
Ramsden and Silvana Tenreyro) voted in favour of the proposition. Three members
(Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann and Michael Saunders) voted against the
proposition, preferring to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 1.5%.

### Operational considerations

43. As of 15 June 2022, the total stock of assets held in the Asset Purchase Facility
(APF) was £866 billion, comprising £847 billion of UK government bond purchases and
£19.3 billion of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases.

44. Consistent with the Committee’s decision at its February 2022 meeting to begin to
reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases, the £3.2 billion of cash flows
associated with the redemption of the July 2022 gilt held by the APF would not be
reinvested.

45. The following members of the Committee were present:
