## Monetary Policy Summary, March 2024

The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the
2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting
ending on 20 March 2024, the MPC voted by a majority of 8–1 to maintain Bank Rate at
5.25%. One member preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%.

Since the MPC’s previous meeting, market-implied paths for advanced economy policy rates
have shifted up. In the United States and the euro area, inflationary pressures have
continued to abate, though by slightly less than expected. Material risks remain, notably from
developments in the Middle East including disruption to shipping through the Red Sea.

Having declined through the second half of last year, UK GDP and market sector output are
expected to start growing again during the first half of this year. Business surveys remain
consistent with an improving outlook for activity.

The fiscal measures in Spring Budget 2024 are likely to increase the level of GDP by around
¼% over coming years. As the measures will probably also boost potential supply to some
extent, the implications for the output gap, and hence inflationary pressures in the economy,
are likely to be smaller.

Reflecting uncertainties around the ONS’s Labour Force Survey, the Committee is continuing
to consider a wide range of indicators of labour market activity. The labour market has
continued to loosen but remains relatively tight by historical standards. Although still
elevated, nominal wage growth has moderated across a number of measures. Contacts of
the Bank’s Agents continue to expect some decline in pay settlements this year and to report
greater difficulty in passing on cost increases to prices.

Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 3.4% in February from 4.0% in January and December, a
little below the expectation in the February Monetary Policy Report. Services consumer price
inflation has declined but remains elevated, at 6.1% in February. Most indicators of shortterm inflation expectations have continued to ease.

CPI inflation is projected to fall to slightly below the 2% target in 2024 Q2, marginally weaker
than previously expected owing to the freeze in fuel duty announced in the Budget. In the
February Report projection, CPI inflation was expected to increase slightly again in Q3 and
Q4, accounted for by the direct energy price contribution to 12-month inflation. Services price
inflation is expected to fall back gradually.

The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of
price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will
be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and
disturbances. Monetary policy will ensure that CPI inflation returns to the 2% target
sustainably in the medium term.


-----

At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. Headline CPI inflation
has continued to fall back relatively sharply in part owing to base effects and external effects
from energy and goods prices. The restrictive stance of monetary policy is weighing on
activity in the real economy, is leading to a looser labour market and is bearing down on
inflationary pressures. Nonetheless, key indicators of inflation persistence remain elevated.

Monetary policy will need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2%
target sustainably in the medium term in line with the MPC’s remit. The Committee has
judged since last autumn that monetary policy needs to be restrictive for an extended period
of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipates.

The MPC remains prepared to adjust monetary policy as warranted by economic data to
return inflation to the 2% target sustainably. It will therefore continue to monitor closely
indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole,
including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage
growth and services price inflation. On that basis, the Committee will keep under review for
how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level.

## Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee

 meeting ending on 20 March 2024

1. Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the
international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply,
costs and prices.

### The international economy 

2. UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.4% in 2023 Q4, in line with
the projection in the February Monetary Policy Report. The divergence in growth among
advanced economies had continued, with the United States again growing faster than had
been expected.

3. Euro-area GDP had been flat in 2023 Q4, in line with the February Report projection.
Near-term indicators such as PMIs and industrial production had continued to stabilise, but
the recovery was somewhat weaker than had been expected. By contrast, US GDP had
grown by 0.8% in the fourth quarter, higher than had been anticipated in the February Report.
US growth was expected to slow in 2024 Q1, following a weakening in real private
consumption and retail sales growth since the start of the year.

4. In China, GDP had grown by 1.0% in 2023 Q4. Going forward, growth was expected to
remain at around that rate and, in early March, the government had set an annual growth
target of around 5%. Other emerging market economies had seen mixed GDP growth
outturns in the fourth quarter, with India growing particularly strongly. Near-term indicators
suggested that some momentum was persisting into 2024.

5. Despite the conflict in the Middle East and continuing disruption to shipping through the
Red Sea, there had been limited news in energy prices since the MPC’s February meeting.
The Brent spot oil price had increased by around 5% to $87 per barrel as OPEC and other
aligned oil producers were expected to extend production cuts. European wholesale natural
gas spot and near-term futures prices had been broadly flat since the Committee’s February
meeting, as temperatures had remained mild and storage levels high.

6. Labour markets in advanced economies had continued to loosen but had remained tight
overall. The job vacancies rate in particular had continued to decline across countries. The
US unemployment rate had increased to 3.9% in February, while non-farm payrolls had
grown by 275,000 in the same month. The unemployment rate in the euro area had edged
down to 6.4% in January. Wage growth in the euro area and the United States had fallen in
2023 Q4 but data on the outcome of current wage negotiations in the euro area were not yet


-----

available. The gap in wage growth between the United Kingdom on the one hand, and the
euro area and the United States on the other, had continued to narrow as UK wage growth
had declined more quickly recently than wage growth in the other two economies. However,
annual pay growth had remained higher in the United Kingdom.

7. Headline and core consumer price inflation had continued to trend down in the euro area
and the United States since the start of this year. However, February inflation rates in both
regions had been slightly higher than expected by market participants, accounted for by news
in core inflation. In the euro area, headline HICP inflation had been 2.6% in February, and
core inflation 3.1%. In the United States, headline CPI inflation had been 3.2%, and core
inflation 3.8%. Services price inflation had remained elevated in both economies.

8. The Committee discussed some factors that might influence the global long-term real
equilibrium interest rate. Factors that had previously been operating, such as demographics,
were likely to continue to bear down on the long-term real rate. Increased investment into
climate transition technologies or artificial intelligence, driven for example by expectations of
higher productivity growth, might be raising the long-term real equilibrium interest rate.
Sustained increases in fiscal spending could also have an impact. The Committee would
continue to discuss these factors.

### Monetary and financial conditions 

9. Since the Committee’s previous meeting, the market-implied paths for policy rates across
major advanced economies had shifted up. Corporate bond spreads had, however, narrowed
and equity prices had risen, leaving mixed signals on the direction of the overall change in
financial conditions.

10. Following significant falls in market expectations of policy rates in December and
January, recent stronger than expected economic data, particularly non-farm payrolls and
inflation releases in the United States, had pushed out slightly the expected timing of future
reductions in policy rates across major advanced economies. Despite the rise in short-term
interest rates, risky asset prices had increased. Market intelligence suggested that the
narrowing in corporate credit spreads and rising equity prices had reflected growing
confidence that global growth, credit conditions and corporate earnings would improve going
forward.

11. In line with market expectations, the Bank of Japan had raised its policy rate to positive
territory and had also ended its policy of yield curve control.

12. In the United Kingdom, all respondents to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey
(MaPS) had expected Bank Rate to be left unchanged at this MPC meeting. They had also
all continued to expect the next move in Bank Rate to be downward. The median respondent


-----

in the latest MaPS had expected a cumulative 75 basis points reduction in Bank Rate this
year, starting in August. This was broadly in line with current market pricing but down from
100 basis points in the February MaPS. The median respondent had reported that they
perceived the neutral interest rate to be at 3.25%, similar to recent surveys.

13. The Committee discussed the increasing convergence and correlated movements in
recent months between market expectations for the UK and US policy rate paths. Market
intelligence indicated that, despite differences in recent and projected supply and demand
growth, this recent convergence could be attributed to factors such as the similarities in
current policy rates and the two economies being in broadly similar stages of the
disinflationary process.

14. While quoted mortgage rates had increased somewhat since the Committee’s previous
meeting, largely reflecting pass-through of increases in risk-free reference rates, they had
remained substantially below the levels reached last summer. The availability of secured
lending to households had improved slightly in the latest Credit Conditions Survey, and the
number of owner-occupied mortgage products advertised was now back at levels recorded
before the start of the interest rate tightening cycle. Quoted interest rates on unsecured
consumer credit and bank lending to businesses had remained close to their recent peaks.

15. The annual growth rate of aggregate sterling broad money had decreased from -0.3% in
December to -1.6% in January, driven by volatility in the holdings of the non-intermediate
other financial corporations sector, but had remained slightly above the previous six-month
average of -1.8%. Within that, annual growth in household deposits had, however, continued
to rise.

### Demand and output 

16. UK real GDP had fallen by 0.3% in 2023 Q4, weaker than had been expected in the
February Monetary Policy Report. This had followed a 0.1% decline in Q3. A Bank staff
estimate of market sector output, which was less subject to swings in measured non-market
output in health and education, had declined by 0.4% in Q4, after a similar-sized fall in Q3.
Within the expenditure components of GDP, domestic household consumption and housing
investment had fallen by 0.4% and 1.9% respectively in Q4. Business investment was
estimated to have risen by 1.5%.

17. Monthly GDP had risen by 0.2% in January, to its highest level since September 2023.
Strength in monthly growth had been concentrated in the construction and government
services sectors. Private services output had risen slightly.

18. GDP and market sector output growth were both expected to pick up and be positive
over the first half of the year. The flash S&P Global/CIPS UK composite output PMI had been


-----

little changed in March at slightly below its long-run historical average, while the future output
PMI had eased back slightly from its two-year high in February. There was a similarly positive
signal from most other business surveys of current and future market sector activity.
Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents had also become slightly more optimistic about the
outlook. Bank staff continued to expect GDP growth of 0.1% in 2024 Q1 and early indications
suggested a small further rise in output growth in Q2.

19. Although consumption had been weaker than expected over 2023, there had been some
early signs of a gradual recovery. Retail sales volumes had been volatile but had risen by
3.4% in January following a 3.3% decline in December. Intelligence from the Agents
suggested that consumption growth was likely to remain weak in 2024 Q1 but to improve
thereafter. GfK consumer confidence had been broadly stable over recent months, with the
future personal financial situation sub-balance remaining only slightly below its long-run
average. The number of mortgage approvals for house purchases had risen in January to its
highest level since October 2022. The UK House Price Index had been broadly flat over
recent months, but other timelier indicators of house prices had tended to rise slightly.

20. The Spring Budget 2024 had taken place on 6 March, accompanied by an Economic and
fiscal outlook from the Office for Budget Responsibility. The Government had announced a
package of fiscal measures, including a further 2p cut in the main rate of employee and selfemployed national insurance contributions from April 2024. Bank staff had provisionally
estimated that these new measures would increase the level of GDP by around ¼% over
coming years. As the measures would probably also boost potential supply to some extent,
the implications for the Committee’s output gap projection, and hence inflationary pressures
in the economy, were likely to be smaller. A full assessment of this news would be conducted
as part of the May Report forecast round.

### Supply, costs and prices 

21. Reflecting uncertainties around the ONS’s Labour Force Survey (LFS), the Committee
was continuing to consider a wide range of indicators of labour market activity. These
collectively pointed to the labour market remaining relatively tight in absolute terms, though
continuing to loosen.

22. The ONS had released updated LFS estimates in February but had advised caution in
interpreting the results owing to low sample sizes. These estimates also did not reflect the
most recent migration and population data. The LFS unemployment rate was estimated to
have fallen over the past six months, to 3.9% in the three months to January. Other
indicators, such as the claimant count and Agents’ intelligence on recruitment difficulties,
pointed to a flat or slightly rising profile of unemployment. The vacancies-to-unemployment
ratio had remained slightly above its 2019 Q4 levels.


-----

23. The collective steer from a range of measures pointed to modestly positive quarterly
employment growth, in line with the February Monetary Policy Report projections. The
Committee noted that employment growth had been relatively resilient in an environment of
subdued activity, suggesting that companies were potentially retaining their existing
employees to meet future increases in demand. This was also consistent with Agents’
intelligence. The Committee would monitor whether or not this retention would restrain any
tightening in the labour market as GDP growth picked up.

24. Against the backdrop of easing labour market tightness and receding inflation
expectations, most indicators of pay growth had declined, although they had remained
elevated. Annual private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) growth had been
6.1% in the three months to January, 1.1 percentage points lower than in the three months to
October and broadly in line with the February Report projection. AWE had moved
increasingly into line with other measures such as median private sector pay growth derived
from HMRC payrolls data.

25. The Committee discussed the degree of persistence in wage growth. Some shorter-term
measures of wage growth had eased, such as an underlying measure based on a range of
pay indicators which had been running at a three-month on three-month annualised pace of
around 5%, and suggested a moderation in inflationary persistence. On the other hand,
adjusting AWE data on a CPI-weighted basis indicated that pay growth could be moderating
at a slower pace than the headline data were suggesting. Some forward-looking indicators
also pointed to slower moderation. Expectations for future wage growth from the Decision
Maker Panel (DMP) Survey had remained flat at 5.2%. The latest intelligence on average pay
settlements collected by the Agents had remained close to the levels observed in the Agents’
annual survey presented in the February Report. Agents’ contacts had generally expected
lower pass-through of higher labour costs to prices compared to 2023, however.

26. Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 3.4% in February from 4.0% in January and
December, a little below the expectation in the February Report. The latest CPI release had
triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the
Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes. The decline in CPI inflation
over recent months could largely be attributed to falls in food and core goods price inflation,
as external cost pressures had continued to abate. Services price inflation had declined but
remained elevated.

27. Energy prices had continued to drag on annual CPI inflation. Despite the 5% rise in the
Ofgem price cap in January, energy was expected to continue to contribute negatively to CPI
inflation over the next six months owing to the upcoming reduction in the price cap from April.
The freeze in fuel duty announced in the Budget would provide a further marginal drag
compared to the February Report projections.


-----

28. Core goods price inflation had fallen to 1.9% in February, slightly lower than expected in
the February Report, as cost pressures from previous shocks and global goods price inflation
had continued to dissipate. Food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation had also fallen, to
5.0% in February from 6.9% in January. The level of producer input and output prices for
both core goods and food had receded significantly from their previous peaks over the past
year and had then flattened, while Agents’ contacts similarly anticipated falling or flat input
costs.

29. Services price inflation had remained higher than CPI inflation, at 6.1% in February, a
decrease of 0.4 percentage points from January and in line with February Report
expectations. Higher-frequency services price measures that excluded components that were
not typically reliable indicators of trends in inflation persistence, such as rents, airfares,
package holidays and education, had risen by around 4½% on a three-month on three-month
annualised basis. The moderation of services price inflation in recent months appeared to
have been accounted for largely by weakness in non-labour rather than labour costs.

30. Households’ median short-term inflation expectations had continued to ease in the
February Bank of England Inflation Attitudes Survey, while longer-term expectations had
remained steady and close to historical averages. Inflation expectations in the Citi/YouGov
survey of households had remained somewhat higher than the Bank measures. The oneyear ahead measure had been in decline, though had remained above historical averages,
while the longer-term measure had been steadier. Business expectations looking one and
three years ahead in the February DMP Survey had eased marginally compared to January
but had remained above 2%. In the latest MaPS, median CPI expectations of market
participants at the one-year point had fallen a little, while median expectations at the three
and five-year horizons had remained unchanged at 2%.

### The immediate policy decision

31. The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to
sustain growth and employment.

32. In the MPC’s February Monetary Policy Report projections, GDP growth had been
expected to pick up gradually during the forecast period. CPI inflation had been expected to
fall temporarily to the 2% target in 2024 Q2 before increasing again in Q3 and Q4, to around
2¾%. Conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate at the time of the February
Report, inflation had then been projected to remain above the 2% target over nearly all of the
remainder of the forecast period, owing to persistence in domestic inflationary pressures. The
Committee had judged that the risks around the modal inflation projection were skewed to the
upside over the first half of the forecast period, stemming from geopolitical factors. Risks from
domestic price and wage pressures had been judged to be evenly balanced.


-----

33. Since the MPC’s previous meeting, market-implied paths for advanced economy policy
rates had shifted up, including in the United Kingdom.

34. Having declined through the second half of last year, UK GDP and market sector output
were expected to start growing again during the first half of this year. Business surveys
remained consistent with an improving outlook for activity. Reflecting uncertainties around the
ONS’s Labour Force Survey, the Committee was continuing to consider a wide range of
indicators of labour market activity. The labour market had continued to loosen but remained
relatively tight by historical standards. To the extent that companies had been retaining their
existing employees to meet future increases in demand, employment growth was likely to be
weaker relative to output growth in the near term, consistent with a further easing in labour
market tightness. Should labour demand prove stronger, there could be less of an easing.

35. Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 3.4% in February from 4.0% in January and
December, a little below the expectation in the February Report. Services consumer price
inflation had declined but remained elevated, at 6.1% in February. Higher-frequency
measures of core services inflation, such as the three-month on three-month annualised rate,
had been around 4½%. Most indicators of short-term inflation expectations had continued to
ease. Although still elevated, nominal wage growth had moderated across a number of
measures. An underlying measure based on a range of pay indicators had been running at a
three-month on three-month annualised pace of around 5%. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents
continued to expect some decline in pay settlements this year and to report greater difficulty
in passing on cost increases to prices. CPI inflation was projected to fall to slightly below the
2% target in 2024 Q2, marginally weaker than had previously been expected owing to the
freeze in fuel duty announced in the Budget.

36. The MPC’s remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the
primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognised
that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of
shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy would ensure that CPI inflation returned to the 2%
target sustainably in the medium term.

37. Monetary policy would need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to
the 2% target sustainably in the medium term in line with the MPC’s remit. The Committee
had judged since last autumn that monetary policy needed to be restrictive for an extended
period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipated.
The Committee recognised that the stance of monetary policy could remain restrictive even if
Bank Rate were to be reduced, given that it was starting from an already restrictive level.

38. Eight members judged that maintaining Bank Rate at 5.25% was warranted at this
meeting. Headline CPI inflation had continued to fall back relatively sharply in part owing to
base effects and external effects from energy and goods prices. The restrictive stance of


-----

monetary policy was weighing on activity in the real economy, was leading to a looser labour
market and was bearing down on inflationary pressures. Nonetheless, key indicators of
inflation persistence remained elevated.

39. There was a range of views among these members on the extent to which the risks from
persistent inflationary pressures had receded. At one end of this range, developments in
nominal indicators, including at higher frequencies, suggested that the restrictive stance of
policy and the unwinding of second-round effects associated with declining short-term
inflation expectations were having a material impact in reducing the more persistent and
slower-moving components of inflation. At the other end of this range, wage growth remained
too high and was expected to moderate only slowly, as reflected in the Agents’ latest
intelligence. There were limited signs so far that services price inflation would return to a
target-consistent pace sufficiently rapidly, with evidence of diminishing second-round effects
still tentative. Some upside risks remained around both the wage and CPI inflation
projections.

40. For all of these members, a further accumulation of evidence on inflation persistence
would be required to warrant a shift in the monetary policy stance, with members differing on
the extent of evidence that was likely to be needed. They would continue to consider the
degree of restrictiveness of policy at each meeting.

41. One member preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting.
For this member, waiting for more reassurance before reducing Bank Rate would weigh
further on living standards and supply capacity. Bank Rate needed to become less restrictive
now to enable a smooth transition in the policy stance and to account for lags in
transmission. While this did not preclude the possibility of maintaining Bank Rate if upside
risks were to materialise, consumer price inflation was already, and had been for some time,
on a firm downward trajectory. Consumption had not recovered to pre-pandemic levels, in
sharp contrast to some other advanced economies where it was driving economic growth.
The outlook for demand remained weak, with vacancies falling sharply and forward-looking
indicators of nominal pay growth easing.

42. The MPC remained prepared to adjust monetary policy as warranted by economic data
to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably. It would therefore continue to monitor closely
indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole,
including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage
growth and services price inflation. On that basis, the Committee would keep under review
for how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level.


43. The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that:


Bank Rate should be maintained at 5.25%.


-----

44. Eight members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Ben Broadbent, Megan Greene,
Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill, Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the
proposition. Swati Dhingra voted against the proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by
0.25 percentage points, to 5%.
