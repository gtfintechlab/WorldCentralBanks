-----

1. The indicators released since the last Copom
meeting suggest economic activity below
expectations in the short term. Forecasts for 2016
and 2017 GDP fell, and the process of recovery of
expectations components of confidence indices was
interrupted. After breaking a long sequence of
negative prints in the second quarter, the measure
of investment in the national accounts fell again in
the third quarter.

2. The economy continues to operate with a high
level of economic slack, reflected in the low
industrial capacity utilization indices and, mainly, in
the unemployment rate.

3. After the decline in economic activity indicators
for August, the absence of a reversal in the following
months makes it less likely that these movements
reflect natural fluctuations in economic activity
around stabilization periods. There is a higher
probability, therefore, that the recovery of
economic activity will be slower and more gradual
than previously anticipated.

4. The global outlook is particularly uncertain. The
increase in asset price volatility indicates the
possible end of the benign period for emerging
economies. There is a high probability of resumption
of the process of normalization of monetary
conditions in the United States in the short term, as
well as uncertainty over the future course of its
economic policy.

5. Returning to the domestic economy, recent
inflation figures came in more favorably than
expected, partly due to the reversal of food price
increases, but also with signs of more widespread
disinflation. These results contributed to a decrease
in expectations for 2016 IPCA[2] inflation measured by
the Focus survey, which stand at around 6.7%. As for
2017, IPCA inflation expectations reported in the
same survey have declined to around 4.9% and
expectations for 2018 and more distant horizons
remain around 4.5%.

6. The path of regulated prices, which enters the
conditional forecasts in the inflation scenarios
produced by the Committee, assumes increases of
5.5% in 2016, 5.9% in 2017, and 5.3% in 2018.


7. The reference scenario maintains, among other
assumptions, that the interest rate and exchange
rate remain unchanged throughout the forecast
horizon at, respectively, 14.00% per annum (p.a.) and
R$3.40/US$. The market scenario considers the
paths for the policy rate and the exchange rate
extracted from the Focus survey. In particular, this
scenario assumes exchange rates of R$3.35/US$,
R$3.40/US$ and R$3.50/US$ at the end of 2016,
2017, and 2018, respectively, and interest rates of
13.75% p.a., 10.75% p.a., and 10.00% p.a. at the end
of the same periods.

8. For 2016, the Copom’s projections under the
reference and market scenarios retreated to around
6.6%.

9. Over the relevant horizon for the conduct of
monetary policy, the Copom’s conditional forecasts
fluctuated around the previous levels due to factors
with opposing effects. Forecasts for 2017 in the
reference and market scenarios show inflation
around 4.4% and 4.7%, respectively. Forecasts for
2018 inflation in the reference and market scenarios
are around 3.6% and 4.6%, respectively.

## B) Risks around baseline inflation scenario

10. Signs of pause, at the margin, in the process of
disinflation of some IPCA components that are most
sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy
persist. The inflation rate of these components has
been retreating in 12-month windows, but the pause
persists, at the margin, according to seasonally
adjusted monthly measures of underlying inflation.
This could reflect greater inflation resilience,
despite the high level of economic slack.

11. On the other hand, the continuous softening of
the labor market and the significant deceleration of
economic activity tend to produce disinflation that
can be more intense than the one reflected in
inflation expectations measured by the Focus survey
and in the conditional projections produced by the
Copom. In fact, the more favorable inflation
dynamics in the recent period show signs of more
widespread disinflation. It is, therefore, reasonable
to expect softer economic activity in the short run
and the prospect of a further delayed and more
gradual recovery to reinforce this process. Another
likely outcome of this outlook would be an earlier
end to the pause and resumption of disinflation, at

12. The steps toward approval of fiscal reforms have
been positive so far, which suggests greater
timeliness and higher probability of approval. On the
other hand, the process is lengthy and carries
uncertainty. The reduction of uncertainty would
enhance the effects of monetary policy, and reduce
the costs of the ongoing disinflationary process.

13. The possible end of the benign period for
emerging economies might make disinflation more
difficult. It is possible, however, that its effects be
mitigated by favorable movements in commodity
prices that are relevant to the country’s terms of
trade, which would be a stabilizing factor.
Furthermore, the end of the benign period may
imply tighter external financial conditions, which
would contribute a disinflationary component.
Therefore, there is no direct relationship between
the global outlook and the conduct of monetary
policy.

## C) Discussion about the conduct of monetary policy

14. The Committee members discussed the
evolution of economic activity in the short term, in
light of the most recent releases. They all agreed
that the economy continued to show signs of
weakness past August. September releases and
indicators available for October and November
failed to show a reversal that should be expected in
a scenario of natural fluctuations of economic
activity around stabilization periods. This increases
the likelihood that the resumption of economic
activity may be further delayed, and be more gradual
than previously anticipated.

15. Regarding the global outlook, the Committee
members pointed out the risks associated with the
possible end of the relatively benign environment
for emerging economies of late. They all agreed that
the process of normalization of monetary policy in
the United States should be resumed in the near
term, and that the course of its economic policy
became a source of uncertainty. The Copom
evaluated that part of this uncertainty should
dissipate in the coming months. They also agreed
that by the end of the year the Committee should
have a more accurate assessment of the possible
impacts of the resumption of the process of
monetary policy normalization in the United States.
The members of the Committee argued that, in face
of expectations that global economic activity will
strengthen, movements in the terms of trade may

16. The Committee analyzed its conditional
forecasts for inflation in different scenarios, the
balance of risks, the wide array of available
information, and the evolution of the factors
emphasized by the Copom in its October Statement
(202[nd] meeting). In this context, the Copom
considered that the recent monetary policy stance
contributed to the anchoring of inflation
expectations, and to create more leeway for the
easing of monetary policy. The discussion turned
then to the pace of easing.

17. Some Committee members reasoned that the
more favorable inflation developments recently, the
positive steps toward the approval of the first fiscal
reforms and the downgrade in the prospects for the
recovery of economic activity would already support
a faster pace of monetary easing at the current
meeting. Other Copom members argued that the
evolution of some inflation components that are
more sensitive to the business cycle and to
monetary policy continue to indicate a pause, at the
margin. They also argued that the uncertainty over
the possible end of the benign global environment
for emerging economies should decrease until the
January Copom meeting. The combination of such
factors recommended waiting until the next
meeting. These same members reasoned,
nevertheless, that if economic activity fails to show
clearer signs of recovering, it is reasonable to expect
an intensification of the pace of monetary easing,
since in this case inflation forecasts should decrease.
In the end, a consensus was built on waiting until the
next meeting.

18. The members of the Committee discussed the
path for regulated prices and its effects on the
prospective scenario for inflation. In particular, the
members of the Committee mentioned: (i) the
impact of the change in fuel price policy that was
recently announced; (ii) possible changes in
electricity prices during 2017, as a result of the fare
hikes required to correct past policy distortions. In
this context, the members of the Committee
emphasized, once again, that the environment with
anchored inflation expectations would enable the
Copom to focus on preventing second-round effects
of these relative price adjustments.

economy, especially with respect to fiscal reforms.
The members of the Committee emphasized that
these efforts are crucial for the stabilization and the
development of the Brazilian economy. The
Committee should monitor these efforts closely,
since they have important implications for the
disinflation process.


20. The Committee understands that the pace of
monetary easing will be calibrated, taking into
account its inflation projections and its determinant
factors, in order to pursue a path that allows the
inflation targets for 2017 and 2018 to be met. The
Committee judges that currently there is no
incompatibility between these two objectives.
Inflation forecasts for both years have improved,
especially in the market scenario. This suggests that
there may be more room for monetary easing than
previously perceived.

21. The Committee discussed the factors
determining the pace and magnitude of monetary
easing. In particular, it was pointed out that the
palpable risk that a timely recovery of economic
activity fails to materialize should allow the
intensification of the pace of monetary easing.

## D) Monetary Policy Decision

22. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the
current balance of risks, and the wide array of
available information, the Copom unanimously
decided to reduce the Selic rate to 13.75 percent per
year, without bias.

23. The Committee judges that convergence of
inflation to the 4.5% target over the relevant
horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which
includes 2017 and 2018, is compatible with a gradual
easing of monetary conditions.

24. The magnitude of monetary easing and the
speeding up of its pace will depend on inflation
forecasts and expectations, and on the evolution of
the aforementioned risk factors. In that respect, the
Copom emphasizes that the pace of disinflation in its
forecasts might intensify if the economic recovery is
delayed further, and occurs more gradually than
anticipated. This intensification of the disinflation
process relies on an adequate global environment.
There is no mechanical relationship, however,
between the global outlook and monetary policy.
