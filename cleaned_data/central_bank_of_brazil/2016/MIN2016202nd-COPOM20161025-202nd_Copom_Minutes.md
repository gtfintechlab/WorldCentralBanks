22. The Committee believes that, in presenting its
conditional forecasts for inflation and emphasizing
factors that can allow greater confidence in
meeting the inflation targets, it increases

transparency, strengthens its communication and
enhances the effects of monetary policy.

discussed the implications of spelling out economic
conditionalities for the pace and magnitude of the
monetary easing just initiated. The Committee
concluded that conditioning the future evolution of
monetary policy on factors that matter for inflation
can better transmit the economic rationality that
guides the Committee’s decisions.

## D) Monetary Policy Decision

24. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the
balance of risks and the wide array of available
information, the Copom unanimously decided to
reduce the Selic rate to 14.00% p.a., without bias.

25. The Committee judges that convergence of
inflation to the 2017 and 2018 target is compatible
with a moderate and gradual easing of monetary
conditions. The Committee will assess the pace and
magnitude of monetary easing over time, in order
to ensure convergence of inflation to the 4.5%
target.

26. The magnitude of monetary easing and a
possible speeding up of its pace will depend on a
