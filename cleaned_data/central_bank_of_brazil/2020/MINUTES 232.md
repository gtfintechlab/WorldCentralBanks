## D) Monetary Policy Decision

20. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the
balance of risks, and the broad array of available
information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower
the Selic rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00% p.a.
The Committee judges that this decision reflects its
baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-
than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is
consistent with the convergence of inflation to its
target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy,
which includes 2021 and, to a lesser extent, 2022.

21. The Committee believes that persevering in the
process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the
Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable
economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that
doubts regarding the continuation of the reform
agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal
consolidation process could result in an increase in the
structural interest rate.

22. The Copom believes that the current economic
conditions continue to recommend an unusually strong
monetary stimulus but it recognizes that, due to
prudential and financial stability reasons, the remaining
space for monetary policy stimulus, if it exists, should
be small. Consequently, possible future adjustments to
the current degree of monetary stimulus would occur
with additional gradualism and would depend on the
perception of the fiscal trajectory, as well as on new
information that changes the Committee's current
assessment about prospective inflation.

23. Despite the asymmetry on its balance of risks, the
Copom does not foresee reductions in the monetary
stimulus unless inflation expectations, as well as its
baseline scenario inflation projections, are sufficiently
close to the inflation target at the relevant horizon for
monetary policy, which currently includes 2021 and, to
a lesser extent, 2022. This intention is conditional on
the maintenance of the current fiscal regime and on the
anchoring of long-term inflation expectations.

24. The following members of the Committee voted for
this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto

(Governor), Bruno Serra Fernandes, Carolina de Assis
Barros, Fabio Kanczuk, Fernanda Feitosa Nechio, João
Manoel Pinho de Mello, Maurício Costa de Moura,
Otávio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Sérgio Neves de
Souza.
