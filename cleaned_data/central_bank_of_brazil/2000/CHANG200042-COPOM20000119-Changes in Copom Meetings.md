# BANCO CENTRAL DO BRASIL – FOCUS

## January 19, 2000

##### Central Bank’s Monetary Policy Council (COPOM) meetings will be held in two

 successive days, effective January 2000. The change from previous one-day meetings aims

 at allowing added time for council members—board directors and department heads—to

 assess current developments and the outlook for the economy. In the first day of the

 meeting, department heads will report on the behavior of domestic and external accounts,

 banking system overall conditions, securities markets, and they will discuss inflation

 models. In the following day, interest rates will be in the agenda for discussion. The

 January’s meeting decision will be known later today. The evolution of discount rates

 (TBC) set by COPOM, in effect from 7.1.1996 to 3.4.1999, since then targets for

 SELIC are shown below, along with overnight rates (SELIC). On the next page, a

 table containing detailed information on COPOM previous decisions and effective

 dates is presented.
