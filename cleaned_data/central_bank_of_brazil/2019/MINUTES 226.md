## D) Monetary Policy Decision

24. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the
balance of risks, and the broad array of available
information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower
the Selic rate to 5.00% p.a. The Committee judges that
this decision reflects its baseline scenario for
prospective inflation and the associated balance of
risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation
to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of
monetary policy, which includes 2020 and, to a lesser
extent, 2021.

25. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions
prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest
rates below the structural level.
