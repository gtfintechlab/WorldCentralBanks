economic activity remains on a gradual recovery
path, without pressuring financial conditions in
advanced economies. This supports risk appetite
towards emerging economies.

4. Inflation developments remain favorable, with
various measures of underlying inflation running at
low levels. This includes the components that are
most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary
policy.

5. Inflation expectations collected by the Focus
survey edged up to around 3.4% for 2017 and
remained around 4.2% for 2018. Expectations for
2019 are around 4.25%, and expectations for 2020
are around 4.0%.

6. The path of administered prices underlying the
inflation scenarios produced by the Committee
assumes increases of 7.5% for 2017 and 5.2% for
2018.

7. The scenario with interest rate and exchange rate
paths extracted from the Focus survey considers,
among other assumptions, exchange rates of
R$3.20/US$ and R$3.35/US$ at the end of 2017 and
2018, respectively, and interest rates of 7.25% per
annum (p.a.) at the end of 2017, 7.0% p.a. during
most of 2018, ending that year at 7.50% p.a.

most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary
policy, may lead to a lower-than-expected
prospective inflation trajectory.

11. On the other hand, (iii) frustration of
expectations regarding the continuation of reforms
and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy
may affect risk premia and increase the inflation path
over the relevant horizon for the conduct of
monetary policy. This risk intensifies in the case of (iv)
a reversal of the current benign global outlook for
emerging economies.

## C) Discussion about the conduct of monetary policy

12. The Committee members discussed the
evolution of economic activity, in light of available
data. They all agreed with the diagnosis that the
process of stabilization of the economy has
consolidated. They also agreed that economic
activity should remain on a gradual recovery path,
whose first signs are already visible. They assessed
that, as the recovery consolidates, consumption
growth should give way to a resumption in
investment. They also judged that there are signs of
employment recovery even in this phase of the cycle.

13. Regarding the global outlook, members of the
Committee confirmed the recent favorable evolution
of the global economy, with gradual recovery of
activity, without pressures on financial conditions in
developed economies. They discussed the risks
associated with the monetary policy normalization
process in central economies and with the outlook
for the Chinese economy, with possible impacts on
risk appetite for emerging economies’ assets. In this
context, the Copom members reaffirmed that the

environment, anchored expectations and prospect of
economic recovery. Nevertheless, the Copom
members pointed out the risk for the Brazilian
economy of a reversal in this benign global outlook in
a context of frustration of expectations regarding
the reforms and necessary adjustments in the
Brazilian economy.

14. The Copom members analyzed the inflation
trajectory throughout this and subsequent years and
agreed that the prospects for inflation continue to
evolve in a favorable way. Considering the scenario
that conditions on paths of the interest rate and
exchange rate extracted from the Focus survey,
projections for 12-month inflation stand around 3.3%
in December 2017. In the same scenario, which
assumes an interest trajectory that reaches 7.25% at
the end of 2017, falls to 7.0% at the start of 2018, and
increases to 7.5% at the end of that year, the inflation
trajectory reaches 4.4% in December 2018.

15. The Committee members discussed the
dynamics of food prices, whose favorable behavior
persists so far. They analyzed that, in the twelvemonth period ending in August 2017, the cost of food
at home measured by the IPCA fell by 5.2%, in
contrast with the increase of 9.4% in 2016. This
represents a contribution of more than two
percentage points for the disinflation observed
through August 2017. They pointed out that a retreat
in food price inflation was expected for 2017, when
compared to 2016. But they agreed that this sharp
drop in food prices constitutes a substantial
disinflationary surprise and accounts for a relevant
share of the difference between the inflation
projections for 2017 and the respective 4.5% target.

16. The Committee members analyzed the prospect
for the future evolution of food price inflation. They
confirmed the prescription that monetary policy
should fight possible second-round effects stemming
from this shock. They pointed out that inflation
projections for 2018 (both the ones extracted from
the Focus survey and those from the Copom
conditional forecasts) consider some normalization
of food price inflation. A slower normalization
constitutes a downward risk to these projections.

17. The Copom members discussed the low levels of
current inflation, including the components that are
most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary
policy. They observed that these low levels have
allowed an increase in the population’s purchasing
power and contributed to the economic recovery.
They also observed that the possible propagation
through inertial mechanisms of the low level of
current inflation may lead to a lower-than-expected
prospective inflation trajectory. Notwithstanding
this risk, the Copom members considered that the


18. The Copom assessed that monetary policy has
the flexibility to react to risks on both sides. On the
one hand, to the risk that side effects of the food
price shock and the propagation of the current low
level of inflation may produce lower-than-expected
prospective inflation. On the other hand, to the
inflationary risk stemming from a possible reversal of
the global outlook, in a context of frustration of
expectations regarding adjustments and reforms.

19. The Committee members expressed the
understanding that economic conditions, with
anchored inflation expectations, underlying inflation
measures running at low levels, inflation forecasts
slightly below target for 2018, and high level of
economic slack – prescribe accommodative monetary
policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level.
Although estimates of this rate involve a high degree
of uncertainty, the Committee members expressed
an understanding that current _ex-ante real interest_
rates already provide stimulus to the economy.

20. The Copom understands that the evolution of
reforms, such as the recently approved credit policy
measures, and of adjustments in the Brazilian
economy contributes to the reduction of its
structural interest rate. The Committee will continue
to reassess estimates of this rate over time.

21. The Committee understands that, for a given
estimate of the length of the monetary easing cycle,
the pace of easing depends on the stage of the cycle,
without necessarily reflecting changes in the
Committee’s baseline scenario or in the balance of
risks.

22. All Copom members agreed that the evolution of
the outlook and of the balance of risks since its July
meeting (208[th] meeting) was compatible with the
reduction of the Selic rate to 8.25% percent per year.

23. The Committee members then discussed the
next step in the conduct of monetary policy. In this
context, they assessed the convenience of signaling
the possible magnitudes of monetary easing at the
next meeting. They argued for the need to maintain
flexibility for monetary policy to properly react in
case of changes to the baseline scenario and the
balance of risks. The members also discussed the
appropriate pace of easing at the current stage of the
cycle. They concluded in favor of signaling,
conditionally, that if the outlook evolves according to
the Copom’s baseline scenario, and due to the stage
of the easing cycle, a moderate reduction in the

seems appropriate, from the current perspective.

24. The Committee members also assessed the
convenience of signaling the possible steps after the
next meeting. In particular, they assessed the costs
and benefits of a gradual ending to the easing cycle.
In general, the Committee members agreed that,
everything else equal, there are benefits from a
gradual ending of monetary cycles. A gradual process
facilitates communication and allows gathering of
more evidence regarding the behavior of the
economy around the end of the cycle. But they also
agreed that, in exceptional cases, the need for
prompt frontloading of the cycle may bring greater
benefits than those related to a gradual ending. In
the current circumstances, the Copom judged
convenient to signal that, if the baseline scenario
evolves as currently expected, the Committee
foresees a gradual ending to the current monetary
easing cycle.

25. The Committee members reaffirmed their
preference for communicating conditionalities for
the evolution of monetary policy, which better
transmits the economic rationality that guides their
decisions. This contributes to increase transparency
and improve Copom communication. In this context,
they once again highlighted that the monetary
easing process will continue to depend on the
evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks,
possible reassessments of the extension of the cycle,
and on inflation forecasts and expectations.

26. All Committee members reemphasized that the
approval and implementation of reforms – notably
those of fiscal nature – and of adjustments in the
Brazilian economy are fundamental to the
sustainability of an environment with low and stable
inflation, to the full operation of monetary policy and
to the reduction of its structural interest rate, with
widespread benefits for society.

27. Finally, the Committee members highlighted the
importance of other initiatives (such as the recently
announced privatizations and concessions) and
investments in infrastructure aimed at productivity
increases, efficiency gains, greater flexibility of the
economy, and business environment improvement.
These efforts are fundamental for the resumption of
economic activity and for the development path of
the Brazilian economy.


28. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the
balance of risks, and the wide array of available
information, the Copom unanimously decided to
reduce the Selic rate by one percentage point, to
8.25% p.a., without bias. The Committee judges that
convergence of inflation to the 4.5% target over the
relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy,
which includes 2018, is compatible with the monetary
easing process.

29. The Committee judges that economic conditions
prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e.,
interest rates below the structural level.

30. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of
reforms, such as the recently approved credit policy
measures, and necessary adjustments to the Brazilian
economy contributes to the reduction of its
structural interest rate. The Committee will continue
to reassess estimates of this rate over time.

31. The Copom emphasizes that economic
conditions have allowed the same pace of monetary
easing at the current meeting. Regarding the next
Copom meeting, provided that the Committee’s
baseline scenario evolves as expected, and due to the
stage of the monetary easing cycle, the Committee
views a moderate reduction of the pace of easing as
appropriate at this time. In addition, under those
same circumstances, the Copom foresees a gradual
ending to the cycle. Notwithstanding these
perspectives, the Copom emphasizes that the
monetary easing process will continue to depend on
the evolution of economic activity, the balance of
risks, possible reassessments of the extension of the
cycle, and on inflation forecasts and expectations.

32. The following members of the Committee voted
for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor), Anthero de
Moraes Meirelles, Carlos Viana de Carvalho, Isaac
Sidney Menezes Ferreira, Luiz Edson Feltrim, Otávio
Ribeiro Damaso, Reinaldo Le Grazie, Sidnei Corrêa
Marques and Tiago Couto Berriel.
