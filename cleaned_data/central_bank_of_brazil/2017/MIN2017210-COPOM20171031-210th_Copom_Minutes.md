3. The global outlook has been favorable, as global
economic activity remains on a gradual recovery
path, without exerting excessive pressure on
financial conditions in advanced economies. This

4. The Committee judges that its baseline inflation
scenario has evolved as expected. Inflation
developments remain favorable, with various
measures of underlying inflation running at
comfortable levels. This includes the components
most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary
policy.

5. Inflation expectations collected by the Focus
survey retreated to around 3.1 percent for 2017 and
4.0 percent for 2018. Expectations for 2019 and
2020 are around 4.25 percent and 4.0 percent,
respectively.

6. The path of administered prices underlying the
inflation scenarios produced by the Copom assumes
increases of 7.9 percent for 2017, 5.1 percent for
2018, and 4.3 percent for 2019.

7. The scenario with interest rate and exchange rate
paths extracted from the Focus survey considers,
among other assumptions, exchange rates of R$
3.16/US$, R$3.30/US$ and R$3.33/US$ at the end of
2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. This scenario
assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends
2017 and 2018 at 7.0 percent per year (p.y.) and
increases to 8.0 p.y. during the course of 2019.


10. On the one hand, (i) possible second-round
effects of the favorable food price shock and of low
current levels of industrial goods inflation, and (ii)
the possible propagation through inertial
mechanisms of low inflation levels may lead to a
lower-than-expected prospective inflation
trajectory.

11. On the other hand, (iii) frustration of
expectations regarding the continuation of reforms
and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy
may affect risk _premia and increase the path for_
inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct
of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in the case
of (iv) a reversal of the current benign global
outlook for emerging economies.

## C) Discussion about the conduct of monetary policy

12. The Committee discussed the evolution of
economic activity in light of available data. All
members agreed that the economy should remain
on a gradual recovery path, whose signs are evident,
for instance, in employment gains, even at this initial
phase. As the recovery advances, consumption
growth should give way to resumption in
investment. Softer economic activity data pertaining
to August were discussed, as well as the prospects
of a stronger recovery ahead. The Committee
emphasized the vision that, owing to the current
levels of slack in the economy, marginal revisions in
the intensity of recovery would not lead to material
revisions in the expected path for inflation.

13. Regarding the global outlook, the Committee
confirmed the recent favorable evolution of the
global economy, which shows a gradual economic
recovery, without exerting excessive pressure on
financial conditions in advanced economies. The
Committee acknowledged that the continuing
process of normalization of monetary policy in major
countries led to slightly less accommodative global
financial conditions. However, the impact on
emerging economies has been limited so far. In this
context, the Copom reaffirmed that the Brazilian
economy shows a greater capacity to absorb
occasional setbacks in the global economy, given its
robust balance of payments, low inflation
environment, anchored expectations and prospects
of economic recovery. Nevertheless, the Copom

14. The Copom analyzed the inflation trajectory
throughout this and subsequent years and all
members agreed that the prospects for inflation
have evolved as expected.

15. The Committee assessed the current situation of
the domestic electric energy generation sector and
incorporated the recent increase in tariffs into its
baseline scenario for inflation.

16. Regarding monetary policy, there was consensus
that, as in the case of other possible relative price
adjustments resulting from supply shocks, with
anchored inflation expectations, monetary policy
should only address the second-round effects of
these shocks. The Committee reiterates that its
reaction to possible changes in relative prices, such
as in food and possible adjustments of electric
energy tariffs, will be symmetric, that is, monetary
policy will follow the same principles in face of both
inflationary and disinflationary supply shocks.

17. The Copom discussed the levels and path of
inflation, including the components that are most
sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy.
These components show comfortable levels and a
path compatible with convergence of inflation
towards target.

18. The Copom assessed that monetary policy has
the flexibility to react to risks in both directions: the
risk that second-round effects of supply shocks and
the propagation of the low current levels of
inflation will lead to a lower-than-expected
prospective inflation trajectory, as well as the risk of
a setback in the global outlook in a context of
frustration of expectations about the reforms and
necessary adjustments.

19. The Committee expressed the view that
economic conditions with anchored inflation
expectations, measures of underlying inflation
running at comfortable levels, inflation projections
slightly below the target for 2018 and a high level of
economic slack prescribe accommodative monetary
policy, with interest rates below the structural level.
Although estimates of this rate involve a high
degree of uncertainty, Committee members
expressed an understanding that current _ex-ante_
real interest rates provide stimulus to the economy.


21. The Committee understands that, for a given
estimate of the length of the monetary easing cycle,
the pace of easing depends on the stage of the
cycle, without necessarily reflecting changes in its
baseline scenario or risk balance.

22. All Copom members agreed that the evolution
of the outlook and the balance of risks since its
meeting in September (209[th] meeting) took place as
expected, and was, therefore, compatible with the
Selic rate reduction to 7.5 percent per year.

23. The Committee then discussed the next step in
conducting monetary policy and the appropriate
pace of easing for the current stage of the cycle.
Provided that the outlook evolves according to the
Copom’s baseline scenario, and because of the stage
of the easing cycle, a moderate reduction in the
magnitude of easing at the next meeting seems
adequate from the current perspective.

24. The Copom also assessed the extension of the
cycle and the convenience of signaling steps
subsequent to the next meeting. There was
consensus in maintaining freedom of action and to
postpone any guidance on future monetary policy
decisions in order to incorporate new information
on the evolution of the baseline scenario and the
balance of risks.

25. The Committee reaffirmed its preference for
communicating conditionalities for the evolution of
monetary policy, which better transmits the
economic rationality that guides their decisions. This
contributes to increase transparency and improve
Copom communication. In this context, it was once
again emphasized that the easing process will
continue to depend on the evolution of economic
activity, the balance of risks, possible reassessments
of the extension of the cycle length, and on inflation
forecasts and expectations.

26. All Committee members once again emphasized
that the approval and implementation of reforms –
notably those of a fiscal nature – and adjustments in
the Brazilian economy are fundamental for the
sustainability of the environment of low and stable
inflation, for the full operation of monetary policy
and for the reduction of the structural interest rate
of the economy, with widespread benefits for
society.

## D) Monetary Policy Decision

28. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the
balance of risks, and the wide array of available
information, the Copom unanimously decided to
reduce the Selic rate by 0.75 percentage point, to
7.50 percent per year, without bias. The Committee
judges that convergence of inflation to the target
over the relevant horizon for the conduct of
monetary policy, which includes 2018 and 2019, is
compatible with the monetary easing process.

29. The Committee judges that economic conditions
prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e.,
interest rates below the structural level.

30. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of
reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian
economy contributes to the reduction of its
structural interest rate. The Committee will
continue to reassess estimates of this rate over
time.

31. The evolution of the baseline scenario, in line
with expectations, and the stage of the monetary
easing cycle made it appropriate to reduce the Selic
rate by 0.75 percentage point at this Copom
meeting. Regarding the next meeting, provided the
Committee's baseline scenario evolves as expected,
and taking into account the stage of the monetary
easing cycle, at this time the Copom views a
moderate reduction of the pace of easing as
appropriate. The Copom emphasizes that the
monetary easing process will continue to depend on
the evolution of economic activity, the balance of
risks, possible reassessments of the extension of the
cycle, and on inflation forecasts and expectations.

32. The following Committee members voted for
this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor), Carlos Viana
de Carvalho, Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira, Maurício
Costa de Moura, Otávio Ribeiro Damaso, Paulo
Sérgio Neves de Souza, Reinaldo Le Grazie, Sidnei
Corrêa Marques and Tiago Couto Berriel.
