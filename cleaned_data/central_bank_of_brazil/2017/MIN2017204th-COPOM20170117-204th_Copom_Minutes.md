1. The set of indicators released recently suggests
weaker-than-expected economic activity, including
in the last quarter of 2016, and that the economic
recovery should be delayed even further, and be
more gradual than previously anticipated.

2. The economy continues to operate with a high
level of economic slack, reflected in the low
industrial capacity utilization indices and, mainly, in
the unemployment rate.

3. The global outlook remains quite uncertain. This
uncertainty arises, among other factors, from
possible changes in the course of economic policy in
the United States, and from the resumption of the
process of normalization of monetary conditions by
the FOMC[2]. Nevertheless, the end of the benign
environment for emerging economies has had a
limited impact so far.

4. Returning to the domestic economy, recent
inflation figures came in more favorably than
expected, with signs of more widespread
disinflation. There is evidence that the more
widespread disinflation process has reached IPCA
components that are most sensitive to the business
cycle and monetary policy. As a result, IPCA[3]
inflation for 2016 ended at 6.3%, well below
expectations held a few months ago, and within the
tolerance limits set for the inflation target for last
year. Inflation expectations collected by the Focus
survey for 2017 have declined to around 4.8% and
expectations for 2018 and more distant horizons
remained anchored at around 4.5%.

5. The path of regulated prices, which enters the
conditional forecasts in the inflation scenarios
produced by the Committee, assumes increases of
6.0% in 2017, and 5.2% in 2018.

6. The reference scenario maintains, among other
assumptions, that the interest rate and exchange
rate remain unchanged throughout the forecast
horizon at, respectively, 13.75% per annum (p.a.) and
R$3.25/US$. The market scenario considers the
paths for the policy rate and the exchange rate
extracted from the Focus survey. In particular, this
scenario assumes exchange rates of R$3.45/US$ and
R$3.50/US$ at the end of 2017, and 2018,


7. The Committee’s conditional inflation forecasts
retreated relative to those in the latest Inflation
Report, which were based on information available
until December 9, 2016. Among other factors,
changes in forecasts were influenced by inflation
and economic activity data released since then. In
the reference scenario, forecasts for 2017 and 2018
are around 4.0% and 3.4%, respectively. The market
scenario for 2017 and 2018 shows inflation around
4.4% and 4.5%, respectively. The incorporation of
the latest data on economic activity into the
Copom’s information set contributed significantly to
the decline in conditional inflation forecasts.

## B) Risks around baseline inflation scenario

8. Short-run inflation behavior has been more
favorable, which may signal lower inflation
persistence. However, the process of disinflation of
some IPCA components that are most sensitive to
the business cycle and monetary policy requires
continuous attention.

9. The continuous softening of the labor market and
the significant deceleration of economic activity
tend to produce disinflation that can be more
intense than the one reflected in inflation
expectations measured by the Focus survey and in
the conditional projections produced by the Copom.
The more favorable inflation dynamics in the recent
period show signs of more widespread disinflation.
Weaker-than-expected economic activity and the
prospect of a further delayed and more gradual
recovery tend to reinforce this process.

10. The steps toward approval of fiscal reforms have
been positive so far, which suggests greater
timeliness and higher probability of approval. On the
other hand, the process is lengthy and carries
uncertainty.

12. The Committee members discussed the
evolution of economic activity, in light of the most
recent releases. They all agreed that the evidence
points to weaker-than-expected economic activity in
the last months. In face of challenges for the
resumption of economic activity, this contributed to
consolidate the assessment that the recovery of the
economy may be further delayed, and be more
gradual than previously anticipated.

13. Regarding the global outlook, the Committee
members pointed out the uncertainties associated
with possible changes in economic policy in the
United States and also with the end of the benign
period that prevailed during most of last year,
considering that the process of normalization of
monetary conditions in that country resumed. These
uncertainties have fueled an increase in long-term
interest rates in major developed economies, with
impact on emerging economies’ financing costs.
Nevertheless, the effects on asset prices of the end
of the benign environment for emerging economies
have been limited so far – in particular for
commodity-exporting countries, which have been
experiencing improvements in their terms of trade.
This context reinforces the assessment of
Committee members, that there is no mechanical
relationship between the global outlook and
monetary policy.

14. All members of the Committee agreed that the
conditions set out at the November Copom meeting
(203rd meeting) for speeding up the pace of
monetary easing were present. Inflation evolved
favorably in the recent period, coming below
expectations. With the evidence of resumption of
the disinflation process, at the margin, of
components that are most sensitive to the economic
cycle and monetary policy, the broad set of core
measures of inflation followed by the Copom points
to inflation at levels compatible with the target of
4.5% for 2017 and 2018. Furthermore, available
evidence reinforces the reading that expectations
remain anchored. These factors contribute to
greater confidence in the projections that the
disinflation process towards the target will
continue. The economy has been operating at a
weaker pace relative to what was expected a few
months ago, and recent releases continued to point
to weaker-than-expected economic activity at the
margin, even after the latest revisions for the end of
2016. The steps in the process of consideration of
additional fiscal reforms and other necessary
adjustments in the economy remain positive.


projections at the target for 2018 and marginally
below the target for 2017, the evolution of
economic activity recommends frontloading the
monetary policy easing cycle. This strategy
contributes to the stabilization process and
subsequent resumption of economic activity,
without deviating from the goals of bringing
inflation to the 4.5% target in 2017 and 2018. The
Committee then moved to the assessment of
options for the frontloading of the monetary easing
cycle.

16. The Copom entertained reducing the Selic rate
to 13.25 percent per year and signaling a larger cut
at the next meeting, if conditions allowed. In favor
of this option weighted the benefit of accumulating
more evidence of the consolidation of Copom's
baseline scenario. Another benefit would be a
greater smoothing of the trajectory of the monetary
policy instrument, which increases its predictability
in the long run.

17. However, the Committee assessed that
conditions for reducing the policy rate to 13% at the
current meeting were already present due to the
more widespread disinflation and weaker-thanexpected economic activity, in an environment with
anchored inflation expectations. This decision would
already contribute to the stabilization process and
later resumption of economic activity, without
requiring a departure from the objective of bringing
inflation to the 4.5% target in 2017 and 2018. The
Committee members also judged that this decision
was compatible with its communication, which
favors spelling out economic conditionalities for the
evolution of monetary policy, as this can better
transmit the economic rationality that guides the
Committee’s decisions. In the Committee's
assessment, the evolution of the outlook for
inflation and the evidence on the evolution of
economic activity gathered since the November
Copom meeting and the December Inflation Report
(whose reference date for the conditional inflation
projections was December 9) allow for a reduction in
the interest rate at a higher pace than the one
discussed by the Committee at its November
meeting. The conditional nature of Copom´s
communication on the conduct of monetary policy
allows economic agents to update their
expectations based on such evidence.

18. The Committee members once again

emphasized that the environment with anchored
inflation expectations would enable the Copom to
focus on preventing second-round effects of relative
price adjustments that may occur over time.

importance of other reforms and investments in
infrastructure aimed at increasing productivity,
efficiency gains, greater flexibility of the economy,
and improvement of the business environment.
These efforts are fundamental for the stabilization
and resumption of the economic activity and for the
development of the Brazilian economy.

the cycle and possible revisions of the pace of easing
will continue to depend on inflation forecasts and
expectations, and on the evolution of the
aforementioned risk factors.
