3. The global outlook has been favorable, as global
economic activity remains on a gradual recovery

4. The Committee judges that its baseline inflation
scenario has evolved, to a large extent, as expected.
Inflation developments remain favorable, with
various measures of underlying inflation running at
comfortable or low levels. This includes the
components that are most sensitive to the business
cycle and monetary policy

5. Inflation expectations collected by the Focus
survey retreated to around 3.0 percent for 2017.
Expectations for 2018, 2019 and 2020 remain
around 4.0 percent, 4.25 percent and 4.0 percent,
respectively.

6. The path of administered prices underlying the
inflation scenarios produced by the Copom assumes
increases of 8 percent for 2017, 4.9 percent for
2018, and 4.2 percent for 2019.

7. The scenario with interest rate and exchange rate
paths extracted from the Focus survey considers,
among other assumptions, exchange rates of R$
3.25/US$, R$3.30/US$ and R$3.37/US$ at the end of
2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. This scenario
assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends
2017 and 2018 at 7.0 percent per year (p.y.) and
increases to 8.0 p.y. during the course of 2019.

of (iv) a reversal of the current benign global
outlook for emerging economies.

## C) Discussion about the conduct of monetary policy

12. The Committee discussed the evolution of
economic activity in light of available data. All
members agreed that the economy remains on a
gradual recovery path, with improvements in
employment even at this early stage of the process.
This conjuncture has led to increases in growth
projections for the current year and for 2018,
consistent with a view that the recovery is more
consolidated. The Committee emphasized the vision
that, owing to the current levels of slack in the
economy, marginal revisions in the intensity of
recovery would not lead to material revisions in the
expected path for inflation.

13. Regarding the global outlook, the Committee
confirmed the recent favorable evolution of the
global economy, which shows a gradual economic
recovery, without exerting excessive pressure on
financial conditions in advanced economies. The
Committee acknowledged that the continuing
process of normalization of monetary policy in major
countries led to slightly less accommodative global
financial conditions, despite the limited impact on
the emerging economies so far. In this context, the
Copom reaffirmed that the Brazilian economy shows
greater capacity to absorb occasional setbacks in
the global economy, given its robust balance of
payments, low inflation environment, anchored
expectations and prospects of economic recovery.
Nevertheless, the Copom pointed out the risk for

14. The Copom analyzed the inflation trajectory
throughout this and subsequent years and all
members agreed that the prospects for inflation, to
a large extent, have evolved as expected.

15. The Committee assessed the current situation of
the domestic electric power generation sector and
incorporated the recent changes in tariffs into its
baseline scenario for inflation for the next year. In
the aggregate, administered prices have constituted
an  inflationary shock. In the opposite direction, and
in a substantially greater magnitude, the dynamics
of food prices constitute a relevant disinflationary
shock. With the prospect of a 5 percent price
reduction in the year, the food at home component
measured by the IPCA explains a large share of the
inflation deviation from the 4.5 percent target set
for the current year.

16. Regarding monetary policy, there was consensus
that, as in the case of other possible relative price
adjustments resulting from supply shocks, with
anchored inflation expectations, monetary policy
should only address the second-round effects of
these shocks. The Committee reiterates that its
reaction to possible changes in relative prices, such
as in food and possible adjustments of electric
power tariffs, will be symmetric, that is to say,
monetary policy will follow the same principles in
face of both inflationary and disinflationary supply
shocks.

17. The Copom discussed the levels and the path of
inflation, including the components that are most
sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy.
Some measures of underlying inflation were
considered to be at comfortable levels while others
at low levels. The Committee also discussed the
extent to which their trajectories are compatible
with the convergence of inflation towards the
target, within the relevant horizon for monetary
policy.

18. The Copom reaffirmed the view that monetary
policy has the flexibility to react to risks in both
directions: the risk that second-round effects of
supply shocks and the propagation of the low
current levels of inflation will lead to a lower-thanexpected prospective inflation trajectory, as well as
the risk of a setback in the global outlook in a
context of frustration of expectations about the
reforms and necessary adjustments.


running at comfortable levels, inflation projections a
little below target for 2018 and a high level of
economic slack prescribe accommodative monetary
policy, with interest rates below the structural level.
Although estimates of this rate involve a high
degree of uncertainty, Committee members
expressed an understanding that current _ex-ante_
real interest rates provide stimulus to the economy.

20. The Copom understands that the process of
reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian
economy contributes to the reduction of its
structural interest rate. The Committee will
continue to reassess estimates of this rate over
time.

21. The Committee understands that, for a given
estimate of the length of the monetary easing cycle,
the pace of easing depends on the stage of the
cycle, without necessarily reflecting changes in its
baseline scenario or risk balance.

22. All Copom members agreed that the evolution
of the outlook and the balance of risks since its
October meeting (210[th] meeting) took place as
expected, and were, therefore, compatible with the
Selic rate reduction to 7.0 percent per year.

23. The Committee then discussed the next step in
conducting monetary policy. On the one hand, they
evaluated that several measures of underlying
inflation are at comfortable or low levels, including
the components that are most sensitive to the
economic cycle and monetary policy, and reflected
on the path of inflation towards the target. On the
other hand, they pondered on the risk that the
current inflationary environment may be
interrupted by a frustration of expectations on the
continuity of the necessary reforms and
adjustments in the Brazilian economy, particularly in
a context of reversal of the current favorable
external scenario for emerging economies.

24. The Committee deemed appropriate to signal
that, as long as the outlook evolves according to the
Copom’s baseline scenario, and because of the stage
of the easing cycle, an additional moderate
reduction in the magnitude of easing at the next
meeting seems adequate from the current
perspective. However, they deemed appropriate to
warn that this view is more susceptible to changes in
the evolution of the scenario and associated risks
than in previous meetings.

again highlighted that the easing process will
continue to depend on the evolution of economic
activity, the balance of risks, possible reassessments
of the extension of the cycle length, and on inflation
projections and expectations.

27. All Committee members once again emphasized
that the approval and implementation of reforms –
notably those of a fiscal nature – and adjustments in
the Brazilian economy are fundamental for the
sustainability of the environment of low and stable
inflation, for the full operation of monetary policy
and for the reduction of the structural interest rate
of the economy, with widespread benefits for
society.

28. Finally, the Copom stressed the importance of
other initiatives aimed at productivity increases,
efficiency gains, greater flexibility of the economy
and improvements in the business environment.
These efforts are fundamental for the resumption
of economic activity and for the development of the
Brazilian economy.

## D) Monetary Policy Decision

29. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the
balance of risks, and the wide array of available
information, the Copom unanimously decided to
reduce the Selic rate by 0.5 percentage point, to 7.0
percent per year, without bias. The Committee
judges that convergence of inflation to the target
over the relevant horizon for the conduct of
monetary policy, which includes 2018 and 2019, is
compatible with the monetary easing process.

30. The Committee judges that economic conditions
prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e.,
interest rates below the structural level.

31. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of
reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian
economy contributes to the reduction of its
structural interest rate. The Committee will
continue to reassess estimates of this rate over
time.


Committee's baseline scenario evolves as expected,
and taking into account the stage of the monetary
easing cycle, at this time the Copom views an
additional moderate reduction of the pace of easing
as appropriate. The Committee views this guidance
as more susceptible to changes in its baseline
scenario and balance of risks than in the previous
meeting. Going forward, the Committee judges that
the current stage of the cycle recommends caution
in conducting monetary policy. The Copom
emphasizes that the monetary easing process will
continue to depend on the evolution of economic
activity, the balance of risks, possible reassessments
of the extension of the cycle, and on inflation
projections and expectations.

33. The following Committee members voted for
this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor), Carlos Viana
de Carvalho, Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira, Maurício
Costa de Moura, Otávio Ribeiro Damaso, Paulo
Sérgio Neves de Souza, Reinaldo Le Grazie, Sidnei
Corrêa Marques and Tiago Couto Berriel.

with expectations, and the stage of the monetary
