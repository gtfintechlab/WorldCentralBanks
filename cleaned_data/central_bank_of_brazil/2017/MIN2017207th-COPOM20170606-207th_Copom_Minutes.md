1. The set of indicators of economic activity
released since the last Copom meeting remains
consistent with stabilization of the economy in
the short run and a gradual recovery of economic
activity during the course of 2017. If sustained
over a long period, high levels of uncertainty
regarding the evolution of reforms and
adjustments in the economy can have
detrimental effects on economic activity.

2. The economy continues to operate with a high
level of economic slack, reflected in the low
industrial capacity utilization indices and, mainly,
in the unemployment rate.

3. Stronger global economic activity has so far
mitigated the effects on the Brazilian economy
of possible changes of economic policy in central
economies.

4. Inflation developments remain favorable.
Disinflation is widespread and includes IPCA
components that are most sensitive to the
business cycle and monetary policy. It is
necessary to monitor possible impacts of higher
uncertainty on the prospective path of inflation.

5. Inflation expectations collected by the Focus
survey are around 4.0% for 2017, 4.4% for 2018
and 4.25% for 2019 and longer horizons.

6. The path of administered prices underlying the
inflation scenarios produced by the Committee
assumes increases of 6.1% for 2017 and 5.5% for
2018.

7. The scenario with interest rate and exchange
rate paths extracted from the Focus survey
considers, among other assumptions, exchange
rates of R$3.25/US$ and R$3.37/US$ at the end
of 2017 and 2018, respectively, and interest
rates of 8.50% per annum (p.a.) at the end of the
same periods.

8. Under these assumptions, the Committee’s
inflation projection for 2017 is around 4.0%. The
projection for 2018 in this scenario is around
4.6%. The Committee emphasizes that its


## B) Risks around baseline inflation scenario

9. The Committee views the heightened
uncertainty regarding the speed of the process
of reforms and adjustments in the Brazilian
economy as the main risk factor. This arises from
both a higher probability of scenarios that may
hinder this process, and the difficulty in
assessing the effects of these scenarios on the
determinants of inflation. These determinants
include economic activity, inflation expectations,
estimates of the structural interest rate, and
prices of relevant financial assets. There are
other risks around the baseline scenario:

10. The global outlook, despite currently favorable,
involves a considerable level of uncertainty and
might make disinflation more difficult.

11. Disinflation in food and industrial prices might
produce second-round effects on inflation.
Notably, it might contribute to additional
reductions of inflation expectations and
inflation in other sectors of the economy.

12. Economic activity points to stabilization in the
short run and prospect of recovery, but the
economy resumption might be more (or less)
gradual and delayed than the anticipated.

## C) Discussion about the conduct of monetary policy

13. The Committee members discussed the
evolution of economic activity, in light of
available data. They all agreed that recent data
confirm the scenario of stabilization and
prospects of gradual economic recovery.
However, if sustained over a long period, high
levels of uncertainty regarding the evolution of
reforms and adjustments in the economy can
have detrimental effects on economic activity.

evolution of the global economy, despite the
uncertainties associated with possible changes
in economic policy in the United States, with the
evolution of commodity prices, with risk
appetite for emerging economies’ assets, and
with the outlook for the Chinese economy. They
also highlighted that the Brazilian economy
nowadays shows greater capacity to respond to
occasional negative developments in the global
economy, due to its more robust balance of
payments and to the progress in the
disinflationary process and in the anchoring of
expectations.

15. All Committee members agreed that the
prospects for inflation have evolved in a
favorable way. The members of the Committee
analyzed the inflation trajectory throughout this
and subsequent years. Considering the scenario
that conditions on paths of the interest rate and
exchange rate extracted from the Focus survey,
projections for 12-month inflation remain below
the 4.5% target throughout 2017. Projections
reach a trough in the third quarter of the year
and increase in the last months of the year to
values still below target. Part of this difference
can be attributed to the primary effects of the
favorable food price shock. This scenario
assumes an interest trajectory that reaches 8.5%
at the end of 2017 and 2018. In this scenario, the
inflation trajectory reaches 4.6% in 2018.

16. Members of the Committee assessed the
impacts of recent changes in regulated prices
(reduction of fuel prices and the return of green
flag on electricity tariffs) on short-term inflation.
It is estimated that these adjustments should
reduce June IPCA inflation by approximately 0.3
percentage point. All members concluded that
these one-off oscillations do not have relevant
implications for the conduct of monetary policy.

17. The members of the Committee discussed
possible impacts of increased uncertainty on the
prospective path of inflation. On the one hand,
they consider that, if sustained over a long
period, high levels of uncertainty regarding the
evolution of reforms and adjustments in the
economy can have detrimental effects on
economic activity, and hence be disinflationary.
On the other hand, the impact of uncertainty on
price setting and on estimates of the structural
interest rate can have the opposite direction. In
general, the members of the Committee
emphasized that, at this moment, the
conditional projections of the Copom involve
greater uncertainty. They concluded that there is
no direct and mechanical relationship between
the increase in uncertainty and monetary policy,
and that the flexibility of the inflation targeting
regime allows the Committee to adjust


18. The Copom members assessed the extension of
the monetary easing cycle, including its
implications for the level of interest rates
throughout 2018. The extension will depend on
the evolution of economic activity, on the other
aforementioned risk factors, on the projections
and expectations of IPCA inflation for 2018 and
2019, and also on the estimates for the
structural interest rate of Brazilian economy.
The Committee judges that the recent increase
in uncertainty regarding the evolution of
reforms and adjustments in the economy
hampers a more timely reduction of estimates of
the structural interest rate, and makes them
more uncertain. These estimates naturally
involve uncertainty and may be reassessed by
the Committee over time.

19. The Committee members reaffirmed the
understanding that, with anchored inflation
expectations, with inflation forecasts at the
target for 2018 and a little below target for
2017, and with the high level of economic slack,
the Copom's baseline scenario prescribes
continuation of the monetary easing cycle. This
understanding already considers the current
risks around the baseline scenario and the
estimates of the extension of the cycle.

20. The Committee understands that, for a given
estimate of its extension, the pace of monetary
easing depends on the stage of the cycle,
without necessarily reflecting changes in the
baseline scenario or in the balance of risks.

21. All members of the Copom agreed that the
evolution of the economy since the April Copom
meeting (206[th] meeting) is compatible with the
reduction of the Selic rate to 10.25 percent p.a.

22. Hence, the members of the Committee
discussed the next steps for monetary policy.
They assessed the pace of easing that would be
recommended for the next meeting and
whether early signaling of this possibility would
be advisable. The analysis regarding the
appropriate pace of easing involved
considerations about inflation and activity
projections, the estimates of the extension of
the cycle and its current stage, and the risks
surrounding the scenario and these estimates,
including those associated with the prospects
for reforms and adjustments in the economy.

regarding the evolution of the baseline scenario
(more inflationary or disinflationary than the
current one) and the balance of risks did not
recommend conjecturing on the possible pace to
be adopted in the future. On the other hand, the
need, at this moment, to provide guidance and
elements to reduce the uncertainty (and the
scope of possibilities) regarding the future
course of monetary policy was highlighted. The
Copom members concluded that a moderate
reduction in the pace of monetary easing should
be appropriate at its next meeting.
Nevertheless, they also emphasized that this
pace will continue to depend on the evolution of
economic activity, on the balance of risks, on
possible reassessments of the extension of the
cycle, and on inflation forecasts and
expectations.

23. The Committee members once again
emphasized that the environment with anchored
inflation expectations would allow the Copom to
focus on preventing second-round effects of
relative price adjustments that may occur over
time. This applies to the favorable food supply
shock and to the positive dynamics in prices of
industrial goods, but also to potential
inflationary relative price adjustments. The
Copom understands that it should seek to
identify the primary effects of these relative
price changes, to which monetary policy should
not react. Monetary policy should, then, focus on
possible second-round effects of those
adjustments, which might contribute to changes
in inflation projections and expectations.

24. All members of the Committee emphasized
again that the approval and implementation of
reforms, notably those of a fiscal nature, and of
adjustments in the Brazilian economy, including
those related to credit policy and of quasi-fiscal
nature, are fundamental to the sustainability of
disinflation, to the full operation of monetary
policy and to the reduction of its structural
interest rate, with widespread benefits for
society.

25. Finally, the Committee members highlighted the
importance of other reforms and investments in
infrastructure aimed at increasing productivity,
efficiency gains, greater flexibility of the
economy, and improvement of the business
environment. These efforts are fundamental for
the stabilization and resumption of the
economic activity and for the development of
the Brazilian economy.


26. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the
balance of risks, and the wide array of available
information, the Copom unanimously decided to
reduce the Selic rate by one percentage point, to
10.25 percent per year, without bias. The
Committee judges that convergence of inflation
to the 4.5% target over the relevant horizon for
the conduct of monetary policy, which includes
2017 and, to a greater extent, 2018, is
compatible with the monetary easing process.

27. The Copom emphasizes that the extension of
the monetary easing cycle will depend, among
other factors, on estimates of the structural
interest rate of the Brazilian economy. The
Committee judges that the recent increase in the
uncertainty regarding the evolution of reforms
and adjustments in the economy hampers a
more timely reduction of estimates of the
structural interest rate, and makes them more
uncertain. The Committee will continue to
reassess these estimates over time.

28. In light of the basic scenario and current balance
of risks, the Copom judges that a moderate
reduction of the pace of monetary easing
relative to the pace adopted today is likely to be
appropriate at its next meeting. Naturally, the
pace of monetary easing will continue to depend
on the evolution of economic activity, the
balance of risks, possible reassessments of the
extension of the cycle, and on inflation forecasts
and expectations.

29. The following members of the Committee voted
for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor),
Anthero de Moraes Meirelles, Carlos Viana de
Carvalho, Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira, Luiz
Edson Feltrim, Otávio Ribeiro Damaso, Reinaldo
Le Grazie, Sidnei Corrêa Marques, and Tiago
