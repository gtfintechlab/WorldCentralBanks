1. The set of indicators of economic activity released
since the last Copom meeting shows some mixed
signals, which are, however, consistent with
stabilization of the economy in the short run.
Available evidence suggests a gradual recovery of
economic activity during the course of 2017.


7. Under these hypotheses, the Committee’s
inflation forecast for 2017 retreated relative to the
one reported in the January Copom Minutes (204[th]
meeting), to around 4.2%. The forecast for 2018 in
this scenario remained around 4.5%.

8. The Committee’s inflation forecasts in the
scenario in which the interest rate and exchange
rate remain unchanged throughout the forecast
horizon at, respectively, 13.00% p.a., and
R$3.10/US$, are around 3.8% for 2017 and 3.3% for
2018[2].

inflation forecasts and expectations.


14. Regarding the global outlook, the Committee
members pointed out the continuation of
uncertainties associated with possible changes in
economic policy in the United States and also with
the outlook for the Chinese economy. Nevertheless,
they believe that the Brazilian economy nowadays
shows greater capacity to absorb occasional
negative developments in the global economy, due
to the progress in the disinflationary process and in
the anchoring of expectations.

15. All Committee members agreed that the
prospects for inflation have evolved in a favorable
way since the last Copom in January (204th meeting)
and, to a large extent, in line with expectations. The
broad set of core inflation measures followed by the
Copom points to inflation at levels compatible with
the target of 4.5% for 2017 and 2018. Inflation
expectations remain anchored.

16. The Committee members reaffirmed the
understanding that, with anchored inflation
expectations, with inflation forecasts at the target
for 2018 and marginally below the target for 2017,
and in light of the high level of economic slack, the
Copom's baseline scenario prescribes frontloading
the monetary easing cycle.

17. Regarding the extension of the cycle, i.e., the
accumulated reduction in the Selic rate at the end of
the monetary easing process, the discussion focused
on two different dimensions, both relevant for its
determination. The first dimension pertains to the
structural interest rate of the economy. This rate
depends on factors such as the economy's
productivity growth, the perspectives for fiscal
policy, the quality of the business and contractual
environment, the efficiency of resource allocation
through the financial system, and the quality of
economic policy. Measurement of the structural
interest rate involves a high level of uncertainty, and
necessarily requires judgment. The Committee
judges that the change of economic policy by the
government, with approval and implementation of
fiscal reforms - notably the social security reform besides others reforms and necessary adjustments
in economy, can reduce the structural interest rate
of the Brazilian economy. In this context, the
Committee will continue to reassess its estimates of
the structural interest rate of the economy over
time. This dimension generates changes for
monetary policy that are less frequent and more
structural.


18. The second dimension refers to conjunctural
aspects. The Committee understands that its
estimates of the extension of the ongoing monetary
easing cycle depend not only on the structural
interest rate trajectory envisaged for the economy,
but also on the evolution of economic activity, on
the other risk factors mentioned above, and on
inflation forecasts and expectations.

19. Regarding the pace of monetary easing over the
cycle, the Committee understands that, for a given
estimate of its extension, a possible acceleration of
the pace is equivalent to greater frontloading of the
cycle. Some members of the Committee pointed out
that the estimated extension may also be itself
revised, depending on the degree of frontloading of
the cycle.

20. All members of the Copom agreed that the
evolution of the economy since the January Copom
meeting was compatible with the reduction of the
Selic rate to 12.25 percent p.a.

21. Hence, the members of the Committee discussed
the next steps for monetary policy and expressed
preference for keeping more leeway for future
decisions, which will depend on the evolution of the
Copom's baseline scenario and on the
aforementioned risk factors. They emphasized the
fundamental condition that any future decision
should be compatible with the maintenance of
inflation projections at the target over the relevant
horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, and with
anchored inflation expectations. They also debated,
on the one hand, how monetary policy could
contribute to the stabilization process and
subsequent resumption of economic activity and, on
the other hand, the lagged effects that monetary
policy could have on 2018 inflation, which is now
forecast around the 4.5% target - both in Focus
survey and in the Copom’s conditional projection in
the market scenario.

22. The Committee members once again
emphasized that the environment with anchored
inflation expectations would allow the Copom to
focus on preventing second-round effects of relative
price adjustments that may occur over time. This
applies to the favorable food supply shock. The
Copom understands that the primary effects of this
supply shock, to which monetary policy should not
react, should be estimated taking into account
demand conditions in that sector. Monetary policy
should, then, focus on possible second-round effects
of this shock, which might contribute to additional
reductions of inflation expectations and of inflation
in other sectors of the economy.


14. Regarding the global outlook, the Committee
members pointed out the continuation of 19. Regarding the pace of monetary easing over the
uncertainties associated with possible changes in cycle, the Committee understands that, for a given

24. Finally, the Committee members highlighted the
importance of other reforms and investments in
infrastructure aimed at increasing productivity,
efficiency gains, greater flexibility of the economy,
and improvement of the business environment.
These efforts are fundamental for the stabilization
and resumption of the economic activity and for the
development of the Brazilian economy.

## D) Monetary Policy Decision

25. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the
current balance of risks, and the wide array of
available information, the Copom unanimously
decided to reduce the Selic rate to 12.25 percent per
year, without bias. The Committee judges that

relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy,

weight, 2018, is compatible with the ongoing

depend not only on the estimated extension of the
cycle, but also on the evolution of economic activity,
on the other risk factors, and on inflation forecasts
and expectations.
