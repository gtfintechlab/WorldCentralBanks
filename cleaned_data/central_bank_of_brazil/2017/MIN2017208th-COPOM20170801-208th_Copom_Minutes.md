## A) Update of economic outlook and Copom’s baseline scenario[1]

1. The set of indicators of economic activity
released since the last Copom meeting remains
consistent with stabilization of the Brazilian
economy in the short run and gradual recovery.
The recent increase in uncertainty regarding the
evolution of reforms and adjustments in the
economy had a negative impact on confidence
indices. However, available information
suggests that the impact of this drop in
confidence on economic activity has been
limited so far.

2. The economy continues to operate with a high
level of economic slack, reflected in the low
industrial capacity utilization indices and, mainly,
in the unemployment rate.

3. The global outlook has been favorable, as global
economic activity remains on a gradual recovery
path, without pressuring financial conditions in
developed economies. This has contributed to
support risk appetite towards emerging
economies. In addition, changes in economic
policy in some central economies have become
less likely.

4. Inflation developments remain favorable.
Disinflation is widespread and includes IPCA
components that are most sensitive to the
business cycle and monetary policy. So far, the
short-run effects of higher uncertainty regarding
the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the
economy have been neither inflationary nor
disinflationary.

5. Inflation expectations collected by the Focus
survey for 2017 and 2018 fell to around 3.3% and
4.2%, respectively. Expectations for 2019 are
around 4.25%, and expectations for 2020 are
around 4.00%.

6. The path of administered prices underlying the
inflation scenarios produced by the Committee
assumes increases of 6.6% for 2017 and 5.3% for
2018.

9. The uncertainty regarding the evolution of
reforms and adjustments in the Brazilian
economy (especially those that pertain to fiscal
and credit policies) remains as the main risk
factor.

10. The global outlook, despite currently favorable,
still carries risks associated with the monetary
policy normalization process in central
economies, with changes in economic policy in
some central economies, and with possible
impacts on risk appetite for emerging
economies’ assets.

The Committee members also discussed the
continuation of risks associated with the
monetary policy normalization process in central
economies and with the outlook for the Chinese
economy, with possible impacts on risk appetite
for emerging economies’ assets. They also
highlighted that the Brazilian economy
nowadays shows greater capacity to respond to
occasional negative developments in the global
economy, due to its more robust balance of
payments and to the progress in the
disinflationary process and in the anchoring of
expectations.

15. All Committee members agreed that the
prospects for inflation have evolved in a
favorable way. The members of the Committee
analyzed the inflation trajectory throughout this
and subsequent years. Considering the scenario
that conditions on paths of the interest rate and
exchange rate extracted from the Focus survey,
projections for 12-month inflation reach a
trough in the third quarter of the year and
increase in the last months of the year to around
3.6% in December. Part of this difference in
relation to the 4.5% target for 2017 can be
attributed to the primary effects of the
favorable food price shock. This scenario
assumes an interest trajectory that reaches 8.0%
at the end of 2017 and 2018. In this scenario, the
inflation trajectory reaches 4.3% in 2018.

16. Members of the Committee assessed the
impacts on short-term inflation of the recent
increase of PIS/Confins on fuel prices. The total
impact on IPCA inflation is estimated at 0.45 p.p.,
over the months of July and August, but with
higher concentration in August. Part of this
impact was already embedded in the Copom’s
conditional forecasts. The members of the
Committee also debated the impact on July IPCA
inflation of the change in the flag on electricity
tariffs from green to yellow, which is estimated
at around 0.15 p.p. All concluded that these oneoff oscillations – in particular the ones related to
fuel and electricity adjustments, which have
been more volatile – do not have relevant
implications for the conduct of monetary policy.

17. The members of the Committee assessed the
possible impacts of increased uncertainty
related to the pace of reforms and adjustments
in the economy on the prospective path of
inflation. They concluded that the available
information suggests limited impacts so far,
both through inflationary and disinflationary
channels.


18. The Copom members assessed the extension of
the monetary easing cycle, including its
implications for the level of interest rates
throughout 2018. The extension will depend on
the evolution of cyclical factors (evolution of
economic activity, of the other aforementioned
risk factors and of the projections and
expectations of IPCA inflation for 2018 and
2019), and also on the estimates for the
structural interest rate of Brazilian economy.
The Committee judges that the evolution of
reforms and adjustments in the economy
(especially those that pertain to fiscal and credit
policies) is important to the reduction of the
structural interest rate. These estimates
naturally involve uncertainty and will continue to
be reassessed by the Committee over time.

19. The Committee members reaffirmed the
understanding that, with anchored inflation
expectations, with inflation forecasts a little
below target for 2018 and with the high level of
economic slack, the Copom's baseline scenario
prescribes continuation of the monetary easing
cycle. This understanding already considers the
current risks around the baseline scenario and
the estimates of the extension of the cycle.

20. The Committee understands that, for a given
estimate of its extension, the pace of monetary
easing depends on the stage of the cycle,
without necessarily reflecting changes in the
baseline scenario or in the balance of risks.

21. All members of the Copom agreed that, despite
the increased uncertainty related to the pace of
implementation of reforms and adjustments in
the economy, the evolution of the economy
since the May Copom meeting (207[th] meeting) is
compatible with the reduction of the Selic rate
to 9.25 percent p.a.

22. Hence, the members of the Committee
discussed the next steps for monetary policy. In
this context, they assessed the convenience of
signaling the possible magnitudes of monetary
easing at the next meeting. The analysis
regarding the convenience of signaling and the
suitable magnitude of monetary easing involved
considerations about the projections for
inflation and economic activity, the estimates of
the extension of the cycle and its current stage,
and the risks surrounding the scenario and these
estimates, including those associated with the
prospects for reforms and adjustments in the
economy.

23. The Copom members agreed on the importance
of signaling, but reaffirmed their preference for
communicating conditionalities for the
evolution of monetary policy, which better
transmits the economic rationality that guides
their decisions. This contributes to increase
transparency and improve Copom
communication.

24. The Committee discussed the convenience of
signaling an additional easing of the same
magnitude as the one adopted at this meeting,
versus a more moderate easing. They decided to
signal, for the next Copom meeting, a possible
monetary easing of the same magnitude as the
one adopted at the current meeting, but which
will depend on the continuation of the
conditions described in the Copom’s baseline
scenario and on the estimates of the extension
of the cycle. In general, the magnitude of
monetary easing will continue to depend on the
evolution of economic activity, the balance of
risks, possible reassessments of the extension of
the cycle, and on inflation forecasts and
expectations.

25. The Committee members once again
emphasized that the environment with anchored
inflation expectations would allow the Copom to
focus on preventing second-round effects of
relative price adjustments that may occur over
time. The Copom understands that it should seek
to identify the primary effects of these relative
price changes, to which monetary policy should
not react. Monetary policy should, then, focus on
possible second-round effects of those
adjustments, which might contribute to changes
in inflation projections and expectations.

26. Also in light of the recent increase in
uncertainty, all members of the Committee
emphasized again that the approval and
implementation of reforms, notably those of
fiscal and credit nature, and of adjustments in
the Brazilian economy, are fundamental to the
sustainability of disinflation, to the full
operation of monetary policy, and to the
reduction of its structural interest rate, with
widespread benefits for society.

27. Finally, the Committee members highlighted the
importance of other reforms (such as the recent
approval of the labor reform) and investments in
infrastructure aimed at increasing productivity,
efficiency gains, greater flexibility of the
economy, and improvement of the business
environment. These efforts are fundamental for

transparency and improve Copom **D) Monetary Policy Decision**


28. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the
balance of risks, and the wide array of available
information, the Copom unanimously decided to
reduce the Selic rate by one percentage point, to
9.25 percent per year, without bias. The
Committee judges that convergence of inflation
to the 4.5% target over the relevant horizon for
the conduct of monetary policy, which includes
2018, is compatible with the monetary easing
process.

29. The Copom emphasizes that the extension of
the monetary easing cycle will depend on cyclical
factors and on estimates of the structural
interest rate of the Brazilian economy. The
Committee judges that the evolution of reforms
and adjustments in the economy (especially
those that pertain to fiscal and credit policies) is
important for the reduction of estimates of the
structural interest rate. The Committee will
continue to reassess these estimates over time.

30. The Copom emphasizes that, despite the
increase in uncertainty regarding the evolution
of reforms and adjustments in the economy, the
continuation of economic conditions so far has
allowed the same pace of monetary easing at the
current meeting. Regarding the next Copom
meeting, maintenance of this pace will depend
on the continuation of conditions described in
the Committee's baseline scenario and on
estimates of the extension of the monetary
easing cycle. The pace of easing will continue to
depend on the evolution of economic activity,
the balance of risks, possible reassessments of
the extension of the cycle, and on inflation
forecasts and expectations.
