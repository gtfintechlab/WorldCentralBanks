**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON MONETARY POLICY ISSUES**

**HELD ON 11 DECEMBER 2014[1]**


**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board (MB) decided to:

a) Maintain the BSP’s key policy interest rates at 4.00 percent for the overnight RRP
(borrowing) facility and 6.00 percent for the overnight RP (lending) facility;

b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs and SDAs; and

c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

  - The MB’s decision was based on its assessment that the inflation environment has become
more manageable, with the risks to the inflation outlook remaining broadly balanced over
the policy horizon. Latest baseline forecasts showed a lower inflation path for 2014-2016
relative to the previous policy meeting, reflecting in large part the subdued outlook for
global commodity prices. Inflation expectations were also generally lower and remained
aligned to the inflation target. Meanwhile, output growth moderated in Q3 2014 as
agricultural production declined amid unfavorable weather conditions and as public
spending slowed down.

  - The MB noted that while global economic conditions remained challenging, prospects for
domestic activity continue to be firm, supported by strong domestic private demand,
robust bank lending growth, and buoyant business sentiment.

  - The MB is of the view that prevailing monetary policy settings remain appropriate given
the manageable inflation outlook and favorable domestic growth prospects. The MB
emphasized that the BSP will continue to monitor evolving price and output developments
and remain prepared to take appropriate measures as necessary to ensure that the
monetary policy stance continues to support an environment characterized by price and
financial stability.

1 The discussions presented reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the information available at the time of the policy
meeting. A comprehensive set of economic information was provided by the Technical Secretariat of the Advisory Committee (AC). The AC is
composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely: the Deputy Governor of the Monetary Stability Sector, the Deputy
Governor of the Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Sub-Sector, and the Assistant Governor of the
Treasury Department. The highlights of the discussions on the 11 December 2014 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular

**III.   Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook**

The MB considered the following developments in deciding its policy stance:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Year-on-year headline inflation decelerated further in November. Other indicators also
eased such as the official core inflation, all alternative measures of core inflation estimated
by the BSP, seasonally-adjusted month-on-month and 3-month moving average annualized
headline and core inflation, and weight of above-threshold items.

  - The continued deceleration of headline inflation in November was driven largely by the
lower prices of electricity and domestic petroleum products along with the slower
increases in food prices. Non-food inflation edged lower due mainly to lower pump prices
of diesel and gasoline (reflecting declines in international oil prices), price reductions in
kerosene and LPG as well as the downward adjustment in electricity rates as a result of
lower generation charges. Similarly, food inflation slowed down on adequate domestic
supply of key food items, particularly rice, corn, meat, oils, vegetables, and sugar.

  - By geographical location, inflation in the National Capital Region (NCR) and areas outside
NCR decreased to 2.4 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively, in November from 3.6 percent
and 4.5 percent a month ago.

**B.  Inflation expectations**

  - Inflation expectations—reflected in forecast surveys in November—were generally lower
compared to the previous month and aligned to the inflation target. Results of the BSP’s
November 2014 survey of private sector economists yielded lower inflation forecasts for
2014 and 2015 at 4.2 percent (from 4.3 percent in October) and 3.9 percent (from
4.0 percent) respectively. Meanwhile, the mean inflation forecast for 2016 was steady at
3.8 percent. Results of the November 2014 Consensus Economics inflation forecast survey
for the country showed a steady mean inflation forecast for 2014 at 4.3 percent and a
lower mean inflation forecast for 2015 at 3.7 percent (from 3.9 percent in October).

**C.  Inflation outlook**

  - The latest outlook for inflation showed a lower path for 2014-2016. The downward
adjustment in the forecasted inflation path could be attributed mainly to lower oil prices
and lower-than-projected inflation in October and November 2014. Current forecasts
suggest that inflation is likely to settle slightly above the midpoint of the
4.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point target range in 2014 and 3.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage
point target range in 2015. It is expected to be close to the lower-end of the
3.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point target range for 2016.

  - Risks to future inflation are broadly balanced. Pending petitions for utility rate adjustments
and looming power shortage pose upside risks to inflation while downside risks could stem
from slower global economic activity.

**D. Demand conditions**

  - GDP growth decelerated in Q3 2014 to 5.3 percent, driven mainly by government
underspending. The slowdown was across the board but the composition of growth
remained similar to that seen in the first half of 2014. Growth in the third quarter was
driven on the production side by the industry (particularly manufacturing) and services
sectors. On the demand side, household consumption, fixed capital formation, and net
exports supported growth, indicating resilience and underlying strength in private
demand.

  - Other indicators continued to point to positive growth momentum in the fourth quarter.
Business expectations turned more upbeat in Q4 2014 compared to Q3 2014, driven by
expectations of an acceleration in the roll-out of infrastructure and other development
projects under the public-private partnership (PPP) program and the favorable
macroeconomic conditions in the country. The results of the monthly Purchasing
Managers’ Index (PMI) survey likewise indicated that domestic output continue to expand
in October 2014 after slowing down in Q3 partly due to supply chain problems. The
sustained expansion in bank lending also supports the view that underlying domestic
demand remains strong.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - The Agriculture sector contracted in Q3 2014 mainly driven by production cutbacks on
_palay, corn, coconut including copra, and poultry, which were adversely affected by_
typhoons Glenda and Luis, and the monsoon rain. Forestry and fishing sub-sector also
posted negative growth during the quarter. Meanwhile, the retail prices of rice eased in
November 2014 due to the ongoing harvest season.

Oil Price Developments

  - Oil prices decreased further in October on weak global demand outlook. Oil prices
continued to drop in November as Saudi Arabia’s price cuts bolstered concerns of a global
glut in oil supply. Tracking the movement of international oil prices, the domestic pump
prices of petroleum products, except LPG, were lowered on 18 November.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

  - Lower generation costs pulled electricity rates lower in November. According to Meralco,
the decline was primarily due to the improved availability of power plants and lower fuel
cost for the supply month of October.

**F. Financial market developments**

    - The local bourse surged in early November due to the news of fresh stimulus from Japan.

For the remainder of the month, investor sentiment was boosted by easing domestic
inflation in October; post-election rally in US equity prices; selective buying over betterthan-expected corporate earnings in Q3, especially of listed companies in the real estate
sector, and the OECD’s optimism about the country’s growth prospects. Most regional
markets also rose in November on the back of upbeat investor sentiment following
stimulus announcement by China and Japan. Peso weakened over the US dollar on
concerns that an increase in US interest rates would spur capital outflows from emerging
markets. Meanwhile, debt spreads also narrowed in November.

**G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions**

    - M3 grew by 15.4 percent in October to P7.2 trillion. This pace of increase was slower than

the 16.2-percent expansion recorded in the previous month. On a month-on-month basis,
seasonally-adjusted M3 rose by 0.9 percent, following the 0.3-percent increase (revised) in
the previous month.

    - Similarly, the outstanding loans of commercial banks, net of reverse repurchase (RRP)
placements with the BSP, grew by 21.1 percent in October. Similarly, bank lending
inclusive of RRPs expanded by 20.0 percent from the 19.5 percent growth posted in the
previous month. On a month-on-month seasonally-adjusted basis, commercial bank
lending increased by 1.4 percent for loans net of RRPs and by 1.2 percent for loans
inclusive of RRPs.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

    - The fiscal deficit for the period January-September 2014 was P31.1 billion, lower than the

P101.2-billion deficit incurred during the same period in 2013. Meanwhile, netting out the
interest payments in the expenditures, the primary surplus amounted to P226.3 billion,
P69.4 billion higher than the level recorded in the period January-September 2013.

**I.  External developments**

    - The outlook for the global economy continued to show divergence in growth paths for the
major economies. On the one hand, economic activity in the US has continued to
strengthen. On the other hand, there was greater unease over the prospects of other large
economies resulting from the sharp decline in Japanese GDP growth and the Chinese
economy’s moderating growth. The recovery in the euro area remained fragile. Moreover,
concerns over deflation or a protracted period of very low inflation, an indication of
substantial output gaps in advanced economies, also remain.
