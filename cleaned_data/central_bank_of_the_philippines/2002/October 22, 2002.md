**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES  HELD ON 23 OCTOBER 2002[∗]**


**Background**

The Monetary Board held its eleventh meeting on monetary policy issues
on 23 October 2002. This followed the 22 October 2002 meeting of the Advisory
Committee.[1] The Advisory Committee submitted, for the Monetary Board’s
consideration, a policy paper along with a comprehensive set of economic and
financial indicators relevant for the deliberation on monetary policy. In
particular, the policy paper prepared by the Advisory Committee contained the
committee’s assessment of the macroeconomic conditions and inflation outlook,
which formed the basis for its recommendations on the appropriate monetary
policy stance. During the meeting, the Monetary Board discussed the factors that
could affect inflation and inflation expectations, including the forecasts of
agricultural production, movements of the exchange rate, direction of world oil
prices, possible adjustments in power and water rates, monetary conditions,
demand and output indicators, fiscal developments, world economic conditions
and outlook, and the implications of these factors on the BSP’s monetary policy
stance.

**I. Considerations in  the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

**Domestic Price Developments and Outlook**

**1.  Despite pressures coming from the recent uptick in international oil prices,**
year-on-year headline inflation in September 2002 remained stable at 2.9 percent,
the same rate posted a month earlier. Month-on-month headline inflation slowed

∗ The highlights of the discussions of the 23 October 2002 Monetary Board meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its meeting held on 21 November 2002.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely
the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy Governor for
Supervision and Examination Sector, the Managing Director, In-Charge of Research or the Director of the
Department of Economic Research, and the Director of the Treasury Department.

down to 0.2 percent in September after a brief pick-up to 0.5 percent in August.
The reduced electricity costs since June 2002 coupled with generally lower food
prices muted the impact of higher prices for other consumer items such as
gasoline products, clothing and related products, as well as housing and repairs.
The nine-month average inflation of 3.3 percent was more than a full percentage
point lower than the 2002 target.[2]

**2.  Despite continued signs of improvement, aggregate demand for the most part**
remained relatively soft. Exports rose by 14.8 percent in August but this
represents a slowdown from the 23 percent  expansion  in the previous month.
Spare capacity in manufacturing also remained sizeable at about a quarter of
firms’ total output capacity. Credit conditions have remained  relatively weak
despite some improvements in August. Energy sales by Meralco declined  by
1.6 percent in August, after rising by 3.7 percent year-on-year in July. In
addition, the  unemployment  rate rose  to  11.2 percent in July 2002 from
10.1 percent in the same period a year ago. These developments signaled that
demand-side price pressures on inflation would remain relatively tamed in the
near term.

**Domestic price conditions remain generally favorable despite the**
**presence of cost-side pressures on inflation emanating from the recent**
**increases in world oil prices. The current subdued inflation environment is**
**expected to continue for the remainder of 2002 with the full-year average**
**inflation rate falling below the government’s target of 4.5-5.5 percent.**

**Developments in Agriculture**

**3.** According to PAGASA, there is a 65 percent likelihood of a mild to moderate
El Niño episode relative to the 1997-98 occurrence.[3] This would  have an initial
impact in the form of water shortages and droughts beginning in the fourth
quarter of 2002 in Mindanao and other regions in the country, which
would extend up to the first half of 2003.

2 The government’s revised inflation target for 2002 is 4.5-5.5 percent.

**4.  The dry spell in  some  parts of the country combined with the delayed**
planting season during the second quarter would likely reduce  agricultural
production in the third quarter. Hence, total palay and corn production for the
year were estimated to decline by 2.1 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively, from
their year-ago levels. However, timely importation as well as gains in the
production of other crops, livestock and poultry could cushion the impact of
lower production in rice and corn production for the year.  The entire agricultural
sector was expected to grow by 2.7-3.6 percent in 2002 from the 3.9 percent
in the previous year.[ 4]

**5.** In addition to the support under the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization
Act (AFMA), the government’s rice import program could also help to mitigate
the adverse impact of El Niño on food supply and rice prices. As of 11 October
2002,  the  total rice imports of the government  reached  1.045 million MT,
equivalent to  92 percent of the total  contracted rice importation for the period
January-October 2002.[5]  Moreover, as of 11 October 2002, the national rice
inventory[6] of  1.3 million metric tons (MT) was sufficient to last for 51 days,

much higher than the 15 days security benchmark for rice self-sufficiency.[ 7]

**The impact of a mild episode of the El Nino weather disturbance will be**
**complemented by the implementation of the government’s mitigating**
**measures. This could help ensure adequate food supply at relatively stable**
**prices in the near term.**

**Exchange rate developments**

**6. The peso fell for the fifth straight month to settle at an average of**
P52.83/US$1 for the period 1-18 October 2002, down by P0.67 from
P52.16/US$1 in September.[8] On 18 October 2002, the peso breached the
P53/US$1 level, registering a daily average of P53.19/US$1, the lowest since 8
August 2001. Increased corporate demand for dollars combined with market fears
over the heightened US-Iraq tensions and renewed threats to domestic and

international security following the recent bombings in Mindanao and Bali,
Indonesia and recently, in Metro Manila exerted pressures on the exchange rate.
In addition, the rising fiscal deficit continued to weigh down on market
sentiment.  However,  the seasonal inflows of overseas workers’ remittances
toward the year-end could help mitigate possible pressures on the peso. In
terms of volatility, the peso remained broadly stable as its standard deviation
eased slightly  to P0.20 for the period 1-18 October compared to P0.28 in
September 2002.

**7.  Recent estimates showed that a one peso depreciation of the exchange rate**
would translate into an increase in the average annual rate of inflation by about
0.11 percentage point over a 12-month period.[9] On the other hand, a moderate
depreciation of the peso would also help improve the country’s external
competitiveness. On a trade-weighted basis and in real terms, the peso
depreciated relative to the basket of currencies of major trading partners by about
2.6 percent in September 2002 from its’ level in December 2001. Similarly, the
peso tracked a depreciation trend vis-à-vis the currency baskets of competitor
countries as reflected in the decline in the real effective exchange rate (REER) of
the peso against the broad and narrow baskets of competitor currencies by about
3.4 percent and 9.5 percent, respectively. These developments indicated a small
but sustained improvement in the country’s external price competitiveness.[10]

**Market concerns over the fiscal deficit and the threat of a US-led**
**attack against Iraq continue to weigh down on the peso. Nevertheless, the**
**exchange rate has been relatively less volatile compared to the previous**
**month.**

**Oil price developments**

**8.** Dubai crude oil prices in the international market increased further  by
US$0.31 per barrel or 1.1 percent to average US$27.11 per barrel for the period 114 October 2002 from US$26.80 per barrel in September 2002 following the US
Congress’ approval of a military offensive aimed at disarming Iraq, which was

and the United Kingdom. The broad basket is composed of the currencies of Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong while the narrow basket is composed of the
currencies of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand only.

alleged to be maintaining biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction.
The October average price was the highest level observed since November 2001.

**9. Following the uptrend in world oil prices, the local pump prices of petroleum**
products rose by an average of P0.50 per liter on 9 October from their posted
levels on 6 September 2002, the last time that domestic oil prices were raised.
The net increase thus far in domestic oil prices for 2002 was P2.10 per liter for
gasoline, P1.90 per liter for diesel and P2.14 per liter for kerosene.[11]  Similarly,
local oil companies raised the prices of their LPG products thrice—between July
and October this year—by a total  of P1.70 per liter.   Apart from geopolitical
risks, the recent  weakness  in the peso also contributed to the increases in
domestic pump prices of oil.

**10. In the futures market, the price of the benchmark Brent crude oil showed a**
modest decline as November 2002 deliveries reached US$27.99 per barrel from
the US$28.55 price per barrel quoted in the previous month.[12] The existing large
excess capacity of OPEC— as a result of  sharp production cuts   over the past
few years—provided assurance that OPEC has the ability to respond to any
disruption in oil supplies should the tension in the Middle East escalate into a war.
In particular, Saudi Arabia has indicated that it would increase its own oil output
if Iraq supplies were disrupted and would push for an OPEC production quota
increase should the price of oil exceed US$28  per barrel for 20 days.[13]

**11.** Based on BSP’s estimates, a one-percent increase  in domestic oil prices
would raise average inflation by about 0.05 percentage point over a 12-month
period.[14] With the series of  increases in the pump prices of domestic petroleum
products, transport operators could soon file their petitions before the Land
Transportation Fare Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for an increase in the minimum
transport fare by P1.00 for the first 5 kms. to P5.00.

for kerosene and diesel oil (Source: Department of Energy).

14 This is based on the assumption of a one percent increase in the price of domestic petroleum products—
arising from higher world oil price—from P14.05 per liter in September 2002 to P14.35 per liter for October
2002-Novermber 2003.  The total impact on inflation, which includes the  feedback on other commodities
and services such as transport fares is estimated at about 0.16 percentage point increase in the average annual
inflation.

**The recent increases in world oil prices have prompted similar**
**adjustments in local pump prices. Since oil is a major input of production,**
**the prospects of higher local pump prices of oil products could trigger**
**upward adjustments in the prices of other goods and services including**
**transport fares and wages.**

**Developments in the Utilities Sector**

**12.** The Department of Energy (DOE) has assured the public that the recent
increases in oil prices would not have a significant impact on electricity rates
since oil accounted for only a small percentage of the country’s power generation
mix. The DOE reported that a 10-percent increase in the price of bunker fuel per
liter could only lead to a minimal one-centavo per kwh increase in the fuel cost
adjustment component of National Power Corporation’s (Napocor) electricity
rates in the Luzon grid while a 50-percent increase in diesel fuel will translate
only to a one-centavo per kwh increase.[15] However, the Manila Electric
Company (Meralco) has already announced that it would raise its purchased
power adjustment (PPA) charges for October by P0.14 per kwh to reflect the
upward adjustments in the selling rates—due mainly to fuel cost adjustment—of
Meralco’s suppliers.[16]

**13.** Meanwhile, Meralco’s proposal for the unbundling of its power rates could
raise the cost of electricity consumption by an average of an average of
P1.12 per kwh.[ 17] The ERC has yet to reach a decision on Meralco’s proposed
unbundling of power rates.

**14.** At the same time, there are plans to establish the Wholesale Electricity Spot
Market (WESM) and introduce the Special Program to Enhance Electricity
Demand (SPEED). Under the WESM scheme, electricity will be traded at the
spot market, where power generators would compete against each other to
supply power to distributors. The creation of the WESM is aimed at ensuring
efficiency and transparency in power generation charges. Based on DOE’s

estimates,  the  operation of  the proposed WESM could reduce further  the
cost of electricity  by  about  P0.40 per kwh. The DOE would also introduce a
“declining block” rate structure for large end-users of  power under the SPEED
program, which would offer discounts for incremental energy consumption
over a specified base load.

**15. Meanwhile, the proposed adjustments in water rates would likely take**
effect in 2003, leaving the current water rates steady for the rest of the year. It
could be recalled that the Manila Water Company (MWC) and Maynilad Water
Services Inc. (MWSI) have earlier filed a petition for upward adjustments in
water rates with the regulatory agency, Manila Waterworks and Sewerage System
(MWSS).[18] The MWSS has decided to put on hold its decision on the said petition
pending a review of the revised estimates submitted by the two water
concessionaires.

**User charges for utilities are likely to remain relatively steady for the**
**rest of 2002 as the petitions for the adjustments in power and water charges**
**are still being reviewed by the appropriate regulatory agencies.**

**Interest rates and interest rate differentials**

**16. The differentials between RP and foreign interest rates were generally on an**
uptrend during first half of October 2002 as RP market interest rates edged up
while foreign interest rates   declined. As of 14 October 2002, the differentials
between the RP 91-day T-bill rate (net of withholding tax) and the 90-day
LIBOR and US 90-day T-bill rate widened further to 245.5 basis points and
266.0 basis points respectively, from the 235.8 basis points and 247.2 basis
points registered in 16 September 2002.[19]

or RRP rate) and the US federal funds target rate was unchanged at 525 basis

points as the BSP policy rates and the US federal funds target rate remained
steady at their 15 March 2002 and December 2001 levels, respectively.

**18.** However, adjusted for the risk premium—that is, the differential between the
BSP policy interest rate and the US federal funds target rate less the risk
premium—the differential in the RP-US policy rates narrowed further in October
by an average of 28 basis points. The narrowing trend could be attributed to the
increase in the risk premium for RP bonds.[20]

**19. In the domestic market, the RP 91-day T-bill rate for the first half of October**
rose  from 5.2 percent in September to 5.288 percent at the 14 October 2002
auction. The increase in yields reflected mainly market apprehensions over the
widening budget deficit and  threats against domestic and international security.

**The RP-US interest rate differentials sustain its uptrend in October**
**due, in part, to the easing trend of foreign interest rates. Meanwhile, the**
**continued rise in the risk premium for RP bonds has led to a further**
**narrowing of the risk-adjusted RP-US interest rate differentials.**

**20. The Philippines’ real lending rate  (based on the low-end of the range of**
banks’ lending rates) for the period 10-16 October 2002, declined slightly to
5.26 percent from the 5.28 percent registered during the review period 4-11
September 2002[21]. The country’s real lending rate was the fourth lowest in a
sample of Asian countries after South Korea, Malaysia,  and Japan, which had
real lending rates of 4.27 percent,  4.39 percent and 2.61 percent, respectively.
By contrast, the highest lending rates were 8.41 percent for Hong Kong and 8.18
percent for Taiwan,  a result partly of  zero to negative inflation rates.

**The Philippines continues to have one of the lowest real lending rates**
**in the Asian region.**

**21. Based on data on bid yields,  the  yield curve for government securities in**
the secondary market as of 14 October 2002 generally shifted upward—except for

the 5-year and 20-year maturities—relative to that which prevailed on 16
September 2002.[22]

**Unresolved concerns over the widening budget deficit as well as in**
**international and domestic security push up the yields of government**
**securities in the secondary market.**

**Domestic stock market movements**

**22.** The modest gain in the composite index in September proved to be
unsustainable as the PHISIX tumbled to a fresh low in October. The average
PHISIX for the period 1-18 October 2002 dropped to 1,075.47—the lowest so far
for the year. Moreover, the daily PHISIX closed at 1,027.67 on 18 October
2002—the lowest since 20 November 2001.  Worries over the US-led offensive
against Iraq,  the slow upturn in the world economy, the depreciation of the peso
and the increasing fiscal gap combined to  dampen market sentiment.
Investor confidence was also hurt by domestic security concerns following the
incidence of bombings at home and overseas.

**23. The soft tone of the local equities market was also reflected in the thin volume**
and value of transactions. For the period 1-18 October 2002, the volume of
transactions settled at 2.4 billion shares, 4.0 percent lower than 2.5 billion shares
recorded for the comparable period in September while value turnover dropped by
72.7 percent to P4.1 billion from P15.0 billion during the same period.
Meanwhile, total foreign transactions in the domestic stock market declined by
26.6 percent from P4.4 billion pesos in the previous month to P3.2 billion pesos in
the review period. Foreign investors have also maintained their net selling
position with foreign selling outpacing foreign buying by P454 million.[23]

**Most market analysts believe that the stock market will remain in a**
**consolidation phase over the near term, with the tone of the market dictated**
**largely by external developments. In particular, the resolution of the crisis in**
**the Middle East is likely to be a key factor in setting the direction of the**
**market.**

**Monetary aggregates and bank lending**

**24.** Domestic liquidity (M3) growth accelerated to 7.7 percent as of end-August
from the 7.1 percent year-on-year increase registered as of end-July. However,
the end-August growth was still considerably below the  projected year-onyear  growth of  M3   of  about 13 percent for end-2002.

**25.** Loans outstanding of commercial banks (KBs) reached P1.376 trillion as of
end-August 2002, 2.0 percent lower compared to the P1.404 trillion recorded
during the same period in the previous year. This, however, reflected an
improvement from the 2.9 percent year-on-year contraction in the previous
month.

**26. The volume of banks’ placements under the RRP window declined by P5.0**
billion to reach P99.6 billion as of 11 October 2002 from the P104.7 billion as of
end-September 2002. Similarly, placements under the SDA declined by P3.0
billion to reach P2.4 billion.  Compared to the levels as of end-December 2001,
RRP and SDA placements registered an increase of P71.4 billion and P2.4 billion,
respectively, from P28.2 billion and zero worth of placements.

**Despite some improvements, credit conditions remain generally soft.**
**The tentativeness in bank lending could be attributed, in part, to the weak**
**corporate credit demand. Meanwhile, the increase of holdings by banks of**
**government securities could have led to the decline in bank placements under**
**the RRP and SDA windows of the BSP.**

**Fiscal developments**

**27.** At  P144.0 billion the NG budget deficit as of August 2002 has  exceeded
the target for 2002 by about P14 billion. However,  the  P10.9 billion deficit
for the month of August was significantly  lower than the average monthly
deficit of P20 billion  during the first semester. Efforts of the government to
prevent a further increase in the budget deficit level were undertaken
through improvements in revenue collections and  restraint  in spending.

**28.** In the short term, a breach of the budget deficit target could still be
manageable given the adequate prefunding efforts of the National Government
(NG). However, a further increase in the fiscal underperformance over the
medium term could pose risks to macroeconomic management.  In particular,

**23-10-2002** **10**


-----

#                                 Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas

large fiscal deficits  could lead to domestic borrowings and withdrawals from
the deposits of the NG with BSP. These alternative measures  to finance the
budget deficit have implications on inflation and interest rates as well as on
output. However, given the low interest rate environment and the benign inflation
outlook, the BSP can accommodate a moderate overrun in the deficit.

**A further widening of the fiscal deficit could pose limitations to the**
**conduct of monetary policy. However, this can be mitigated in part by the**
**current low interest rate environment amidst ample liquidity in the system.**

**Developments and outlook in the rest of the world**

**29.** A number of leading economic indicators and survey data  showed that
global economic recovery was proceeding weaker than expected, particularly in
the US. For example, US real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2002 was
recorded  at 1.3 percent, slower than the 5.0 percent expansion in the first
quarter.  Other indicators suggested that US private consumption growth  has
slowed down  while private business investment has not shown a rebound.
The  University of Michigan’s preliminary consumer sentiment index fell
sharply to 80.4 in October  from 86.1 percent  in the previous month. At this
level, the  index has declined for the fifth consecutive month since June    to
its  the lowest level  in 9 years.[24]   This reading correlated closely with the
data on US spending. In particular, the overall retail sales declined  by 1.2
percent in September due mainly to the 4.8 percent drop in auto sales despite
financing incentives from automakers. The pressure on consumer spending can
be traced largely to the steep falls in the equity prices associated with the
disclosures on corporate accounting irregularities  in recent months.  In
addition, rising fears of a US-led military  offensive against Iraq  continued to
weigh on  consumer and business confidence.  The slowdown in consumption
spending has raised concerns that the consumer-driven recovery of the US
could be  in jeopardy. Moreover, the Institute of Supply Management’s (ISM)
manufacturing index fell to 49.5 in September  from holding steady at 50.5
in  July and August. Meanwhile,  the  unemployment rate showed an
improvement,  easing slightly to 5.6 percent in September from  5.7 percent
a month ago.

**30. The US Federal Reserve kept  the federal funds target rate  unchanged  at**
1.75 percent during its  meeting on 24 September 2002, citing  the considerable
uncertainty about the extent and timing of the expected pickup in production and
employment  owing in part to the heightened geopolitical risks.

**31. In the euro zone, the European Central Bank (ECB) kept the key ECB**
interest rates unchanged during its meeting on 10 October 2002 based on its
overall assessment  that the  risks to price stability are balanced at the
moment. The ECB noted that  economic activity in the euro area remained
subdued and that  the uncertainty surrounding the  economic outlook was still
high.[25]  A significant degree of uncertainty has built up over the past few
months, owing mainly to the sharp decline in stock prices and their potential
detrimental effects on the economy, as well as to geopolitical tensions as reflected
in surging oil prices.

**32. Following the two-day monetary policy meetings of the Bank of Japan**
(BOJ) held  on 10 and 11 October 2002, the BOJ noted that “it will take a while
for the economy of Japan to show clear signs of recovery, as the increase in
exports and production was expected to slow for the time being.”[26] Signs that the
US rebound was faltering could dampen  Japan’s  prospects  for  a sustained
upturn in  exports,  thereby  endangering its expectations for  a  gradual
economic recovery.   In addition, the  domestic economy continued to be
saddled by  large corporate debt and  the associated high NPLs of the banking
system.

**The pace of the US-led global economic recovery is proceeding slower**
**than initially expected. With increased uncertainty over the strength of the**
**global economy, the major central banks are expected to maintain a bias**
**towards accommodation in order to support recovery and growth.**

**II. Discussion on the Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

**33. In their assessment of the stance of monetary policy, the members of the**
Monetary Board expressed the view that while the near-term risks to the inflation
outlook are well under control, possible upside pressures on inflation could set in
over the policy horizon. At the same time, the pace of the global economic
recovery has slowed down and domestic demand conditions remain soft. Against
this backdrop, discussions by the members of the Monetary Board revolved
around the following policy questions:

(a) Given the risks to the inflation outlook, would an increase in policy rates
be warranted?
(b) Given the uncertainty in external conditions and relative softness in
domestic demand conditions, should policy rates be reduced to provide
the further stimulus to perk up the economy?
(c) Looking at both perspectives, should the policy stance remain cautious,
one that continues to be accommodative while at the same time guarding
firmly against the risks to the inflation outlook, and maintain the current
monetary policy settings?

**34. The members of the Monetary Board pointed out that monetary tightening**
through an increase in policy rates would serve as a pre-emptive action against
inflationary risks stemming from possible demand-side pressures. However, the
potential risks to inflation are associated largely with supply-side factors, which
include the effects of the El Niño weather disturbance as well as the possible
increase in oil prices, power rates and water charges. Moreover, given the stillweak domestic demand conditions, the members of the Monetary Board agreed
that an increase in interest rates could dampen consumption and investments.
Higher interest rates could stifle the recovery in bank lending and hurt the
domestic stock market. The members of the Monetary Board thus expressed the
view that an increase in policy rates could undermine efforts to steer the economy
toward a sustainable recovery path.

**35. The Monetary Board also noted that a further easing of the BSP’s monetary**
policy stance at this time would infuse additional liquidity in the system, which
already has ample liquidity. Given that monetary policy affects inflation with a
lag, a more accommodative stance now could undermine the attainability of the
inflation target in 2003. In particular, the Monetary Board discussed the

following main risk factors to inflation and inflationary expectations that could
arise from a reduction in policy rates as follows:

a. The present scope for monetary easing is already limited by the fact that
policy rates have already been reduced to a significant extent over the past
year (amounting to a cumulative 800 basis points for the period 4 December
2000-15 March 2002, 75 basis points of which was for this year alone).

b. Further monetary easing, either through a reduction in the BSP’s policy
rates or in  liquidity reserve requirement  would  infuse  more liquidity
in the system, which could generate inflationary pressures. This could
increase the risk of a sharp correction in interest rates later should
inflationary pressures become evident.

c. A reduction in the BSP’s policy rates  would narrow down further  the
country’s interest rate differentials with foreign interest rates, which could
trigger renewed volatility in the foreign exchange market and  undermine
the stability of the peso. This could impact adversely on inflation and
inflationary expectations.

**36.** The Monetary Board likewise expressed the view that indications of potential
upside pressures to future inflation and inflationary expectations combined with
the relatively soft domestic demand amidst the observed slowing down in global
economic activity called for a cautious monetary policy stance, one that would
remain appropriately supportive of the strengthening of domestic demand while
guarding firmly against price pressures. The members of the Monetary Board
thus argued that maintaining policy rates at their current levels accords with the
view that withdrawal of the monetary stimulus to domestic demand could hurt the
economy’s growth prospects. They emphasized, however, that keeping the policy
rates on hold does not represent inaction by monetary authorities to the downside
risks to inflation.

**III.  Monetary Policy Decision**

**37.** Based on the analysis of data that have become available since the last
meeting of the Monetary Board on 26 September 2002 and a careful assessment
of the balance of risks on inflation and inflationary expectations, the members
of the Monetary Board by a unanimous vote decided as follows:

a. maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 7.0 percent for
the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight
RP (lending) rate;

b. maintain the tiering scheme on banks’ placements with the BSP under
the RRP and SDA windows;

c. maintain the  current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs;
and

d. maintain the reserve requirements at their current levels given the
adequate level of liquidity in the system.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary policy
setting was scheduled on 21 November 2002.
