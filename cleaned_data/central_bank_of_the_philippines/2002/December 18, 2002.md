**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES  HELD ON 19 DECEMBER 2002[∗]**


**Background**

The Monetary Board held its thirteenth meeting on monetary policy
issues on 19 December 2002. This followed the 17 December 2002 meeting of
the Advisory Committee.[1] The Advisory Committee prepared, for the Monetary
Board’s consideration, a policy paper which outlined the committee’s assessment
of the macroeconomic conditions and inflation outlook as well as their
recommendations on the appropriate stance of monetary policy. During the
meeting, the Monetary Board discussed the factors that could affect inflation and
inflation expectations, including the forecasts of agricultural production,
movements of the exchange rate, direction of world oil prices, possible
adjustments in power and water rates, monetary conditions, demand and output
indicators, fiscal developments, world economic conditions and outlook, and
the implications of these factors on the BSP’s monetary policy stance.

**I. Considerations in  the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

**Domestic Price Developments and Outlook**

**1. Year-on-year inflation continued to be lower than expected in November 2002**
at 2.5 percent compared to 2.7 percent a month earlier. The November inflation
rate also marked the lowest rate on record since June 1987. The deceleration was
traced to lower food inflation and fairly stable non-food prices. Month-on-month
headline inflation showed a 0.1 percent rise compared to a 0.1 percent decline in
October. The eleven-month average inflation of 3.2 percent was more than a full

∗ The highlights of the discussions of the 19 December 2002 Monetary Board meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its meeting held on 16 January 2003.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely
the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy Governor for
Supervision and Examination Sector, the Managing Director, In-Charge of Research or the Director of the
Department of Economic Research, and the Director of the Treasury Department.

percentage point below the 2002 target and was considerably lower than the
average of 6.3 percent for the same period in 2001.

**2. There were indications of strengthening demand for goods and services based**
on the sustained growth in real GDP in the third quarter of 2002 at 3.8 percent
year-on-year, up from the 3.0 percent growth recorded during the same period last
year. The third-quarter expansion was underpinned by a 3.7 percent growth in
personal consumption spending, which was stronger than last year’s rise of 3.5
percent and driven mainly by spending on food, transportation and
communication and miscellaneous services. However, other indicators pointed to
areas of weakness in domestic demand. For instance, manufacturing activity
remained sluggish. Data from the Monthly Integrated Survey of Selected
Industries (MISSI) published by the National Statistics Office (NSO) showed that
the Value of Production Index (VAPI) of the manufacturing industry rose by a
minimal 0.7 percent (revised) in September 2002 while the Volume of Production
Index (VOPI) fell by 3.9 percent (revised) on an annual basis during the same
month. Capacity utilization in manufacturing also remained fairly low at 75.0
percent (revised) for September 2002.

**The eleven-month inflation results suggest that the full-year average**
**headline inflation for 2002 would be significantly lower than the low-end of**
**the target range of inflation. However, for 2003, a number of downside risks**
**could accompany the outlook for inflation, notably the fiscal performance**
**and cost-side factors. Nevertheless, average inflation for 2003 is expected to**
**be in line with the government’s target of 4.5-5.5 percent.**

**Developments in Agriculture**

**3.** Agriculture grew by 2.3 percent during the first nine months of 2002,
reflecting a deceleration from the  3.1 percent year-on-year growth in the same
period a year ago.[2] This resulted as crop production fell by 0.4 percent for
January-September 2002 compared to the level a year ago due mainly  to the
decline in  rice and corn production by 3.6 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively.
Meanwhile, the government’s import program helped mitigate the upward price
pressure from the low palay production in the third quarter of 2002, as the

National Food Authority (NFA) allowed 1.2 million metric tons (MT) of rice
imports from 1 January-4 December 2002.[3]

**4. Palay production could grow by 8.9 percent year-on-year to 5.4 million MT in**
the fourth quarter of 2002 with the expected favorable impact of the quick
turnaround scheme (QTA) and adequate rainfall brought about by the southwest
monsoons.[4] This could make up for the crop losses in the third quarter, and lead
to a full-year palay production growth of 1.2 percent to 13.1 million MT.
However, corn production could decline by 4.9 percent year-on-year in the fourth
quarter of 2002 to 4.3 million MT, as earlier floods affected the standing crops
and delayed the planting especially in the corn-growing areas in the south. In the
first quarter of  2003, palay production could decline by 1.9 percent year-on-year
to 3.0 million MT as irrigated rice farmers have tempered  their planting
activities  due to apprehensions  over the effect of the El Niño phenomenon.
However, corn production for the first quarter of 2003 could be expected to
grow by 6 percent year-on-year to 1.2 million MT.

**5. Moreover, the agricultural sector was expected to gain from other government**
programs aimed at boosting production and mitigating the impact of the El Niño
phenomenon.  For the first 11 months of 2002, the Quedan and Rural Credit
Guarantee Corporation (Quedancor) extended a total of P1.2 billion worth of
loans to projects involving grains, livestock and poultry, fisheries and various
agribusiness production.[5] In addition, the Department of Budget and
Management released for the period January- October 2002, a total of P1.3 billion
for irrigation projects and other El Niño mitigating programs of the DA.[6]

3 NFA, Grains Situation Report as of the First Week of December 2002, 5 December 2002
4 The quick turnaround scheme (QTA) is part of the Ginintuang Masaganang Ani (GMA) Rice Program of
the DA which aims to compensate for possible loss in rice output brought about by drought, flooding caused
by typhoons, and also to mitigate the impact of El Niño weather phenomenon. Under the scheme, irrigated
rice areas which had been harvested in August or early September were immediately replanted with early
maturing rice varieties and certified seeds within two to three weeks to make up for the delays in planting
during the second quarter. Farmer participants to the program may also avail of fertilizer on credit under the
Quedancor. The program expects to produce an additional 339,598 metric tons of rice for 2002. (Source:

**In the near term, food prices are expected to remain in check due to**
**the prospect of a good harvest in the fourth quarter of 2002, helped by**
**timely  government interventions.**

**Exchange rate developments**

**6. The peso weakened slightly against the US dollar as of 19 December 2002,**
averaging at P53.54/US$1 for the period 1-19 December 2002 compared to
P53.33/US$1 average in November.[7] The domestic currency continued to be
weighed down by market concerns over the government’s fiscal position. In
addition, the weakness of the Japanese yen exerted pressure on the peso.  The
seasonal foreign exchange  remittances from overseas Filipino workers to
their families for holiday spending, however, helped cap the depreciation of the
peso against the US dollar.  Thus, the  peso showed  relative stability during
first two weeks of December, with  the standard deviation at only P0.15 for the
period 1-19 December compared to P0.32 registered in  November 2002.

**7. On a real, trade-weighted basis, the peso depreciated relative to the currencies**
of the major trading partners by about 5.0 percent in November 2002 from its
level in December 2001, as shown in the real effective exchange rate (REER)
index.[8] The peso showed a similar depreciation trend over the same period vis-àvis two sets of currencies of the Philippines’ competitor countries. The REER for
the broad and narrow baskets of competitor currencies fell by about 5.0 percent
and 12.7 percent, respectively. These developments indicated the continued
modest improvement in the country’s external price competitiveness.

**The peso was mildly weaker against the dollar in December. However,**
**the peso remains less volatile compared to the previous month due mainly to**
**the seasonal rise in inflow of remittances from OFWs.**

7  Based on real-time foreign exchange transactions in the Philippine Dealing System (PDS)
8 The basket of the major trading partners is composed of the currencies of the US, Japan, Germany and the
United Kingdom. The broad basket of competitor countries is composed of the currencies of Singapore,
South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong while the narrow basket is composed of
the currencies of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand only.

**Oil price developments**

**8. The price of** Dubai crude in the international market averaged US$24.47 per
barrel for the period 2-13 December 2002,  about 5.0 percent higher than the
US$23.31 per barrel posted  in November 2002. World oil prices trended upward
in December following  the decision of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production quotas of members by 1 January
2003 in a move to maintain the US$22-28 per barrel price band mechanism.[9] In
addition,  the renewed threat of a US-led assault on Iraq,  the general strike in
Venezuela that stalled oil exports  and the seasonal increase in demand for
heating oil during the winter season in the Northern hemisphere  have combined
to  push up oil prices in the world market. In the futures market, the price of the
benchmark Brent crude oil tracked the rise in the spot market as January 2003
deliveries settled at US$25.46 per barrel from US$23.49 per barrel quoted in the
previous month.[10]

**9. Meanwhile, local oil companies  reduced  the pump prices of petroleum**
products  particularly gasoline, kerosene and diesel oil  by an average of 40
centavos on 9 December 2002. Despite the recent cuts, the price per liter  of
gasoline and other petroleum products  as of 9 December 2002 were higher
relative to end-December 2001 levels.  The net increase  in domestic oil prices
in 2002  thus far, stood at P1.48, P1.75 and P1.84 per liter for diesel, gasoline,
and kerosene, respectively.[11]

**The direction of oil prices in the near term would  be  dictated by**
**potential supply shock scenarios  surrounding the Middle East tensions and**
**the Venezuela crisis interacting with  the bearish demand outlook due to**
**the tepid pace of economic recovery of the US and other major economies.**

for Dubai crude—is used as an indicator of future world oil prices since futures data on Dubai crude are not
available.

gasoline and P1.29 per liter for kerosene (Source: Department of Energy).

**Developments in the Utilities Sector**

**10. In its decision issued on 15 November 2002, the Supreme Court affirmed the**
Energy Regulatory Board (ERB) findings and  urged the Manila Electric
Company (Meralco) to reduce its rates as well as to reimburse its customers the
“overcharges”. It could be recalled that in January 1994, the ERB granted
Meralco the provisional authority to raise its rates by P0.184 per kwh. However,
in 1998, the ERB ruled that Meralco should have raised its rates by only P0.017
per kwh and ordered Meralco to refund the excess P0.167 per kwh it had collected
since February 1994. The case was brought before the Court of Appeals, which
set aside the ERB ruling. The impact of the Supreme Court’s decision to reverse
the Court of Appeals ruling on Meralco’s electricity charges is still uncertain at
the moment as Meralco has filed a motion for reconsideration of the said case.[12]

**11. On the other hand, the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) has yet to**
reach a decision on Meralco’s proposed power rate unbundling. According to
Meralco—in its submission to the ERC on 26 December 2001—its proposed new
rates as contained in its petition for the unbundling of power rates could raise the
cost of electric power consumption by an average of P1.12 per kwh.[13] This
represents an average increase of 19.6 percent from the November 2001 average
tariff of P5.73 per kwh.[14] The impact of the unbundling of the power rates would
also need to be weighed against those of the Special Program to Enhance
Electricity Demand (SPEED) and the planned establishment of the Wholesale
Electricity Spot Market (WESM).[15]

12 “Decision on G.R. No. 141314, Republic of the Philippines represented by Energy Regulatory Board vs.
Manila Electric Company”, 15 November 2002, at http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph and “Meralco customers
billed at rates approved by law”, undated, at http://www.meralco.com.ph
13 Meralco, Application to ERC for unbundling of rates, dated 26 December 2001, as mandated under Sec.
36 of RA 9136
14 Ibid.
15 The WESM is a spot market for the trading of electricity in which power generation companies (gencos)
submit their offers to sell electricity to distribution utilities at their desired price. Distribution utilities, in
turn, submit their demand requirements to a market operator who is assigned to match the supply and
demand for power. The Electric Power Industry  Reform Act of 2001 (R.A. 9136) requires the
Department of Energy (DOE) to  establish the WESM in coordination  with  electric power industry
participants to ensure greater supply and rational pricing of electricity. Meanwhile, the SPEED is a
price incentive scheme for large end-users of electricity whereby discounts are  provided to industrial
and commercial customers for incremental use of energy above a specified base load. The program is
aimed at enhancing demand for electricity and ensuring that excess power capacity is fully utilized.

**12.** The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) has already
approved an initial P4.25 per cubic meter increase in the water tariff of Manila
Water Co. (MWC) beginning January 2003. This will bring the average weighted
all-in water tariff of MWC to P14.22 per cubic meter of water from its current rate
of P9.97 per cubic meter. The MWSS’ initial estimates for MWC’s rate
adjustment was P7.03 per cubic meter. To soften the impact of the rate increase
on consumers, the MWSS and MWC have agreed to implement the tariff
adjustment on a staggered basis. The initial P4.25 per cubic meter water rate
increase will take effect in January 2003 while the remaining P2.78 per cubic
meter could be implemented in 2005. Meanwhile, the other water concessionaire
in Metro Manila—Maynilad Water Services Inc. (MWSI)—also has a pending
petition with MWSS for a tariff adjustment. MWSI was earlier reported to have
expressed its interest to terminate its concession agreement with the government.
The process of arbitration between the MWSS and MWSI has yet to be organized.

**Water rates in the east zone of Metro Manila have been raised**
**effective 1 January 2003 following the MWSS approval of a tariff hike for**
**MWC. Meanwhile, the direction of power rates will depend on the Supreme**
**Court’s final ruling on Meralco’s case and the ERC’s decision on the utility**
**firm’s unbundling petition.**

**Interest rates and interest rate differentials**

**13. As of 9 December 2002, the differentials between the RP 91-day T-bill rate**
(net of withholding tax) and the 90-day LIBOR and US 90-day T-bill rate
declined to 271.1 basis points and 292.6 basis points, respectively, from the 286.1
basis points and 304.1 basis points registered in 11 November 2002.[16]

**14.** The differential between the BSP’s policy interest rate (overnight borrowing
or RRP rate) and the US federal funds target rate was unchanged at 575 basis
points as the BSP policy rates and the US federal funds target rate remained
steady at their 15 March 2002 and 6 November 2002 levels, respectively.

**15. Adjusted for the risk premium—as measured by the differential between the**
10-year ROP note and the 10-year US Treasury note—the differential between the

BSP policy interest rate and the US federal funds target rate narrowed
significantly in December, as the risk premium jumped to 510 basis points on 9
December from 474 basis points in end-November. The sharp rise in the premium
was due mainly to fiscal deficit concerns as well as the sell-off of bonds to book
profits for the year as financial institutions closed their books.[17]

**16. The yield on the 91-day short-term government securities declined during the**
Bureau of Treasury’s (BTr) 9 December 2002 auction—the last for the year—but
the yields on the 182-day and 364-day Treasury bills rose on concerns that the
government will exceed the budget deficit estimate for 2002.

**The steady decline in the RP 91-day T-bill rates resulted into a**
**narrowing of the RP-US interest rate differential in December. Likewise, the**
**risk-adjusted RP-US interest rate differential declined in December due**
**mainly to the uptick in the risk premium for RP bonds on fiscal worries and**
**year-end profit-taking of investors.**

**17. During the period 28 November-3 December 2002, the Philippines’ real**
lending rate (based on the low-end of the range of banks’ lending rates) increased
slightly to 5.6 percent from the 5.5  percent registered during the review period
4-6 November 2002[18] due primarily to the decline in the inflation rate for
November. However, the Philippines continued to have one of the lowest real
lending rates in the Asian region. In particular, the Philippines’ real lending rate
together with  Singapore’s  rank as the fifth lowest  at 5.6 percent  in a
sample of Asian countries after Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand,
which had real lending rates of 2.5 percent,  3.9 percent, 4.4 percent, and 5.1
percent, respectively.  By contrast, the highest real lending rates were 8.6 percent
for Hong Kong and 7.9 percent for Taiwan,  a result partly of negative
inflation rates.

**The Philippine real lending rate increases marginally but remains**
**lower than the real lending rates of other Asian countries surveyed.**

**18. Based on data on bid yields,  the  yield curve for government securities in**
the secondary market as of 5 December 2002 remained generally unchanged

relative to that which prevailed on 11 November 2002 as banks competed for
government papers, given their excess liquidity position.[19]

**Banks continued demand for government securities resulting from**
**ample liquidity in the system helped keep the yield curve broadly stable.**

**Domestic stock market movements**

**19. Lack of enticing market news pushed the average PHISIX for the period 2-9**
December 2002 to 1037.6 index points, down by 24.7 index points from the
1062.3 index points average PHISIX posted for the comparable period in
November. Uncertainties brought about by the government’s widening budget
gap, the absence of positive corporate news as well as the domestic and
international peace and order concerns continued to cast a shadow in the market.

**20. The volume of transactions in the local bourse for the period 2-6 December**
2002 rose by 1.1 billion shares to reach 1.6 billion shares from 489 million shares
for the comparable period a month ago. On the other hand, value turnover
declined by almost P300 million to P1.5 billion from P1.8 billion in the previous
month as share prices declined. Foreign investors have remained reluctant to
invest in the domestic stock market as indicated by the decline in total foreign
transactions during the period 2-6 December 2002 by 10.4 percent  compared to
the level in previous month.  Moreover, foreign selling exceeded foreign buying
by P199.1 million.[20]

**Cautious trading in the local bourse is expected to persist in the near**
**term as the market waits for fresh leads.**

**Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

**21. Domestic liquidity (M3) sustained its acceleration since July of this year as**
it grew by 9.7 percent (revised) year-on-year to reach P1.598 trillion in
October 2002. The sustained rise in the net foreign assets (NFA) of the monetary
system as well as the continued growth in credits to the National Government
contributed to the rise in M3.

**22.** The total volume of loans outstanding  of commercial banks rose steadily
by 1.1 percent in October from 1.2 percent year-on-year rise in the previous
month. The sustained rise in bank credits to firms  in the  agricultural,
community, social and personal services, and the financial institutions, real estate
and business services (FIREBS) sectors—which together accounted for 46.9
percent of total KB loans—contributed  to the  continued, although modest,
growth in bank lending activities in October.

**23. The volume of banks’ placements under the RRP window increased by P3.2**
billion to P85.3 billion as of 4 December 2002 from the P82.1 billion in endNovember 2002. Meanwhile, placements under the SDA facility declined by P24
million to reach P343 million. Compared to the levels as of end-December 2001,
RRP and SDA placements registered an increase of P57.1 billion and P343
million, respectively, from P28.2 billion and zero worth of placements.

**Bank lending posts second consecutive month of growth as money**
**demand strengthens. This could signal the start of the recovery in bank**
**lending. Meanwhile, banks continue to channel excess funds into the BSP’s**
**RRP window.**

**Fiscal developments**

**24.** The deficit of the National Government (NG) for the first eleven months of
2002 was recorded at P200.6 billion, considerably higher than the full-year target
deficit of P130.0 billion (3.3 percent of GDP). This was the result of the shortfall
in revenue collections and higher-than-programmed expenditures.

**25.** The NG announced that the indicative budget deficit for 2002 was raised to
5.6 percent of GDP (P223 billion) from the original 3.3 percent of GDP (P130
billion).[21]  From a strictly monetary policy perspective,  this level of deficit
appeared manageable as market interest rates were expected to remain relatively
low.  The impact of  the deficit on market interest rates could be muted by the
ample liquidity in the system.  However, a large overshoot for 2002 means that
the NG will enter 2003 with fewer funds to deal with its financing requirements.
The resulting tightness in government finances could thus force fiscal authorities

21 The P223 billion indicative budget deficit target was estimated using the low-end of the nominal GDP
consistent with the real GDP growth of 4-4.5 percent for 2002.

to either withdraw from the NG’s deposits with the BSP or increase their
borrowing next year. The withdrawal of NG deposits with the BSP could imply
an infusion of additional liquidity into an already-liquid financial system, which
could lead to demand-related inflationary pressures. On the other hand, increased
NG borrowing could push up not only  interest rates on domestic government
debt but also the private cost of capital as the government competes with the
private sector for available funds. These factors thus imply a cost-side risk to the
inflation outlook.

**Continued widening of the NG’s budget deficit could impact adversely**
**on the conduct of monetary policy. However, its impact could be mitigated,**
**in part, by the ample liquidity in the system and the current low interest rate**
**environment.**

**Developments and outlook in the rest of the world**

**26. Despite  an upturn in the third quarter real GDP growth to 4.0 percent**
(revised) relative to the 1.3 percent  year-on-year  growth in the previous
quarter, the US economy continued to show signs of weakness, highlighted by
high unemployment as well as the slow pace of growth in manufacturing and
business investment. These prevailing signs of weakness in the US economy
combined with the lack of  price pressures were the major factors behind the
Fed’s decision to maintain its neutral  monetary policy stance, keeping the
federal funds target rate at a 41-year low of 1.25 percent on 10 December 2002.
Some analysts, however, contend that the Fed could reconsider a shift  to an
easing bias if weak economic conditions continued to persist.[22]

**27. In the euro area, the weakness in the 12 member-countries—particularly**
Germany—persisted as inflation remained  above the  2 percent target even as
there are signs that  price pressures have started to dissipate. These factors
underpinned the recent decision of  ECB  to  cut its policy rates  following
the meeting of its Governing Council on 5 December 2002.   The benchmark
interest rate on the ECB’s refinancing  operations was reduced by 50 basis

points to 2.75 percent effective 11 December 2002.[23]

**28. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) noted that an appreciable recovery of the**
Japan’s economy  is unlikely in the near term due to, among others, greater
uncertainty regarding economic conditions overseas. Given these considerations,
the BOJ, in its Monetary Policy Meeting held on 18-19 November 2002,
decided to keep  its policy stance aimed at maintaining the outstanding balance
of current accounts[24] at around 15 to 20 trillion yen.[25]

**The weakness in the external environment amidst renewed**
**uncertainty over the pace and timing of recovery suggests that global**
**interest rates are likely to remain low so as to provide support to the**
**economic recovery process.**

**II. Discussion on the Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

**29. The Monetary Board’s assessment of the conditions influencing future price**
developments pointed to a generally subdued inflation environment in 2003.
The members noted that average inflation in 2003 will broadly track the 4.5-5.5
percent government target for the year. The Monetary Board also pointed out that
the subdued economic activity—highlighted by the slowdown in manufacturing in
the third quarter as well as continued spare capacity in manufacturing and
relatively modest  growth in bank lending—could help ease potential supplyside  pressures on inflation.  Moreover, they added that the possible  supplyside or cost-push strains on prices  were largely temporary in nature. They
also noted that the risks to the inflation outlook were associated with the possible
adverse impact on  agricultural  output of the El Niño weather disturbance,
the lingering geopolitical tensions with potential  consequences for future oil
prices as well as the  widening fiscal  gap  and its possible   implications for

**30. The Monetary Board is also of the view that continued  uncertainty  in the**
strength of the world economic recovery,  areas of weakness in domestic
demand  and  concerns about the sustainability of the fiscal position  could
weigh down the economy’s growth prospects.  They agreed that the weakness in
the US economy as evidenced by lower imports from Asia, including the
Philippines, could constrain prospects for growth in exports with adverse
implications for the manufacturing sector. Moreover, the Monetary Board
observed that the overall pattern of domestic demand remained mixed and
uneven  as the economy’s growth path  has yet to gather momentum.
Meanwhile, the Monetary Board also noted that the  growth in bank lending that
persisted for the past two months suggested that the impact of  past monetary
easing actions  has begun to filter into the economy,   providing evidence
that monetary policy acts with a lag.

**31. In the course of the Monetary Board’s discussion on the appropriate stance**
of monetary policy, the following issues were raised:

a. Given the uncertainty over the recovery of the world economy and the
softness in domestic demand conditions, should policy rates be reduced to
propel the economy towards sustained economic recovery?

b. With the potential risks to the inflation outlook, would an increase in policy
rates be warranted?

c. Should current monetary policy settings be maintained to allow previous
policy rate reductions to work their way further through the system while
guarding firmly against sources of potential pressures to the inflation
outlook?

**32. The Monetary Board identified the following arguments in favor of a policy**
rate reduction:

� Recent inflation readings continued to be relatively benign, thereby
strengthening expectations of a manageable inflation environment over the
policy horizon despite possible upside risks to consumer prices. Moreover,
the expected price pressures over the policy horizon are largely supply-side
and, therefore, transient in nature.

� Given a tame inflation outlook, the tentative overall pattern of domestic
demand conditions suggests some room for continued domestic monetary
stimulus.

� Continued uncertainty about the pace and timing of the global economic
upturn also argues for further interest rate stimulus.

� A policy rate reduction is not expected to lead to significant exchange market
volatility, since the interest rate differential will simply revert to levels before
the US policy move on 6 November 2002 and would remain positive in favor
of the peso.

� A policy rate cut could also serve to brighten confidence as this could send a
strong signal to the financial markets.

**33.** On the other hand, the Monetary Board pointed out the considerations for
raising policy rates as follows:

� An increase in policy rates could serve as a pre-emptive action against the
risks to the inflation outlook, arising mainly from demand-side pressures.

� While there are looming inflationary pressures—coming from the impact of
the El Niño weather phenomenon on food prices and the increase in utility
charges—these are likely to be short-lived because these are supply-side
factors. Thus, these would not warrant an increase in the BSP’s policy rates.

� Given that the strength of the domestic economic recovery remains
tentative,  an increase in interest rates could dampen incentives for increased
consumption and investment.

**34. Finally, the Monetary Board discussed the following as arguments in favor of**
keeping policy rates steady:

� The significant extent of monetary easing since December 2000—through a
reduction in policy rates by 800 basis points—and the resulting ample
liquidity in the financial system should give the economy ample room to
expand without the need for further monetary stimulus.

� The traditional transmission channels of monetary policy impulses may be
weak under present conditions and  that   further easing could have little
impact on real sector activity.

� The best approach to the problem of weak credit demand may simply be to
allow sufficient  time for the past  monetary  easing to work its way fully
through the real sector. The steady growth in bank lending in September and
October could be indicative of  the  start of  a recovery in bank lending.

� In addition, the NG fiscal performance posed a significant concern for the
inflation outlook.

� Maintaining the BSP policy rates at their current levels would lead to a wider
interest rate differential that could allow authorities more room to maneuver in
case of any possible pressures on the foreign exchange market  that may
arise in the near term.

**III.  Monetary Policy Decision**

**35. Based on the analysis of indicators that have become available since the**
review of the BSP’s monetary policy stance by the Monetary Board on 21
November 2002 and a careful assessment of the balance of risks on inflation
and inflationary expectations, the Monetary Board believed that the current
monetary policy stance continued to be  appropriately supportive of the
economy’s growth objective while ensuring price stability. In particular, the
Monetary Board decided to approve the following measures:

a. maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 7.0 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight RP
(lending) rate;

b. maintain the tiering scheme on banks’ placements with the BSP under the
RRP and SDA windows;

c. maintain the  current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs; and

d. maintain the reserve requirements at their current levels given the adequate
level of liquidity in the system.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary policy
setting was scheduled on 16 January 2003.
