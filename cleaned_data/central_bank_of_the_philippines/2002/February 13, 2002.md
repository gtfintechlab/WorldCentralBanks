**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES  HELD ON 14 FEBRUARY 2002[∗]**


**Background**

The Monetary Board held its second meeting for the year on monetary
policy issues on 14 February 2002.  Earlier, on 12 February 2002, the
Advisory Committee[1] met and formulated its recommendations regarding the
appropriate monetary policy settings. The Advisory Committee submitted, for the
consideration of the Monetary Board, a policy paper and various information
relevant for the deliberation on monetary policy. In particular, the Monetary
Board discussed inflation developments and expectations—particularly, the
trend in oil prices, power rates and the impact of the El Niño weather
phenomenon on food supply in the latter part of 2003—monetary  conditions,
external developments  and  the global economic  outlook, demand and output
indicators and the implications of these factors on monetary policy.

**I. Considerations in Setting the Monetary Policy Stance**

**Current inflation and the inflation outlook**

**1.   Inflation for January 2002—at 3.8 percent—provides early  indications of**
a generally favorable inflation environment for 2002.  The sustained gains in
agricultural production—on account of the bumper harvest in 2001 and
expectations of good harvests in the first half of the year—are expected to
translate into lower prices of food and other agricultural products in the coming
months. With unemployment (at 9.8 percent as of October 2001) still high and
spare  capacity (average capacity utilization was at 76.6 percent for November
2001) still substantial, labor costs are not expected to rise sharply.[2] In addition,
the sustained slowdown in  the various measures of  core inflation since

August 2001 supports the continued favorable  inflation outlook. These
factors should exert a favorable  influence on the level of  consumer prices.

**2.  Based on the results of the  DER’s inflation forecasting models,  the**
monthly inflation path  for inflation  in 2002  is expected to  be relatively
subdued  for the period  February to September 2002, with  an uptick
expected in  November and December 2002 due to the assumed wage increase
effective November 2002.  However, the average annual inflation rates are
expected to be in line with the targets  set for 2002 and 2003. [3]

**The downtrend in January inflation and the sustained slowdown in**
**the various measures of  core inflation since August 2001 support the**
**continued favorable inflation outlook over the policy horizon, which is in**
**line with the inflation targets for  2002 and 2003.**

**Inflation impact of cyclical weather pattern**

**3. Based on the movements of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), the**
Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration
(PAGASA) has forecasted generally normal weather conditions for 2002.[4]

**Expectations of a brief episode of a weak El Niño (warm) weather**
**condition  in the last quarter of  2002 would  have a minimal impact on**
**agricultural production  and, consequently, on prices of food and other**
**agricultural products  in the latter part of the year. [5]**

**Exchange rate**

**4.** Along with major Asian currencies, the movements of the peso-dollar rate
narrowed to a range of  P51.20-P51.72 for January 2002, an improvement from
the P51.15-P52.06 range recorded in December 2001. Increased confidence in the
Philippine economy contributed to higher foreign inflows as  expectations of

accompanied by sustained warming of the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and often
indicate El Niño episodes (Source: Australian Bureau of Meteorology website).

recovery in the Asian economies  gained strength.  In addition, continued
inflows of overseas workers’ remittances contributed to the relative stability of
the exchange rate. This was reflected in the decline in the volatility of the pesodollar rate to about 5 centavos from 18 centavos in January 2002 and 31
centavos in December 2001.

**Continued broad stability in the exchange rate is expected to have a**
**favorable influence on inflationary expectations and the inflation outlook.**

**Oil prices**

**5.   The world oil price (Dubai crude)  rose to  $19.45 per barrel in January**
2002 from $17.83 per barrel in December 2001, reflecting the seasonal uptick in
crude oil prices in the winter season.  At this level,  however,  the price of
crude oil has  declined from  the peak of about $26.70 per barrel  in June 2001.
In the futures market,  world oil prices (Brent crude) are  generally stable with
prices quoted at a close range of $19.37-$19.70 per barrel for the period MarchDecember 2002.[6]

**6.** Despite the  recent downtrend in prices, a reversal  in world oil prices
could arise if the OPEC is able to negotiate successfully agreements  with
other non-member oil producing countries (including Russia) to support oil
prices through coordinated production cuts. However, according to industry
experts,  a near-term abrupt rise in oil prices is not considered likely inasmuch
as oil stocks have been running at their highest levels since August 1999 as mild
winter in the Northern Hemisphere and weak global conditions have reduced fuel
demand.  While fuel—which include petroleum products—accounts for only
about 2.3 percent of the Filipino consumer basket, it is important to note that its
pass-on effects invariably move the prices of almost all goods and services sold
domestically.

**The current and futures prices suggest  broadly stable world oil**
**prices in the near term.**

**Petitions for upward adjustment in power rates**

**7.  The “unbundling” of power rates by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco)**
—which would  entail  updating of the firm’s asset valuation using 2000 as the
base year from the current 1993 base year—is expected to  raise the cost of
electric power to households and industrial users by an estimated minimum
amount of about P38.00 per 100 kwh usage of electricity.[7] While electric
power consumption accounts for only less than 3 percent of the CPI basket, the
second round effects of the increase in power rates  could lead to a generalized
increase in the prices of other commodities.

**The increase in power rates could cause an uptick in consumer**
**prices.**

**Interest rates and interest rate differentials**

**8.   As of 4 February 2002, the interest rate differential between the RP 91-day**
T-bill rate (net of RP withholding tax) and the 90-day LIBOR stood at 4.117
percent while the interest rate differential between the RP 91-day (net of RP
withholding tax) and the US 90-day T-bills reached 4.270 percentage points.  The
differentials are higher relative to the levels in  2000, which averaged at
about 2 percent  and  for the most part of  2001 (29-January to 6 August
2001), which averaged at  3.531 percent.

**9.   The differential between the BSP’s policy interest rate (overnight borrowing**
or RRP rate) and the US federal funds target rate declined slightly to 575 basis
points following the latest 25 basis-point cut in the BSP’s RRP rates effective 18
January 2002.  This differential was about the same as the average differential
in 2001 of about 5.7 percent and is higher than the differential  that prevailed
for the most part  of  2000,  which averaged at about 4.7 percent.

**10.  As of end-January 2002, the spread of the Philippine lending rate over the**
benchmark T-bill rate stood at about 355 basis points. This differential was
within the range of spreads for a sampling of Asian countries.

7 The unbundling of power rates is prescribed under Republic Act (RA No.) 9136 or the
Electricity  Industry Reform Act issued on 8 June 2000.

**11.  However, the Philippines’ real  lending rate  at 7.25 percent for the**
period 24-30 January 2002 remained high  compared to those in other
countries in the region, which ranged at 2.9-6.6 percent.

**The margin  between domestic interest rates and foreign interest rates**
**provides some room for further  monetary easing given that the outlook**
**for inflation remains favorable and given that there is broad stability in the**
**foreign exchange market. Monetary easing could help reduce further the**
**real lending rate, which remains high relative to other countries in the**
**region, thus exerting a positive effect on the competitiveness of domestic**
**enterprises.**

**12.  While the yield curve for government securities in the secondary market as**
of 4 February 2002 showed a downward shift  relative to that which prevailed
at the start of 2002,  it was also steeper  at the longer-term maturities (5-10
years.

**Steeper yield curve at the long end indicates higher inflationary**
**expectations in the long run.**

**Domestic stock market movements**

**13.  The domestic stock market has been gaining strength of late, boosted by the**
string of positive news, particularly the stronger-than-expected growth numbers
in 2001, reining in of the Government’s fiscal position close to target, relative
stability in the exchange rate and the  downtrend in market interest rates. The
recent  inflows  of foreign funds  contributed to briskier trading activity in
the domestic stock market. Data from the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE)
show that foreign investors were net buyers of stocks in 2001 as the total
amount of foreign buying transactions exceeded foreign selling transactions by
P4.5 billion. This trend has continued in 2002 as foreign investors continued to
be net buyers in the domestic stock market, with net purchase amounting to P1.7
billion in January.  There was also a marked increase  in the participation of
foreign funds as the share of foreign transactions to the total  value turnover
rose to about  45 percent in 2001 from only 31.6 percent in the previous year.
The strong foreign interest in the market is anchored on brighter economic
prospects in 2002.

**14. There are also indications that sustained growth is firming up. GDP**
numbers show stronger economic performance in the fourth quarter relative to
the third quarter on the back of the strong agriculture and services sectors. A
recovery in the industrial sector should further strengthen the economy’s growth
prospects.

**Recent gains in the bourse and strong economic performance in the**
**fourth quarter of 2001 could signal an acceleration in the growth**
**momentum, and thus making the case for large rate cuts less compelling.**

**Monetary aggregates and bank lending**

**15.  Reserve money (RM) declined to reach P277.8 billion  as of 6 February**
2002 from  P312.9 billion as of end-December 2001.  The contraction in RM
developed as banks’ liquidity flowed back  to the BSP—as placements under
the  reverse repurchase (RRP) and special deposit accounts (SDA) facilities—
instead of being channeled to the private sector in the form of loans.  The
contraction in bank lending has been sustained for the fifth consecutive month in
December 2001—as loans outstanding of commercial banks declined further by
3.6 percent year-on-year—due in large part to the persistently high NPLs of the
banking system—which has constrained lending activity—and weak demand for
credit by corporates.

**Despite the downtrend in bank lending rates,  banks’ lending activity**
**has  been constrained in part by the high NPLs of the banking system and**
**weak corporate demand.**

**External developments and outlook**

**16.  Recent  indicators  on the US  economy suggest that the recession has**
bottomed out and that the forces of recovery are in place.  There are signs that
weakness in demand has abated and economic activity has been firming; these
signs included increased profits, lower unemployment and stronger consumer
expenditures on new homes, automobiles and durables. This earlier-thanexpected recovery could pose near term upside risks to the US economy, and this
underpinned the decision to keep the US federal funds target rate unchanged at
the last FOMC meeting on 29-30 January 2002. In addition, a survey of the
federal funds futures contract  indicates that the US federal funds target rate is

expected to  increase by 50-100 basis points  in the second half of 2002.[8]
There are also early signs of economic recovery in the euro zone,  which could
mean that the interest rate easing cycle of the European Central Bank (ECB)
would come to an end soon.

**Increasing signs of a US-led recovery have raised market expectations**
**that the US and Europe would start tightening monetary policy in the**
**second half. This, in turn, could limit the scope for further monetary easing**
**by the BSP.**

**II. Discussion  on the Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

**17.** Majority of the Monetary Board  members supported the view that the
generally favorable inflation outlook for the year—given expectations of good
food supply conditions and  stable oil prices—provide scope for further easing of
policy rates. In addition, the differential between domestic and foreign interest
rates—which would remain comfortable even with a 25-basis point cut—and the
broadly stable foreign exchange market provides additional room for monetary
easing. They expressed the view that a  further 25-basis point cut in the BSP’s
policy rates would continue to support the  country’s growth objective without
endangering the inflation target for 2002. The members of the Monetary Board
argued that this policy stance is in line with the primary objective of the BSP
of “maintaining price stability consistent with a balanced and sustainable
economic growth,” as embodied under its Charter.[9] A lower interest rate
environment, in turn, could also help ease debt servicing costs of corporates and
the National Government, and set the conditions for a briskier lending activity.

**18.  The majority of the Monetary Board members  noted that  a  25-basis**
point cut in policy rates is not likely to pose an upsurge in the average
inflation above the  target set for 2002. They noted the preliminary estimates
of  the Department of Economic Research, which showed  that a 25-basis
point cut in the BSP’s overnight RRP rate will raise inflation by only a
minimal 1 basis point.

**19.  However, some members of the Monetary Board expressed reservations on**
a further policy rate cut,  based on  the following considerations:

a. There are risks to the inflation outlook—given the likely uptrend in
inflation forecasts for 2003 and the possible resumption of the
monetary tightening stance of  the US Fed and the ECB;

b. Firmer indications of the recovery of the Philippine economy point to a
case where another or a further rate cut is less compelling; and

c. A further reduction in the BSP’s policy rates may not likely translate
promptly into increased bank lending due to continued structural
problems facing the banking system, particularly the high levels of
NPLs.

**20.  In support of a policy rate cut,  a member of the Monetary Board  also**
expressed the view that, while there are clearer signs of  economic recovery in
the US,  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan  still expressed concern  that such
recovery could still be at risk. In particular, the increase in US retail sales in
December 2001 was still relatively weak. Thus, a further cut in the BSP’s
policy rate –given a benign inflation outlook—would continue to be supportive of
the  economy’s growth efforts. Moreover, it was noted that further easing can be
done now before the US Fed and the ECB resume monetary policy tightening as
viewed by market analysts.

**21.  Cognizant of the risks to the inflation outlook, the members of the Monetary**
Board highlighted the need to continuously monitor economic and financial
developments in order to guard against potential inflationary pressures.  A
member of the Monetary Board  pointed out that, even with the shift in inflation
targeting, the movements of monetary aggregates—particularly the various
indicators of money demand and the level of domestic liquidity in the system—
should continue to be monitored very closely.

**22.  The members of the Monetary Board  underscored the need to  temper**
banks’ propensity to park excess funds with the BSP through the continued
application of the tiering scheme on successively higher volume of banks
placements with the BSP on a consolidated basis.

**23.  All the Monetary Board members shared the view that, going forward,**
monetary policy should proceed on a cautious footing. The BSP  should monitor

carefully incipient  risks factors. While the risks to the inflation outlook have
lessened, they are still present, as indicated by the  uptrend in the inflation
forecast path  in  the last quarter of 2002 to 2003.

**III.  Monetary Policy Decision**

**24. Based on the assessment of the balance of risks on inflation and**
inflationary expectations—indicating that various factors  are weighed heavily
toward  providing some room for monetary easing—the members of the
Monetary Board approved the following measures:

a. Reduction in the  BSP’s policy rates  by 25 basis points each to 7.25
percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.5 percent for the
overnight RP (lending) rate effective  15 February 2002. (At 7.25
percent, the BSP’s overnight RRP rate is the lowest since 25 August
1995);

b. Adjustment in the interest rates on  banks’ overnight  RRP
placements with the BSP under the tiering system as follows:  7.25
percent for placements of up to P5 billion, 4.25 percent for the next P5
billion, and 1.25 percent for placements in excess of P10 billion.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary policy
setting was scheduled on 14 March 2002.
