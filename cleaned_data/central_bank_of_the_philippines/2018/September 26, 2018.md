**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON THE MONETARY POLICY**

**STANCE HELD ON 27 September 2018[1]**

**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board (MB) decided to:

a) Increase the BSP’s key policy interest rate by 50 basis points to 4.50 percent for the

overnight RRP (borrowing) facility, effective 28 September 2018; and,

b) Adjust the interest rates on the overnight deposit and overnight lending facilities

accordingly.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

  - The Monetary Board’s decision to raise the BSP’s policy interest rate anew was based on its
assessment that a further tightening of monetary policy was warranted by persistent signs of
sustained and broadening price pressures. Latest baseline forecasts have shifted higher for
both 2018 and 2019, with risks to the outlook still leaning toward the upside. Equally
important, with supply-side forces expected to continue to drive inflation in the coming
months, inflation expectations have remained elevated amid indications of second-round
effects. Meanwhile, domestic demand conditions have generally held firm, even as the
previous monetary policy responses continue to work their way through the economy.

  - Given the considerations cited above, the Monetary Board decided to raise the BSP policy
interest rate anew to further anchor inflation expectations and to safeguard the inflation
target over the policy horizon.

  - The Monetary Board believed that a tighter monetary policy stance will help steer inflation
toward a target-consistent path over the medium term by reducing further risks to the
inflation outlook, including those emanating from exchange rate volatility given the continued
uncertainty in the external environment amid geopolitical tensions and the normalization of
monetary policy in advanced economies.

  - The Monetary Board likewise emphasized the need for timely and appropriate non-monetary
measures that will further mitigate the impact of supply-side factors on inflation, including rice
tariffication.

  - The Monetary Board reassured the public of the BSP’s strong commitment to take all
necessary policy actions to address the threat of high inflation and deliver on its primary
mandate of price stability.

1 The discussions herein reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on a comprehensive set of economic information available at
the time of the policy meeting. The highlights of the discussions during the 27 September 2018 monetary policy meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its regular meeting held on 18 October 2018. The next meeting of the Monetary Board on the monetary policy stance is

**III.   Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook**

The MB considered the following developments in deciding on the monetary policy stance:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Year-on-year headline inflation rose further to 6.4 percent in August 2018 from 5.7 percent in
July 2018 using the 2012-based consumer price index (CPI) series. This brought the
year-to-date average to 4.8 percent, which is above the Government’s announced inflation
target range of 3.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point for 2018. Similarly, core inflation readings
are higher in August. The number of CPI items above the 4-percent threshold and the diffusion
index of price changes have likewise increased compared to that in the previous month.

**B.  Inflation expectations**

  - Mean inflation forecasts from surveys of private sector economists continued to show
elevated inflation expectations for 2018-2020. Preliminary results of the BSP’s September 2018
survey of private sector economists showed higher mean inflation forecasts at 5.3 percent for
2018 (from 4.9 percent in the August survey), 4.3 percent for 2019 (from 4.1 percent), and
3.9 percent for 2020 (from 3.7 percent). Meanwhile, based on the survey conducted by
Consensus Economics in August 2018, mean inflation forecasts are also higher at 4.7 percent
(from 4.5 percent) for 2018 and 3.9 percent (from 3.7 percent) for 2019.

**C.  Inflation outlook**

  - Compared with the previous forecast round, the latest baseline inflation forecasts for 2018
and 2019 were higher at 5.2 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. Inflation forecast for 2020
was unchanged at 3.2 percent.

**Baseline Inflation Forecasts**

**2012-based CPI**

9 Aug MB 27 Sep MB

2018 4.9 5.2

2019 3.7 4.3

2020 3.2 3.2

  - The risks to future inflation remain on the upside in 2018, but downside risks to the outlook
are seen to dominate in 2019-2020 due largely to the projected impact of rice tariffication.

`o` Additional wage adjustments and transport fare hikes, higher electricity rates, and faster
than-expected monetary policy normalization in advanced economies are the main upside
risks to inflation.

`o` Meanwhile, the slower global economic growth due to protectionist policies in advanced

economies and geopolitical tensions along with the proposed reform in the rice industry
involving the replacement of quantitative restrictions with tariffs and the deregulation of
rice imports continue to be the main downside risks to inflation.

**D. Demand conditions**

  - GDP growth moderated in the second quarter due to negative contribution of net exports,
although the economy continued to grow above its historical average rate. Domestic demand
remained generally firm with its contribution to headline growth the highest in seven quarters
due to higher government spending and increased capital formation while household
expenditure continued to slow down. Meanwhile, most recent surveys show business and
consumer sentiment turning less sanguine in the third quarter albeit still optimistic in the next
few succeeding quarters. Nonetheless, the Philippine composite PMI remained above the 50point expansion threshold at 58.1 in August, the highest level since May 2016. Aggregate
demand is also expected to be supported in part by accelerated NG spending.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - Domestic retail prices of rice continued to increase in September 2018 amid the ongoing lean
season. Nonetheless, public and private sector rice importations and the implementation of a
suggested retail price (SRP) of well-milled rice in Metro Manila are expected to help temper
the rise in rice prices during the lean months. Moreover, the increased likelihood of the
passage of the proposed rice tariffication bill could also help push down the retail prices of rice
in 2019.

Wage Developments

  - As of 10 September 2018, wage petitions have been filed in four regions, including NCR and
Regions VI, VII, and XI. The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines submitted a new wage hike
petition in NCR on 15 June 2018 while region VI, VII, and XI have new minimum wages
effective on 12 July 2018, 3 August 2018, and 16 August 2018, respectively. This brings the
number of approved regional wage hike petitions to 15 in non-agriculture industry, with 19
approved regional wage hike petitions in other industries in 2018.

Oil Price Developments

  - Average crude oil prices continued to increase in September 2018 due to supply concerns over
the upcoming US sanctions against Iran. At the same time, unplanned production disruptions
due to adverse weather conditions (i.e., “Gordon”, Hurricane Florence) and continued decline
in Venezuela output also exerted upward pressures on global oil prices.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

  - The overall electricity rate decreased in September 2018 due to lower demand in the Luzon
grid and less capacity outage, which brought down rates from the Wholesale Electricity Spot
Market (WESM).

**F. Financial market developments**

  - The Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) dipped in early September due to higher-thanexpected August inflation data and slower Q2 GDP growth. Similarly, the peso further
depreciated against the US dollar over inflation concerns and risk-off sentiment arising from
the continued concern over trade tensions among key economies.

**G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions**

  - Liquidity and credit growth remained manageable. In July, domestic liquidity growth
decelerated to 11.0 percent (from 11.8 percent in June) while bank lending grew at a slightly
faster rate at 19.6 percent (from 19.1 percent). Meanwhile, market interest rates (time deposit
and lending rates) increased following the 100-bps cumulative hike in the BSP’s key policy rate.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

  - The ongoing efforts to raise infrastructure spending provided a boost to domestic activity. The
National Government (NG) recorded a fiscal deficit of P279.4 billion for January – July 2018,
which is 36 percent higher than the previous year’s deficit level at P205.0 billion. NG
expenditures rose by 23 percent in the first seven months after excluding interest payments.

**I.  External developments**

  - Global economic activity continues to expand, albeit slower, as business activity in the service
sector increased at a weaker pace. Robust market demand supported economic activity in the
US and in the euro area as well as the manufacturing activity in Japan. Meanwhile, economic
activity in India slowed down as growth in both the manufacturing and service sectors were
weaker in August.

  - A further tightening in the US raises worries of heightened risk aversion in global financial
markets. At the same time, investors are keeping a cautious stance amid the potential adverse
economic impact of tariffs imposed by the US against its trading partners. In emerging
markets, there is a prevailing risk-off sentiment as headlines from Turkey and Argentina
exacerbated the potential negative impact of rising interest rates in the US. Both Turkey and
Argentina are experiencing significant currency depreciation pressures amid a steep inflation
environment.
