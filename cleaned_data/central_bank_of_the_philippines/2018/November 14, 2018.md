**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON THE MONETARY POLICY**

**STANCE HELD ON 15 NOVEMBER 2018[1]**

**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board (MB) decided to:

a) Increase the BSP’s key policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent for the

overnight RRP (borrowing) facility, effective 16 November 2018; and,

b) Adjust the interest rates on the overnight deposit and overnight lending facilities

accordingly.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

  - The Monetary Board’s decision to raise the BSP’s policy interest rate anew was based on its
assessment that the balance of risks to inflation is still weighted to the upside and inflation
expectations have remained elevated. While the latest inflation forecasts show inflation
settling within the 2-4 percent target band in 2019-2020, after considering the impact of the
rice tariffication bill and suspension of the oil excise tax, the MB was of the view that a followthrough policy action would help anchor inflation expectations and preempt further secondround effects.

  - The MB deemed it necessary to respond with proactive policy action to help temper the risks
to the inflation outlook, including those emanating from the continued uncertainty in the
external environment amid tighter global financial conditions and trade tensions among major
economies. The MB believes that prospects for the domestic economy remain generally
favorable and allow some scope for a measured adjustment in the policy rate.

  - The MB continues to emphasize the need for follow-through non-monetary measures to
mitigate the impact of supply-side factors on inflation.

1 The discussions herein reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on a comprehensive set of economic information available at
the time of the policy meeting. The highlights of the discussions during the 15 November 2018 monetary policy meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its regular meeting held on ___ November 2018. The next meeting of the Monetary Board on the monetary policy stance is

**III.   Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook**

The MB considered the following developments in deciding on the monetary policy stance:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Year-on-year headline inflation held steady in October 2018 at 6.7 percent from the previous
month’s level using the 2012-based consumer price index (CPI) series. This brought the
year-to-date average to 5.1 percent, which is above the Government’s announced inflation
target range of 3.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point for 2018. Month-on-month seasonallyadjusted headline inflation decelerated further in October 2018 to 0.3 percent from 0.8
percent in the previous month, indicating that inflation momentum has started to slow down.

  - Meanwhile, core inflation readings are higher in October. The number of CPI items above the
4-percent threshold and the diffusion index of price changes have likewise increased
compared to that in the previous month, suggesting still broader inflation pressures.

**B.  Inflation expectations**

  - Mean inflation forecasts from surveys of private sector economists continued to show
generally elevated inflation expectations for 2018-2020. Preliminary results of the BSP’s
November 2018 survey of private sector economists showed mean inflation forecasts at 5.4
percent for 2018 (unchanged from the October survey), 4.4 percent for 2019 (from 4.5
percent), and 3.9 percent for 2020 (unchanged from October). Based on the survey conducted
by Consensus Economics in October 2018, mean inflation forecasts are higher at 5.3 percent
(from 5 percent) for 2018 and 4.4 percent (from 4 percent) for 2019.

**C.  Inflation outlook**

  - Compared with the previous forecast round, the latest baseline inflation forecasts for 2018
and 2020 were slightly higher at 5.3 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively. Meanwhile,
baseline inflation forecast for 2019 was lower at 3.5 percent, after considering the estimated
impact of the rice tariffication bill and the suspension of the excise tax on oil.

**Baseline Inflation Forecasts**

**2012-based CPI**

27 Sep MB 15 Nov MB

2018 5.2 5.3

2019 4.3 3.5

2020 3.2 3.3

  - The risks to future inflation remain on the upside in 2018 and 2019, but downside risks to the
outlook are seen to dominate in 2020 due largely to the projected impact of slower global
growth.

`o` Additional wage adjustments and transport fare hikes, higher electricity rates, and faster
than-expected monetary policy normalization in advanced economies, and the reversion to
higher tariffs on key food items are the main upside risks to inflation.

`o` Meanwhile, the slower global economic growth due to protectionist policies in advanced

economies and geopolitical tensions are the main downside risks to inflation.

**D. Demand conditions**

  - GDP growth decelerated in the third quarter due to lower growth in household consumption.
Although lower than the trend, the Q3 2018 GDP growth was higher than the long-run
average. Meanwhile, government spending accelerated while gross fixed capital formation
continued to grow at double-digit rate. In terms of contribution to growth, domestic demand
moderated due weaker consumer spending while net external balance was unchanged.
Meanwhile, most recent surveys show business and consumer sentiment turning less sanguine
in the third quarter albeit still optimistic in the next few succeeding quarters. Nonetheless, the
Philippine composite PMI remained above the 50-point expansion threshold at 55.3 in October
2018 from 54.4 in September. Aggregate demand is also expected to be supported in part by
accelerated National Government (NG) spending.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - Domestic rice prices decreased significantly in the provinces of Batangas, Palawan, Aklan,
Bukidnon, Sarangani, and Surigao del Sur. This can be partly attributed to the onset of the
main harvest season in some provinces, as well as the continued arrival of rice imports by the
government and the private sector.

  - On 14 November 2018, the Senate approved the rice tariffication bill on third and final
reading. The bill, which aims to replace the system of imposing quantitative import restrictions
on rice with tariffs, is expected to lower rice prices in the market. The bill also earmarks P10
billion for the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund or Rice fund which will be allotted for
the provision of farm machinery and equipment, seed production, and training on rice farming,
among others.

Wage Developments

  - Two regions namely, the Bicol Region (Region V) and the Northern Mindanao Region (Region
X) have their wage petitions approved recently. For Region V, the P20.00-P30.00 increase in
basic pay was granted effective 21 September 2018, to be given in two tranches. While for
Region X, the P27.00-P35.00 increase became effective on 1 November 2018. In NCR, the
Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board-NCR granted the NCR a P25.00 increase in
basic pay and the integration of the P10.00 COLA into the basic pay effective 22 November
2018.

Oil Price Developments

  - Global crude oil prices fell significantly in early November 2018 following US decision to issue
waivers to majority of Iran oil consumers even as US shale oil production continued to rise. At
the same time, Saudi Arabia has increased its output to ensure sufficient supply in the market.
The lower demand expectations due to weaker growth outlook has also pushed crude oil
prices down.

  - In a memorandum dated 8 November 2018, President Duterte approved the recommendation
of the economic managers to suspend the scheduled increase in the excise tax on oil in
January 2019. The temporary suspension of excise taxes on oil will be subject to review every
quarter and is assumed to be implemented only until the first quarter of 2019.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

  - The overall electricity rate decreased in October 2018 due mainly to lower generation charge.
According to Meralco, the downward adjustment in the generation cost was primarily due to
decrease in generation charge of P0.28 per kWh from the Power Supply Agreements (PSAs).

**F. Financial market developments**

  - The Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) entered bear market territory in October 2018 on
concerns over rising domestic inflation and interest rates. A less robust outlook for the
Philippine economy and a decline in global equity markets also weighed heavily on the local
bourse. Meanwhile, the peso further depreciated against the US dollar in October following
the release of hawkish US Federal Reserve meeting minutes for its 25-26 September 2018
meeting and amid lingering US-China trade tensions as well as geopolitical concerns in Europe.

**G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions**

  - Credit growth slowed down while domestic liquidity expanded by single-digit rate. In
September 2018, domestic liquidity growth decelerated to 9.7 percent (from 10.4 percent in
August) while bank lending growth eased to 17.4 percent (from 18.9 percent). Meanwhile,
market interest rates (deposit and lending rates) increased following the 150-bps cumulative
hike in the BSP’s key policy rate.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

  - The ongoing efforts to raise infrastructure spending provided a boost to domestic activity. The
NG recorded a fiscal deficit of P378.2 billion for January – September 2018, which is 78 percent
higher than the previous year’s deficit level at P213.1 billion due to strong revenue collections
and surge in government spending. Netting out interest payments, NG expenditures went up
by 26 percent.

**I.  External developments**

  - Indicators of global economic activity continue to signal a mild expansion as business activity in
accelerated in the service sector but eased slightly in the manufacturing sector. Stronger new
work inflows supported economic activity in Japan and in India. Meanwhile, economic activity
in the US and in the euro area slowed down due to weaker growth in new business.

  - Continued policy uncertainty, spillovers from tighter global financial conditions, and
geopolitical risks remain as downside risks to global growth over the medium term. The
downward revision of the International Monetary Fund in its global economic growth
projections reflects the surprises that suppressed economic activity in some major advanced
economies in early 2018, the negative effects of the US-China trade measures implemented or
approved between April and mid-September, as well as a weaker outlook for some key
emerging market and developing economies arising from country-specific factors, tighter
financial conditions, geopolitical tensions, and higher oil import bills.
