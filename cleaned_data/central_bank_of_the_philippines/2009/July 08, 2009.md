**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 9 JULY 2009[1]**


**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Reduce the BSP’s policy rates by 25 basis points to 4.00
percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 6.00
percent for the overnight RP (lending) rate;

b) Reduce accordingly the current interest rates on term RRPs,
RPs, and SDAs; and

c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The recommendation to reduce policy rates took into consideration the BSP’s
resolve to provide support to economic activity to the extent that the inflation
outlook would allow.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

   - The Monetary Board noted that there remained some scope to
reduce policy rates further.

� The latest baseline forecasts continued to reflect a lower inflation
path over the policy horizon, with average inflation falling at around
the middle of the target range for 2009 and at the lower bound of
the target range for 2010.

� Inflation expectations remained well anchored. The results of the
BSP and private sector surveys reflected inflation expectations
falling within the target ranges for both 2009 and 2010.

1 The discussions presented herein reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the
information available at the time of the policy meeting. The sets of economic information were provided by
the technical secretariat of the Advisory Committee (AC). The Advisory Committee is composed of the
Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely: the Deputy Governor of the Monetary
Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor of the Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor
of the Monetary Policy Sub-Sector, and the Managing Director of the Treasury Department. The highlights
of the discussions on the 9 July 2009 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular
meeting held on 30 July 2009. The next meeting of the Monetary Board on monetary policy issues is
scheduled on 20 August 2009.

� The downside pressures on prices continued to predominate and
were due mainly to expectations of a marked weakening of global
economic activity and still ample inventory levels. In addition, with
economic recovery expected to be gradual as financial market
conditions remain weak, a rapid rebound in commodity prices was
seen as remote for the near term.

� However, the Board was mindful of upside pressures on prices
over the long term and the possibility that global commodity prices
could be reaching a trough.

� With inflation pressures subdued and domestic demand conditions
weak, there could be some scope for monetary policy to balance
any short-run trade-off between inflation variability and output
variability.

- The Board recognized that a continued accommodative stance would
lend support to the productive sectors of the economy. Bringing down
policy rates further could induce banks to lower borrowing costs
which, in turn, could help promote wider access to domestic sources
of financing, encouraging investment growth and providing the needed
working capital to sustain the efficient operation of businesses.

- •• The Board also noted that an accommodative stance would help
support market confidence. While there have been tentative signs of
stabilization, the world economy is expected to remain under a
prolonged period of deleveraging. Confidence could be slow to return,
and the rebalancing of global demand could take some time. Thus,
monetary policy must continue to be on the accommodative side to
reinforce confidence among banks, firms, and households.

- •• With considerable monetary stimulus already in place and the impact
of fiscal action already in the pipeline, the Monetary Board believed
that prevailing monetary settings were appropriately calibrated to the
outlook for inflation and domestic demand.

- •• The Monetary Board agreed to continue to pay close attention to signs
of global demand recovery as well as to possible build-up in
commodity price pressures over the medium term, with a view to
undertaking timely action towards a non-inflationary recovery in
economic activity.

**III.** **Recent Developments in Economic Indicators**

The Monetary Board’s decision took into account recent developments
in various economic indicators:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Headline inflation continued to fall in June, dropping to 1.5 percent
year-on-year from 3.3 percent in May, the lowest in more than 22
years. This brought the year-to-date average inflation down to 5.0
percent from 5.7 percent a month earlier.

  - All major commodity groups registered lower or negative inflation
rates in June. Lower food inflation accounted for the bulk of the
decline in headline inflation, with lower rice and corn prices and
slower price increases year-on-year in fruits and vegetables, fish, and
miscellaneous food. In addition, fuel prices were lower in June along
with rentals inflation. Services inflation turned negative as educational
services inflation slowed down and as transportation and
communication services inflation turned even more negative.

  - On a month-on-month, seasonally-adjusted basis, headline inflation
was zero in June from negative 0.1 percent in May.

  - Core inflation, which excludes specific food and energy items to
measure generalized price pressures, was lower at 3.9 percent yearon-year in June from 4.4 percent in May. Year-to-date core inflation
also went down from 5.7 percent to 5.4 percent. Likewise, all
alternative core inflation measures estimated by the BSP declined.

**B.  Inflation Expectations**

  - Recent surveys showed inflation expectations remained generally
well-anchored:

� Results of the BSP’s survey of private sector economists/analysts
for May 2009 showed within-target inflation expectations for both
2009 and 2010.

� The latest Asia Pacific consensus forecasts as of June 2009
showed lower inflation expectations for both 2009 and 2010.

� Meanwhile, the results of the Consumer Expectations Survey
(CES) for Q2 2009 showed marginally higher inflation expectations
for the next 12 months: from 8.6 percent in the previous survey to
8.7 percent.

**III.** **Recent Developments in Economic Indicators**

**C. Inflation Outlook**

  - Latest baseline forecasts showed a continued downward shift in the
inflation path, with annual average inflation likely to settle at about the
middle of the 3.5 percent + 1.0 percentage point target range for 2009
and at the lower bound of the target range of 4.5 percent + 1.0
percentage point for 2010.

  - The risks around the central projection for world economic activity
remained skewed towards the downside, suggesting some downside
risks as well to global commodity prices.

**D.  Demand conditions**

Economic activity weakened substantially in the first quarter, reflecting
the overall drag caused by the sharp decline in global economic activity.

  - GDP rose at an annual rate of 0.4 percent in Q1 2009 compared to
3.9 percent in the same quarter in the previous year and 2.9 percent in
the previous quarter.

  - Based on preliminary NSO data, merchandise exports contracted
further by 35.2 percent year-on-year in April 2009. Likewise,
merchandise imports declined more steeply by 37.4 percent year-onyear in April from a contraction of 36.2 percent in the previous month.

  - Other demand indicators also moderated:

� Average capacity utilization in April remained below last year’s
average level, although slightly higher than the previous month’s
figure.

� Year-on-year total vehicle sales declined in May as sales of
commercial vehicles and trucks and buses dipped. Meanwhile,
passenger car sales expanded.

� Q2 2009 CES results showed overall consumer confidence
declining quarter-on-quarter but still an improvement, year-onyear.

� Year-on-year energy sales of Meralco dropped in May by 0.7
percent after contracting by 1.4 percent in the previous month.
Energy sales also declined by 0.1 percent year-on-year in the
same period a year ago.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - Latest data from the NSCB showed that the growth in agriculture,
fishery and forestry (AFF) slowed down to 2.1 percent in Q1 2009
from 2.8 percent in the same period a year ago. Growth in AFF during
the period, which accounted for about a fifth (19.7 percent) of total
GDP, was driven by the palay, fishery, poultry, livestock, and banana
subsectors. Contraction in the corn, sugarcane, and other crops
subsectors pulled down agricultural growth in Q1 2009.

  - _Palay production for Q2 and Q3 2009 is expected to grow by 1.8_
percent and 2.4 percent year-on-year, respectively. Meanwhile, corn
production for Q2 2009 is forecast at 1.3 MMT, 1.0 percent lower than
the Q2 2008 output, due to heavy rains and the early harvest in Q1.
For Q3 2009, corn harvest is expected to rebound and increase by 2.3
percent relative to the same period in 2008.

  - FAO’s April 2009 Crop Prospects and Food Situation continued to
suggest an overall decline in world cereal production in 2009 from the
previous year’s record output as farmers have been discouraged by
poor expected returns on their crops due to the sharp decline in grain
prices and high input costs.

Oil Price Developments

  - The spot price of Dubai crude oil was higher in May and June amidst
expectations that the economic slowdown may be bottoming out and
reports of greater-than-expected decline in US crude and gasoline
inventories due to improving demand. Given these developments in oil
demand, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
decided to maintain its current oil production level during its meeting
on 28 May 2009.

  - Meanwhile, prices in the futures market decreased. The price of Brent
crude oil for August 2009 deliveries fell to US$64.05 per barrel on 6
July 2009, lower by US$5.01 per barrel relative to its month-ago level
of US$69.06 per barrel. Futures prices eased on signs that US oil
demand would be slow to recover after it was reported that US
unemployment jumped to 9.5 percent in June, the highest in almost 26
years.

  - In the domestic market, oil companies raised the price of gasoline (by
P0.50 per liter) but reduced the prices of kerosene and diesel (by
P0.39 per liter and P0.38 per liter, respectively) on 7 July. This
brought the year-to-date net increase in the prices of gasoline

products to P10.25 for unleaded gasoline, P1.18 for diesel, P0.37 for
kerosene, and P5.45 for LPG.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

 - Compared to the previous month, Meralco rates were lower in June by
about 4.0 percent. Meralco passed on to its customers lower
generation costs from the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM)
and its suppliers. Meralco’s suppliers had lower generation costs due
to cheaper natural gas.

 - The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System-Regulatory
Office (MWSS-RO) had approved the reduction in water rates through
the foreign currency differential adjustments (FCDA) for Q3 2009 by
P0.01/m[3] and P0.09/m[3] for Manila Water and Maynilad, respectively.

**F. Financial Market Developments**

Government Securities Market

 - Relative to their 29 May levels, the yields and term spreads
(secondary market yields of GS net of overnight reverse repurchase or
RRP rates) generally increased across all tenors on 6 July 2009.
Yields increased with the decline in bond prices as banks tightened
their positions and some traders opted to stand in the sidelines after
the government announced it may boost bond sales on concerns over
the widening budget deficit, especially given the lower-than-expected
GDP growth performance for the first quarter.

Interest Rate and Interest Rate Differentials

 - The differential between the BSP policy rate and the US federal funds
rate continued to narrow in May, following the BSP’s 25-basis-point
policy rate cut on 29 May. Adjusted for the risk premium, the
differential widened with the decline in the risk premium, potentially
encouraging capital inflows.

 - The cumulative 175-basis-point policy rate cut of the BSP from 18
December 2008 to 28 May 2009 appeared to have been passed on
partially by depository corporations to their borrowers. Actual bank
lending rates declined by 87 basis points during the period 22-26 June
2009 to reach 8.401 percent relative to 9.272 percent for the period 812 December 2008.

Stock Market

 - Stock market activity remained upbeat, as the Philippine Stock Exchange
Index (PSEi) rose in May 2009 and June 2009, sparked by the market’s

positive perception that the economic downturn is bottoming out. The
index closed 32 percent higher year-to-date on 7 July as investor
sentiments were boosted by higher revenue collections, S&P's decision to
maintain the country's credit rating, and expectations of another rate cut.

Foreign Exchange

  - Despite the lower-than-expected GDP growth in the first quarter, the
peso continued to appreciate in the first week of June with sustained
strong OF remittances and the continuing weakness of the dollar.
However, from the second week until the end of June, the peso
weakened due to market concerns on prospects of a wider fiscal
deficit, weak economic growth, a possible credit rating downgrade,
and the political noise created by the prospects of amendments to the
Philippine constitution.

  - On a year-to-date basis, the peso and most of the Asian currencies
weakened against the US dollar on 30 June 2009.

Global Bond and Credit Default Swap Spreads

  - In June, credit risk continued to fall as financial markets showed signs
of stabilizing as aggressive policy measures adopted in advanced
economies appeared to have gained traction. The EMBI+Global
spread slightly narrowed on 29 June to 446 basis points (bps), lower
than the 480 bps average in May. Similarly, the EMBI+ Philippine
spread slightly declined to 324 bps on 29 June compared to the
previous month’s average of 330 bps. The cost of protecting the
Philippine debt from default, as measured by the Philippine five-year
CDS spread, likewise narrowed to 223 bps in the same period.

**G. Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

  - The growth of domestic liquidity or M3 increased to 15.0 percent yearon-year in May, higher than the 13.7 percent recorded in the previous
month. The robust expansion in net foreign assets (NFA) at 19.8
percent in May continued to drive liquidity growth. Net foreign assets
rose as the BSP continued to build up its international reserves, while
banks reduced their foreign liabilities possibly as they paid off
maturing obligations.

  - The outstanding loans of commercial banks including reverse
repurchase agreements (RRPs) grew by 10.2 percent year-on-year in
May, lower than the 13.4 percent increase registered in April. Net of
RRP placements with the BSP, bank lending also grew at a slower
pace of 17.3 percent in May from 19.0 percent in the previous month.

-----

  - Total capital raised in the PSE for the period January-May 2009
remained significantly lower at P5.3 billion compared to P15.8 billion
during the same period in 2008. Meanwhile, corporate bond issuance
during the first five months of 2009 at P180.5 billion was more than
triple the level recorded in the comparable period in 2008 at P49.2
billion.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

  - The January-May fiscal deficit reached P123.2 billion in 2009, more
than six times the P18.8 billion deficit level in the comparable period
last year. Compared to the programmed level, this represented 79.4
percent of the program deficit (P155.1 billion) for the first semester.

**I.  External developments**

  - The world economy continues to face a severe downturn.
Governments, central banks, and investors alike continue to watch out
for signs that will either confirm or negate expectations that the global
economic decline is indeed showing signs of bottoming out.

  - The most recent indicators from the JP Morgan’s Global Purchasing
Managers’ Index (PMI) point to a deceleration in the pace of decline in
economic activity. Nevertheless, the PMI indicator for manufacturing
activity is still at a very low level by historical standards, and is well
below the level that would be consistent with an outright recovery.

Based on the PMI, the US manufacturing sector failed to grow in May
for the 16[th] consecutive month. Nonetheless, based on the latest report
of the Institute for Supply Management, the overall economy grew for the
first time following seven months of decline. Meanwhile, the EU’s first
quarter GDP declined at a rate lower than previously anticipated. In
Japan, although economic conditions continued to deteriorate, there
are signs that the pace of decline may have begun to decelerate.

  - Global inflationary pressures have been diminishing rapidly, owing to
base effects stemming from lower commodity prices, weaker labor
market conditions, and greater global economic slack.

  - As governments worldwide have opted to spend their way out of
recession, many countries are recording higher fiscal deficits, and are
faced with the possibility that they may need to pay higher interest on
rapidly expanding debt going forward. A commitment to long-term
fiscal consolidation will help address concerns over fiscal
sustainability.
