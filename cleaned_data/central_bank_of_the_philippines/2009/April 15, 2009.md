**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 16 APRIL 2009[1]**


**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Reduce the BSP’s policy rates by 25 basis points to 4.50
percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 6.50
percent for the overnight RP (lending) rate;

b) Reduce accordingly the current interest rates on term RRPs,
RPs, and SDAs; and

c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The recommendation to reduce policy rates took into consideration the
BSP’s commitment to achieve medium-term price stability and its resolve to
undertake policy actions that will ensure the soundness and stability of the
financial system and provide cushion against continuing headwinds to
economic growth.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

    - The Monetary Board noted that there was still room for an additional
25-basis-point reduction given the continued favorable inflation
outlook:

��Baseline forecasts continued to indicate that annual average
inflation will fall within the target ranges for both 2009 and
2010.

## ��������������������������������������������
1 The discussions presented herein reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the
information available at the time of the policy meeting. The sets of economic information were provided by
the technical secretariat of the Advisory Committee (AC). The Advisory Committee is composed of the
Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely: the Deputy Governor for the Monetary
Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor for the Supervision and Examination Sector, the Managing Director
of the Monetary Policy Sub-Sector, and the Managing Director of the Treasury Department. The highlights
of the discussions on the 16 April 2009 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular
meeting held on 7 May 2009. The next meeting of the Monetary Board on monetary policy issues is
scheduled on 28 May 2009.

��Inflation expectations remained well-anchored. The results of
the BSP and private sector surveys reflected stable or
declining inflation expectations anchored towards the targets
over the policy horizon.

��On balance, inflation risks were slightly skewed to the
downside, with increasingly weaker global and domestic
demand conditions and lower probability of any significant
near-term recovery in commodity prices.

��However, while inflation conditions were seen as generally
favorable, a prudent rate move was deemed appropriate
given the upside risks to inflation stemming from the:

`o` volatility in the peso-dollar exchange rate and oil prices,
and
`o` possible increases in utility tariffs and food prices.

- Given the expected sustained slowdown in inflationary pressures,
considerable monetary stimulus in the pipeline and ample liquidity in
the system, the Board decided to continue its measured pace of
monetary easing. To date, the BSP has already responded
aggressively since the onset of the crisis with both interest rate
reductions (total of 125 basis points since December 2008) and a
variety of liquidity-enhancing measures to help ensure the
functioning of financial markets.

- The Board recognized that monetary policy is an important policy
lever in supporting demand to minimize any further corrosive
feedback stemming from weakening economic and financial
conditions. Lower policy rates will help bring down the cost of
borrowing and promote wider access to domestic financing and will
help relieve the negative feedback loop of deleveraging. Given the
background of extreme uncertainty surrounding the downturn,
lowering policy rates could help support growth by encouraging
spending, investment, and production.

- The Board also noted that monetary policy cannot single-handedly
limit the contractionary effects of the crisis on the economy.
Monetary policy should work with other government measures,
including more active fiscal policy.

**III.** **Recent Developments in Economic Indicators**

The Monetary Board’s decision took into account recent developments
in various economic indicators:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

    - Headline inflation dropped to 6.4 percent year-on-year in March from
7.3 percent in February due mainly to lower electricity rates, price
rollbacks in diesel and gasoline, recent reduction in jeepney fares,
and lower year-on-year inflation for rice, meat, and miscellaneous
food.

    - Year-on-year core inflation was also lower in March at 5.6 percent
from 6.4 percent in February.

**B.  Inflation Expectations**

    - Recent surveys showed steady or declining inflation expectations:

��The Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) for Q1 2009
showed lower inflation expectations for the next 12 months:
from 8.8 percent in the previous survey to 8.6 percent.

��Results of the Business Expectations Survey (BES) for Q1
2009 indicated that the proportion of respondents that
anticipate inflation to move up in Q1 2009 has significantly
decreased.

��Results of the BSP’s initial monthly (from quarterly) survey of
private sector economists/analysts for March 2009 showed
unchanged inflation expectations for both 2009 and 2010.

��Meanwhile, the latest private sector consensus forecasts as of
March 2009 showed unchanged inflation expectations for
2009 and slightly lower inflation expectations for 2010.

**C. Inflation Outlook**

    - Latest baseline forecasts continued to indicate that inflation would
settle within the 2009 and 2010 targets.

    - Meanwhile, upside risks to inflation include: volatility in world oil
prices and the exchange rate, possible increases in utility rates, and
potential price pressures coming from a reduction in global cereal
output in 2009 as supply responds to lower selling prices, high input
costs, and tighter credit conditions.

**III.** **Recent Developments in Economic Indicators**


-----

**D.  Demand conditions**

Recent indicators suggest that aggregate demand conditions are
under strong pressure as consumer spending continued to show restraint
and as weaker global economic activity took its toll on exports.

    - GDP posted a modest growth of 4.5 percent in Q4 2008 compared to
6.4 percent in the same quarter in the previous year and 5.0 percent
in the previous quarter.

    - Merchandise exports showed a record decline of 41.0 percent yearon-year in January 2009.

    - Merchandise imports declined further by 34.5 percent in January
2009.

    - Selected demand indicators moderated:

��Sales of commercial vehicles, and trucks and buses declined
in February while sales of passenger cars decelerated.

��Energy sales declined by 9.9 percent year-on-year in January,
pulled down by the negative growth across sectors except
streetlights.

��Average capacity utilization in manufacturing dropped
markedly to 77.5 percent in January 2009, indicating a trend
decline starting November 2008.

��MISSI figures indicate slower manufacturing activity in
January 2009. �
�
��Results of the first quarter 2009 consumer and business
expectations surveys show sustained bearish sentiment.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

    - Average retail prices of rice declined beginning in the fourth week of
March 2009 due to the increase in supply following the summer
harvest season.

    - FAO’s report on Crop Prospects and Food Situation suggests an
overall decline in world cereal production in 2009 from the previous

year’s record output due to a decline in the area planted to cereals of
major exporters, adverse weather conditions, and high input costs.

    - Meanwhile, with the risks to the outlook for global GDP growth
weighted heavily on the downside for 2009 and 2010, the expected
future path for global commodity prices will be lower for the same
period compared to 2008.

Oil Price Developments

   - The spot price of Dubai crude was higher by US$2.50 per barrel in
March 2009 at US$45.59 per barrel from US$43.09 per barrel in
February. Prices were influenced by expectations that recent moves
by the US government to revive the economy would boost demand for
oil. The weak US dollar also gave support to oil prices.

   - Notwithstanding the recent boost in expectations, given the current
global economic condition, the Energy Information Administration
(EIA) still projects that annual world oil consumption would decline by
almost 1.4 million barrels per day (bbl/d) in 2009. Likewise, both
OPEC [2] and the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that
global oil demand for 2009 will fall by 1.0 million bbl/d and 1.2 million
bbl/d, respectively.[3]

   - Prices in the futures market also increased. The price of Brent crude
oil for May 2009 deliveries rose to US$52.75 per barrel on 2 April
2009, higher by US$9.59 per barrel or 22.2 percent relative to its
month-ago level of US$43.16 per barrel.

   - Oil companies raised the prices of petroleum products on 14 April
2009. This brings the year-to-date net adjustment in the prices of
gasoline products to P6.00 for unleaded gasoline, - P2.44 for diesel,

    - P4.24 for kerosene, and P2.51 for LPG.

   - In the transport sector, the National Council for Consumer Protection
(NCCP) filed a petition with the Land Transportation and Franchising
Regulatory Board (LTFRB) requesting the reduction in bus and
jeepney fares.

Developments in the Utilities Sector



 - Transco’s petition before the ERC to recover P1.8-billion worth of
damages incurred from the series of super typhoons in 2006 was
approved. This allowed Transco to collect force majeure pass-through
amounts from its Luzon and Visayas customers in 2009.

 - Effective March 2009, Meralco implemented the P0.040/kwh refund
under the CERA. This offset the P0.025/kwh increase in generation
charge and resulted in a net reduction of P0.015/kwh in the March
billing. The higher cost of supply from both the Wholesale Electricity
Spot Market (WESM) and the NPC due to warmer weather caused the
slight increase in generation charge in March.

**F. Financial Market Developments**

Government Securities Market

 - Relative to their 31 March 2009 levels, the yields and term spreads
(secondary market yields of GS net of overnight reverse repurchase or
RRP rates) generally decreased across all tenors on 13 April 2009.
The yield curve shifted downward as bond prices increased, on
expectations that the BSP will cut its policy rates further to support
economic growth during its 16 April 2009 Monetary Board policy
meeting. In addition, positive sentiments also continued to contribute
to lower yields as market participants reacted to the news that the
BSP’s average 2009 inflation forecast has declined to 3.5 percent
from 3.9 percent.

Interest Rate and Interest Rate Differentials

 - Policy interest rate differentials tightened in March 2009, while
improving sovereign risk spreads led to positive risk-adjusted
differentials in February and March. The differential between the BSP
policy rate and the US federal funds rate narrowed in March 2009,
following the BSP’s 25-basis-point cut in its policy rate.

 - Meanwhile, the after-tax differentials between the domestic and
foreign interest rates narrowed in March 2009, and real lending rates
declined as the banks’ average lending rate declined steadily
beginning January 2009 to reach 8.4 percent in March.

Stock Market

 - The Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSEi) gained further ground in
March and early April. In early April, the PSEi sustained an uptrend for
five consecutive trading days starting 1 April to 8 April 2009 to close at

2,072.81 index points. This was way above the 2,000 psychological
resistance level, reflecting investors’ optimism on account of positive
global developments.

Foreign Exchange

   - Despite the reduction in the BSP’s key interest rates on 5 March
2009,[4] the peso remained broadly steady as investors gained some
appetite for regional stocks as the US dollar weakened on market
fears that the plan of the Federal Reserve to buy US$300 billion worth
of US Treasuries could crowd out global markets. However, lingering
market concerns on the health of the global financial system, the
expected slowdown in capital inflows and OF remittances, and the
contraction in exports earnings exerted pressures on the peso.

   - In the first half of April 2009, the peso, together with other Asian
currencies, strengthened following the rally in the region’s equity
markets on renewed optimism over signs of improvement in the US
economy based on firmer US factory and home sales data. However,
on a year-to-date basis, the peso depreciated against the US dollar by
0.3 percent at the close of trading on 14 April 2009.[5]

Global Bond and Credit Default Swap Spreads

    - For the period 3-14 April 2009, debt spreads continued to narrow
following weeks of general tightening. The positive market sentiment
was buoyed by speculation that Asian economies will recover faster
than investors expected as governments in the region boosted
spending and reduced borrowings. The announcement of the Group
of 20 policy makers that they will triple the amount the IMF can lend
to countries likewise provided some relief to the market.

**G. Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

   - Domestic liquidity or M3 grew by 14.6 percent year-on-year in
February, a slowdown from the previous month’s growth of 16.1
percent. However, this was higher than the 6.8 percent expansion
recorded during the same month a year ago. On a monthly basis,

4 The BSP has reduced its policy rates three times from December 2008 given an easing inflation outlook.
On 18 December 2008 and 29 January 2009, the BSP reduced its key policy rates by 50 basis points in
each occasion while on 5 March 2009, the BSP’s key policy rates were reduced by 25 basis points. These
policy reductions brought the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and the overnight
lending or repurchase (RP) rate to 4.75 percent and 6.75 percent, respectively.

seasonally-adjusted M3 declined further by 0.8 percent in February,
compared to the 0.4 percent (revised) deceleration posted in the
previous month.

   - Meanwhile, bank lending activity continued to expand in February.
Outstanding loans of commercial banks including reverse repurchase
agreements (RRPs) increased by 22.5 percent year-on-year, an
acceleration from the previous month’s growth of 18.8 percent. Net of
RRP placements with the BSP, lending also increased by 22.6 percent
year-on-year in February, slightly slower compared to the 24.5 percent
expansion in the previous month.

   - Capital-raising activities in the PSE remained weak in the period
January-March 2009 as companies pushed back plans of selling
shares due to unfavorable market conditions. Meanwhile, corporate
bond issuances increased during the first three months of 2009.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

   - The January to February 2009 deficit of the National Government
reached P67.0 billion, higher than the deficit of P32.9 billion incurred
during the same period last year.

**I.** **External developments**

   - Available indicators over the past three months signaled a deeper and
more widespread downturn in the global economy. Notwithstanding the
decisive policy measures across the globe, the economic toll of the sharp
global downturn has been mounting and has now affected advanced,
emerging, and developing economies.

   - Amid the resulting weakening in external demand and the possible rise in
protectionist sentiments, global trade in 2009 is expected to record the
largest decline in 80 years. The financial crisis, therefore, has long-term
implications not only for the US, the Euro area and other advanced
economies, but for developing economies as well.

   - On the upside, inflationary pressures continue to ease, owing to sharply
declining commodity prices and weak global demand, and basic
consumption spending has remained strong in most, if not all, of Asia.

   - However, during the second week of April, markets have gradually
turned optimistic on the possibility that the downtrend may be nearing
the bottom following tentative but positive developments in the US.
