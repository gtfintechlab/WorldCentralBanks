**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 1 OCTOBER 2009[1]**


**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at 4.00 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 6.00 percent for the
overnight RP (lending) rate;

b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The Monetary Board’s decision took into consideration the BSP’s latest
assessment that the prevailing monetary settings remain appropriate given
the continued favorable and within-target inflation outlook amidst increasing
signs of economic recovery.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

   - On balance, the Monetary Board agreed that there was no compelling
reason to modify the prevailing monetary settings. The inflation
outlook continued to be within the target range, while both BSP and
private sector surveys showed that inflation expectations remained
anchored toward the target range over the policy horizon. At the same
time, there were increasing signs of recovery, with real sector activity
gradually normalizing, supported by household and government
spending.

   - The presence of continued soft spots in the macroeconomy supported
the need to preserve the stimulus to economic activity. The continued

1 The discussions presented herein reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the
information available at the time of the policy meeting. The sets of economic information were provided by
the technical secretariat of the Advisory Committee (AC). The Advisory Committee is composed of the
Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely: the Deputy Governor of the Monetary
Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor of the Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor
of the Monetary Policy Sub-Sector, and the Managing Director of the Treasury Department. The highlights
of the discussions on the 1 October 2009 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular
meeting held on 15 October 2009. The next meeting of the Monetary Board on monetary policy issues is
scheduled on 5 November 2009.

contraction in gross capital formation and manufacturing output along
with the modest expansion in credit activity, suggested that the current
monetary policy stance must continue to provide adequate stimulus to
the real sector. Moreover, the volatility of economic indicators in
advance economies highlighted the need to exercise caution in
assessing the evolving global economic and financial developments.

   - This need to be more circumspect with respect to any adjustment in
the monetary policy stance was also prompted by the additional
upside risks to the inflation outlook. Increasing signs of recovery in
real sector activity indicate potential demand-driven pressures on
consumer prices in the near term. Upward inflationary pressures could
also stem from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus at play in
advanced economies, the prevailing El Niño conditions in the Pacific
area, and pending petitions to increase power rates. On the downside,
inflationary pressures are expected to be dampened by the likelihood
of a slow recovery in global economic activity.

**III.   Recent Developments in Economic Indicators**

The Monetary Board’s decision took into account recent developments
in various economic indicators:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

   - Headline inflation continued to fall in August, dropping to 0.1 percent
year-on-year from 0.2 percent in July, the lowest in more than 22
years. This brought the year-to-date average down to 3.7 percent,
well within the target range for 2009. Most major commodity groups
registered lower or negative inflation rates in August.

   - On a month-on-month seasonally-adjusted basis, headline inflation
was 0.1 percent in August from -0.1 percent (revised) in July.

   - Core inflation, which excludes specific food and energy items to
measure generalized price pressures, was lower at 2.9 percent yearon-year in August from 3.6 percent in July. Likewise, all alternative
core inflation measures estimated by the BSP declined. Year-onyear, the trimmed mean dropped to 1.7 percent from 1.9 percent, the
weighted median to 2.2 percent from 2.9 percent, and the net of
volatile items measure to 0.8 percent from 1.3 percent. Seasonallyadjusted month-on-month core inflation in August fell to 0.0 percent
from 0.1 percent in the previous month.

**B.  Inflation Expectations**

   - Recent surveys showed that inflation expectations remained
generally well-anchored. Relative to previous surveys, the Asia

contraction in gross capital formation and manufacturing output along
with the modest expansion in credit activity, suggested that the current


-----

Pacific consensus forecast for September and the BSP’s survey of
private sector economists for August showed lower and within-target
average inflation forecasts for 2009.

   - In the same direction, results of the Q3 2009 Consumer Expectations
Survey (CES) reflected a marginally lower inflation expectation for the
next 12 months, while the Q3 2009 Business Expectations Survey
(BES) indicated a sharp decrease in the number of respondents
expecting inflation to increase in the current quarter.

**C. Inflation Outlook**

   - Emerging baseline inflation forecasts indicate that inflation would settle
within the 3.5 percent + 1.0 percentage point target range for 2009 and
slightly below the low-end of the 4.5 percent + 1.0 percentage point target
range for 2010.

   - While the inflation outlook continues to be within targe range, additonal
upside risks have emerged: increasing signs of recovery in real sector
activity, extensive macroeconomic stimulus in advanced economies,
pending petitions to increase power rates, and prevailing El Niño
conditions. Meanwhile, surges in world commodity prices over the policy
horizon appear less likely as global economic recovery is likely to be
sluggish, with the balance of risks remaining tilted to the downside.

**D.  Demand conditions**

   - Latest information shows increasing signs of stabilization in economic
activity. The second quarter GDP growth came out better than
expected at 1.5 percent. Various leading indicators also show that
economic conditions have started to improve: capacity utilization in the
manufacturing sector sustained its upward trend, energy sales
continued to grow, business and consumer confidence indices had
improved, and����� PMI index for August suggested that economic
expansion would continue.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

   - Growth in the agriculture, fishery and forestry (AFF) sector slowed
down to 0.3 percent in Q2 2009 from 4.9 percent in the same period a
year ago. The modest growth in AFF during the period, which
accounted for 16.5 percent of total GDP, was driven by fishery,
banana, poultry, livestock, _palay,_ and coconut including copra.
Contraction in the sugarcane, forestry, corn, and other crops
subsectors pulled down agricultural growth during Q2 2009.

 - As of 29 September 2009, the Department of Agriculture estimates the
damage to agricultural production brought by typhoon Ondoy to be
about P3.2 billion, around 98 percent of which is accounted for by rice.
In particular, initial estimated rice production loss is at 180.2 thousand
metric tons, which is equivalent to about 2.8 percent of the projected
rice production for Q4 2009.

 - As of 25 September 2009, the country's total rice inventory stood at
2.4 million metric tons, lower than the previous month’s level of 2.7
MMT but higher than the year-ago level of 1.9 MMT. The latest
inventory level is sufficient to last for 67 days. Meanwhile, the
contracted volume of imports for the whole year of 2009 (1.5 MMT)
had arrived as of 20 August 2009. The NFA contracted an additional
75 thousand MT on 22 July 2009, 69.975 thousand MT (or 93.3
percent) of which had already arrived as of 25 September 2009 and
had been included in the current national rice inventory.

 - El Niño conditions are now prevailing across the equatorial Pacific
Ocean. The persistence of these conditions will affect rainfall patterns
in the country in the coming months and may adversely affect
domestic water supply, agriculture, and day-to-day weather
conditions.

Oil Price Developments

 - Dubai crude oil prices were higher in August due to falling US
inventories, gains in the commodities market, and tensions in Nigeria.
However, oil prices decreased in September on unexpected increase
in oil inventories in the US and uncertainties on the pace of its
economic recovery. Prices in the futures market also decreased.

 - In the domestic market, oil companies reduced the prices of gasoline
and diesel by P1.00 per liter each on 29 September. This was the third
price reduction for gasoline and the fourth for diesel during the month.
This brought the year-to-date net decrease in the price of diesel to
P0.68/liter. Unleaded gasoline, however, still posted a year-to-date net
increase of P10.27/liter.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

 - Retail electricity rates declined in August and September. Meralco
reported that power rates were lower because of the start of the wet
season and the relatively stable prices at the WESM.

 - The ERC is set to approve the rules for the automatic recovery of
monthly fuel and purchased power costs and foreign-exchange related
costs of the NPC. Once the resolution becomes final, the NPC will be

**F. Financial Market Developments**

Government Securities Market

 - Relative to their 28 August levels, the yields and term spreads
(secondary market yields of GS net of overnight reverse repurchase or
RRP rates) broadly increased across most tenors on 29 September.
Yields increased with the decrease in bond prices, due to lingering
concerns about the country’s budget deficit.

Interest Rate and Interest Rate Differentials

 - The differential between the BSP policy rate and the US federal funds rate
remained steady in August. With the increase in the risk premium, the
risk-adjusted differential narrowed in August, potentially discouraging
capital inflows. However, the risk-adjusted differential subsequently
widened to 117 basis points as of 15 September 2009 as the risk
premium declined.

 - The cumulative 200-basis-point policy rate cut of the BSP appeared to
have been passed on by banks to their borrowers. Actual bank lending
rates declined by 151.3 basis points during the period 8-11 September
2009 to reach 7.789 percent relative to 9.302 percent for the period 8-12
December 2008. This implies a 76 percent pass-through by banks.

Stock Market

 - While the stock market index closed the month of August on a high
note, the index trekked a general downtrend in September. During the
first two weeks of September, trading was mixed as the index
seesawed between such negative news as the rise in job cuts in the
US private sector in August, the fall in the Shanghai Composite Index
due to the perception that China will not meet growth expectations,
and the lack of fresh news to stir local equities versus the positive
developments in the local front, including the continued easing of
inflation and the upward revision in the country’s GDP growth targets.
On the third to the fourth week of September, the PSEi was bearish as
market sentiments were generally sluggish, with the PSEi moving
within a tight consolidation range; while typhoon Ondoy was an added
market dampener.

Foreign Exchange

 - The peso weakened in early September as it reached a five-month
daily low of P49.01/US$1 on 2 September 2009 as risk aversion

continued amid heightened market concern on the health of US
financial institutions.[2] Nevertheless, the peso firmed up against the US
dollar by mid-September on improved risk appetite for high-yielding
assets as reflected in the rally in regional stock markets. Furthermore,
strong dollar inflows from OFs’ remittances helped buoy the peso. On
a year-to-date basis, however, the peso still depreciated by 0.1
percent against the US dollar as it closed at P47.52/US$1 on 29
September 2009.

Global Bond and Credit Default Swap Spreads

   - Debt spreads generally tightened in September from the end-August
level as growing signs of global economic recovery once again
attracted investors to higher-yielding emerging market assets. The G20’s stance on maintaining economic stimulus policies and other
measures in curbing bank leverage and raising the amount and quality
of bank assets fueled market optimism that the worst of the financial
crisis is over. The IMF’s estimate that developing economies shall
lead the global economy’s recovery from its worst recession likewise
supported the demand for emerging assets.

**G. Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

   - Domestic liquidity or M3 continued to grow in July at a slightly faster
pace of 12.9 percent year-on-year, relative to the 12.6 percent growth
recorded in the previous month. On a monthly basis, seasonallyadjusted M3 growth accelerated to 1.1 percent from 0.3 percent in
June. The expansion in liquidity continued to be fueled by the rise in
net foreign assets (NFA) at 21.7 percent in July from 17.6 in June.
This can be traced to the sustained growth in the NFA position of the
BSP and of the banks at 18.1 percent and 42.8 percent, respectively.
The NFA expanded as the BSP continued to build up its international
reserves, supported by steady remittances from abroad, while banks
repaid their foreign liabilities. On the other hand, the growth in net
domestic assets (NDA) slowed down to 1.5 percent year-on-year from
3.2 percent in the previous month, due mainly to the larger decline
(from -47.4 percent to -48.6 percent) in the net other items (NOI)
account against the broadly steady growth (at 15.0 percent) in net
domestic credit.

   - Bank lending net of banks' reverse repurchase (RRP) placements with
the BSP grew by 8.7 percent in July, albeit slower compared to the
14.3 percent expansion in the previous month. Outstanding loans of
commercial banks, including RRPs, also grew by 2.9 percent from
11.1 percent in the previous month, to reach P2.1 trillion at end-July

2009. On a month-on-month seasonally-adjusted basis, commercial
banks' lending declined by 5.5 percent (for loans inclusive of RRPs)
and by 3.1 percent (net of RRPs) in July.

   - Total capital raised in the PSE for the period January-August 2009
remained significantly lower compared to the same period in 2008.
Meanwhile, corporate bond issuance during the first eight months of
2009 was more than twice the level recorded in the comparable period
in 2008.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

   - The January-August 2009 fiscal deficit reached P210.0 billion, more
than six times higher than the P31.7 billion deficit in the comparable
period last year. This represents 96.5 percent of the P217.6 billion
programmed deficit for the first three quarters. Revenue collections
declined by 6.5 percent to P739.1 billion in January-August 2009
compared to P790.3 billion for the same period last year while the
cumulative expenditures for the first eight months of 2009 amounted
to P949.1 billion, 15.5 percent higher than the disbursements in the
comparable period in 2008. Excluding interest payments, total
disbursements increased by 21 percent to P745.7 billion. Interest
payments declined by 1 percent to reach P203.4 billion.

**I.  External developments**

  - Favorable developments, particularly the gains in manufacturing,
suggest that global recovery has begun and could accelerate earlier
than previously expected. Overall global economic growth, however,
remains largely policy-driven.

  - The rebound of the global manufacturing sector continued to
accelerate in August as the JP Morgan’s Global Manufacturing
purchasing managers’ index (PMI) registered an index level of 53.1, up
from 50.0 in July. This is the highest reading so far in twenty-six
months. Likewise, the US, China, and Japan registered further gains in
manufacturing in August; and India, Hong Kong, and Taiwan also
posted expansions in factory production in the same period.

  - Despite the still-high degree of uncertainty, the current recession
appears to be bottoming out, supported by the strong stimulus
measures and improving financial conditions globally. Meanwhile, the
negative base effects from last year’s price surge and the prevailing
weakness in global economies continue to dampen prices.
Nevertheless, current high fiscal deficits, record-low interest rates,
large-scale monetary easing, and other government interventions are
not sustainable: an expansion of private demand is necessary to drive
the global recovery beyond the impact of the various stimuli.
