**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 17 DECEMBER 2009[1]**


**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at 4.00 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 6.00 percent for the
overnight RP (lending) rate;

b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The Monetary Board's decision was based on its view that current
monetary policy settings remained appropriate as inflation forecasts
continued to be within the target ranges over the policy horizon with
underlying demand and supply pressures generally muted.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

  - The Monetary Board agreed that the current monetary policy settings
remained appropriate given the prevailing assessment of future price
and output conditions.

  - Inflation forecasts continued to follow a target-consistent path over the
policy horizon, with latest projections indicating that inflation would
settle below the middle of the target ranges for 2010 and 2011.
Inflation expectations also appeared to be well contained.

  - Demand-based pressures, as evident from the relatively stable core
inflation and soft labor market conditions, remained limited.

1 The discussions presented reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the information
available at the time of the policy meeting. The sets of economic information were provided by the
technical secretariat of the Advisory Committee (AC). The Advisory Committee is composed of the
Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely: the Deputy Governor of the Monetary
Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor of the Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor
of the Monetary Policy Sub-Sector, and the Managing Director of the Treasury Department. The highlights
of the discussions on the 17 December 2009 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its
regular meeting held on 7 January 2010. The next meeting of the Monetary Board on monetary policy
issues is scheduled on 28 January 2010.

- The Board also considered the latest assessment on the risks to the
inflation outlook which points to increasing supply-side price pressures
due to:

� a possible resurgence in global commodity prices;
� prevailing El Niño phenomenon which could add pressure to
domestic food prices;
� potential increase in international rice prices due to the expected
higher demand from the Philippines and India; and
� increases in domestic power costs in the offing due to pending
NPC petitions for cost recovery.

- Upside risks to the inflation outlook could also come from the
extensive macroeconomic stimulus and other policy measures
undertaken by advanced economies.

- Meanwhile, recent demand and credit indicators affirmed the earlier
assessment that growth in economic activity would be subdued,
keeping price pressures in check over the near term. Macroeconomic
conditions remained fragile as seen in the uneven performance of the
aggregate demand components.

� The expansion in aggregate consumption was driven largely by
consumer and government spending, while private capital
formation and exports contributed negatively to growth.

- Reflecting the relatively weak economic growth trajectory, bank
lending, particularly in credit-intensive sectors such as manufacturing,
expanded quite modestly despite the substantial easing of banks’
lending rates.

- In addition, the appreciation of the peso resulting from foreign
exchange inflows could temper the increase in domestic prices of
imported commodities while the reduction in the system loss cap could
temper electricity costs going forward.

- The Board reiterated its support for non-monetary government
measures to promptly address supply-side price pressures. While the
favorable inflation forecasts over the policy horizon and supply-sidedriven risks to the inflation outlook do not warrant a monetary policy
response, managing the risks to inflation expectations continue to be a
key policy priority.

**III.   Recent Developments in Economic Indicators**

The Monetary Board’s decision took into account recent developments
in various economic indicators:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Headline inflation rose to 2.8 percent year-on-year in November from
1.6 percent in October with the year-to-date average reaching 3.2
percent, well within the 2009 target range of 2.5-4.5 percent.

  - The uptick in inflation was due mainly to the increase in the inflation
rates of specific food items—notably fruits and vegetables, rice, and
meat. Fuel inflation, which had been negative for almost a year,
moved to positive territory during the month, while, the inflation rate of
transportation and communication services remained negative.

  - Core inflation was unchanged from the October level of 2.7 percent
year-on-year.

**B.  Inflation Expectations**

  - Recent surveys showed that inflation expectations showed wellanchored average inflation forecasts for 2009 and 2010. Results of the
BSP’s survey of private sector economists as well as the Asia Pacific
consensus survey for November 2009 yielded within-target inflation
forecasts for 2009 and 2010.

  - Meanwhile, results of the Q4 2009 Consumer Expectations Survey
(CES) showed a smaller majority of respondents expects increases in
the prices of goods and services over the next 12 months. However,
the Q4 2009 Business Expectations Survey (BES) indicated that more
respondents expect inflation to rise in the current quarter.

**C. Inflation Outlook**

  - The latest baseline inflation forecasts indicated that inflation would
settle below the middle of the 2009-2010 inflation target ranges.

  - The widely-held assessment is for commodity prices to increase
moderately in the future given the outlook of a gradual global
economic recovery, sufficient commodity inventories, higher world oil
production, and favorable production prospects for cereals as a whole.
However, upside risks to commodity prices have heightened since the
last policy meeting. These include: the possible resurgence in global
commodity prices following some signs of global recovery, the
sustained weakening of the US dollar, and the persistence of supply

tightness in key agricultural sectors due to adverse weather
conditions. Upside risks to the inflation outlook such as the prevailing
El Niño weather conditions, and higher-than-anticipated adjustments
in domestic oil prices, transport fares, and utility rates also remain.

  - Meanwhile, downside risks to the inflation outlook include a stalled
economic recovery and its likely downward pull on commodity prices,
and a sustained strong inflow of foreign exchange.

**D.  Demand conditions**

  - The latest national income accounts (NIA) data indicate that, while the
Philippine economy is on a growth trajectory, the recovery has been
relatively moderate. Household consumption and stimulative spending
of the government remained at the helm of economic expansion.
Meanwhile, capital formation and exports continued to be weighed
down by tepid global demand which was also reflected in the
sustained drop in industrial output.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - NIA data showed that the growth in agriculture, fishery and forestry
(AFF) slowed down to 1.6 percent in Q3 2009 from 2.5 percent in the
same period a year ago. The modest growth in AFF during the period
was driven mainly by corn, _palay, poultry, and coconut, including_
copra.

  - Palay production for Q4 2009 is expected to decline by 11.3 percent
due mainly to damages brought by typhoons “Pepeng,” “Ramil,” and
“Santi.” However, palay production for Q1 2010 is expected to surpass
Q1 2009’s, driven mainly by replanting of typhoon-damaged areas,
availability of seeds, and the fertilizer subsidy.

  - Corn production for Q4 2009 is forecast to grow by 5.2 due mainly to
increased area harvested and improved yield. For Q1 2010, corn
harvest is expected to be lower due to unfavorable weather conditions
and lower profitability in corn farming.

  - As of 28 November 2009, the country's total rice inventory stood at
2.37 MMT, lower than the month-ago and year-ago levels of 2.45
MMT and 2.94 MMT, respectively. The latest inventory level is
sufficient to last for 66 days.

  - While rice prices were steady in Metro Manila (MM), they increased in
areas outside Metro Manila (AOMM) in November 2009, driving the
national average up. The increase in rice prices in AOMM was mainly

tightness in key agricultural sectors due to adverse weather
conditions. Upside risks to the inflation outlook such as the prevailing

due to the lower supply from the ongoing harvest which was affected
by the recent tropical storms.

 - In international markets, the prices of rice from Vietnam, Pakistan and
the US increased in October due to the recovery of Asian demand and
the expected reduction of global export supply. In November, the Thai
benchmark export price reached US$590 per ton, 10.3 percent higher
than the October average.

 - Conditions in the equatorial Pacific remain indicative of a weak-tomoderate El Niño. Latest observations suggest a slight strengthening
of the phenomenon.

Oil Price Developments

 - Dubai crude oil prices were higher in November on falling US oil
inventory and better economic outlook. The spot price of Dubai crude
oil was higher by US$4.57 per barrel in November at US$77.72 per
barrel from US$73.15 per barrel in October.

 - However, prices in the futures market decreased slightly following
reports of larger-than-expected build-up in US crude and gasoline
stocks for the week ending 2 December. The price of Brent crude oil
for January 2010 deliveries decreased slightly to US$78.36 per barrel
on 3 December 2009 from its month-ago level of US$78.94 per barrel.

 - In the domestic market, oil companies reduced the prices of gasoline
by P0.50 per liter and of kerosene and diesel by P1.00 per liter each
on 15 December. Meanwhile, the price of LPG remained at its 24
November level when it rose by P0.94 per liter. This brought the yearto-date net increase in the price of unleaded gasoline, diesel, and
kerosene to P13.27/liter, P4.43/liter, and P3.39/liter, respectively.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

 - After six consecutive months of rate reductions, retail electricity rates
in Metro Manila increased month-on-month due to higher cost of
power from suppliers and higher fuel cost. Nonetheless, retail
electricity rates were still generally lower on a year-on-year basis for
the seventh consecutive month in November.

 - The system loss cap for distribution utilities (DUs) will be reduced
effective January 2010 which could help lower electricity rates. The
ERC has set the system loss cap for DUs at 8.5 percent from 9.5
percent.

**F. Financial Market Developments**


Government Securities Market

- Relative to their 30 October levels, the yields and term spreads
(secondary market yields of GS net of overnight RRP rates) generally
decreased across most tenors on 4 December. Yields decreased due
to the strengthened market expectations that the BSP will keep its key
policy rates steady well into 2010.

Interest Rate and Interest Rate Differentials

- The differential between the BSP policy rate and the US federal funds
rate remained steady in November 2009. With the increase in the risk
premium, the risk-adjusted differential narrowed in November 2009,
discouraging potential capital inflows.

- The cumulative 200-basis-point policy rate cut of the BSP from 18
December 2008 to 9 July 2009 appeared to have been passed on by
banks to their borrowers. Actual bank lending rates declined by 213.4
basis points during the period 23-27 November 2009 to reach 7.138
percent from 9.272 percent for the period 8-12 December 2008.

Stock Market

- Trading at local bourse exhibited mixed trends in December. The
Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSEi) breached the new resistance
level of 3,100 on 2 December and settled at 3,120.0 index points.
However, in the second week, the PSEi decreased marginally, due to
the negative sentiment following the declaration of martial law in
Maguindanao.

Foreign Exchange

- The peso strengthened in the first week of December 2009 due to the
strong foreign exchange inflow from OF remittances ahead of the
coming holiday season. On a year-to-date basis, the peso appreciated
by 2.9 percent against the US dollar on 15 December 2009. The
peso’s appreciation is in line with the movements of other regional
currencies which strengthened against the US dollar due to increased
risk appetite for higher-yielding assets.

Global Bond and Credit Default Swap Spreads

- Debt spreads tightened in the first week of December as Dubai World
began talks to restructure less than half of its debt. China’s significant
growth in its manufacturing sector likewise provided support for the

market and the higher commodity prices added to optimism that a
recovery in developing economies will be sustained.

**G. Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

  - Demand for money strengthened in October as domestic liquidity or
M3 growth accelerated to 12.5 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) from 11.6
percent in September. The steady rise in net foreign assets (NFA)
which is associated with strong inflows from OF remittances continued
to drive the expansion in domestic liquidity.

  - Bank lending net of banks’ reverse repurchase (RRP) placements with
the BSP grew by 4.7 percent in October, slower compared to the 5.9
percent expansion in September. Outstanding loans of commercial
banks, including RRPs, also grew by 2.6 percent compared to 6.1
percent in the previous month. The modest expansion in bank lending
reflected moderate demand due to the still weak economic activity.

  - Total equity raised in the PSE reached P7.5 billion for the period
January-October 2009, around one-third of the level reached in the
same period last year. Equity raised by both financial and nonfinancial corporations decreased significantly by 51.8 percent and 87.6
percent, respectively.

  - Corporate bond issuances amounted to P262.0 billion for the first ten
months of 2009, more than double the previous year’s level at P104.3
billion. Non-financial corporations accounted for the bulk of the bond
issues at P190.7 billion.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

  - The January-October 2009 fiscal deficit reached P266.1 billion,
already exceeding the P250 billion programmed deficit for full year
2009. Revenue collections declined by 4.8 percent to P925.4 billion in
January-October 2009, while the cumulative expenditures at P1,191.5
billion was 15.1 percent higher than the disbursements in the
comparable period in 2008. Fiscal authorities expect a “worst case”
deficit scenario of P300 billion at the end of 2009 if revenue collections
do not improve and the privatization of some state-owned assets does
not push through as planned.

**I.  External developments**

  - Survey indicators as well as hard data have been reinforcing the view
that the world economy is starting to grow again. Inflation rates
generally remained negative, resulting mostly from base effects from
the previous years’ surge in commodity prices as well as due to the
presence of spare capacity. Although there is still some uncertainty

market and the higher commodity prices added to optimism that a
recovery in developing economies will be sustained.

with respect to the global economic outlook, the consensus view is that
the risks to the global economic outlook are now broadly balanced.
