**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 28 MAY 2009[1]**


**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Reduce the BSP’s policy rates by 25 basis points to 4.25
percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 6.25
percent for the overnight RP (lending) rate;

b) Reduce accordingly the current interest rates on term RRPs,
RPs, and SDAs; and

c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The recommendation to reduce policy rates took into consideration the BSP’s
resolve to support domestic economic activity to the extent that it remains
consistent with the inflation target over the policy horizon.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

    - The Monetary Board noted that there remains some scope to lower
policy rates further given the continued favorable inflation outlook:

��Baseline forecasts continued to indicate that annual average
inflation will fall within the target ranges for both 2009 and 2010
with base effects stemming from the inflation trend in 2008
expected to impact short-term inflation dynamics.

��Inflation expectations remained well-anchored. The results of the
BSP and private sector surveys reflected inflation expectations
falling within the target ranges for both 2009 and 2010.

1 The discussions presented herein reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the
information available at the time of the policy meeting. The sets of economic information were provided by
the technical secretariat of the Advisory Committee (AC). The Advisory Committee is composed of the
Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely: the Deputy Governor for the Monetary
Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor for the Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor
of the Monetary Policy Sub-Sector, and the Managing Director of the Treasury Department. The highlights
of the discussions on the 28 May 2009 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular
meeting held on 18 June 2009. The next meeting of the Monetary Board on monetary policy issues is
scheduled on 9 July 2009.

��The downside risks to the inflation outlook continued to dominate
as the drop in global demand and lower commodity prices dampen
inflationary pressures.

��However, the volatility in global oil prices remained as an upside
risk to the inflation outlook. Foreign exchange market volatility is
another source of risk to future inflation.

   - The Board recognized that maintaining an expansionary policy
stance could support household and business confidence as the
economy works through a long transition period ahead. The global
slowdown this year is expected to hit the country through the trade,
remittance, investment, financial market, and confidence channels.
So far, remittances and foreign direct investments are holding up.
The impact on the trade sector, however, has been more
pronounced, as reflected in the precipitous drop in exports.

   - The Board also observed that while there were encouraging signs
that the global slowdown may be bottoming out, it is too early to
conclude that global economic conditions are clearly moving towards
normalcy. There are still large imbalances in the global financial
markets which could prolong the adjustment process.

   - The Board reiterated its resolve to support domestic activity to the
extent that the inflation outlook would allow and to address quickly
any threat to price stability over the medium term to ensure a noninflationary recovery.

**III.** **Recent Developments in Economic Indicators**

The Monetary Board’s decision took into account recent developments
in various economic indicators:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

   - Headline inflation dropped further to 4.8 percent year-on-year in April
from 6.4 percent in March. This brought the year-to-date average to
6.4 percent from 6.9 percent a month earlier.

   - Most major commodity groups registered either lower or negative
inflation rates in April. Lower year-on-year food inflation—particularly
for rice, meat, and miscellaneous food items—drove down overall
headline inflation in April. Meanwhile, only services had a higher
positive inflation compared to March because of the higher pump
prices of petroleum products in April relative to the previous month.

   - Month-on-month headline inflation was higher in April at 0.5 percent
from 0.1 percent in March, due mainly to the higher pump prices of

petroleum products and higher electricity rates in April relative to the
previous month.

   - Core inflation, which excludes specific food and energy items to
measure generalized price pressures, was lower at 5.0 percent yearon-year in April from 5.6 percent in March. Likewise, all the
alternative core inflation measures estimated by the BSP declined.

**B.  Inflation Expectations**

   - Recent surveys showed inflation expectations remained generally
well-anchored:

��Results of the BSP’s survey of private sector economists/analysts
for April 2009 showed lower average inflation forecast for both
2009 and 2010.

��The latest private sector consensus forecasts as of May 2009 also
showed lower inflation expectations for both 2009 and 2010.

��Meanwhile, the Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) for Q1 2009
showed lower inflation expectations for the next 12 months: from
8.8 percent in the previous survey to 8.6 percent.

��The results of the latest Business Expectations Survey (BES) for
Q2 2009, however, indicated that the proportion of respondents
that anticipate inflation to move up in Q2 2009 increased, albeit
marginally.

**C. Inflation Outlook**

   - Latest baseline forecasts continued to indicate that inflation would
settle within the 2009 and 2010 target ranges.

   - The risks around the central projection for world output lie mainly to
the downside, suggesting some downside risks as well to global
commodity prices. Meanwhile, upside risks to inflation include
volatility in world oil prices and the exchange rate.

**D.  Demand conditions**

Economic activity weakened substantially in the first quarter, reflecting
the overall drag caused by the sharp decline in global economic activity.

   - GDP rose at an annual rate of 0.4 percent in Q1 2009 compared to
3.9 percent in the same quarter in the previous year and 2.4 percent in
the previous quarter.

petroleum products and higher electricity rates in April relative to the
previous month.

   - Merchandise exports continued to fall in March 2009 by 30.9 percent
year-on-year. Likewise, merchandise imports declined further by 36.2
percent during the same month.

   - Selected demand indicators also moderated:

��In major central business districts, growth of land values
decelerated in Q1 2009, rental rates declined, while office and
residential vacancy rates increased.

��Year-on-year, sales of passenger cars, commercial vehicles, and
trucks and buses declined in April.

   - Nonetheless, positive developments were noted in some indicators:

��Energy sales rebounded in March after two months of
consecutive declines.

��Average capacity utilization in manufacturing increased for the
second consecutive month from 77.7 percent in February to 79.0
percent in March.

��Q2 2009 BES results showed business sentiment improved
during the quarter and turned positive for the next quarter
outlook, driven by improving confidence in the US and global
markets and the announcement of the Economic Resiliency Plan
of the National Government (NG).

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

   - _Palay production grew by 5.1 percent in Q1 2009 to reach 3.9 MMT_
given sufficient irrigation, declining fuel cost, and the availability of
seeds. Corn production, on the other hand, dropped by 3.4 percent in
Q1 2009 due to the adverse effects of continuous rains during the
period.

  - _Palay production for Q2 and Q3 2009 is expected to grow by 1.8_
percent and 2.4 percent year-on-year, respectively. Meanwhile, corn
production for Q2 2009 is forecast at 1.3 MMT, 1.0 percent lower than
the Q2 2008 output, due to excessive rains and the early harvest in
Q1. For Q3 2009, corn harvest is expected to rebound and increase
by 2.3 percent relative to the same period in 2008.

   - FAO’s April 2009 report on Crop Prospects and Food Situation
continued to suggest an overall decline in world cereal production in
2009 from the previous year’s record output due to a decline in the

conditions, and high input costs.

Oil Price Developments

 - The spot price of Dubai crude oil was higher in April 2009 relative to
the previous month and remained elevated as of 18 May on rising
optimism for a global economic rebound that could boost oil demand.
Prices in the futures market also increased. Some economists
anticipate that oil prices could be higher in the second half of 2009 if
economic policies adopted by major economies succeed in reversing
demand falls and if members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) comply with agreed output cuts.

 - Oil companies again raised the price of gasoline by P1.00 per liter on
26 May. This adjustment was the third price increase of this product
during the month. The prices of kerosene and diesel were raised
earlier on 19 May by P0.50 per liter each. Meanwhile, the price of LPG
remained at its 5 May level when it fell by P0.25 per liter. This brings
the year-to-date net adjustment in the prices of gasoline products to
P8.00 for unleaded gasoline, - P1.69 for diesel, - P3.49 for kerosene,
and P2.26 for LPG.

 - In the transport sector, a petition to restore the minimum jeepney fare
to� P7.50 (from the existing P7.00) was filed by the Alliance of
Concerned Transport Operators (ACTO) with the Land Transportation
and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on 18 May 2009.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

 - The increase in Meralco’s distribution rates was offset by lower
generation costs resulting in a net reduction in retail electricity rates in
May. In April, the ERC approved Meralco's pending application to
increase distribution-related charges under the performance-based
rate (PBR) mechanism starting May 2009. However, this was offset by
the lower generation cost of Meralco’s suppliers with cheaper natural
gas and improved dispatch. In addition, the Currency Exchange Rate
Adjustment (CERA) refund which was implemented in March also
contributed to tempering electricity costs.

 - On a net basis, Maynilad rates were lower by P2.03 per cubic meter in
the second quarter. The P1.38 increase in the basic charge of
Maynilad from P25.86 per cubic meter to P27.24 was offset by the
refund ordered by the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage
System Regulatory Office (MWSS-RO) from gains due to
prepayments of dollar-denominated loans.

**F. Financial Market Developments**


Government Securities Market

- Relative to their 30 April levels, the yields and term spreads
(secondary market yields of GS net of overnight reverse repurchase or
RRP rates) generally declined across all tenors on 20 May 2009.
Yields declined as bond prices rose with increased buying activity due
to the favorable inflation outlook and expectations of additional policy
rate cuts by the BSP in the months ahead.

Interest Rate and Interest Rate Differentials

- The differential between the BSP policy rate and the US federal funds
rate continued to narrow as of end-April, following the BSP’s most
recent 25-basis-point cut in the policy rate. Adjusted for the risk
premium, the differential continued to widen in the same period with
the decline in the risk premium, encouraging capital inflows.

- The cumulative 150-basis-point policy rate cut of the BSP from 18
December 2008 to 16 April 2009 appears to have been passed on
partially by banks to their borrowers. Actual bank lending rates
declined by 51.4 basis points during the period 11-15 May 2009 to
reach 8.758 percent relative to 9.272 percent for the period 8-12
December 2008.

Stock Market

- The Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSEi) recovered in April and
sustained the upbeat trend in May, reflecting renewed investors’
appetite sparked by positive news that the recession may have
reached its bottom. On 25 May, the index reached 2,334.6 index
points, the highest level posted since 7 October 2008.

Foreign Exchange

- The peso strengthened in the first three weeks of May as investors
regained some appetite for regional assets amid signs of easing
recessionary pressure in major economies. Sentiment in the domestic
financial markets further improved following reports that the Philippine
inflation decelerated in April while the inflation outlook remained
favorable. Moreover, on 6 May 2009, Fitch Ratings affirmed its rating
and kept its outlook stable for the Philippines’ debt issuances.
Moreover, the news that the NG posted a surplus in April 2009 helped
improve market sentiment. Robust overseas Filipinos’ remittances
ahead of the school opening in June, coupled with weak demand for
the US dollar, provided additional leverage to the peso.

   - As of 25 May 2009, the peso appreciated against the US dollar by 0.7
percent on a year-to-date basis. The peso’s appreciation was in line
with the strengthening of other Asian currencies.

Global Bond and Credit Default Swap Spreads

   - In April and the first three weeks of May, credit risk has fallen as
financial markets showed some signs of stabilizing. Emerging
markets’ debt spreads continued to narrow due to the improved credit
quality of most sovereign issuers, balanced supply and demand for
sovereign debt and more rapid growth of emerging market economies.
Moreover, investors’ risk appetite improved as reflected in the
strengthening of global equity, currency and commodity markets. The
recent Fitch ratings on Philippine debt also contributed to narrowing
debt spreads. Following the upbeat sentiment in global financial and
commodity markets, credit default swap (CDS) spreads of Asian
economies including the Philippines and the emerging markets bond
index (EMBI+) spread for the Philippines narrowed during the review
period.

**G. Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

   - The growth of domestic liquidity or M3 increased to 15.6 percent yearon-year in March, higher than the previous month’s 14.6 percent. This
was also considerably higher than the 2.1 percent expansion recorded
during the same month a year ago. On a month-on-month basis,
seasonally-adjusted M3 rose by 0.5 percent in March compared to the
0.9 percent decline in the previous month.

   - The growth in outstanding loans of commercial banks including
reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) remained strong at 18.9
percent in March. Net of RRP placements with the BSP, lending
likewise expanded by 17.8 percent. Bank lending growth, whether
gross or net of RRPs, was slightly lower when compared to the
corresponding expansions in the previous month, which were 22.5
percent and 22.6 percent, respectively.

   - However, overall credit standards tightened somewhat in Q1 2009, as
reflected in the BSP’s survey on senior bank loan officers.

   - Total capital raised in the PSE for the period January-April 2009
remained significantly lower compared to that generated in the same
period in 2008. Meanwhile, corporate bond issuance during the first
four months of 2009 was almost twice the level recorded in the
comparable period in 2008.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

   - The NG registered a fiscal surplus in April amounting to P7.9 billion,
lower than the P25.8 billion surplus in the comparable period last year.
Cumulatively, the fiscal deficit reached P111.8 billion for January-April,
increasing by more than fourfold from last year’s deficit for the same
period. This also represented 72.1 percent of the deficit programmed
for Q1-Q2 2009.

**I.** **External developments**

   - Weighed down by sharp declines in exports, business inventories, and
home prices, US GDP contracted further in Q1 2009 by 6.1 percent in
annualized terms from the 6.2 percent contraction in the fourth quarter
of 2008. But there have been small, incipient signs that indicated
financial conditions may be improving: market volatility has declined,
while funding and credit spreads have narrowed. Compared to the
survey two quarters ago, fewer banks have tightened lending
standards over the past six months based on the Fed’s Senior Loan
Officer Survey. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index
and the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index showed that
consumer expectations improved further in April. Despite these initial
signs of improvement, however, financial conditions in the US
economy have remained tight. Lenders’ balance sheets are still
encumbered with impaired assets, promoting further deleveraging.

   - In the Euro zone, the drop in industrial output, the outlook from
surveys, and other monthly indicators suggest that the pace of
economic activity declined significantly in Q1 2009.

   - External shocks have rapidly fed through domestic demand in Asia. In
its May 2009 issue of the Regional Economic Outlook in Asia and the
Pacific, the IMF expects growth in Asia to decelerate to 1.3 percent in
2009, as Japan experiences its worst annual performance on record.
Quarterly GDP growth is expected to return to positive territory only in
2010, given the strong fiscal response, but underlying growth will
remain weak as the fall in exports is expected to spill over to private
domestic demand. China’s growth is expected to slow down slightly,
as the massive program of public investment is expected to
compensate for the decline in private investment, thereby supporting
demand.

   - In general, most central banks either continued their monetary easing,
albeit many at a slower pace (Euro region, New Zealand, Canada,
Thailand, Indonesia), or decided to maintain policy rates in their latest
policy meetings in April/May (Japan, US, UK, Australia, Malaysia,
South Korea).
