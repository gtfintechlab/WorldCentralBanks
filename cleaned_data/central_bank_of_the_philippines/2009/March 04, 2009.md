**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 5 MARCH 2009[1]**


**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Reduce the BSP’s policy rates by 25 basis points to 4.75
percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 6.75
percent for the overnight RP (lending) rate;

b) Reduce accordingly the current interest rates on term RRPs,
RPs, and SDAs; and

c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The policy decision to reduce policy rates was arrived at in the
process of balancing the BSP’s concern over price stability and its resolve to
undertake policy actions that will ensure the soundness and stability of the
financial system.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

    - The Monetary Board noted that there is sufficient flexibility to
continue to ease monetary conditions given favorable inflation
conditions.

��Baseline forecasts continued to indicate that annual average
inflation will fall within the target ranges for both 2009 and
2010.

�� Inflation pressures are expected to remain subdued as
commodity price pressures remain on the downside while

��The discussions presented herein reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the
information available at the time of the policy meeting. The sets of economic information were provided by
the technical secretariat of the Advisory Committee (AC). The Advisory Committee is composed of the
Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely: the Deputy Governor for the Monetary
Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor for the Supervision and Examination Sector, the Managing Director
of the Monetary Policy Sub-Sector, and the Managing Director of the Treasury Department. The highlights
of the discussions on the 5 March 2009 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular
meeting held on 19 March 2009. The next meeting of the Monetary Board on monetary policy issues is
scheduled on 16 April 2009.

prospects of an economic slowdown reduced inflationary
pressures further.

��Inflation expectations remained well anchored. The results of
the BSP and private sector surveys reflected declining
inflation expectations anchored towards the target over the
policy horizon.

��Additional policy stimulus is expected to provide cushion
against the headwinds to economic growth. Although growth
has remained resilient towards the end of 2008, investor
sentiment has become more clouded. Business sentiment has
turned more cautious based on the BSP’s latest business
confidence survey. In the fourth quarter of 2008, gross capital
formation contracted, and if sustained, economic growth over
the medium term could further slow down. Industrial
production in the fourth quarter, while showing a sustained
annual growth rate, declined on a deseasonalized quarter-onquarter basis, while exports fell to a record low in December.

��The Board also recognized that an accommodative monetary
policy, combined with the expansionary measures taken
earlier provided liquidity to the system resulting in the
reduction of lending rates. This should help reinforce
confidence in the financial markets by ensuring smooth credit
intermediation as the impact of global financial market strains
is expected to be quite persistent and may still carry
considerable risks to domestic credit conditions.

��While inflation conditions are generally favorable, a prudent
rate move seems appropriate given the upside risks to
inflation stemming from the:

1. volatility in the peso-dollar exchange rate and oil
prices,
2. increases in utility rates, and
3. potential price pressures coming from the
agricultural commodities sector

- The Board also considered proceeding along the course of a more
measured policy easing as preemptive policy moves of the past few
months, including other liquidity-enhancing measures, already put
substantial stimulus in the pipeline. By frontloading the rate cuts, the
BSP acted preemptively to address potential risks to growth and
financial stability, gaining sufficient policy space for maneuver should
potential inflation risks materialize.

    - The Board also believed that a more calibrated monetary easing this
time is circumspect should the planned fiscal stimulus come on
stream and exert inflationary pressures.

    - The Board opted to take a more prudent approach that will allow
more time to observe new data and gauge how much, if any,
additional stimulus is needed while closely monitoring the inflation
outlook.

����������Recent Developments in Economic Indicators

The Monetary Board’s decision took into account the recent
developments in various economic indicators:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

    - Headline inflation inched up in February to 7.3 percent year-on-year
from 7.1 percent in January.

**B.  Inflation Expectations**

    - Recent surveys showed moderating inflation expectations:

��The latest CES for Q1 2009 showed lower inflation
expectations for the next 12 months: from 8.8 percent in the
previous survey to 8.6 percent.

��Results of the latest BES for Q1 2009 indicated that the
proportion of respondents that anticipate inflation to move up
in Q1 2009 has significantly decreased.

��Results of the BSP’s initial monthly (from quarterly) survey for
January 2009 of private sector economists/analysts showed
inflation is expected to fall within the target range for 2009 and
2010.

��The latest private sector consensus forecasts showed lower
inflation expectations as of February 2009 relative to the
previous month and is also expected to be within-target for
2009 and 2010.

**C. Inflation Outlook**

    - Emerging inflation forecasts continued to indicate that inflation would
settle within the 2009 and 2010 targets. Latest inflation forecasts
incorporate the lower projections for oil prices and GDP growth.

    - Meanwhile, upside risks to inflation include: volatility in world oil
prices and the exchange rate, possible increases in utility rates, and
potential pressures coming from agricultural commodities prices.

**D.  Demand conditions**

Recent indicators suggest that aggregate demand conditions are
under strong pressure as consumer spending continued to show restraint
and as weaker global economic activity took its toll on exports.

    - GDP posted a modest growth of 4.5 percent in Q4 2008 compared to
6.4 percent in the previous year and 5.0 percent in the previous
quarter.

    - Merchandise exports showed a record decline of 40.4 percent yearon-year in December 2008.

    - Merchandise imports declined further by 34.2 percent in December
2008.

    - Selected demand indicators moderated:

��The increase in land and rental values has generally
moderated in the fourth quarter of 2008 while office and
residential vacancy rates increased.

��Sales of passenger cars, commercial vehicles, and trucks and
buses declined in December,� as restraints in supply and the
spillover effect of the US economic slowdown could have
started to influence the decisions of prospective clients.

��Energy sales decelerated in December, pulled down by the
negative growth in the industrial sector.

��Average capacity utilization in manufacturing dropped further
in December 2008.

��MISSI figures indicate slower manufacturing activity in
December 2008. �
�
��Results of the first quarter consumer and business
expectations surveys show sustained bearish sentiment.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

    - Average retail prices of rice continued to increase in the second week of
February 2009.

    - Meanwhile, international cereal prices increased in January. The
International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) also warned that rice
prices could remain highly volatile in 2009.
## �

    - FAO’s report on Crop Prospects and Food Situation suggests an
overall decline in world cereal production in 2009 from the previous
year’s record output due to a decline in the area planted to cereals of
major exporters, adverse weather conditions, and high input costs.

Oil Price Developments

    - The spot price of Dubai crude was slightly lower in February,
averaging US$43.09 per barrel from US$44.12 per barrel in January.
Prices eased on signs of further softening of the demand for oil due
to expectations of worsening global economic conditions.

    - However, prices in the futures market increased slightly due to supply
concerns arising from speculation that OPEC will further cut its oil
production during its meeting on 15 March 2009 and reports that Abu
Dhabi National Oil Co. (the main oil supplier of the United Arab
Emirates) would be limiting its oil supplies to Asia. The drop in the
stockpiles of gasoline in the US ahead of the driving season also
influenced the increase in futures prices.

    - Oil companies reduced the price of petroleum products on 2 March
2009.

    - In the transport sector, another provisional reduction of 50 centavos
in jeepney fare was implemented effective 23 February 2009.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

    - The ERC provisionally approved a lower refund under the 12[th] GRAM
and 11[th ]ICERA for the Luzon grid and the increase in NPC’s basic
rates.

    - Meanwhile, the increase in water rates for the two Metro Manila water
concessionaires, which was earlier deferred, was implemented in
February.

**F. Financial Market Developments**

   - The interaction between the global financial shock and the recession
in major economies, as well as the associated crisis in confidence,
continued to pose challenges to domestic financial markets.

Interest Rate and Interest Rate Differentials

   - The differential between the BSP policy rate and the US federal funds
rate narrowed in January 2009, following the BSP’s 50-basis-point
cut in its policy rate. Adjusted for the risk premium, the policy interest
rate differential turned positive during the first two weeks of February
2009, as sovereign risk spreads improved.

   - Meanwhile, the differentials between the domestic and foreign
interest rates narrowed during the first two months of 2009.

Stock Market

   - Despite the approval by the US Congress of the economic stimulus
package, stock trading remained weak in February 2009 as market
uncertainties continued to hound investors.

Foreign Exchange

   - The peso remained volatile in January to mid-February. On the third
week of February, regional currencies weakened as market uncertainty
rose following reports that the Euro area suffered its deepest contraction
on record in the fourth quarter of 2008. The deep contractions in the
Euro area and the US as well as in some Asian economies, particularly
Japan, were taken by financial markets as further signs of a more severe
global crisis. The peso also weakened as the domestic financial markets
reflected the US stock market rout amid rising concern that the global
slowdown is more severe than expected while the US stimulus plan
might not be sufficient to mitigate the financial crisis. The depreciation of
the peso was tempered by the lack of corporate demand for dollars.

   - On a year-to-date basis, Asian currencies depreciated, led by the
Korean won.

Global Bond and Credit Default Swap Spreads

   - As of 24 February, emerging market debt spreads narrowed after
climbing close to its year’s peak on 17 February. Emerging market bond
risks fell as expectations that the US government would nationalize
major banks abated, boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.

Following global market developments, the EMBI+ Philippine spread
likewise narrowed.

    - However, the cost of protecting the Philippine debt from default
increased as the Philippine five-year credit default swap (CDS) spread
reached its peak for the year on 24 February. Against neighboring
economies, the Philippine CDS has remained below Indonesia’s CDS
level but higher than Malaysia and Thailand.

�
**G. Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

    - Domestic liquidity sustained its strong growth in January due to the
expansion in both net domestic assets (NDA) and net foreign assets
(NFA).

    - Meanwhile, bank lending growth continued to expand in January
2009.

    - The equity raised in the Philippine Stock Exchange in 2008 was lower
than the level reached in 2007, while corporate bond issuances
increased significantly in 2008.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

    - The full year 2008 fiscal deficit reached P68.1 billion, better than the
P75.0 billion program, but higher than the P12.4 billion deficit for the
full year of 2007.

**I.** **External developments**

    - The adverse and protracted impact of the financial turmoil on real
economic activity around the world has been accompanied by a
strong contraction in international trade.

��Economic activity continued to decelerate in emerging Asia,
driven by the severe and synchronized downturn in external
demand which has particularly affected exports and industrial
production.

    - Nevertheless, analysts note that rock-bottom policy interest rates,
plans of massive fiscal stimulus packages, and central banks` other
efforts to restore market confidence have helped ease some
tensions in financial markets and are buying some time to keep
business confidence afloat and lay the groundwork for the global
economy to begin a moderate recovery.
