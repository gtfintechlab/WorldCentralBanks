**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 5 NOVEMBER 2009[1]**


**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at 4.00 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 6.00 percent for the
overnight RP (lending) rate;

b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The Monetary Board’s decision took into consideration the prevailing
assessment of price and output conditions over the policy horizon which
continued to suggest that current monetary settings remained appropriate.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

  - The Monetary Board considered the latest outlook on inflation which
continued to suggest that current monetary policy settings remain
appropriate. The forecasted inflation path shifted slightly higher but
was still within target. The uptick in inflation starting September was
partly statistical, as base effects which contributed to low inflation
readings during the earlier part of the year have started to
abate. Meanwhile, initial estimates on agriculture losses resulting from
the recent typhoon-related calamities were not expected to result in a
significant and long-lasting deviation of the forecasted inflation path
from target.

1 The discussions presented reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the information
available at the time of the policy meeting. The sets of economic information were provided by the
technical secretariat of the Advisory Committee (AC). The Advisory Committee is composed of the
Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely: the Deputy Governor of the Monetary
Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor of the Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor
of the Monetary Policy Sub-Sector, and the Managing Director of the Treasury Department. The highlights
of the discussions on the 5 November 2009 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its
regular meeting held on 3 December 2009. The next meeting of the Monetary Board on monetary policy
issues is scheduled on 17 December 2009.

  - Demand-side pressures on consumer prices remained limited while
inflation expectations remained well anchored to the target range over
the policy horizon. However, compared to the balanced assessment of
the inflation outlook in the previous review, the Board is of the view
that the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook is slightly
tilted to the upside as upside pressures persisted while downside
pressures diminished. Upside risks to the inflation outlook included
adverse weather conditions due to El Niño, possible increases in utility
rates due to cost recoveries, and a delayed unwinding of large
stimulus programs in advanced economies. There were also
additional upside risks to the inflation outlook, including the strongerthan-earlier-expected rebound in global economic activity and
unaccounted typhoon-related damages which could affect domestic
food supplies. Downside risks to the projected inflation path consisted
of a subdued global economic recovery, and the recent appreciation of
the peso.

  - With a still manageable inflation environment, the Board noted that
there was sufficient latitude to balance risks to the inflation outlook
against the need to preserve stimulus to economic activity. While
domestic growth prospects have turned positive, global recovery was
expected to be modest. Global imbalances are far from being resolved
and financial markets are still in the process of deleveraging,
warranting the need for authorities to maintain the current policy
environment until recovery strengthens. In addition, keeping a steady
hand on policy settings could support the reconstruction efforts in the
wake of the recent calamities.

  - The Board reiterated its support for non-monetary government
measures to address supply-side risks to consumer prices. While
monetary policy should not react to supply-side price shocks caused
by the recent calamities, monetary authorities are mindful that such
shocks could give rise to second-round price effects and feed into
inflation expectations.

**III.   Recent Developments in Economic Indicators**

The Monetary Board’s decision took into account recent developments
in various economic indicators:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Headline inflation increased to 1.6 percent year-on-year in October
from 0.7 percent in September. Meanwhile, month-on-month headline
inflation was higher at 0.6 percent in October from 0.2 percent in
September. The year-to-date average of 3.2 percent is well within the
target range of 2.5-4.5 percent for 2009.

           - Demand-side pressures on consumer prices remained limited while
inflation expectations remained well anchored to the target range over


-----

  - The uptick in inflation was due mainly to the markedly higher prices of
fruits and vegetables owing to crop losses and delivery bottlenecks in
the wake of recent weather-related calamities. Rice and meat prices
were also higher year-on-year. Meanwhile, the inflation rates of
services and fuel, light, and water remained negative in October.

  - Core inflation, which excludes specific food and energy items to
measure generalized price pressures, was slightly lower at 2.7 percent
year-on-year in October from 2.8 percent in the previous month.

**B.  Inflation Expectations**

  - Recent surveys showed that inflation expectations remained generally
well anchored. Relative to previous surveys, the Asia Pacific
consensus forecast for October and the BSP’s survey of private sector
economists for September showed within-target average inflation
forecasts for 2009 and 2010.

  - Results of the Q3 2009 Consumer Expectations Survey (CES)
showed marginally lower inflation expectations for the next 12 months,
while the Q3 2009 Business Expectations Survey (BES) indicated a
sharp decrease in the number of respondents expecting inflation to
increase in the third quarter.

**C. Inflation Outlook**

  - Emerging baseline inflation forecasts indicated that inflation would
settle at the lower half of the 3.5 percent + 1.0 percentage point target
range for 2009 and the 4.5 percent + 1.0 percentage point target
range for 2010.

  - Since the previous policy meeting, upside risks to the inflation outlook
remained, such as a stronger-than-expected rebound in economic
activity and its potential tightening effect on commodity
supply-demand balances; adverse weather conditions due to El Niño;
possible increases in utility rates due to cost recoveries; and a
delayed unwinding of large stimulus programs in advanced
economies. Unaccounted damages caused by the typhoons was also
expected to add inflationary pressures in the near term. Meanwhile,
downside risks to the projected inflation path consisted of a stalled
global economic recovery and its pull on commodity prices, as well as
the impact on consumer prices of the recent appreciation of the peso.

**D.  Demand conditions**

  - Latest information showed increasing signs of stabilization in
economic activity. The BSP’s business cycle model indicated the
beginning of an economic upturn in Q3 2009, although at a modest
pace. Various leading indicators also showed that economic
conditions have started to improve: capacity utilization in the
manufacturing sector sustained its upward trend, energy sales
continued to grow, and book-to-bill ratio in August and September
remained above 1.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - As of 16 October 2009, the National Food Authority (NFA) reported
that the country's total rice inventory stood at 2.29 MMT, lower than
the previous month’s level of 2.35 MMT but higher than the year-ago
level of 2.22 MMT. The latest inventory level is sufficient to last for 65
days.

  - With the government’s projection that the impact of tropical storms
(TS) “Ondoy” and “Pepeng” on rice stocks could be felt in early 2010,
the NFA initially imported 250 thousand MT of rice on 30 October
2009, earlier than the usual December auction. The date of delivery
has been tentatively set between January and April 2010.

  - Rice prices were steady in Metro Manila (MM) but declined in areas
outside Metro Manila (AOMM) in September 2009 and the first half of
October. Generally, rice prices in the areas affected by TS “Ondoy”
and “Pepeng” were stable due to the intensified rice distribution of the
NFA and the implementation of the price control law by the
Department of Trade and Industry. Meanwhile, the start of the harvest
season accounted for the decline in the prices of commercial rice
(special and ordinary) in AOMM.

  - International prices of rice, corn, and wheat declined in September.
Global rice prices fell on the back of sluggish demand and rescission
of export restrictions while corn prices fell with the increase in stocks
due to record production in the US. The reduced demand for feeds in
the US following the losses in its meat and dairy industries provided
further downward pressure to corn prices. Meanwhile, the continued
decline in wheat prices was attributed to the rising global production
which boosted inventories. In the US, the world’s biggest exporter of
wheat, stockpiles exceeded expectations on slack domestic demand
and better-than-expected production.

**D.  Demand conditions**

 - El Niño conditions now prevailed across the equatorial Pacific Ocean.
The latest observations and international forecast models indicated
that El Niño could strengthen and last through the first quarter of 2010.

Oil Price Developments

 - Dubai crude oil prices were higher in October on improved US
economic recovery prospects and falling oil inventories. The spot price
of Dubai crude oil was higher by US$5.51 per barrel in October at
US$73.15 per barrel from US$67.64 per barrel in September.

 - Prices in the futures market also increased. The price of Brent crude
oil for December 2009 deliveries rose to US$77.77 per barrel on
19 October 2009, higher by US$5.77 per barrel or 8.0 percent relative
to its month-ago level of US$72.00 per barrel.

 - Given signs of global economic recovery, the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and International Energy
Agency (IEA) revised upward their 2009 oil demand forecasts.
Likewise, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) expected that
world oil consumption will grow in the fourth quarter of 2009. OPEC,
EIA, and IEA projected that demand will also increase in 2010 with
most of the growth coming from emerging economies.

 - In the domestic market, oil companies reduced the prices of gasoline,
kerosene, and diesel on 27 October, in compliance with Executive
Order No. 839. The prices of these products were reduced by P1.25
per liter, P1.50 per liter, and P2.00 per liter, respectively, effectively
reverting to their respective price levels prior to the 20 October
increase. Meanwhile, the price of LPG was unchanged from its
8 September level when it was increased by P0.91 per liter.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

 - Retail electricity rates have declined for the past six months. Year-onyear, retail electricity rates were lower by an average of 9.3 percent in
October; month-on-month, rates also declined by 1.6 percent. Meralco
reported that power rates were lower in October due to lower NPC
and WESM rates, stable fuel costs, and stronger peso.

**F. Financial Market Developments**

Government Securities Market

 - Relative to their 30 September levels, the yields and term spreads
(secondary market yields of GS net of overnight reverse repurchase or
RRP rates) generally decreased across most tenors on 28 October.
Yields decreased with the increase in bond prices, as market

sentiment improved and concerns on the budget deficit eased on the
back of pronouncements made by the Government, reassuring the
market that there are other available financing options at its disposal.

Interest Rate and Interest Rate Differentials

- The differential between the BSP policy rate and the US federal funds
rate remained steady in October 2009. With the decline in the risk
premium, the risk-adjusted differential widened in September and as of
16 October 2009, potentially encouraging capital inflows.

- The cumulative 200-basis-point policy rate cut of the BSP from 18
December 2008 to 9 July 2009 appeared to have been passed on
partially by banks to their borrowers. Actual bank lending rates
declined by 172.3 basis points during the period 12-16 October 2009,
to reach 7.579 percent relative to the 9.302 percent for the period 8-12
December 2008. This implied an 86.2 percent pass-through by banks.

Stock Market

- Trading recovered from a month of sluggish activity and generally
posted an uptrend in October. On 7 October 2009, the PSEi hurdled
past the 2,900 resistance level. However, during the second week of
October, the index movement was almost flat with slight downward
bias due to investors’ profit taking. This generally bearish market
sentiment persisted up to the last week of October and early
November as the local market tracked the movement of the US
market.

Foreign Exchange

- The peso continued to strengthen as it appreciated by 2.6 percent to
P46.86/US$ in October 2009. The peso reached a daily high of
P46.25/US$1 on 15 October 2009, the highest level for the year, on
the back of a 4 percent year-on-year expected increase in remittances
for 2009 and 6 percent growth in 2010. However, towards the end of
October, the peso weakened amid concerns on increasing oil prices.

Global Bond and Credit Default Swap Spreads

- Debt spreads continued to tighten (following the same trend during the
previous month) on growing signs of global economic recovery fueling
demand for higher yielding emerging market assets. However,
investors remained mindful of the rising burden of sovereign financing,
raising concerns on the sustainability of public sector finances which,
in turn, could temper emerging markets’ nascent recovery.

**G. Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

  - Growth in domestic liquidity or M3 remained robust in August. M3
increased by 13.4 percent year-on-year, higher than the 12.9 percent
annual growth recorded a month ago. On a monthly basis, seasonallyadjusted M3 growth accelerated to 2.6 percent from 1.5 percent in
July. The sustained growth in net foreign assets (NFA), which
accelerated to 29.9 percent in August from 21.7 percent in the
previous month, continued to drive the expansion in domestic liquidity.
This can be traced to the significant increase in the NFA position of
the BSP and of other depository corporations. NFA rose as the BSP
continued to build up its international reserves while banks reduced
their foreign liabilities. The depreciation of the peso compared to a
year ago also contributed to NFA expansion.

  - Bank lending net of banks' reverse repurchase (RRP) placements with
the BSP grew at a slower pace of 5.9 percent in August compared to
the 8.7 percent expansion posted in the previous month. Outstanding
loans of commercial banks including reverse repurchase agreements
(RRPs), meanwhile, increased by 3.1 percent year-on-year to reach
P2.1 trillion in August 2009, broadly similar to the expansion in July.
On a month-on-month seasonally-adjusted basis, commercial banks’
lending grew by 0.2 percent (net of RRP) and 2.1 percent (for loans
inclusive of RRP) during the month. Latest data showed that loans for
production activities expanded year-on-year by 5.7 percent in August,
lower than the 8.1 percent growth reported in the previous month, as
the expansion of lending to some productive sectors was pulled down
by the contraction in other sectors led by manufacturing. Growth in
consumption loans likewise moderated to 5.3 percent this month from
8.2 percent in the previous month, following the slower growth in auto
loans and credit card lending, and the steeper contraction in other
types of consumption loans.

  - Total equity raised in the PSE reached P7.5 billion for the period
January-September 2009, around one third of the level reached in the
same period last year at P23.4 billion. Equity raised by both financial
and non-financial corporations decreased significantly by 51.8 percent
and 87.6 percent, respectively. No initial public offerings (IPOs) were
recorded in the first nine months of 2009.

  - Corporate bond issuance during the first nine months of 2009 was
more than twice the level recorded in the comparable period in 2008.
Non-financial corporations accounted for the bulk of the bond issues
at P176.6 billion, which was 74.7 percent of the total corporate bonds
issued during the period.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

  - The January-September 2009 fiscal deficit reached P237.5 billion,
more than four times higher than the P53.4 billion deficit in the
comparable period last year. This exceeded the P217.6 billion
programmed deficit for the first three quarters by P19.9 billion.
Revenue collections declined by 4.6 percent to P839.8 billion in
Q1-Q3 2009 compared to P879.9 billion for the same period last year.
It was also lower than the Q1-Q3 program at P914.2 billion.
Meanwhile, the cumulative expenditures for the first nine months of
2009 amounted to P1,077.3 billion, 15.4 percent higher than the
disbursements in the comparable period in 2008, but lower than the
Q1-Q3 program at P1,131.8 billion. Excluding interest payments, total
disbursements increased by 20.5 percent to P842.1 billion.

**I.  External developments**

  - Economic indicators increasingly suggested that the contraction in
global economic activity is coming to an end, notably in major
emerging economies as well as in a number of advanced economies.
Although there was still some uncertainty with respect to the economic
outlook, the consensus view was that risks to the global economic
outlook were now broadly balanced. The October 2009 World Economic
Outlook of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that the global
recession is ending and the global economy appears to be expanding
again. However, global activity was expected to remain below
pre-crisis levels.
