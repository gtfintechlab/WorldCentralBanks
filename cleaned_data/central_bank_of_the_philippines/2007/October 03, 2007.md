**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 4 OCTOBER 2007***


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following recommendations for
the consideration of the Monetary Board:

   - Adjust the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Adjust the BSP’s policy interest rates downward by 25 basis points to
5.75 percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 7.75 percent for
the overnight RP (lending) rate;

(b) Adjust the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs
accordingly; and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The Monetary Board then proceeded to review the recent developments
and the key considerations in the formulation of the BSP’s monetary policy
stance.

**I.** **Review of Recent Developments**

**A. Domestic price conditions**

   - Headline inflation slowed down to 2.4 percent in August from 2.6 percent
in July. The lower inflation in August can be traced mainly to the decline
in the prices of fruits and vegetables and the slower increase in fuel
prices relative to levels a year ago. The average inflation rate for JanuaryAugust 2007 was maintained at 2.6 percent.

   - The official core inflation measure published by the National Statistics
Office (NSO) slowed down to 2.9 percent in August from 3.0 percent in
July.

- The discussion presented herein reflects the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the
information available at the time of the policy meeting. The highlights of the discussions of the 4 October
2007 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular meeting held on 25 October 2007.

**B. Demand conditions**

   - Latest data for Q2 2007 showed that the growth in Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) accelerated to 7.5 percent. On the demand side, GDP
growth was buoyed by strong household spending, improving capital
investments, and robust government consumption.

   - The year-on-year growth in merchandise exports accelerated to 4.5
percent in July from 1.5 percent (revised) in June, due mainly to the
higher growth in manufactures, particularly electronics which posted an
upturn of 5.1 percent in July after declining by 1.7 percent in the previous
month. The cumulative growth rate for January-July was 6.3 percent,
considerably lower than the previous year’s 17.6 percent.

   - Growth in merchandise imports accelerated to 14.3 percent year-on-year
in July from 3.8 percent in June. This was due mainly to the upturn in
imports of mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials, and the
continued growth in imports of raw materials and intermediate goods. For
the first seven months of 2007, merchandise import payments rose by 4.1
percent, less than half of the year-ago growth of 10.0 percent.

   - Selected indicators of demand continued to indicate a broad
strengthening trend.

��Based on latest data from Colliers, land values in Q2 2007 rose by
6.8 percent year-on-year for the Makati Central Business District
(CBD) and 14.2 percent for Ortigas Center. Quarter-on-quarter, the
estimated land values in the Makati CBD and Ortigas were 5.6
percent and 6.7 percent higher, respectively.

��The year-on-year sales of passenger cars rose by 4.6 percent in
August, a reversal of the 6.6 percent decline in July. Such growth was
attributed to the launch of new models. However, year-to-date sales
increased by 4.0 percent, slightly higher than the 3.9 percent growth
registered in the comparable period last year. Similarly, the year-onyear sales of trucks and buses grew by 11.9 percent in August, a
turnaround from the 13.6 percent decline registered in July. Year-todate sales of trucks and buses surged by 25.9 percent, from the 9.3
percent growth registered in the same period last year.

��The year-on-year energy sales by Meralco rose at a faster pace of 6.7
percent in July compared to 5.4 percent in June. Meanwhile, year-todate energy sales increased by 4.6 percent from 1.7 percent in the
comparable period last year.

��Appliance sales continued to grow although at a slower pace of 9.7
percent year-on-year in June relative to the 15.7 percent growth
registered in May. Meanwhile, year-to-date sales rose by 11.2
percent, a turnaround from the 7.5 percent decline in the comparable
period last year.

��Average capacity utilization in manufacturing increased slightly in July
to 80.3 percent from 80.2 percent in June based on the NSO’s
Monthly Integrated Survey of Selected Industries (MISSI).

��MISSI data showed a recovery in manufacturing activity in July. The
value of production index (VAPI) recovered after 10 months of
consecutive declines, growing at a rate of 1.4 percent year-on-year in
July from a 3.0 percent decline in June.

   - Results of the latest Business Expectations Survey (BES) for Q3 2007
showed that business confidence remained buoyant. The overall
business confidence index (CI) remained at the 40.0 percent mark for the
fourth consecutive quarter at 40.9 percent, up by 19.2 index points
compared to the year-ago level. Quarter-on-quarter, however, the index
fell by 5.5 points.

   - Consumer confidence continued to improve in Q3 2007 CES. The
nationwide consumer CI for Q3 2007 sustained its improving trend to
-23.6 percent from -26.0 percent in Q2. Consumers attributed the
favorable economic outlook to the strength of the peso, stable prices of
goods and more job opportunities.

   - Wage increases were recently approved in two regions while COLA
adjustments were approved in three more regions.

**C. Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

   - The agriculture industry registered a positive growth (3.9 percent) in Q2
2007. Despite the prolonged dry spell experienced in some key areas of
the country, agricultural output growth is expected to continue for the rest
of the year, supported by the expected increase in public spending on
seed technology and rural infrastructure. In addition, the Department of
Agriculture (DA) is undertaking a massive greening project to counter
future dry spells.

   - Meanwhile, the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) reported
the occurrence of the early stage of a weak La Niña event. This implies
above-normal rainfall conditions over Visayas and some areas of Luzon
from October to December, with below-normal rainfall over most areas of
Luzon in November.

   - Meanwhile, the swine flu has crept in Nueva Ecija—although minimally—
after affecting the hog industry in nearby Bulacan and Pampanga.

   - On the price front, international and domestic retail prices of rice are on a
gradual uptrend. Global prices of food products like dairy, corn, and
wheat have also risen.

   - In response to the recent price increases of rice, the National Food
Authority (NFA) is implementing measures to ensure the stability of the
supply and price of rice during the lean months in Q3.

Oil price developments

   - International spot and futures prices were higher in September on
expectations of increased global demand for oil and supply concerns due
to the hurricane season. Meanwhile, domestic pump prices were raised
by another P0.50 per liter on 29 September. In the transport sector, the
approved increase in minimum transport fare will not be implemented in
2007.

Developments in the utilities sector

   - On top of the successive rate cuts by NPC and Meralco in the third
quarter of 2007, consumers will enjoy another round of power rate
reductions following the ERC’s decision to lower NPC rates starting
October.

   - However, electricity rates could still increase due to the restoration of the
Automatic Generation Rate Adjustment (AGRA), Meralco’s pending
petitions, ERC’s recent ruling on the alleged ‘price manipulation’ in the
WESM, and the approval of Meralco’s distribution charge starting 2008
under the performance-based rate (PBR) application. Meanwhile, even
with the relatively firm peso, the MWSS has approved an increase in
water rates in the fourth quarter.

**D. Monetary conditions**

Interest rate developments

   - The interest rate differential between the BSP policy rate and the US Fed
funds rate and that between the RP and US T-bill rates widened in
September with the cut in the target for the federal funds rate.

   - With the decline in inflation, the Philippines’ real lending rate for August
increased and was the fourth highest in a sample of 10 Asian countries.

   - Primary T-bill rates and secondary market yields for GS in September
generally decreased.

Domestic liquidity and credit conditions

   - Growth in domestic liquidity or M3 sustained a decelerating trend for the
fourth consecutive month at 14.9 percent year-on-year in August from
18.7 percent in July. On a month-on-month basis, seasonally adjusted
M3 declined by 1.6 percent in August from a 0.8 percent expansion in
July.

   - Outstanding loans of commercial banks, thrift banks and rural banks (net
of reverse repurchase or RRP placements) expanded by 6.9 percent
year-on-year in July compared to the 4.7 percent growth posted in the
previous month. This was a substantial improvement from the 0.5
percent expansion registered in the same month a year ago.

   - Consumer credit increased by 22.0 percent year-on-year in Q2 2007.
This was higher than the year-ago growth recorded at 15.0 percent but
slightly lower than 22.2 percent registered in Q1 2007.

**E. Financial market developments**

   - The local bourse experienced some volatility in August, but has since
recovered starting in the second week of September.

   - The peso weakened slightly by 1.2 percent in August relative to July to
average P46.14/US$1, but strengthened anew to average P46.05/US$1
in September.

**F. Fiscal developments**

   - The National Government’s (NG’s) fiscal operations recorded a P13.9
billion surplus in August 2007. This brought the fiscal deficit of the NG in
the first eight months to P25.5 billion, 25.4 percent lower than the P34.2
billion deficit incurred during the same period last year.
�

**G. External developments**

   - Latest data suggest that the global economy will continue growing,
although at a slower pace, against the backdrop of a weaker-thanexpected US housing recession. Growth is mainly supported by buoyant
economic activity in emerging markets.

   - Negative risks to the global economic outlook have increased recently,
mainly because of the tensions caused by the US subprime mortgage
problem on global capital markets.

Domestic liquidity and credit conditions


-----

   - Economic prospects in the Euro area and Japan remain positive—with
modest output growth in Q2—while China and India continue to gain
significant roles as drivers of global economic growth.

   - Rising inflationary pressures remain on the back of increasing resource
utilization and rising global commodity prices.

   - Central banks show differing policy directions, with the Federal Reserve
loosening monetary policy settings while the Bank of Japan, European
Central Bank, and Bank of England have maintained a neutral stance.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

   - The Monetary Board considered that the overall conditions for future
inflation and output support the case for policy easing. Inflation is likely to
fall well below the 4.0-5.0 percent target range in 2007 and within the 4.0
percent + 1 percentage point target in 2008. Liquidity growth decelerated
for the fourth consecutive month in August; weather conditions have
broadly normalized, supporting favorable supply of agricultural products;
and recent wage adjustments are not expected to generate additional
inflationary pressures.

   - The Monetary Board noted that, while risks to the inflation outlook remain,
these have on balance moderated. The continued strength of the peso
provides a buffer against rising global commodity prices, including food
and oil, while the impact of strong foreign exchange inflows on domestic
liquidity has been mitigated by recent policy measures.

   - The Monetary Board will continue to monitor developments in the global
economy. The Board will also remain watchful of any emerging risk to
future inflation to ensure stable prices, which is a precondition to robust
and durable economic growth.

**III.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

   - Given the above considerations, the Monetary Board decided to adjust
the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Adjust the BSP’s policy interest rates downward by 25 basis points to
5.75 percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 7.75 percent
for the overnight RP (lending) rate;

(b) Adjust the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs
accordingly; and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board on the monetary policy stance is
scheduled on 15 November 2007.
