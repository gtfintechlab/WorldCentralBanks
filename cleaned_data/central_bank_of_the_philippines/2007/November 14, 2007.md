**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 15 NOVEMBER 2007***


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board:

� Adjust the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Adjust the BSP’s policy interest rates downward by 25 basis points to
5.50 percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 7.50 percent
for the overnight RP (lending) rate;

(b) Adjust the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs
accordingly; and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios

Further easing of the monetary policy stance was recommended
based on the following assessment:

(a) Benign inflation outlook over the policy horizon;

(b) The policy move is supportive of non-inflationary growth, and the
balance of risks is manageable;

(c) Positive signal to markets about the BSP’s confidence on the
durability of the benign inflation outlook; and

(d) A pre-emptive move by monetary authorities to soften the impact on
the domestic economy of a possible global economic slowdown, which
could have a serious impact on monetary and financial stability.

The Monetary Board then proceeded to review the recent
developments and the key considerations in the formulation of the BSP’s
monetary policy stance.

- The discussion presented herein reflects the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the
information available at the time of the policy meeting. The highlights of the discussions of the 15
November 2007 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular meeting held on 29

**Review of Recent Developments**

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Headline inflation was unchanged at 2.7 percent in October. Prices
for food, beverages and tobacco were broadly stable while light
registered lower price levels. Meanwhile, higher prices were recorded
for fuel, water and services. The average inflation rate for JanuaryOctober 2007 was maintained at 2.6 percent. Inflation pressures in
October continued to be influenced largely by movements in the prices
of cereals, fuel, and gasoline products.

  - The official core inflation measure published by the National Statistics
Office (NSO) decelerated to 2.4 percent in October from 2.7 percent in
September. Month-on-month, core inflation was unchanged in
October.

**B. Demand conditions**

  - GDP growth accelerated to 7.5 percent in Q2 2007 on the back of
strong consumption spending and expanding investments.

  - The 7.1 percent GDP growth for Q1 2007 validated the upturn phase
of the Philippine business cycle. The upward business cycle path was
expected to continue in Q2 2007 and it did, with GDP growing by 7.5
percent.

  - Data from the NSO showed that the growth in merchandise imports
decelerated appreciably to 1.8 percent year-on-year in August from
14.2 percent in July. For the first eight months of 2007, merchandise
import arrivals rose by 3.8 percent, less than half of the year-ago
growth of 10.8 percent. Month-on-month, merchandise import arrivals
slid by 1.4 percent in August, after increasing by 7.2 percent in July.

  - Data from the NSO showed that merchandise exports registered a 4.7
percent year-on-year growth in September after declining by 4.0
percent in August. For the first nine months of 2007, merchandise
exports rose by 4.9 percent, less than one-third of the year-ago growth
of 17.6 percent. Month-on-month, merchandise exports increased by
6.6 percent in September after falling by 2.0 percent in August.

  - Selected indicators of demand continued to indicate a broad
strengthening trend.

� Based on the latest data from Colliers, land values in Q3 2007
rose by 24.2 percent year-on-year for the Makati Central Business
District (CBD) and 17.9 percent for Ortigas Center.

� Sales of passenger cars surged by 18.4 percent year-on-year in
September, four times the 4.6 percent growth in August. Year-todate sales increased by 5.7 percent, higher than the 4.5 percent
growth registered in the comparable period last year.

� Sales of trucks and buses increased but at a slightly slower pace
of 11.4 percent year-on-year in September compared to 11.9
percent in August. Year-to-date sales of trucks and buses rose by
24.1 percent, up from the 10.4 percent growth registered in the
same period last year.

� Latest data indicate that the energy sales by Meralco rose at a
faster pace of 6.7 percent year-on-year in July compared to 5.4
percent in June. Year-to-date energy sales increased by 4.6
percent, higher than the previous year’s 1.7 percent. The higher
growth rate was attributed by Meralco to the growing economy,
widening customer base and higher energy consumption,
particularly in the commercial sector.

� The volume of appliance sales increased by 1.5 percent year-onyear in September, a turnaround from the 2.0 percent decline in
August. Year-to-date sales likewise grew by 5.0 percent, reversing
the 7.0 percent decline in the comparable period last year.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing declined slightly in
August to 80.4 percent from a revised rate of 80.7 percent in July,
based on the NSO’s Monthly Integrated Survey of Selected
Industries (MISSI).

� MISSI data showed a decline in manufacturing activity in August.
The value of production index (VAPI) declined during the month by
3.6 percent year-on-year, reversing the previous month’s recovery
of 2.1 percent (revised). The volume of production index (VOPI)
similarly fell year-on-year by 4.7 percent in August after increasing
by 1.5 percent (revised) in the previous month.

- Latest data for Q3 2007 showed that business confidence remained
buoyant. The overall business confidence index (CI) remained at the
40.0 percent mark for the fourth consecutive quarter at 40.9 percent,
up by 19.2 index points compared to the year-ago level. For Q4 2007,
respondents expected that business activity would surge as the index
climbed to 53.0 percent, the highest level since the survey was first
conducted in Q2 2001.

- Latest data for Q3 2007 showed that consumer confidence continued
to improve. The nationwide consumer CI for the quarter sustained its
improving trend to -23.6 percent from -26.0 percent in Q2 2007. The
more upbeat consumer outlook for the current quarter was buoyed by

favorable economic conditions, higher family incomes and better
family financial positions.

  - Based on the results of the July 2007 LFS, the unemployment rate
declined to 7.8 percent from 8.1 percent in July 2006.

  - Minimum wage increases in Region V and Region VII, and an
additional cost-of-living allowance in Region XIII were recently
approved while there are two petitions for minimum wage increases
being reviewed by the National Wages and Productivity Commission.
The proposal for the P125 daily wage hike for private sector
employees and the Salary Standardization Law III for government
workers were re-filed in Congress. Meanwhile, the P18 across-theboard increase petition in the daily wages in Region I is the only
pending application before a regional wage and productivity board.

**C. Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - Agriculture grew in Q2 2007 and is expected to sustain its growth,
although modestly, for the rest of the year despite the prolonged dry
spell and the typhoons experienced in some key areas of the country
in Q2 and Q3. Agricultural production will be supported by the
expected increase in public spending on seed technology and rural
infrastructure. Meanwhile, the DA, through its Ginintuang Masaganang
Ani (GMA) Rice Program, is investing in hybrid rice as one of the key
solutions to the country’s food problems.

  - The Department of Science and Technology reported that recent
oceanic and atmospheric conditions in the central and eastern
equatorial Pacific signify the occurrence of the early phase of a weak
La Niña event.

  - Retail prices of commercial rice have decreased gradually since the
last week of September. However, the National Food Authority is
intensifying the monitoring and distribution of government rice
nationwide.

  - Meanwhile, international rice prices have trended upward but may
decline in the coming months. World rice prices have gathered
strength since May, but the increase was far smaller compared to the
world price increases for other cereals, in particular wheat. Similarly,
international prices for all major cereals remained high, with wheat
prices hitting record highs in September.

  - After affecting the hog industry in Bulacan, Pampanga, and Nueva
Ecija, the swine flu epidemic is under control, according to the Bureau
of Animal Industry.

Oil Price Developments

  - International spot and futures prices were higher in early November
due to tight fundamentals and speculations in the oil market.

  - In the domestic scene, pump prices of petroleum products were raised
anew on 10 November 2007.

  - In the transport sector, the Land Transportation Franchising and
Regulatory Board approved the restoration of the P7.50 minimum
fare for public utility vehicles in the National Capital Region, Region III,
and Region IV effective 2 November 2007.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

  - Meralco reduced its power rates further for residential customers in
October as a result of the mandated rate reduction (MRR) on power
supply from the National Power Corporation. On top of the MRR, the
Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) granted a provisional authority
to the NPC to reflect its lower cost under the 7[th] incremental currency
exchange rate adjustment and 8[th] generation rate adjustment
mechanism application.

  - Meralco reduced the generation charges to its residential customers
by P0.42/kwh in October.

  - However, electricity rates could still increase in the near term due to:
1) restoration of the automatic generation rate adjustment; 2) ERC’s
ruling readjusting the spot market settlement price, which would
translate to a rate increase in the whole of Luzon; and 3) the approval
of Meralco’s distribution charge starting 2008 under the performancebased rate application.

  - Meanwhile, after four quarterly reductions in the foreign currency
differential adjustment component of the water tariff, Maynilad Water
Company, Inc. and Maynilad Water Services, Inc. have increased their
rates for the fourth quarter by P0.14 and P0.27 per cubic meter,
respectively.

**D. Financial Market Developments**

Interest Rates

  - Weighted average T-bill rates in the primary market were broadly
lower as of 5 November relative to September. During the 5
November auction, the Auction Committee made a full award of P1.5
billion and P2.0 billion worth of T-bills for the 91-day and 182-day
tenors, but rejected in full the bids for the P2.5 billion worth of 364-day
T-bills.

  - Relative to the 28 September level, the belly of the yield curve for
government securities in the secondary market shifted downward as
medium-term tenors declined, while yields on both ends of the curve
either declined slightly or remained the same.

Stock Market

  - Stock prices trended upwards in September and early October, but
tumbled in mid-October. The rate cuts in the US indicate a positive
signal that the local equities market in the medium term may be
trending upwards although some traders are expected to cash in on
gains in the shorter term. In addition, the country’s positive
macroeconomic fundamentals also contributed to the uptrend in the
stock market index.

Foreign Exchange

  - The peso appreciated by 3.9 percent in October 2007 to average
P44.32/US$1 from the P46.05/US$1 average in September. Further,
the peso reached its seven-year high on 31 October 2007 to average
P43.73/US$1. This developed as the US dollar has generally
weakened against the peso and other regional currencies amid fears
of a US recession, which were fueled by concerns on US banks’ and
funds’ exposures to the subprime mortgage market as well as the
weakness in the US housing prices and employment conditions.

  - Year-to-date movements saw most Asian currencies strengthening
vis-à-vis the US dollar as of 8 November 2007 from their 29 December
2006 levels, led by the peso’s 13.2 percent gain. However, the
Indonesian rupiah depreciated by 1.6 percent vis-à-vis the US dollar.

Global Bond and Credit Default Spreads

  - Debt spreads have narrowed since August but renewed concerns that
the US subprime mortgage crisis could drag on widened spreads
towards the end of October. As of 6 November, EMBI+ global and

**Page 6 of 9**

EMBI+ Philippine spreads widened to 204 and 194 basis points,
respectively, from their end-October levels while Credit Default Swap
spreads climbed to 153 from 132 basis points during the same period.

**E. Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

  - Growth in domestic liquidity or M3 sustained a decelerating trend for
the fifth consecutive month at 11.4 percent year-on-year in September
from 14.9 percent in August. Net foreign assets of depository
corporations continued to drive M3 growth, although at a slower pace
of 32.2 percent year-on-year from 39.7 percent in August.

  - Outstanding loans of commercial banks, thrift banks and rural banks
(net of reverse repurchase or RRP placements) expanded by 7.5
percent year-on-year in August compared to the 6.9 percent growth
posted in the previous month. This was a marked turnaround from the
0.4 percent decline registered in the same month a year ago. Gross
of banks’ RRP placements with the BSP, bank lending exhibited the
same trend, rising by 4.3 percent year-on-year in August from 3.4
percent in July.

  - Consumer credit rose by 22.2 percent year-on-year in Q1 2007. This
was higher than the year-ago growth recorded at 21.1 percent. More
specifically, auto loans, credit card receivables and residential real
estate loans expanded by 19.9 percent, 22.3 percent and 24.0
percent, respectively.

  - Capital-raising activities by PSE-listed companies reached P83.2
billion during the first nine months of the year, exceeding the P31.5
billion raised during the comparable period in 2006 and surpassing the
P57.2 billion raised for the whole year of 2006.

  - As of end-August 2007, the stock of bank loans outstanding rose by
P31.6 billion relative to the end-December 2006 level. Over the same
period, issuances of equity capital and bonds by the private sector
including banks totaled P136.4 billion. Excluding issuances by banks,
the total amount of equity and bonds issued during the period
January-August 2007 reached P104.6 billion.

**F. Fiscal developments**

  - The fiscal deficit of the National Government reached P14.5 billion in
September. This brought the January-September fiscal deficit to P40.0
billion, lower by P14.0 billion compared to the programmed ceiling of
P54.0 billion. The lower deficit resulted mainly from lower spending
partly on account of the savings on interest payments due to lower
borrowing cost.

**G. External developments**

  - The recent turmoil in global financial markets caused by the US
subprime mortgage problem has moderated global growth momentum
in Q3 2007. Global growth is expected to slow down, but the overall
outlook remains uncertain as the extent of the impact of the housing
slump remains protracted and could drag on.

  - Buoyant economic activity in emerging markets and the coordinated
response of major central banks to improve liquidity conditions will
help avoid a serious downturn and possibly reduce the downside risks
of tighter credit and financial conditions from spreading into the global
real economy.

  - Other major central banks, meanwhile, adopted mixed policy
directions. The Federal Reserve loosened monetary policy settings
while the other three major central banks maintained their neutral
stance.

**II. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

  - The Monetary Board considered the continuing benign inflation
outlook across a range of possible scenarios. Inflation remains likely
to fall well below the 4.0-5.0 percent target range in 2007 and within
the lower bound of the 4.0 percent ±1 percentage point target in 2008.

  - In assessing the upside risks to inflation, the Monetary Board noted
that these have remained manageable. Liquidity growth continued to
slow down for the fifth consecutive month in September; risks
pertaining to agricultural output have moderated; more recent regional
wage adjustments are not expected to add price pressures; and
inflation expectations remain well-anchored.

  - Moreover, monetary measures implemented last May 2007 continue
to temper the impact on domestic liquidity of the sustained strong
foreign exchange inflows, while the firm peso has cushioned the effect
of higher import prices of oil and food, among other commodities.

  - The Monetary Board noted that downside risks are present as well.
These include the possible moderation in demand pressures and the
potential decline in international oil prices if global growth slows down.

  - The Monetary Board was of the view that a more accommodative
monetary policy stance will help stimulate business activity and could
pre-empt any possible slowdown in the global economy, which could
have a significant impact on the country’s monetary and financial
stability.

  - The Monetary Board will continue to keep a watchful eye on global
and domestic economic developments, particularly factors that could
pose threats to the inflation target, mindful that price stability is
essential to sustainable economic growth.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

  - After considering the balance of risks to inflation and the evidence that
has become available since its previous meeting on monetary policy,
the Monetary Board approved the recommendations of the Advisory
Committee.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board on the monetary policy
stance is scheduled on 20 December 2007.
