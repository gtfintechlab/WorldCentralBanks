**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 12 JULY 2007***


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board:

? Adjust the current monetary policy settings as follows:

## (a) Reduce the BSP’s policy interest rates to 6.0 percent for the overnight
RRP (borrowing) rate and 8.0 percent for the overnight RP (lending)
rate;

(b) Remove the tiering scheme;

(c) Adjust the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs
accordingly; and

(d) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The Monetary Board then proceeded to review the recent
developments and the key considerations in the formulation of the BSP’s
monetary policy stance.

**I.** **Review of Recent Developments**

**A. Domestic price conditions**

? Headline inflation slowed down to 2.3 percent in June from 2.4 percent
in May. This brought the average inflation rate for the first semester of
2007 to 2.6 percent. The lower inflation was mainly attributable to the
slower price increases in fuel, light and water; food, beverages and
tobacco; and services.

- The discussion presented herein reflects the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the
information available at the time of the policy meeting. The highlights of the discussions of the 12 July 2007
meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular meeting held on 26 July 2007.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and five members,
namely: the Deputy Governor for the Monetary Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor for Supervision and
Examination Sector, the Managing Director of the Treasury Department, the Managing Director of the
Monetary Policy Sub-sector, and the Director of the Department of Economic Research.

? Similarly, the official core inflation measure published by the National
Statistics Office (NSO) went down to 2.5 percent in June after being
pegged at 2.6 percent from March to May.

**B. Demand conditions**

? Growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Q1 2007 surged to 6.9
percent, its highest level since Q1 1990. On the demand side, GDP
growth was buoyed by robust consumption spending and net exports.

? Selected indicators of demand continued to indicate a broad
strengthening trend.

� Based on data from Colliers International Research, land values in
Q2 2007 rose by 6.8 percent year-on-year for the Makati Central
Business District (CBD) and 14.2 percent for Ortigas Center.
Office and residential rents increased by more than 20 percent
over the same period. In real terms, however, land and rental
values remained way below their 1997 levels. Meanwhile, office
and residential vacancy rates in the Makati CBD continued to
decline in Q2 2007.

� Growth in passenger car sales continued but at a slower pace of
6.1 percent year-on-year in May from 15.5 percent in April. The
year-on-year growth in sales of trucks and buses similarly
continued but at a slower rate of 16.0 percent in May compared to
the blistering rate of 66.1 percent in April.

� Energy sales by Meralco rose at a slower pace of 2.5 percent
year-on-year in April relative to 5.1 percent in March. This reflected
the lower growth in electricity demand by the commercial and
industrial sectors. Year-to-date energy sales remained broadly
unchanged compared to the same period last year.

� Appliance sales slid slightly by 0.7 percent year-on-year in
February after declining by 12.0 percent in January. Similarly,
year-to-date sales declined at a slower pace of 6.6 percent
compared to 21.2 percent in the first two months of 2006.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing was broadly
unchanged in April at 80.1 percent compared to 80.0 percent in
March based on the NSO’s Monthly Integrated Survey of Selected
Industries (MISSI).

� MISSI data also showed that the value of production index (VAPI)
recovered slightly, growing by 0.1 percent year-on-year in April
after seven consecutive months of declines. Meanwhile, the

volume of production index (VOPI) continued to decline by 1.3
percent year-on-year in April.

? Preliminary NSO data showed that growth in merchandise exports
rose to 6.1 percent year-on-year in May from 5.1 percent in April. This
was due mainly to higher growth in manufactures (including
electronics) and petroleum products. The cumulative growth rate for
January to May was 7.7 percent, lower than the previous year’s 17.7
percent.

? Merchandise imports recorded a 1.8 percent year-on-year decline in
April, reversing the previous month’s increase of 8.0 percent. This can
be attributed to the decline in imports of capital goods as well as raw
materials and intermediate goods. For the first four months of 2007,
merchandise imports rose by 3.4 percent, less than half of the 7.6
percent growth in the comparable period in 2006.

? Business sentiment continues to be bullish in Q2 2007 based on the
latest Business Expectations Survey (BES). The overall business
confidence index (CI) remained above the 40 percent level for the
third consecutive quarter, after rising to a record high of 49.4 percent
in Q4 2006. The Q2 2007 CI remained strong at 46.4 percent, higher
relative to comparable levels year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.

? Consumer confidence improved based on the Q2 2007 Consumer
Expectations Survey (CES). The overall consumer CI was less
negative in Q2 2007, indicating that the number of optimistic
respondents increased. Consumer confidence for the third quarter
and the next 12 months also improved, particularly among households
in the NCR where the Q2 2007 confidence indices reached their
highest level since the start of the CES in Q3 2004.

? As of end-June 2007, there were six pending petitions for wage
increases before six out of 17 Regional Tripartite and Wage
Productivity Boards (RTWPBs).

**C. Supply side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

? The agriculture sector registered a 4.2 percent growth in Q1 2007,
slightly higher than the year-ago growth of 4.1 percent. The major
contributions to output growth came from the palay, fishery, livestock
and poultry subsectors.

? Current global forecasts point to the potential occurrence of La Niña in
Q3 2007. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical
Services Administration (PAGASA) noted that four international
weather bureaus expect a strong incidence of La Niña in the second
semester of 2007. In addition, weather conditions last May met
PAGASA’s criteria for the start of the rainy season, which peaks
between the months of June to August. PAGASA also forecasts one
or two tropical cyclones in June and around three or four tropical
cyclones per month in July and August.

Oil price developments

? International spot and futures prices remained high on supply
concerns related to the US summer driving season and ongoing
geopolitical tensions. Meanwhile, domestic prices of petroleum
products were raised twice in June. On the transport sector, a 50centavo minimum fare hike for public utility jeepneys (PUJs) will take
effect in Metro Manila, Central Luzon and Southern Tagalog, as soon
as the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board
(LTFRB) gets clearance from the National Economic and
Development Authority (NEDA).

Developments in the utilities sector

? Despite reduced charges by the National Power Corporation (NPC),
electricity rates may be adjusted later on to reflect Transco’s higher
billing rates. Meanwhile, an average reduction of two percent in water
rates will be implemented in Q3 2007.

**D. Monetary conditions**

Interest rate developments

? During the 2 July 2007 auction, T-bill rates rose relative to their levels
in the 21 May 2007 auction.

? Relative to their end-May levels, secondary market yields of GS as of
end-June increased except for the yield on the 6-month GS. The yield
curve in the secondary market shifted upward, triggered by
speculations that there will be less demand for emerging market
securities given the rise in the yield for 10-year US Treasuries.

Domestic liquidity and credit conditions

? Growth in domestic liquidity or M3 slowed down to 21.1 percent yearon-year in May from the 26.3 percent increase registered in the

**Page 4 of 7**

previous month. On a month-on-month basis, seasonally adjusted M3
contracted by 1.1 percent in May after a 2.8 percent expansion in
April. Growth in the net foreign assets of depository corporations
continued to drive M3, albeit at a slower pace of 32.6 percent from
37.9 percent in April. Net domestic assets likewise posted a
decelerating growth trend at 6.4 percent from 12.5 percent in the
previous month. In particular, growth in credit to the public sector
slowed down to 11.8 percent from 18.2 percent during the same
period. This was partly offset by the continued expansion in credit to
the private sector, which rose by 5.8 percent from 5.2 percent, as
lending to entities other than financial corporations was sustained
during the month.

? Consumer credit rose by 22.2 percent year-on-year in Q1 2007. This
was higher than the year-ago growth recorded at 21.1 percent. More
specifically, auto loans, credit card receivables and residential real
estate loans expanded by 19.9 percent, 22.3 percent and 24.0
percent, respectively.

Financial market developments

? In May, the stock market sustained its upbeat mood. The continued
deceleration in inflation, the strengthening of the peso, bright
economic prospects and strong corporate profits helped sustain
investors’ interest in local stocks.

? Equity raised by PSE-listed companies via various capital-raising
activities[2] increased by 41.5 percent to P34.8 billion for the first five
months of 2007 from P24.6 billion in the comparable period last year.
Meanwhile, issuances of bonds by private companies reached P46.2
billion during the first five months of 2007, more than three times the
year-ago level.

**E. Exchange rate developments**

? The peso averaged P46.15/US$1 for the month of June, appreciating
by 1.3 percent against the P46.75/US$1 average in May,[3] due to
continued strong inflows from overseas Filipinos’ remittances, foreign
direct and portfolio investments, and export earnings.

2 These consist of initial public offerings (IPOs), follow-on-offerings, stock rights offerings, and private
placements.

**F. Fiscal developments**

? The National Government (NG) incurred a fiscal deficit of P1.7 billion
in May, a reversal of the P5.8 billion surplus in the same month last
year and the P12.0 billion surplus in April. The January-May deficit of
the NG reached P41.8 billion, about 5.4 percent below the deficit in
the comparable period last year. The cumulative deficit for the first five
months of the year exceeded the P31.3 billion program for the first
semester of 2007 by P10.5 billion.

**G. External developments**

? Global economic growth remained buoyant, notwithstanding the
weaker-than-expected growth in the United States. Steady growth in
major economies such as the Euro area and Japan, coupled with the
brisk pace of expansion in China and India, sustained the strong
global economic performance to date.

? 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of world growth in excess of 4.0
percent, and initial estimates of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
are showing that the world economy is growing this year at a rate
faster-than-expected in the previous months. This five-year period of
continued growth is the longest period of sustained expansion in three
decades, and global inflationary pressures are building up as a result.

? Most major central banks (except for Indonesia, New Zealand, China,
UK, Thailand, and Taiwan) maintained key policy rates at their latest
policy meetings.

**II. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

? The Monetary Board noted that the recommendation of the Advisory
Committee to lower key policy interest rates and remove the tiering
scheme—which was assessed to be neutral relative to future inflation
and output—is consistent with the forward-looking orientation of
inflation targeting, considering the low actual inflation and, more
importantly, the benign inflation outlook over the policy horizon. The
latest BSP forecasts continue to indicate that inflation is likely to fall
below the 4.0–5.0 percent target range in 2007 and stay within the 4.0
percent ± 1.0 percentage point target in 2008.

? The Monetary Board also observed that recent data suggest that the
additional liquidity management measures implemented in early May
2007 have begun to exert the desired cooling effect on liquidity

conditions. Meanwhile, there are indications that the tiering scheme
that has been in effect for the past eight months has had a beneficial
impact on bank lending to the productive sectors of the economy.  At
the same time, the Monetary Board observed that the continued
broadening of financial markets means that non-bank sources of
financing are becoming increasingly available to the corporate sector,
therefore reducing the reliance on bank lending.

? The Monetary Board believes that the neutral stance of monetary
policy is appropriate given moderate demand pressures, favorable
supply conditions and manageable inflation expectations. Moreover,
the Monetary Board considers that neutrality will provide greater
flexibility to the monetary authorities in the absence of a clearer
direction on potential risks to the inflation outlook, such as liquidity,
wage pressures and oil prices.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

? After considering the risks to inflation and the evidence that has
become available since its previous meeting on monetary policy, the
Monetary Board approved the recommendations of the Advisory
Committee.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board on the monetary policy
stance is scheduled on 23 August 2007.
