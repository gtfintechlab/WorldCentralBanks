**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 20 DECEMBER 2007***


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board:

� Adjust the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Adjust the BSP’s policy interest rates downward by 25 basis points to
5.25 percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 7.25 percent
for the overnight RP (lending) rate;

(b) Adjust the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs
accordingly; and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios

Further easing of the monetary policy stance was recommended
based on the following assessments:

(a) A generally benign inflation path over the policy horizon;

(b) The balance of risks to the inflation outlook has remained
manageable, both on the supply and demand side;

(c) It sends a positive signal to markets about the BSP’s confidence on
the durability of the benign inflation outlook, as well as the BSP’s
credibility and ability to anchor inflation expectations; and

(d) It is a pre-emptive move to soften the impact on the domestic economy
of a possible US and global economic slowdown, which could have a
serious impact on monetary and financial stability.

The Monetary Board then proceeded to review the recent
developments and the key considerations in the formulation of the BSP’s
monetary policy stance.

- The discussion presented herein reflects the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the
information available at the time of the policy meeting. The highlights of the discussions of the 20
December 2007 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular meeting held on 3
January 2008.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and five members,
namely: the Deputy Governor for the Monetary Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor for Supervision and
Examination Sector, the Managing Director of the Treasury Department, the Managing Director of the
Monetary Policy Sub-sector, and the Director of the Department of Economic Research.

**Review of Recent Developments**

**A. Domestic price conditions**

? Headline inflation increased to 3.2 percent in November from 2.7
percent in October. Inflation pressures in November were linked
mainly to increases in the prices of food and energy-related items.
Year-to-date inflation averaged slightly higher at 2.7 percent
compared to the 2.6 percent recorded in January to October 2007.

? The official core inflation measure published by the National Statistics
Office (NSO) decelerated to 2.3 percent in November from 2.4 percent
in October. While the official core inflation went down, alternative
measures estimated by the BSP went up.

**B. Demand conditions**

? Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 6.6 percent in Q3 2007.
While this was slower than the 7.1- and 7.5-percent growth posted in
the first two quarters, this was faster compared to the 5.1 percent
growth in the comparable period last year. GDP growth was boosted
by household spending and capital investments from the expenditure
side, and by the services sector from the production side.

? Year-to-date GDP growth was 7.1 percent, higher than the upper end
of the Government’s full-year growth target of 6.1-6.7 percent.

? Based on BOP data, imports of goods rose by 4.6 percent in Q2 2007
to US$ 14.1 billion. Meanwhile, exports of goods increased by 5.0
percent in Q2 2007 to US$ 12.2 billion.

? Preliminary data (NSO) for September indicated an 8.9 percent import
growth year-on-year, accelerating from the 0.4 percent and 2.1
percent growth recorded in the previous year and in the previous
month. The surge in imports was due to the higher cost of imported
commodities such as petroleum crude, feeding stocks, and other basic
food items like rice and dairy products. Meanwhile, merchandise
exports registered a 10.5 percent year-on-year growth in October after
expanding by 4.6 percent in September. This was due mainly to the
recovery of electronics and the strong performance of agro-based
exports.

? Selected indicators of demand continued to indicate a broad
strengthening trend.

� Based on the latest data from Colliers, land values in Q3 2007
rose by 24.2 percent year-on-year for the Makati Central Business
District (CBD) and 17.9 percent for Ortigas Center.

� Sales of passenger cars increased by 21.2 percent year-on-year in
October, bringing the growth of year-to-date sales to 7.3 percent,
an acceleration from the 5.3 percent growth registered in the same
period last year and the 5.7 percent growth in September.

� Sales of trucks and buses grew modestly by 3.7 percent year-onyear in October, a slowdown compared to the 22.8 percent
increase last year and the 11.4 percent growth in September;
while year-to-date sales increased by 21.1 percent in October,
higher than the 12.0 percent growth registered in the same period
last year.

� The year-on-year energy sales of Meralco grew by 1.9 percent in
September, higher than the 0.9 percent increase in the same
month last year but significantly lower than the previous month’s
sales growth of 9.3 percent. Similarly, year-to-date energy sales
increased by 4.8 percent, also an improvement from the 1.0
percent registered in the comparable period last year.

� Retail sales recorded significant growth during the period JanuaryAugust at P88.5 billion, reflecting a 40.5 percent growth against
the 27.9 percent recorded in the same period of the previous year.

� The volume of appliance sales increased by 28.9 percent year-onyear in October, a significant increase from the 1.5 percent
recorded in September. Year-to-date sales likewise grew by 7.2
percent, a turnaround from the 8.1 percent decline in the
comparable period last year.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing increased slightly in
September to 80.6 percent from a revised rate of 80.5 percent in
August, based on the NSO’s Monthly Integrated Survey of
Selected Industries (MISSI).

� MISSI data also showed a slight improvement in manufacturing
activity in September. The value of production index (VAPI)
recovered to 0.7 percent in September compared to the 4.5
percent (revised) year-on-year decline in August. Meanwhile, the
volume of production index (VOPI) continued to fall year-on-year in
September, although at a slower pace of 1.0 percent, from a
sharper fall of 5.7 percent (revised) in August.

? Q4 2007 Business Expectations Survey results showed that business
confidence is still high, as the confidence index (CI) rose quarter-onquarter by more than seven index points to 48.0 percent.

? Q4 2007 Consumer Expectations Survey results showed consumer
confidence has weakened after strengthening during the past two

quarters. The nationwide CI for Q4 declined quarter-on-quarter by
10.0 index points to settle at -33.6 percent. Consumers’ apprehension
may have partly reflected the concerns regarding uncertainty on the
orderly conduct and outcome of the _barangay election, political noise,_
and threats of terrorism during the survey period (October 2007).

? Based on the preliminary results of the October 2007 Labor Force
Survey, the unemployment rate declined to 6.3 percent in October
2007 from 7.3 percent in October 2006.

? A lower-than-petitioned minimum wage increase in Region I and an
additional cost-of-living allowance in Region VIII were approved
recently, leaving one pending petition for a similar increase filed with a
regional wage and productivity board. The proposal for the P125 daily
wage hike for private sector employees and the Salary
Standardization Law III for government workers were re-filed in
Congress.

**C. Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

? Agriculture, fishery and forestry (AFF) output grew by 5.6 percent in
Q3 2007 from 3.6 percent in the same period a year ago. Growth in
AFF during the period, which accounted for 17.3 percent of total GDP,
was driven by the fishery, corn and palay subsectors. Meanwhile, the
Department of Agriculture is pushing for a concerted effort by all
sectors to sustain the growth momentum of the farm sector in 2008
onwards in the face of the recent tightening in global supply and
surging prices of commodities.

? Based on recent global observations, a La Niña episode of moderate
strength is currently taking place over the central and eastern
equatorial Pacific. Majority of statistical and model forecasts from
international climate centers predict that La Niña will continue through
early 2008.

? Meanwhile, retail prices of commercial rice continued to decrease in
November. The National Food Authority recently increased the
support price of _palay, boosting its procurement activities as more_
farmers sold their harvest to the agency.

? International rice prices have continued to strengthen since January
2007, reflecting a tightening of market conditions in key exporting
countries and a rebound in import demand, particularly in Asia.
International prices for all major cereals have likewise remained high
and some registered considerable gains from the previous season.

? The prices of poultry products generally softened in October after
successive increases in the previous months due to the slowdown in
production brought by the prolonged dry spell.

Oil Price Developments

? International spot prices were lower as of 16 December on worries
that US inflation could dampen global oil demand and expectations
that OPEC will raise its oil output in February 2008. In the domestic
scene, the prices of petroleum products were raised anew on 8
December 2007.

? In the transport sector, the Land Transportation Franchising and
Regulatory Board is conducting hearings with the transport sector to
discuss petitions for fare increases.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

? A lower generation charge was passed on in November to electricity
users following the reduction in the 8[th] Generation Rate Adjustment
Mechanism and 7th Incremental Currency Exchange Rate Adjustment
of the National Power Corporation in October 2007. However, the
generation charge was raised in December as Meralco passed on its
recovery of purchased power costs resulting in a P0.06/kwh increase
in its generation charge.

? For water rates, on a cumulative basis, there was a net increase in
Metro Manila for 2007, but this was tempered by the appreciation of
the peso which resulted in a negative foreign currency differential
adjustment for the whole year.

**D. Financial Market Developments**

Interest Rates

? Weighted average T-bill rates in the primary market were broadly
lower as of 3 December relative to November. During the 3
December auction, the Auction Committee made a full award of the
P2.0 billion and a partial award of the P2.5 billion offerings for the 182day and 364-day T-bills, respectively, but rejected the bids for the
P1.5 billion offering for the 91-day T-bills.

? As of 12 December, the yields for secondary market GS continued to
decline and the yield curve flattened. Yields declined further on 12
December as the markets factored in their expectation of another
reduction in the BSP’s policy rates on 20 December.

Stock Market

? The stock composite index trended upwards in the first two weeks of
October but retreated during the last two transaction days as investors
cashed in on their gains in anticipation of the long weekend. In the first
two weeks of November, the stock market was volatile due to a
confluence of external developments, namely: surge in oil prices, huge
subprime mortgage-related write-offs, continued weakening of the US
dollar, and expectations of a possible economic slowdown in the US
economy by next year. However, the stock market index rose anew in
the first two weeks of December on expectations that the US Fed will
further reduce its target rate on 11 December 2007.

Foreign Exchange

? The peso appreciated by 2.7 percent in November 2007 to average
P43.17/US$1 from the P44.32/US$1 average in October. The peso
reached its highest level since April 2000 on 13 December 2007 to
average P41.14/US$1, buoyed by strong inflows from OF remittances
due to the holiday season. Further, the steady stream of foreign
portfolio and direct investments to the country, reflecting favorable
investor sentiment, as well as export earnings provided support to the
peso.

? Year-to-date movements saw most Asian currencies strengthening
vis-à-vis the US dollar as of 18 December 2007 from its 29 December
2006 level, led by the Philippine peso’s 16.8 percent gain.  However,
the South Korean won and the Indonesian rupiah depreciated by 1.0
percent and 4.3 percent, respectively.

Global Bond and Credit Default Spreads

? Debt spreads have widened significantly since late October due to
renewed credit concerns as large international banks have been
reportedly writing off losses on their holdings of mortgage-backed
securities. Debt spreads have narrowed since August but renewed
concerns that the US subprime mortgage crisis could drag on widened
spreads towards the end of October. EMBI+Philippine spreads
widened to 246.0 from 171.0 basis points, while the Philippine credit
default swap spreads likewise widened to 188.5 from 132.4 basis
points.

**E. Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

? In October, domestic liquidity or M3 grew by 11.4 percent year-onyear, maintaining the same growth momentum as in the previous
month. Net foreign assets (NFA) of depository corporations continued
to drive M3 growth, even as NFA growth slowed down slightly to 29.7

percent year-on-year from 32.2 percent in September. This trend is
associated with the continued foreign exchange inflows from OF
remittances, exports, and direct and portfolio investments.

? Growth in outstanding loans of commercial banks, thrift banks, and
rural banks (net of reverse repurchase or RRP transactions) grew by
7.1 percent year-on-year in October, from the 6.9 percent (revised)
growth recorded in September. Gross of banks’ RRP placements with
the BSP, bank lending growth slowed down to 3.2 percent year-onyear in October from 4.8 percent (revised) in September, as banks’
RRP placements with the BSP declined with the shifting of funds to
special deposit accounts or SDAs.

? Capital-raising activities by Philippine Stock Exchange-listed
companies reached P84.4 billion during the first ten months of the
year, almost twice the level reached in the same period last year.

? As of end-September 2007, the stock of bank loans outstanding rose
by P21.4 billion relative to the end-December 2006 level. As of endOctober 2007, issuances of equity capital and bonds by the private
sector including banks totaled P146.4 billion. Excluding issuances by
banks, the total amount of equity and bonds issued during the same
period reached P106.1 billion.

**F. Fiscal developments**

? The National Government’s (NG) fiscal position recorded a P1.5 billion
deficit in October, lower than the P5.8 billion deficit recorded in
October 2006. This development brought the January-October 2007
fiscal deficit to P41.5 billion, lower than the P56.3 billion deficit in the
same period last year and the P63.0 billion program for the whole year
of 2007. Compared to the same period last year, the lower deficit
resulted mainly from higher revenues and lower interest payments.

? Revenues increased to P83.7 billion in October, 4.8 percent higher
than the level recorded in the comparable period of the previous year.
This brought the January-October 2007 revenues to P896.0 billion,
12.6 percent (or P100.4 billion) higher than the comparable level
recorded in 2006, but 20.0 percent (or P222.8 billion) lower than the
whole year program for 2007.

**G. External developments**

? Global growth is expected to slow down for the rest of the year until at
least mid-2008, but the overall outlook remains uncertain as the extent
of the impact of the US housing slump remains protracted and could
drag on. Nevertheless, prospects remain brighter in emerging markets
as they continue to support global economic growth. The coordinated

**Page 7 of 9**

responses of major central banks to improve liquidity conditions are
also expected to help avoid a serious downturn. On balance, the
outlook for growth remains on the downside due to risks relating
mainly to the potential for a broader impact of the ongoing
reassessment of financial market risks, market confidence, and further
oil and non-oil commodity price increases.

? The Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank of England eased policy
settings during their latest policy meetings. Other major central banks,
meanwhile, adopted a neutral stance.

? On 12 December, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the
European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National
Bank announced measures designed to address elevated pressures
in short-term funding markets. Central bankers took the action after
policy interest-rate reductions in the United States, United Kingdom,
and Canada failed to ease market concerns that banks will reduce
lending, which could send the US and the rest of the world in a global
slowdown that is worse than expected.

**II. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

? The Monetary Board considered the continuing benign inflation
outlook across a range of possible scenarios. In the absence of
unforeseen adverse shocks, latest estimates indicate that average
inflation forecasts are expected to remain well below the 4.0-5.0
percent target range in 2007, within the 4.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage
point target for 2008, and within the 3.5 percent ± 1.0 percentage point
target for 2009.

? Demand indicators have been consistent with modest demand growth,
and these have exerted limited price pressures; inflation expectations
remain well anchored; and liquidity growth has been decelerating for
the last six months up to October, reflecting the impact of the
monetary measures implemented by the BSP in May.

? Risks to the inflation outlook consist mainly of oil and food price
pressures stemming from world markets. The Monetary Board noted
that these risks have remained manageable both on the supply and
demand sides. While the firm peso has tempered the impact of higher
import costs, developments in global oil and non-oil commodity prices
bear close monitoring because of possible spill-over effects on
domestic prices.

? The Monetary Board noted that with a generally benign inflation path
going forward, the principal emerging risk to the economy at present is
to output. The global economy has yet to exhibit  a durable  recovery

**Page 8 of 9**

path—given rising oil prices and the ongoing US subprime mortgage
crisis—and a possible weakness in external demand could weigh
down on the growth prospects of the Philippine economy. Under such
conditions, an accommodative monetary policy stance could provide
room to allow demand to continue to grow in order to counter the
contractionary impact of a possible US and global slowdown.

? The Monetary Board further noted that lowering the policy rates could
provide further impetus to growth via stronger investments and bank
lending.

? The Monetary Board will continue to keep a watchful eye on global
and domestic economic developments, particularly on those that could
pose threats to the inflation target, mindful that price stability is
essential to sustainable economic growth.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

? After considering the balance of risks to the inflation outlook and the
evidence that has become available since its previous meeting on
monetary policy, the Monetary Board approved the recommendations
of the Advisory Committee.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board on the monetary policy
stance is scheduled on 31 January 2008.
