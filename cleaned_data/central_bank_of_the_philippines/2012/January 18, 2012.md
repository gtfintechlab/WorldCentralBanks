HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON MONETARY POLICY ISSUES

HELD ON 19 JANUARY 2012[1]


I. Monetary Policy Decision

The Monetary Board (MB) decided to:

a) Reduce the BSP’s policy interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 6.25 percent for the overnight RP (lending)
rate;

b) Reduce accordingly the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs and SDAs; and

c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

II. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance

  - The inflation outlook remains comfortably within the target range, with inflation
expectations well-anchored. Latest baseline forecasts indicate that average annual
inflation rates are likely to fall within the lower half of the 3-5 percent target range up
to 2013. Pressures on global commodity prices are seen to continue to abate amid
weaker global growth prospects.

  - The MB noted that the global economic environment had become more challenging
amid renewed uncertainty, much of it linked to the ongoing Euro crisis. With the
resolution of the European sovereign debt crisis expected by market players to be a
drawn-out process, uncertainty and risk aversion are likely to weigh down on global
sentiment. Meanwhile, the US economy, despite signs of improvement, remains
susceptible to financial market volatility amid ongoing discussions on a long-term fiscal
debt-reduction plan.

  - Against this background, the MB believed that the overall balance of global economic
activity going forward appears to be tipping towards a further slowdown and the
Philippine economy is likely to face external headwinds in 2012. The MB concluded that
the benign inflation outlook allowed some scope for a reduction in policy rates to help
boost economic activity and support market confidence. While the Philippine economy
continues to expand, sustained domestic spending is expected to compensate for
weaker external demand.

1 The discussions presented reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the information available at the
time of the policy meeting. A comprehensive set of economic information was provided by the Technical Secretariat of the
Advisory Committee (AC). The AC is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely: the Deputy
Governor of the Monetary Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor of the Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant
Governor of the Monetary Policy Sub-Sector, and the Assistant Governor of the Treasury Department. The highlights of the
discussions on the 19 January 2012 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular meeting held on
2 February 2012. The next meeting of the Monetary Board on monetary policy issues is scheduled on 1 March 2012.

  - However, the MB also took into account the risks surrounding the inflation outlook. The
impact of sustained capital inflows on domestic liquidity and the effect of geopolitical
tensions in major oil-producing countries on global oil supplies are seen to continue to
pose upside risks to inflation.

III.   Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook

The MB considered the following developments in coming up with its policy decision:

A. Domestic price conditions

  - The year-on-year average headline inflation in 2011 at 4.4 percent (2000=100) and 4.8
percent (2006=100) was within the Government’s target for the year. Meanwhile,
December inflation dropped further after peaking in October, driven mainly by lower
inflation for food, particularly rice, vegetables and sugar. Other indicators also reflected
a downtrend, notably various measures of core inflation and the cross-sectional
distribution of CPI price changes.

B.  Inflation expectations

  - Inflation expectations continued to be bounded by the target range. Latest results of
the BSP’s survey of private sector economists and the AP consensus survey showed
steady mean forecasts for 2012, indicating that inflation expectations remained
anchored to the target over the policy horizon.

C. Inflation outlook

  - The outlook for inflation over the policy horizon continues to be manageable. Latest
baseline inflation forecasts using the 2006-based CPI series reflect a decelerating path,
with average annual inflation for 2012-2013 falling close to the lower bound of the
target range of 3-5 percent.

  - The downside risks to the inflation outlook have intensified due to concerns over the
strength of the global economy. At the same time, the broadly stable peso could help
temper the prices of imported commodities. Meanwhile, the upside risks to inflation
could emanate from the impact of the geopolitical risks in the MENA region on global
oil supplies, sustained strong capital inflows and additional petitions for electricity rate
adjustments.

D.  Demand conditions

  - Output dynamics appear to be weaker. The business cycle analysis by the BSP indicated
that the economy has been growing below its long-term growth trend. Furthermore,
surveys suggest households and businesses could turn more cautious in the ensuing
period.

E.  Supply-side indicators

Developments in Agriculture

  - The Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS) revised downwards its forecast for 2011
palay production, reflecting the adverse effects of typhoons Mina, Juaning, Pedring and
Quiel on standing crops. However, palay and corn production for 2011 are still expected
to exceed their 2010 levels due to significant gains recorded in the first half which more
than offset the crop damages triggered by the typhoons in the second half.

Oil Price Developments

  - The continuing tensions in the MENA region, modest improvement in the US economy
and combined efforts to resolve the Euro zone crisis have exerted upward pressures on
oil prices in recent months. However, downward pressures brought about by
uncertainties on the global economy and the contagion effects of the European debt
crisis are still expected to persist in the near term.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

  - Electricity rates of Manila Electric Co. (Meralco) decreased in December resulting from
reduced power supply cost. Meralco noted that the decrease in prices in the electricity
spot market was brought about by the recovery of the Malampaya natural gas pipeline,
which helped ease power supply conditions.

F. Financial market developments

  - At the 9 January 2012 auction, interest rates for the 91-day and 182-day T-bills declined
relative to the rates fetched during the 12 December 2011 auction on account of strong
demand amid a high level of market liquidity and ahead of possible policy actions by the
BSP. Meanwhile, the interest rate for the 364-day T-bill went up, reflecting weak
demand (tenders amounted to P2.9 billion compared to the P3.5 billion offered
amount). Market expectations that the interest rate environment may be affected by
possible policy actions by the BSP dampened investors’ appetite for the said tenor.

  - In December, concerted efforts of key central banks to extend financial assistance to
banks in the Euro zone calmed investors, boosting stock markets around the globe and
bringing down premia on emerging market debt securities. Favorable US economic
data, which reflected a steady pick up in the US economy, likewise buoyed market
sentiment. However, the peso came under pressure during the same period, following
the International Monetary Fund’s downward revision of its growth forecast for the
Philippine economy and the sluggish performance of the export sector. However, the
sustained flow of OF remittances tempered the further depreciation of the peso.

G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions

    - Domestic liquidity or M3 grew at a faster pace of 7.2 percent in November 2011 from
6.9 percent in October 2011 to reach P4.4 trillion. Higher growth in net foreign assets
(NFA) continued to fuel liquidity expansion, while net domestic assets contracted at a
slower rate as the sustained strong expansion in the net other items account (which
includes, among other things, SDA placements of trust entities as well as revaluation
and capital and reserve accounts) was moderated by the acceleration in the growth of
net domestic credits. Reflecting the continued strong growth of bank lending to firms
and households, net domestic credits expanded, supported by credit extended to both
private and public sector.

    - Bank lending growth, net of banks’ reverse repurchase (RRP) placements with the BSP,
rose slightly in November to 22.5 percent from the previous month’s expansion of 22.2
percent. Commercial banks’ loans have been growing steadily at double-digit growth
rates since January 2011.

    - Corporate issuers continue to tap the equity and bond markets. Capital-raising activities
in the Philippine Stock Exchange reached P109 billion for the period January-November
2011, higher by 30 percent from the 2010 level of P84 billion. However, corporate bond
issuances for the same period amounted to only P173 billion, lower compared to the
2010 level of P201 billion.

H.  Fiscal developments

    - The fiscal deficit in January-November 2011 was P96.3 billion, 64.3 percent lower than
the P269.8 billion deficit incurred during the same period in 2010. The lower deficit
figure is attributed to increased revenue collections (13.1 percent year-on-year)
coupled with lower government spending (-2.1 percent year-on-year).

I.  External developments

   - The global economic environment has become more challenging amid renewed
uncertainty. While the US economy has shown signs of improvement, it remains
susceptible to financial market volatility amid the failure of Congress to settle on a longterm debt-reduction plan. In contrast, the Euro area economy has become notably
weaker and it remains uncertain how the current situation would be resolved.
Developments in Europe continue to pose increasing downside risks to the global
economy. With the resolution of the European sovereign debt crisis expected to be a
drawn-out process, uncertainty and risk aversion are likely to weigh down on both the
real sector and global financial markets. Most analysts now expect the European
economy to record minimal growth in 2012. Against this background, the overall
balance of global economic activity appears to be tipping towards a further slowdown
going forward.
