**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON MONETARY POLICY ISSUES**

**HELD ON 1 MARCH 2012[1]**


**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board (MB) decided to:

a) Reduce the BSP’s policy interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.0 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 6.0 percent for the overnight RP (lending)
rate;

b) Reduce accordingly the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs and SDAs; and

c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

  - Latest baseline forecasts indicate that average annual inflation rates are likely to fall
within the lower half of the 3‐5 percent target range up to 2013. This inflation
trajectory is broadly in line with the latest BSP and private sector surveys, which show
inflation expectations as being anchored towards the target over the policy horizon.

  - The MB noted that the risks to the inflation outlook appear to be broadly balanced,
with the subdued pace of global economic activity expected to temper the rise in
commodity prices. The upside risks to inflation stem mainly from volatility in
international oil prices due to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and from the
impact of strong capital inflows on domestic liquidity growth.

  - At the same time, the MB noted that domestic demand has continued to grow at a
modest pace, reflecting mainly the impact of weaker external demand. Global economic
conditions are expected to stay subdued as fiscal and banking sector headwinds in
advanced economies affect global output growth and as market confidence remains
fragile. Given these considerations, the MB is of the view that the benign inflation
outlook has allowed further scope for a measured reduction in policy rates to support
economic activity and reinforce market confidence.

1 The discussions presented reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the information available at the
time of the policy meeting. A comprehensive set of economic information was provided by the Technical Secretariat of the
Advisory Committee (AC). The AC is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely: the Deputy
Governor of the Monetary Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor of the Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant
Governor of the Monetary Policy Sub‐Sector, and the Assistant Governor of the Treasury Department. The highlights of the
discussions on the 1 March 2012 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular meeting held on
22 March 2012. The next meeting of the Monetary Board on monetary policy issues is scheduled on 19 April 2012.

**III.   Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook**

The MB considered the following developments in coming up with its policy decision:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Year‐on‐year average headline inflation dropped in January, driven mainly by lower
inflation for food, particularly vegetables and sugar. Other indicators also reflected a
downtrend, including the following: two out of three alternative measures of core
inflation estimated by the BSP, and the number and weight of above‐threshold items.

  - Lower food inflation due to ample domestic supply of selected food items, particularly
vegetables and sugar, led to the continued deceleration of inflation in January.
Meanwhile, higher prices of liquefied petroleum gas contributed to the marginal rise in
non‐food inflation.

**B.  Inflation expectations**

  - Inflation expectations continue to be bounded by the target range. Latest results of the
BSP’s survey of private sector economists and the AP consensus survey show within‐
target mean inflation forecasts for 2012 and 2013.

**C. Inflation outlook**

  - The latest baseline forecasts indicate that headline inflation is expected to average near
the low end of the 3‐5 percent target range for both 2012 and 2013 with risks to
inflation appearing to be broadly balanced.

  - The downside risks to the inflation outlook include concerns over the strength of the
global economy and their implication on the pace of economic activity and commodity
prices. At the same time, the broadly stable peso could help temper the prices of
imported commodities. Meanwhile, there are also upside risks to inflation. These
include the impact of geopolitical tensions on oil prices, strong capital inflows and
additional petitions for electricity rate adjustments.

**D.  Demand conditions**

  - The Philippine economy grew at a modest pace of 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter,
bringing the annual growth to 3.7 percent for 2011. Full‐year GDP growth was below
the government’s growth assumption of 4.5‐5.5 percent.

  - The MB noted that private consumption continued to advance strongly despite strong
external headwinds and below‐program public spending. Nevertheless, national
accounts data in the fourth quarter showed economic growth remaining below trend.

**E.  Supply‐side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - Agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing (AHFF) expanded in 2011, a turnaround from
the contraction in the previous year. Considerable crop output gains during the first half
of the year more than offset the losses from the string of typhoons in the second half.

  - Meanwhile, the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS) projects palay and corn
production to grow slightly in the first semester of 2012. This can be attributed to
higher harvest area and yield, particularly in Cagayan Valley, Bicol, Caraga and ARMM,
with the expected favorable wet weather conditions brought by the La Niña episode.

Oil Price Developments

  - Oil prices continued their uptrend in February following the approval of a second
international bailout package for Greece, signs of growth in China, and lower
unemployment in the US, which boosted market expectations of improved fuel demand
in the future. Iran’s halting of oil shipments to some countries in Europe, which fueled
concerns about oil supply disruptions, also pushed oil prices higher.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

  - Electricity rates of Manila Electric Co. (Meralco) inched up in February driven mainly by
higher power supply prices from the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market. The National
Power Corporation’s (NPC) rates also went up on account of the shift to more expensive
dry‐season rates.

**F. Financial market developments**

  - At the 20 February 2012 auction, T‐bill rates rose across the board relative to the rates
fetched during the 6 February 2012 auction, as the government sought to align the
auction interest rates with the rates in the secondary market. Total tenders reached
P14.6 billion or less than twice the original offered amount of P9.0 billion, reflecting
weak demand for T‐bills as investors’ appetite remained at the longer end of the yield
curve. The low volume of tenders was also attributed to investors’ anticipation of the
Retail Treasury Bond (RTB) offering for the period 21‐29 February 2012.

  - The PSEi continued to rally in February on the back of an upbeat outlook on local
corporate earnings and expectations of a sovereign credit rating upgrade for the
Philippines by S&P. Meanwhile, the peso’s depreciating trend reversed on account of
continued foreign exchange inflows from OF remittances, foreign portfolio investment
and foreign direct investments. However, uncertainty arising from the Iran nuclear
tensions also continued to weigh down on the peso.

  - Debt spreads tightened significantly in February as positive developments in major
global markets buoyed demand for emerging market assets. The approval of Greece’s
second bailout package prompted spreads to tighten to their lowest levels for the year.

Improving economic data from the US and the cut in China’s reserve requirement also
pushed spreads to narrow during the period. However, the narrowing trend was
tempered by persistent concerns over the sustainability of the Greece bailout package
combined with sovereign downgrades in selected European countries by Fitch and
Moody’s, and the rising geo‐political tensions in Iran and Syria.

**G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions**

    - Domestic liquidity or M3 grew at a slower pace of 6.3 percent in December 2011 from
7.2 percent in November 2011 to reach P4.7 trillion as net foreign assets (NFA) growth
slowed down. While domestic credit growth remained strong on account of higher
National Government, corporate and household borrowings, the BSP’s SDA operations
moderated liquidity growth.

    - Bank lending growth, net of banks’ RRP placements with the BSP, eased in December to
19.3 percent from the previous month’s expansion of 22.5 percent as the growth of
loans for production activities and consumer loans decelerated.

    - Corporate issuers continue to tap the equity and bond markets. Capital‐raising activities
in the Philippine Stock Exchange reached P109 billion in 2011, higher by 28 percent
from the 2010 level of P85 billion. However, corporate bond issuances for the same
period amounted to only P181 billion, lower by 13 percent compared to the 2010 level
of P208 billion.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

    - The fiscal deficit in January‐November 2011 was P96.3 billion, 64.3 percent lower than
the P269.8 billion deficit incurred during the same period in 2010. The lower deficit
figure is attributed to increased revenue collections (13.1 percent year‐on‐year)
coupled with lower government spending (‐2.1 percent year‐on‐year).

    - The Department of Budget and Management has already released 72 percent of the
P1 trillion national budget in January. The early release was aimed to jump‐start most
of the programmed infrastructure projects. Of the P208‐billion budget allocated for
capital outlays, 72 percent has been released for various infrastructure projects.

**I.  External developments**

   - The overall balance of global economic activity remains tilted to the downside, with
uncertainty still elevated. While there have been encouraging signs from the US, the
European economy remains subject to persistent strains from the interlocking
sovereign debt and banking crises. The euro area is expected to experience a mild
recession in 2012 and possible spillovers via trade and financial channels will likely
constrain the growth of advanced economies and their trading partners. In China,
recent indicators also suggest weak real sector momentum, especially in the
manufacturing sector, although partly policy‐driven.
