**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON THE MONETARY POLICY**

**STANCE HELD ON 17 DECEMBER 2020[1]**


**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Maintain the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate at 2.00 percent; and

b) Maintain accordingly the current levels of overnight deposit and overnight lending rates

at 1.50 percent and 2.50 percent, respectively.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

  - The Monetary Board’s decision was based on its assessment that the inflation outlook remained
benign. The latest baseline forecasts have risen slightly due to the sharp increase in global crude
oil prices and the higher-than-expected food inflation in November. However, since the rise in
food prices is transitory, it is expected that the future inflation path will remain firmly within the
Government’s 2-4 percent target over the policy horizon. The balance of risks to the inflation
outlook also leans toward the downside from 2020 until 2022 owing largely to potential
disruptions to domestic and global economic activity amid the ongoing pandemic. Meanwhile,
inflation expectations remained broadly consistent with the inflation target.

  - The Monetary Board noted that the resurgence of COVID-19 cases globally has tempered
economic activity with the re-imposition of preventive measures in recent weeks. However,
optimism over the delivery of vaccines has lifted market confidence, supporting improved
prospects for global growth. On the domestic front, the Monetary Board also observed early
indications of improved mobility and sentiment. While recent natural calamities could pose
strong headwinds to growth, the further easing of quarantine measures should help facilitate
the recovery of the economy in the coming months.

  - Given these considerations, the Monetary Board was of the view that monetary policy settings

remained appropriate. The Monetary Board believed that an accommodative monetary policy
stance, together with sustained fiscal initiatives to ensure public welfare, should quicken the
economy’s transition toward a sustainable recovery.

**III.** **Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook**

The MB considered the following developments in deciding on the monetary policy stance:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Year-on-year headline inflation further increased to 3.3 percent in November from 2.5 percent
in the previous month. This brought the year-to-date average inflation to 2.6 percent, which
remained within the government’s 2-4 percent target range. The higher November inflation was
due largely to faster price gains of food items as weather-related disruptions from recent
typhoons severely affected domestic supply. At the same time, supply shortages induced by the
African Swine Fever continued to affect retail prices of pork. By contrast, non-food inflation
eased as most commodities under non-food decelerated, while inflation for recreation and
culture remained negative given the rollback in lotto ticket prices last August 2020.

  - Official core inflation, which excludes selected volatile food and energy items to measure
underlying price pressures, increased to 3.2 percent year-on-year in November from 3.0 percent
in the previous month.

**B.  Inflation expectations**

  - The latest results of the BSP’s survey of private sector analysts showed higher mean inflation
forecasts for 2020 to 2022. The survey for December 2020 posted higher mean inflation forecast
for 2020 to 2.6 percent from 2.4 percent based on the November 2020 survey. Similarly, mean
inflation forecasts for 2021 and 2022 rose to 2.9 percent (from 2.7 percent) and 3.0 percent
(from 2.9 percent), respectively.

**C.  Inflation outlook**

  - The latest baseline forecasts continued to suggest a benign inflation environment over the
policy horizon. Inflation is expected to average at 2.6 percent for 2020, 3.2 percent for 2021,
and 2.9 percent for 2022. The forecast revisions for 2020-2021 were due largely to the
higher-than-expected inflation outturn in November 2020 and the sharp uptick in global crude
oil prices. Meanwhile, the forecast for 2022 was broadly unchanged compared to the previous
round due primarily to base effects.

**Baseline Inflation Forecasts**

**Forecast as of** **Forecast as of**

**19 November 2020** **17 December 2020**

2020 2.4 2.6

2021 2.7 3.2

2022 2.9 2.9

  - The overall balance of risks to the inflation outlook remained tilted to the downside for 2020
to 2022. The potential impact of a more disruptive pandemic on global and domestic economic
growth prospects was the primary downside risk to inflation. Meanwhile, adjustments in utility
rates were the main upside risks to inflation.

|Baseline Inflation Forecasts|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
||Forecast as of 19 November 2020|Forecast as of 17 December 2020|
|2020|2.4|2.6|
|2021|2.7|3.2|
|2022|2.9|2.9|

**D. Demand conditions**

  - Domestic economic activity is projected to contract at a slower pace in the last quarter of 2020
before recovering in 2021 and 2022. The decline in GDP is seen to be driven primarily by further
deterioration in the industry and services sectors, which remained heavily affected by the
pandemic despite the easing in quarantine measures. In particular, the projected weakness in
manufacturing and construction activities is expected to drive the decline in the industry sector,
albeit at a slower pace compared to Q3 2020. Similarly, the services sector could continue to
contract as a result of the slowdown in transport, tourism, and other services. Meanwhile, the
agriculture sector is projected to contract in Q4 2020 due to the impact of weather disturbances
on production.

  - Forward-looking indicators for manufacturing production suggest slight improvement in
business operations but remained below expansion threshold. The preliminary composite PMI
in November remained below the 50-point expansion threshold at 46.8, marginally lower by
0.4 index point than the October PMI of 47.2. Despite the slower contraction of the
manufacturing index, the composite PMI dipped anew as the services and retail and wholesale
sectors decelerated faster in November. The manufacturing sector’s better performance was
due mainly to the gradual easing of lockdown measures. Respondent-firms were optimistic that
the business environment will improve in December.

  - As quarantine measures in NCR and surrounding provinces have eased, mobility activity has also
been gradually rising closer to pre-COVID baseline figures in locations such as grocery and
pharmacy, parks, and retail and recreation. As a result, mobility numbers under residential have
been declining, implying that people are staying less at home. Meanwhile, transit stations
remained subdued amid limited public transportation options despite easing containment
measures in the country.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - Domestic retail rice prices remained stable, owing to ample supply of the grain, and moved
closer to international prices as envisioned with the enactment of R.A. No. 11203.

  - Meanwhile, tropical cyclones (TCs) made landfall in parts of the country and caused damage to
the agriculture sector. As of 27 November 2020, the Department of Agriculture recorded total
damage and losses of ₱15.3 billion brought about by TCs Nika, Ofel, Pepito, Quinta, Rolly, Siony,
and Ulysses. Among the commodities affected, rice recorded the most damage and losses with
estimated value of ₱5.4 billion, followed by high value crops at ₱4.8 billion.

  - According to the latest climate advisory of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and
Astronomical Services Administration, moderate to strong La Niña is expected to continue until
April 2021, which is anticipated to adversely affect vulnerable areas and sectors of the country
since a La Niña event is associated with above normal rainfall condition.

Oil Price Developments

  - International oil prices increased in the first week of December 2020 compared to the full-month
average in November, driven by market optimism over successive announcements of an
effective COVID-19 vaccine and expectations of lower supply from the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Economies and its partners (OPEC+). In the domestic front, prices of
petroleum products continue to post a net decline compared to end-2019.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

  - The overall electricity rate decreased in November 2020 due to lower power generation charges.
This may be attributed to improved supply conditions in the Luzon grid given lower electricity
demand due to weather disturbances and less generation capacity on outage. Consequently,
the cost of power from the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market declined. Similarly, purchases from
Independent Power Producers edged lower as a result of lower Malampaya natural gas prices
due to its quarterly repricing and the slight appreciation of the peso against the US dollar.
Meanwhile, charges from Power Supply Agreements increased due to the forced outage of
San Gabriel.

**F. Financial market developments**

  - For the first week of December 2020, the peso appreciated against the US dollar amid market
optimism over news of progress in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 as well
as the release of lower-than-expected Philippine unemployment data for October 2020.
The seasonal increase in overseas Filipino remittances amid the holiday season likewise
supported the peso.

**G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions**

  - Domestic liquidity growth slowed in October. Preliminary data showed that domestic liquidity
(M3) expanded by 11.8 percent year-on-year to about ₱13.5 trillion in October. This was
slower than the 12.2-percent (revised) growth in September. Likewise, bank lending eased to
1.9 percent in October from 2.6 percent (revised) in the previous month. The overall slowdown
in bank lending growth reflected the combined effects of muted business confidence and banks’
stricter loan standards attributed mainly to continued disruptions in business operations.

  - Liquidity in the financial system remained ample as a result of the BSP’s extraordinary
liquidity-enhancing measures. The increased liquidity in the financial system is reflected in the
continued oversubscriptions in the T-bill and T-bond auctions by the Bureau of the Treasury
in November and December 2020, which have resulted in full awards on the back of
strong demand for government securities amid manageable inflation expectations. Similar
oversubscriptions have been observed in TDF, RRP, and the BSP bills auctions, while transactions
in the interbank market and overnight lending facility of the BSP have diminished significantly.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

  - The National Government recorded a ₱940.6 billion fiscal deficit for the first ten months of 2020.
Netting out the interest payments in NG expenditures, the primary deficit amounted to
₱605.5 billion, from the ₱33.8 billion primary deficit recorded in the previous year.

**I.  External developments**

  - Global economic activity continued to expand, reflecting the sustained improvement in demand
conditions. However, overall economic activity in the euro area returned to contraction amid
the re-imposition of mobility restrictions to stem the resurgence of COVID-19 infections.
The JP Morgan Global All-Industry Output Index eased slightly to 53.1 in November from 53.3 in
October as global service sector business activity expanded at a slower rate. Five out of the
six sub-sectors covered by the survey registered output expansions during the month, with
growth acceleration in the consumer goods and investment goods categories. All-industry
output grew in the US, China, Germany, India, Brazil, and Australia. Contractions were seen in
Japan, France, the UK, Italy, Spain, Russia, and Ireland.

  - Meanwhile, manufacturing conditions in the ASEAN region stabilized. The Nikkei ASEAN
Manufacturing PMI rose to the neutral 50.0-threshold in November due to expansion in factory
production and a renewed increase in new orders. Across the seven monitored countries,
Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia showed improvements in manufacturing operations during
the month, while Myanmar and Malaysia continued to contract. Manufacturing conditions were
broadly steady in the Philippines and in Vietnam.
