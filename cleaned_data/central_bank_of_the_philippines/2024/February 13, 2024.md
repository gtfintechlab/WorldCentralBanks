**_HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON THE_**

**_MONETARY POLICY STANCE HELD ON 14 FEBRUARY 2024 [1]_**

**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Maintain the current policy interest rate at 6.50 percent for the Target

RRP Rate; and

b) Maintain the current interest rates on the overnight deposit facility at

6.00 percent and overnight lending facility at 7.00 percent.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

       - Based on new information and its latest assessment of the impact of prior

monetary policy adjustments, the Monetary Board decided to maintain
the current monetary policy settings of the BSP. The Monetary Board
deemed it appropriate to keep the BSP’s monetary policy settings
unchanged in the near term amid the improvement in inflation conditions
while taking into consideration the prevailing risks to the inflation outlook.

       - The Monetary Board noted that the outlook for inflation was broadly

unchanged. The latest risk-adjusted inflation forecast for 2024 eased to 3.9
percent from 4.2 percent in the previous meeting in December. For 2025,
the risk-adjusted inflation forecast is relatively steady at 3.5 percent from
3.4 percent. Equally important, the BSP’s latest survey of external
forecasters shows inflation expectations to be more firmly anchored, with
mean forecasts remaining within the target range for both 2024 and 2025.

       - Meanwhile, the risks to the inflation outlook have receded but remain

tilted toward the upside. The upside risks to the inflation forecasts are
linked mainly to higher transport charges, increased electricity rates,
higher oil and domestic food prices, and the additional impact on food
prices of a strong El Niño episode. On the other hand, the implementation
of government measures to mitigate the impact of El Niño weather
conditions is the primary downside risk to the outlook.

       - Given the salience of rice prices to domestic inflation, the Monetary Board

viewed the NG’s recent agreement with Vietnam to secure rice supply over
the next five years to be favorable. Moreover, the NG’s efforts to increase

information available at the time of the monetary policy meeting. The next meeting of the Monetary Board on the


-----

productivity in the rice sector, including the distribution of droughtresistant seeds, are seen as a step in the right direction.

  - On domestic economic activity, the Monetary Board noted the sustained

expansion in output in Q4 2023 which reaffirmed the BSP’s view that the
country’s growth momentum remains intact over the medium term.
However, recent indicators also suggested that economic activity could
moderate in the near term as the full impact of the BSP’s prior monetary
policy tightening continues to manifest.

  - In consideration of the prevailing risks, the Monetary Board deems it

appropriate to keep the BSP’s monetary policy settings unchanged in the
near term amid the improvement in inflation conditions. The BSP also
continues to support the National Government’s non-monetary measures
to address supply-side pressures on prices and sustain the disinflation
process. The Monetary Board stands ready to adjust monetary policy
settings as necessary in keeping with its primary mandate to safeguard
price stability.

**III.** **Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook**

In assessing the monetary policy stance, the Monetary Board considered

the latest macroeconomic and financial developments as discussed below:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Headline inflation slowed further to 2.8 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in

January 2024 from 3.9 percent in December 2023. The downtrend in
overall inflation was due mainly to the slower price increases in most food
commodities. However, rice inflation increased further to 22.6 percent in
January 2024 (from 19.6 percent in December 2023) due mainly to higher
import prices and the El Niño impact on global and regional output. Nonfood inflation also decelerated because of slower price increases of
housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels particularly, rent and power
rates. Transport inflation also declined due to lower gasoline and diesel
prices, along with easing inflation for sea fares. In addition, the official core
inflation further slowed down to 3.8 percent in January 2024 from 4.4
percent in December 2023. Likewise, alternative measures of core inflation
including trimmed mean and weighted median further moderated in
January 2024.

**B.  Inflation expectations**

  - Results of the BSP’s survey of external forecasters for February 2024

showed unchanged mean inflation forecast for 2024 at 3.9 percent as well
as for 2026 at 3.4 percent relative to the forecasts in the January 2024
survey round. By contrast, the mean inflation forecast for 2025 rose to 3.5
percent from 3.4 percent. Analysts expected inflation to remain
manageable in 2024 and settle within the target range However analysts


-----

also anticipate that the risks to the inflation outlook will continue to be
dominated by upside pressures owing to supply-side shocks and secondround effects.

**C.  Inflation outlook**

- The risks to the inflation outlook continue to be primarily skewed to the

upside for 2024 to 2025, even as the risk-adjusted forecasts are now within
the BSP’s inflation target range. The upside risks to the inflation outlook
could emanate from increased electricity rates; higher transport charges;
higher global oil prices; higher prices of food commodities facing supply
constraints; and higher rice prices owing to stronger El Niño and further
weather disturbances as well as higher global prices. Meanwhile,
successful implementation of government measures to mitigate the
impact of El Niño weather conditions is the primary downside risk to the
outlook.

- The latest staff risk-adjusted inflation forecast is estimated at 3.9 percent

for 2024 (from 4.2 percent in the previous forecast round) and 3.5 percent
in 2025 (from 3.4 percent). The downward revision in the risk-adjusted
forecast for 2024 is attributed primarily to the decline in the estimated risks
along with the decrease in the baseline forecast for the year. The lower
estimated impact of risks emanated from the removal of the impact of
higher transport fares from the jeepney modernization; the lower
probability of fare hikes for traditional jeepneys; the lower impact of higher
global oil prices; and the removal of the risk from the non-extension of
Executive Order (E.O.) No. 10. Meanwhile, the risk-adjusted forecast for
2025 is higher due mainly to the shift in the assumed implementation of
higher electricity rates.

**D. Demand conditions**

- The Philippine economy grew by 5.6 percent year-on-year in Q4 2023,

slower than the 6.0 percent growth posted in the previous quarter and 7.1percent growth in the same period a year ago. This brought the full year
2023 real GDP growth to 5.6 percent, which is below the government
target of 6.0 to 7.0 percent GDP growth for the year. On a seasonally
adjusted basis, quarter-on-quarter GDP growth slowed down to 2.1 percent
in Q4 2023 from 3.8 percent in the previous quarter. GDP growth in Q4 2023
was mainly driven by strong household spending and investments but was
tempered by slower government spending and weak external trade.

- The country’s output growth prospects for 2024 and 2025 remain intact

despite global headwinds and tighter financial conditions. Philippine GDP
growth estimates by the BSP for 2024 and 2025 have been adjusted
upwards from the previous forecast round due to the improved outlook in
global economic activity and the decline in crude oil prices which offset
the lower-than-expected GDP outturn in Q4 2023. However, domestic
economic activity is seen to decelerate in the second semester of 2024,
reflecting the impact of policy rate hikes before picking up again in 2025

**E. Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

- Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing (AFF) posted a growth of 1.4 percent in

Q4 2023, faster than the 0.9-percent growth in Q3 2023, and a reversal of
the 0.3 percent contraction in Q4 2022.68. Cumulative growth of the AFF
sector was recorded at 1.2 percent for 2023, higher than the 2022 outturn
of 0.5 percent. Higher AFF output in Q4 2023 was attributed mainly to the
positive contribution of poultry, egg, livestock, other animal production,
sugarcane, and support activities to AFF, which more than compensated
for the lower output in fishing and aquaculture, corn, coconut, rubber,
cassava, and other agricultural crops production.

- Nationwide average retail rice prices continued to increase in January 2024

after falling during the start of the peak harvest season in October 2023.
Rice prices further increased in January as import prices remained high
due to rice export bans and worries over potential impact of El Niño on
global and regional output.

- Based on the assessment of weather conditions by the US Climate

Prediction Center and International Research Institute for Climate and
Society (CPC/IRI) as of 11 January 2024, prevailing El Niño conditions will
likely continue in the coming months before transitioning to El Niño
Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-neutral by April to June 2024. Similarly,
according to PAGASA’s climate outlook as of 24 January 2024,79F  a strong and
mature El Niño is present and is expected to gradually weaken in the
coming months. In addition, most climate models predict that the current
El Niño episode will likely persist until the March-April-May 2024 season.
Nonetheless, El Niño increases the likelihood of way-below to belownormal rainfall conditions which could occur within the first semester of
2024.

Oil Price Developments

- The spot price of Dubai crude oil slightly increased in the first week of

February 2024 compared to the full-month average price in January 2024.
The rise in world oil prices was driven primarily by fears of possible supply
disruptions due to the on-going geopolitical tensions in the Middle East;
the continued disputes in the Red Sea; and Ukraine’s attacks on Russian
oil facilities. The uptick in oil prices was partly tempered by possible
ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. On the demand side, the worsening
real estate situation in China as well as the continued contraction in
Chinese manufacturing activity in January 2024, and high global interest
rate environment, also counterbalanced the increase in oil prices.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

- Retail electricity rates went up in February 2024 relative to January 2024

rates, reflecting increased generation charges due to higher power costs
from Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and Power Supply Agreements
(PSAs). Charges from IPPs rose due to higher fuel costs resulting from the
increased use of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), which was more
expensive than Malampaya gas. Charges from PSAs also increased due to
higher costs from Emergency Power Supply Agreements (EPSAs).
Furthermore, the depreciation of the peso also contributed to higher
charges from IPPs and PSAs.

**F.  Financial market developments**

- The peso depreciated by 0.13 percent to an average of ₱56.09/US$1 for the

period 1-12 February 2024 relative to the previous month’s average. The
weakening of the peso partly reflected US dollar strength amid
expectations of delay in the US Fed’s policy easing as well as lingering
geopolitical tensions in Gaza and the Middle East. On the domestic front,
dampened market sentiment amid elevated inflation outlook in Q2 2024,
and lower Gross International Reserves (GIR) in January contributed to the
depreciation of the peso. Nonetheless, these factors were partly offset by
the following positive domestic developments: i) stronger-than-expected
Q4 and full-year 2023 GDP growth; ii) hawkish statement from the central
bank; iii) sustained growth in the country’s manufacturing activity in
January; iv) lower government debt-to-GDP ratio in 2023; and v) stronger
net FDI inflows in November 2023.

- On a year-to-date basis, the peso closed at ₱56.01/US$1 on 12 February 2024,

depreciating by 1.13 percent against the US dollar from the end-December
2023 closing rate of ₱55.37/US$.

**G. Liquidity and credit conditions**

- Preliminary data showed that outstanding loans of universal and

commercial banks, net of RRP placements with the BSP increased by 7.0
percent y-o-y in December, the same rate of increase as in November.
Bank lending activity has continued to grow at a single-digit rate,
reflecting the impact of the BSP’s tight monetary policy. Nonetheless,
banks anticipate sustained demand for credit from both corporate and
household sectors in the near term.

**H. Fiscal developments**

- National Government (NG) spending, which amounted to about P4.7

trillion in January-November 2023, increased to 89.4 percent of the fullyear (FY) 2023 expenditure program from 81.1 percent share in JanuaryOctober 2023. NG spending also expanded by 3.6 percent y-o-y in JanuaryNovember 2023 buoyed by the higher NG disbursements for


-----

infrastructure and other capital outlays (IOCO); personnel services (PS);
maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE); and interest
payments. Meanwhile, other expenditure items declined.

  - As revenue growth outpaced the percentage increase in expenditures, the

P1.1-trillion NG deficit in January-November 2023 is 10.1 percent narrower
than the deficit in the same period in 2022 and is 74.1 percent of the FY
2023 deficit program. Netting out the interest payments in NG
expenditures, the primary deficit amounted to P543.5 billion, 30.0 percent
lower than the deficit recorded in 2022.

**I.  External developments**

  - Prospects for global economic growth improved as downside risks to

economic activity recede. In the January 2024 World Economic Outlook
(WEO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised its 2024 global
economic growth projection to 3.1 percent, reflecting the greater-thanexpected resilience in the US and several large emerging market and
developing economies (EMDEs), as well as fiscal support in China.
Nonetheless, global economic expansion is expected to remain well below
the annual average of 3.8 percent until at least 2025 with elevated central
bank policy rates to fight inflation, a withdrawal of fiscal support and high
debt weighing on economic activity, as well as low underlying productivity
growth. With the likelihood of a hard landing receding as adverse supply
shocks unwind, the risks to the global outlook are broadly balanced.
