**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 5 JUNE 2008***


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board:

� Adjust the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Raise the BSP’s policy interest rates by 25 basis points to 5.25
percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 7.25
percent for the overnight RP (lending) rate;

(b) Adjust accordingly the current interest rates on term RRPs,
RPs and SDAs; and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The recommendation to tighten monetary policy settings was based
on the following assessments:

(a) Tighter monetary policy would help anchor inflation
expectations (including wage demands) and stop higher
commodity prices from spreading into the wider economy;

(b) Indications of second-round effects and higher inflation
expectations also support the need for a measured increase in
policy rates; and

(c) The buoyancy of domestic demand suggests that there is
some room for a measured policy response to second-round
effects.

The Monetary Board then proceeded to review the recent
developments and the key considerations in the formulation of the BSP’s
monetary policy stance.

- The discussion presented herein reflects the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the
information available at the time of the policy meeting. The highlights of the discussions of the 5 June 2008
meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular meeting held on 17 June 2008.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely: the Deputy Governor for the Monetary Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor for Supervision and
Examination Sector, the Managing Director of the Treasury Department, and the Managing Director of the
Monetary Policy Sub-sector.

**Review of Recent Developments**

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Headline inflation rose to 8.3 percent year-on-year in April from 6.4
percent in March, bringing the year-to-date average to 6.2 percent.

[Headline inflation rose to 9.6 percent year-on-year in May—the
highest in more than nine years—from 8.3 percent in April and 2.4
percent a year ago, bringing the year-to-date average to 6.9 percent].

  - Core inflation, which measures the underlying trend in inflation by
excluding specific food and energy items, was similarly higher in April.
The official core inflation measure published by the National Statistics
Office (NSO) increased to 5.9 percent in April from 4.8 percent in
March. [Core inflation accelerated to 6.2 percent year-on-year in May
from 5.9 percent in April].

**B. Demand conditions**

  - Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at a slower rate of 5.2 percent in
Q1 2008 compared to the growth posted in the previous quarter and
the comparable period last year. GDP growth was boosted by
household spending and capital investments on the expenditure side,
and by the services sector from the production side.

  - For Q1 2008, the business cycle path remained broadly steady,
indicating a continuing expansion phase.

  - Monthly National Statistics Office (NSO) data reflected a 12.2 percent
growth in merchandise imports for March 2008. Meanwhile, exports
declined by 6.8 percent year-on-year in March.

  - Selected demand indicators of demand indicated a broad
strengthening trend.

� Land values in the Makati Central Business District (CBD) and
Ortigas Center rose in Q4 2007 and reached about 70 percent of
the 1997 levels. In real terms however, land values only increased
slightly in Q4 2007 and remained at about 30-40 percent of the
peak levels in 1996.

� Passenger car sales declined by 6.5 percent year-on-year in
March, compared to the 34.9 percent growth registered in the
same period last year and 11.4 percent in February. Year-to-date
sales growth decelerated to 7.8 percent in the first quarter of 2008
from the 9.9 percent growth in the comparable period last year.

**Review of Recent Developments**


-----

� Meanwhile, commercial vehicle sales continued to grow although
at a slower rate of 11.4 percent year-on-year in March, compared
to the year-ago level of 14.9 percent and the month-ago level of
11.9 percent. Likewise, on a year-to-date basis, the growth of
commercial vehicle sales slowed down to 12.2 percent, lower than
the 23.4 percent registered in the comparable period last year.

� On a year-on-year basis, sales of trucks and buses increased by
12.9 percent in February 2008, lower than the 66.0 percent
recorded in February 2007 but a reversal of the 21.7 percent
contraction in January 2008. Year-to-date sales growth
decelerated to 7.8 percent in the first quarter of 2008 from the 9.9
percent growth in the comparable period last year.

� Year-on-year energy sales of Meralco contracted by 3.7 percent in
March, a reversal of the year- and month-ago growth of 5.1
percent and 6.0 percent, respectively. As a result, year-to-date
energy sales grew at a slower rate of 2.1 percent in March,
compared to the 3.7 percent growth registered in the same period
last year.

� Based on revised data, appliance sales continued to grow
although at a slower rate of 11.5 percent year-on-year in March,
compared to the year-ago growth of 24.3 percent. However, this
was higher than the 8.3 percent growth registered a month ago.
Meanwhile, year-to-date appliance sales increased by 12.0
percent, but at a lower pace compared to the 13.5 percent
increase recorded in the same period last year.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing was relatively steady
for the eighth consecutive month at 80.2 percent in March 2008,
based on the rates reported in NSO’s Monthly Integrated Survey of
Selected Industries (MISSI).

� The value of production index (VAPI) decreased by 5.0 percent
year-on-year in March 2008, reversing the 7.4 percent (revised)
increase in the previous month. The volume of production index
(VOPI) also dropped by 5.9 percent year-on-year in March,
reversing the 6.3 percent (revised) increase in February.

- Q2 BES results show business sentiment has remained positive but
has turned more cautious. The index was lower by 17.3 index points
and 33.8 index points compared to the levels in the previous quarter
and a year ago, respectively.

- Preliminary Q2 2008 CES results showed a decline in consumer
confidence. The nationwide overall consumer outlook index (CI) for

the second quarter of 2008 decreased to -43.8 percent, down by 11.7
index points quarter-on-quarter and by 17.8 index points year-on-year.

  - Based on the preliminary results of the January 2008 Labor Force
Survey (LFS), the unemployment rate declined to 7.4 percent in
January 2008 from 7.8 percent in January 2007.

  - The salaries of government employees will increase by 10 percent
effective July 2008. The National Wages and Productivity Commission
(NWPC) recently approved minimum wage and COLA adjustments in
NCR, Region IV-A, Region VIII, and Region X. Meanwhile, the
proposal for the P125 daily wage hike for private sector employees
and the Salary Standardization Law (SSL) III for government workers
remain pending in Congress.

**C. Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - Agriculture expanded in Q1 2008 buoyed by production increases in
the crops, poultry, and fishery subsectors.

  - Retail prices of commercial rice in Metro Manila were steady while
price increases were slower during May in areas outside Metro
Manila.

  - Data from NFA as of 16 May indicate that the country's total rice
inventory stood at 2.2 MMT, higher than the previous month's and
previous year’s level of 1.9 MMT. In terms of rice sufficiency, the
latest inventory level is sufficient to last 68 days based on the average
daily rice requirement of 33 thousand MT.

  - Meanwhile, prices of beef products were generally unchanged and the
prices of poultry products sustained their downward trend in April
given sufficient supply in the market.

  - International prices for rice and maize continued their rise in April,
largely driven by persistent supply tightness and the imposition of new
export restrictions. Rice prices sustained increases in May.

Oil Price Developments

  - International spot and futures prices of oil were higher in May due to
OPEC’s reluctance to increase its production and supply disruptions.
In the domestic scene, the oil import tariff will be reduced to zero in
June. Meanwhile, pump prices of most petroleum products increased
anew on 31 May.

the second quarter of 2008 decreased to -43.8 percent, down by 11.7
index points quarter-on-quarter and by 17.8 index points year-on-year.

  - In the transport sector, provisional increases for jeepney and bus
fares were implemented on 21 May. The minimum fare for jeepneys
nationwide increased by P0.50 and the fare for regular and airconditioned buses in Metro Manila by P1.00 and P1.50, respectively.
For provincial buses, there will be an increase of P0.50 in the
minimum fare for regular buses and an additional of P0.10 for every
succeeding kilometer while air-conditioned buses were allowed to
charge P0.25 more for every kilometer.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

  - Electricity rates in Metro Manila were raised anew in April as Meralco
adjusted its generation, transmission, and system-loss charges.

  - The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System-Regulatory
Office (MWSS-RO) earlier approved the reduction in water rates
through the foreign currency differential adjustments (FCDA) for Q2
2008.

**D. Financial Market Developments**

  - Inflation fears, risk aversion, and economic uncertainty in the US and
global economies continued to drive stock market sentiments, while
the peso depreciated in April relative to the previous month.

Interest Rates

  - During the 26 May 2008 auction, the Auction Committee made a
P1.62 billion partial award of 364-day T-bills at an average rate of
6.846 percent, 6.9 basis points lower than the rate at the previous
auction (12 May).

  - Relative to their 30 April levels, terms spreads (secondary market
yields of GS net of reverse repurchase or RRPs) generally increased
across all tenors on 27 May. The spread of the yield curve shifted
upward as investors remained cautious on continued concerns over
global and domestic inflationary pressures.

Stock Market

  - The uptick in domestic inflation, economic uncertainty in the US and
global economies, and lack of positive news continued to dampen
market sentiments that resulted in four consecutive months of decline
in the PSEi from 3,266.0 index points in January to a new low of
2,749.8 index points in April. In May, trading started weak as investors
stayed cautious. In the second week of May, the market gained
momentum as the PSEi showed a sustained uptrend from 2,727.70
index points on 6 May to 2,896.15 index points on 20 May.

Foreign Exchange

  - The peso depreciated by 1.2 percent to average P41.84/US$1 in April
relative to the previous month. Risk aversion continued in April as
investors avoided assets in emerging markets in anticipation of further
global financial turbulence amid widening losses triggered by the
property downturn in the US.

  - On a year-to-date basis, the peso depreciated by 5.6 percent to close
at P43.82/US$1 on 30 May 2008. The depreciation of the peso was in
line with the movements of the Indian rupee, Thai baht, and Korean
won which depreciated by 7.3 percent, 7.5 percent and 9.1 percent,
respectively, vis-à-vis the US dollar relative to their end-2007 closing
levels.

Global Bond and Credit Default Spreads

  - Debt spreads eased in May as global oil prices retreated from their
peak of over US$135 a barrel on 22 May. Emerging debt spreads over
US Treasury notes [Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI)+ Global]
tightened to 255 basis points on 27 May from 264 basis points posted
in end-April. During the same period, EMBI+ Philippine spreads
tracked the same trend as it slightly eased to 224 basis points from
228 basis points.

  - On the domestic front, Philippine credit default swap (CDS) spreads
widened to 223 basis points on 27 May from end-April’s 195 basis
points.

**E. Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

  - Based on data generated from the new system of bank reporting,
domestic liquidity or M3 grew by 9.6 percent year-on-year in March,
up from 6.6 percent in February. The expansion in domestic liquidity
continued to be driven by the increase in net foreign assets (NFA),
particularly those of the BSP, as banks registered a reduction in their
NFA.

  - Based on preliminary data from the new system of bank reporting,
outstanding loans of commercial banks (including reverse repurchase
agreements or RRPs) rose further in March, posting a growth of 10.6
percent year-on-year. This was higher than the 5.7 percent growth
posted in February. Bank lending—net of banks’ RRP placements with
the BSP—increased by 15.7 percent year-on-year in March.

  - Consumer credit increased by 15.9 percent year-on-year in Q4 2007
but this was lower than the 21.1 percent growth recorded in Q4 2006
and the 20.9 percent growth registered in Q3 2007.

  - Capital-raising activities in the PSE were weak in the period JanuaryApril 2008. Meanwhile, corporate bond issuances rose slightly during
the first four months of 2008 relative to the comparable period in the
previous year.

**F. Fiscal developments**

  - The National Government (NG) registered a fiscal surplus in April
amounting to P25.8 billion, more than twice the surplus in the
comparable period last year. This brought the fiscal deficit for JanuaryApril to P25.8 billion, lower by one-third relative to last year’s deficit for
the same period. For the first four months, revenue collections grew
by 11.0 percent to P375.5 billion compared to P338.5 billion for the
same period last year.

  - The full-year public sector external debt-to-GDP ratio in 2007 was
26.1 percent of GDP, lower by 5.4 percentage points compared to
31.5 percent in 2006.  This can be attributed to the increase in GDP
to US$144.1 billion for 2007 from US$117.6 billion in 2007. This
offsets the increase in the stock of public sector external debt which
rose to US$37.7 billion from US$37.1 billion in 2006.

**G. External developments**

  - The weakness in US economic activity and the volatility in financial
markets are causing global expansion to lose speed. Emerging market
economies, however, have so far been less affected by the financial
market turbulence and have continued to grow at a rapid pace—
particularly China and India—although economic activity is beginning
to moderate in other Asian economies.

  - Meanwhile, headline inflation has increased around the world,
reflecting the greater weight of energy and food in consumption
baskets. The risks to the outlook for inflation have intensified and the
concern is that persistent inflation in emerging economies may require
tightening of monetary policies going forward.

  - Against the background of financial market volatility and a possible
protracted slowdown in the US economy, an extended period of
slower growth is expected in the near term as the rest of the world
may not be able to decouple from the US despite the strong
fundamentals of emerging market economies.

  - The Fed eased monetary policy settings while most central banks
remained on hold. The Fed reduced its target for the federal funds rate
by 25 basis points to 2.0 percent. Meanwhile, the central banks of the
Euro area, Japan, and England maintained policy settings on growing
concerns on rising inflation.

  - In Asia and the Pacific, Indonesia, China, and Taiwan raised their
policy rates during their latest policy meetings, whereas New Zealand,
Australia, India, South Korea, Thailand, and Malaysia maintained their
monetary policy stance.

**II. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

  - In its assessment, the Monetary Board noted that the inflation outlook
calls for preemptive policy action against emerging second-round
effects and rising inflation expectations.

  - The emerging baseline forecasts, which reflect more recent data on
inflation and output, indicate a likely breach of the inflation targets in
2008 and 2009, with the balance of risks tilted to the upside. The BSP
forecasts 2008 average inflation to reach 7.0-9.0 percent. For 2009,
average inflation is expected to decline to 4.0-6.0 percent.

  - The upside risks to inflation include exchange rate volatility, continuing
high world oil prices, possible increases in electricity rates, and
petitions for transport fare increases (recent adjustments were only
provisional), and possibility of higher-than-expected wage hikes in
those regions where wage petitions have not yet been acted upon.
Moreover, despite the signs of prices easing in some commodities
such as wheat, food inflation is likely to remain elevated as world
prices are unlikely to fall back to their pre-2007 levels.

  - The Monetary Board also noted that there are already indications that
supply-driven pressures are beginning to feed into demand. Core
inflation as of May 2008 has reached its highest level since April 2006.
Recent business and consumer confidence surveys also indicate an
upward shift in inflation expectations, coinciding with increased term
spreads on government securities and higher secondary market
yields.

  - Given the early evidence of second-round effects, the Monetary Board
recognized the need to act promptly to rein in inflationary
expectations. Since monetary policy affects economic variables with a
time lag, policy measures undertaken now will help address risks to
inflation in 2009. In addition, the buoyancy of domestic demand
suggests some room for a measured policy response. Favorable
conditions arising from a respectable and still solid domestic growth as
well as a strong external payments situation imply that the economy
can withstand a measured tightening.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

  - After considering the inflation outlook and the balance of risks to the
inflation outlook as well as the evidence that has become available
since its previous meeting on monetary policy, the Monetary Board
approved the recommendations of the Advisory Committee.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board on the monetary policy
stance is scheduled on 17 July 2008.
