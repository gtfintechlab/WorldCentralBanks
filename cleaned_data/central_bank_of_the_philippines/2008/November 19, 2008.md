**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 20 NOVEMBER 2008[1]**


**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at 6.00 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 8.00 percent for the
overnight RP (lending) rate;

b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs and
SDAs; and

c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The policy decision to keep interest rates steady was arrived at in the
process of balancing the BSP’s concern over price stability and its resolve to
undertake policy actions that will ensure the soundness and stability of the
financial system.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

   - The Monetary Board noted that while the recent coordinated rate
cuts by central banks signaled the strong commitment of the
international central banking community to address the
macroeconomic implications of the global financial turmoil, country
specific factors remain the major consideration in the monetary
policy assessment.

   - The Monetary Board considered the various arguments for a policy
rate cut and for keeping rates steady. It decided to keep policy rates
unchanged based on the following considerations:

1 The discussions presented herein reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the
information available at the time of the policy meeting. The sets of economic information were provided by
the technical secretariat of the Advisory Committee (AC). The Advisory Committee is composed of the
Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely: the Deputy Governor for the Monetary
Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the Managing Director of
the Treasury Department, and the Managing Director of the Monetary Policy Sub-sector. The highlights of
the discussions on the 20 November 2008 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its
regular meeting held on 11 December 2008. The next meeting of the Monetary Board on monetary policy
issues is scheduled on 18 December 2008.

� The inflation outlook reflects a decelerating inflation path over
the policy horizon, but still shows a breach of inflation targets for
2009 and possibly for 2010.

� The increasing contribution of core inflation to headline inflation
and the persistent upsurge in core inflation indicate that
generalized domestic price pressures are still in the pipeline
although they have been tempered as reflected in the
decelerating month-on-month trend.

� Sources of upside risks continue to be present. These are the
following:

1. Inflation expectations are still high although they have
shown some moderating.

2. An interest rate cut could have important implications
on the stability of foreign exchange market conditions.
A weaker peso impacts the prices of imported
commodities and utility rates, among other things, and
therefore on inflation and on inflation expectations.

3. Tight international demand-supply balances in key
commodities remain, as considerable demand from
emerging economies is expected to continue, while
supply responses to rising relative prices have been
slow to adjust.

4. Upward pressures may also be coming from possible
wage adjustments under the salary standardization law
and new calls for a legislated across-the-board
adjustment in private sector wages.

� Latest demand indicators provide mixed signals, but on balance
they point to the underlying strength in demand conditions,
providing a reasonable impetus to keep monetary policy settings
steady.

� Another important factor that the Board took into consideration
was that the growth slowdown and financial stress are not
expected to be as severe in the Philippines as in those countries
that have already cut rates. In those countries that have cut rates
and have announced financial packages, one of the most potent
sources of the economic drag is the wealth effect which operates
through equities and pensions. This is not the case for the
Philippines.

� Real interest rates remain in deep negative territory.

  - The Board believes that a decline in policy rates will not remedy the
problem of liquidity distribution. Recent policy measures (the reduction
in reserve requirement and the increase in the rediscounting budget)
should ensure an adequate funding environment even without a rate
cut.

  - The Board recognized that the BSP faced multiple and
contemporaneous challenges of stabilizing the financial system,
nursing the economy through a period of slower growth, and closely
monitoring the inflation outlook. However, with the underlying
resilience in domestic demand as reflected in demand indicators, the
Board believed that the Philippine economy may still see respectable
growth this year and in 2009.

  - The Board concluded that keeping policy rates steady would provide
the BSP with more flexibility in responding to future shocks that could
besiege the economy going forward.

III. **Recent Developments in Economic Indicators**

The Monetary Board’s decision took into account the recent
developments in various economic indicators:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Headline inflation dropped further to 11.2 percent year-on-year in
October from 11.8 percent in September, with lower price increases
seen in food and petroleum products.

  - However, core inflation was higher in October at 7.8 percent
compared to 7.5 percent in the previous month.

**B.  Inflation Expectations**

  - Recent surveys showed inflation expectations leveling off from
previous sharp increases.

� Q4 2008 BES indicated moderation in inflation expectations
with less respondents expecting inflation to move up.
� The BSP’s quarterly inflation survey showed a lower increase
in inflation expectations in Q3 2008 from Q2 2008.
� AP Consensus forecasts for Philippine inflation showed that
the monthly trend increase in inflation expectations is less
steep relative to the second quarter and in the early part of
the third quarter.

**C.  Demand conditions**

Latest data showed a moderation in demand conditions amid the
global economic downturn and the still high prices of fuel and food.

  - GDP grew at a slower rate of 4.6 percent in Q2 2008 compared to the
4.7 percent and 8.7 percent growth rates posted in the previous
quarter and the comparable period last year, respectively. GNP also
decelerated to 5.5 percent.

  - Monthly NSO data showed merchandise imports increased marginally
by 1.1 percent in August 2008, compared to their month- and year-ago
growth rates of 16.0 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively.

  - Meanwhile, exports growth decelerated in September at 1.2 percent
from the month-and year- ago growth of 6.1 percent and 5.1 percent,
respectively.

  - Selected demand indicators suggest some moderation in demand
conditions.

� Sales of passenger cars decelerated to 12.4 percent year-on-year
in September relative to month-ago and year-ago levels of 20.6
percent and 17.9 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, sales of
commercial vehicles posted a lower decline of 0.8 percent from a
negative growth of 3.1 percent in August, but still substantially
lower than the 26.8 percent year-on-year growth in September
2007. Likewise, sales of trucks and buses increased by 9.2
percent year-on-year in September, from the 2.7 percent growth
posted in August 2008, but was lower than the 11.4 percent
growth registered in September last year.

� Energy sales of Meralco grew marginally in August by 0.5 percent
after shrinking by 1.3 percent in the previous month, but was still
lower than the 9.3 percent growth posted in the comparable period
a year ago. Year-to-date sales registered a 1.3 percent growth,
although lower than the 5.2 percent expansion recorded in the
same period in 2007.

� Appliance sales rose dramatically by 18.3 percent year-on-year in
September, from the 1.5 percent growth recorded in the same
period last year and almost double the 9.4 percent growth in
August. Likewise, year-to-date appliance sales increased by 8.0
percent year-on-year compared to 6.9 percent in the period
January to September 2007.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing declined slightly to
81.3 percent in August from its peak of 81.6 percent in July 2008.

� The value of production index maintained two-digit growth at 12.7
percent year-on-year in August 2008 albeit slower than the 14.2
percent growth (revised) in July 2008. Likewise, the volume of
production index grew slower year-on-year in August 2008 at 6.5
percent from the 8.0 percent growth (revised) in July.

� The increase in land and rental values have generally moderated
compared to 2007.

**D.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - Latest data from the National Income Accounts showed that the
agriculture, fishery and forestry sector grew by 4.9 percent in Q2 2008
from 4.2 percent in the same period last year.

  - The decline in the average retail prices of commercial rice, which
began around the second week of July, continued up to the first week
of November.

  - International cereal prices continued to fall in October.

Oil Price Developments

  - Dubai crude oil prices continued to ease up to mid-November on
heightened fears of deteriorating global demand for oil. The spot price
of Dubai crude oil was lower in mid-November at $54.12 per barrel from
US$67.42 per barrel in October.

  - Latest estimated futures prices of Dubai crude oil are lower for 2008
and 2009.

  - Oil companies again reduced the prices of gasoline products, diesel,
and kerosene by P1.00 per liter each on 20 November. The price of
LPG likewise fell by P1.26 per liter.

  - In the transport sector, a provisional reduction in the minimum fare for
jeepneys and buses nationwide was implemented on November 7 and
10, respectively.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

 - The Energy Regulatory Commission deferred the implementation of its
earlier decision allowing Meralco to increase its distribution charge by
November 2008 under the performance-based rate (PBR) application.

 - In the telecommunications sector, the National Telecommunications
Commission mandated telecommunication companies to interconnect
their backhaul networks to all cable landing stations to lower service
rates as this will dismantle the monopoly in landing stations and
backhaul facilities.

**E. Financial Market Developments**

 - Risk aversion and global economic uncertainty continued to dictate
financial market sentiment.

Market Interest Rates

 - The Fed’s easing of its policy rates and the decline in US T-bill rates
widened interest rate differentials with the BSP’s policy rate. However,
risk-adjusted differentials narrowed as sovereign risk spreads
increased. Meanwhile, real lending rates remained negative even with
the lower September inflation outturn.

Stock Market

 - The local bourse was at its worst in October. The Philippine Stock
Exchange Index fluctuated in the first two weeks of November,
breaching the 1,900-index support level on 18 November.
Year-to-date, the index had declined by 48.0 percent.

Foreign Exchange

 - The peso continued to weaken amid market concern that the
contagion effect of the global financial crisis could lead to a worldwide
recession.

 - On a year-to-date basis, the peso had depreciated against the US
dollar by 17.3 percent on 18 November 2008, closing at P49.94/US$1
as the global economic slowdown deterred investment in emerging
markets

Global Bond and Credit Default Spreads

  - The EMBI+ Philippines spread narrowed on 10 November following
China’s announcement of a US$586 billion stimulus package to spur
growth in its economy. The Philippine five-year credit default swap
spread likewise moved in tandem with the region’s general easing
trend.

  - The coordinated liquidity measures by major central banks provided
market relief as spreads eased from their peak levels.

**F. Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

  - The growth of domestic liquidity or M3 accelerated further by 13.5
percent year-on-year in September from 9.8 percent in the previous
month and 11.5 percent a year ago. The expansion in domestic
liquidity was due to the build-up of both net domestic assets and net
foreign assets.

  - Outstanding loans of commercial banks including reverse repurchase
agreements or RRPs, increased in September by 24.1 percent yearon-year, growing at the same pace as in the previous month. Bank
lending net of banks’ RRP placements with the BSP accelerated to
24.8 percent in September from 22.1 percent in August.

  - The equity raised in the Philippine Stock Exchange for the first ten
months of 2008 was only one-fourth of the level reached in the same
period in 2007. Meanwhile, bond issuances by the corporate sector in
January-October 2008 reached P104.3 billion, 68.1 percent higher
relative to the comparable period last year, suggesting that local firms
have been turning to the corporate bond market to raise funds.

**G.  Fiscal developments**

  - The fiscal deficit reached P62.3 billion for the period January-October
2008, higher than the P41.5 billion deficit for the same period last
year.

**H.  External developments**

  - Global activity is slowing quickly. Governments across advanced
economies were swift to take early, decisive action to shore up
confidence and revive credit in their financial markets by
unprecedented coordinated rate cuts, rescue packages, and
extraordinary liquidity provisioning:

1. The impact of the US financial market turmoil on the real
economy has already become apparent. In response, the
Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by another 50 bps on 29
October.

2. In response to the financial turmoil, major central banks around
the world acted as one to soothe tensions in the financial
system by pumping liquidity in global credit markets.

3. Growth has fallen sharply in the Euro area, while inflation
seems to have peaked.

4. The headwind from commodity prices seems to be receding in
Japan, but the downside risks remain high.
