**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 24 APRIL 2008***


The Advisory Committee [1] submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board:

�� Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy interest rates at 5.0 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 7.0 percent for the overnight
RP (lending) rate;

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs and RPs; and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The recommendation to keep monetary policy settings unchanged
was based on the following assessments:

(a) The inflation environment has become more challenging.
Depending on the movements in oil and non-oil commodity
prices, inflation could settle above the 2008 inflation target
range but will be within the 3.5 percent ± 1.0 percentage point
target range for 2009.

(b) The factors driving inflation have come mostly from the supply
side, and the use of monetary instruments against such
influences may have less effect compared with direct supplyside intervention measures. Meanwhile, demand conditions—
while strengthening—have been growing apace with the
economy’s growth prospects.

(c) The balance of risks to the inflation outlook is tilted to the
upside. Core inflation has drifted upward, with the March 2008
reading at its highest level since November 2006. The pending
requests for wage and transport fare adjustments could raise
the upside risks to inflation coming from demand-side
pressures.

- The discussion presented herein reflects the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the
information available at the time of the policy meeting. The highlights of the discussions of the 24 April
2008 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular meeting held on 8 May 2008.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,

(d) However, global economic growth could be adversely affected
by a prolonged slowdown in the US economy which could, in
turn, temper demand pressures and moderate price increases
in global oil and non-oil commodities.

The Monetary Board then proceeded to review the recent
developments and the key considerations in the formulation of the BSP’s
monetary policy stance.

�Review of Recent Developments

**A. Domestic price conditions**

   - Headline inflation rose to 6.4 percent year-on-year in March from 5.4
percent in February, bringing the year-to-date average to 5.6 percent.
All major commodity groups, led by food, posted higher year-on-year
inflation rates relative to the previous month.

   - Core inflation, which measures the underlying trend in inflation by
excluding specific food and energy items, was similarly higher in
March. The official core inflation measure published by the National
Statistics Office (NSO) increased to 4.8 percent in March from 4.0
percent in February.

   - It was noted that inflation is on the rise not only in the Philippines but
also in other countries (China, Indonesia, Thailand, Korea, South
Africa, Brazil, and Chile) due largely to the rise in energy and food
prices.

**B. Demand conditions**

   - Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 7.4 percent in Q4 2007,
sustaining the third quarter’s revised growth rate and exceeding the
5.5 percent expansion posted in Q4 2006. GDP growth was boosted
by household spending and capital investments on the expenditure
side, and by the services sector from the production side.

   - Full-year GDP growth for 2007 was 7.3 percent, higher than the upper
end of the Government’s full-year growth target of 6.1-6.7 percent.

   - For Q1 2008, the business cycle path remained broadly steady,
indicating a continuing expansion phase.

   - NSO data showed that merchandise imports continued to accelerate
for the fifth consecutive month in January 2008, registering a 27.7
percent increase.  Merchandise exports likewise grew by 10.7 percent
year-on-year in February.

- Selected indicators of demand indicated a broad strengthening trend.

��Based on estimates from Colliers International Research, land
values in Q4 2007 rose by 30.3 percent year-on-year for the
Makati central business district and 20.9 percent year-on-year for
the Ortigas Center.

��Passenger car sales grew although at a slower pace of 11.4
percent year-on-year in February 2008, compared to the 25.6
percent growth registered in February 2007 and the 28.3 percent
increase in January 2008.

��Commercial vehicle sales continued to grow although at a slower
rate of 11.9 percent year-on-year in February 2008, compared to
50.0 percent in February 2007 and 13.3 percent in January 2008.
On a year-to-date basis, commercial vehicles also rose by 12.6
percent, lower than the 28.7 percent registered in JanuaryFebruary 2007.

��On a year-on-year basis, sales of trucks and buses increased by
12.9 percent in February 2008, lower than the 66.0 percent
recorded in February 2007 but a reversal of the 21.7 percent
contraction in January 2008.

��Year-on-year energy sales of Meralco increased by 6.0 percent in
February 2008, higher than the February 2007 and January 2008
growth rates of 1.1 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively.

��Appliance sales increased by 26.9 percent year-on-year in February
2008, higher than the 9.5 percent growth in February 2007 and 12.7
percent registered in January 2008.

��Average capacity utilization in manufacturing was relatively steady
for the sixth consecutive month at 80.2 percent in January 2008,
based on the revised rates reported in NSO’s Monthly Integrated
Survey of Selected Industries (MISSI).

��The value of production index (VAPI) decreased anew at a rate of
1.4 percent year-on-year in January 2008 from declines of 1.3
percent (revised) in December 2007 and 0.5 percent in January
2007. In contrast, the volume of production index (VOPI) grew
year-on-year in January 2008 at 0.5 percent from 0.1 percent
(revised) in December 2007 and a decline of 3.6 percent in
January 2007.

- The Q1 2008 overall business confidence index (CI) remained positive
but the lower index for the quarter indicated that more firms expect a
slowdown in business activity.

   - Q1 2008 CES results showed improved consumer confidence after
the downturn in the past quarter. The nationwide consumer
confidence index (CI) for the first quarter of 2008 improved quarter-onquarter by 6.5 index points to -27.1 percent.

   - Based on the preliminary results of the January 2008 Labor Force
Survey (LFS), the unemployment rate declined to 7.4 percent in
January 2008 from 7.8 percent in January 2007.�
�

   - Salaries of government employees are expected to increase by 10
percent effective July 2008. Three petitions for an across-the-board
increase in the daily minimum wages in NCR, Region VI, and Region
X were filed with their respective wage boards. Meanwhile, the
proposal for the P125 daily wage hike for private sector employees
and the Salary Standardization Law (SSL) III for government workers
remained pending in Congress.

**C. Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

   - Agriculture sustained its growth in Q4 2007 notwithstanding the
destruction brought by typhoons that visited certain areas of the
country during the quarter as a result of the on going La Niña
phenomenon which started in August 2007. According to the
Department of Agriculture (DA), agricultural production will be
supported by the anticipated rise in public spending on irrigation and
other infrastructure, postharvest facilities, research and development
(R&D), and agricultural extension work.

   - Meanwhile, the DA is poised to advance after the summer harvests its
third cropping season for palay under its quick turnaround (QTA)
program to take advantage of the weather bureau’s forecast of the La
Nina phenomenon lasting until mid-2008.

   - Latest data from the National Food Authority (NFA) as of 11 April
indicate that the country's total rice inventory stood at 1.8 million
metric tons (MT), slightly lower than the previous month's level of 1.9
million MT but higher than the previous year's level of 1.5 million MT.
In terms of sufficiency, the latest inventory level is sufficient to last for
55 days based on the average daily rice requirement of 33 thousand
MT.

   - Meanwhile, retail prices of commercial rice continued to increase.
Special and ordinary rice prices have been trending upward since the
first week of March. Elevated prices of farm inputs (fertilizers, fuel and
oil), which pushed up farm gate prices of palay, and speculations of a

rice shortage as world inventories continue to be depleted (which sent
imported rice prices at historic highs), have contributed largely to the
uptrend in rice prices.

   - The rising costs of feed ingredients, particularly corn, soybean meal,
feed wheat, and coconut oil is putting upward pressures on the prices
of meat products.

   - International prices for all major cereals continued their rise in
February and March, largely driven by persistent supply tightness and
the imposition of new export restrictions.

Oil Price Developments

   - International spot and future prices were higher in March up to midApril due to the weak US dollar, the decision of OPEC to keep its
output unchanged, and dwindling US crude inventories. In the
domestic scene, the oil import tariff was lowered to one percent in
April from two percent in March. Meanwhile, pump prices of petroleum
products, except for LPG, increased anew by P0.50 per liter on 12
April.

   - In the transport sector, a provisional increase of P0.50 in the minimum
fare for jeepneys in NCR, Region III, and Region IV may be
implemented by June but the petitions filed by jeepney operators in
December 2007 seeking a P1.00-P1.50 increase in the minimum fare
for Metro Manila remain pending with the Land Transportation
Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).

Developments in the Utilities Sector

   - With the start of the summer season, more pressures on electricity
rates in the coming months are expected. This, however, may be
tempered by the broadly steady peso and higher utilization of
hydroelectric power plants with the increased rainfall brought about by
the La Niña.

   - Meanwhile, water rates in Metro Mania were lowered in the second
quarter due to the higher discount from the foreign currency
differential adjustment (FCDA).

**D. Financial Market Developments**

   - Asian equities, including those in the Philippines, weakened and
currencies slid in mid-April amid fears of a regional economic
downturn following Chairman Ben Bernanke’s remarks in April that the
US would barely grow and could fall into recession this semester.
Meanwhile, the primary market T-bill rates stayed at their January

2008 levels while the yield curve for the secondary market shifted
upward.

Interest Rates

   - During the 31 March 2008 auction, the Auction Committee decided to
make a partial award of 364-day T-bills worth P1.9 billion (out of the
P6.0 billion offered) at an average rate of 5.705 percent, 43.9 basis
points higher than the average rate during the previous auction.
There were no offerings for the 91-day and 182-day T-bills.

   - Compared to their 29 February levels, the secondary market yields
rose on 8 April. However, compared to their 12 March levels, the
yields were higher at the short- and long-end of the curve, but
remained the same or declined for the medium-term maturities.

Stock Market

   - Risk aversion and uncertainties on the severity of the US economic
recession continued to dictate stock market sentiments in April 2008.
Following three consecutive months of market slowdown due to lack of
leads that could spur investors’ sentiments coupled with the continued
worries over global uncertainties, the PSEi continued to trek down on thin
trading. On 9 April, the PSEi slipped back to 2,961.8 index points. By midApril, stocks slid back due to persistent fears of a US recession, uptick in
domestic inflation rate and lack of positive news that kept investors on the
sidelines. On 21 April, the PSEi closed at 2,890.9 index points, lower by
2.7 percent compared to the first trading day of the month (1 April).

Foreign Exchange

   - The peso depreciated in March and well into mid-April. The peso
depreciated by 1.6 percent in March 2008 to average P41.32/US$1
relative to February 2008 amid rising risk aversion as investors shifted
away from emerging market assets due to concerns on the worsening
global financial market turbulence and fears of a looming US
recession and its impact on the world economy

   - On a year-to-date basis, several Asian currencies strengthened vis-àvis the US dollar as of 21 April 2008, led by the Japanese yen’s 8.7
percent appreciation. However, the peso, as well as the Indian rupee,
Thai baht and Korean won, depreciated.

Global Bond and Credit Default Spreads

   - Debt spreads showed mixed trends but narrowed towards mid-April 2008.
Debt spreads generally eased from end-March 2008 but were still close to
their record high levels. The market reacted well to the writedowns by

large international banks which indicated that banks were finally revealing
the true extent of their losses in the credit crisis.

   - Meanwhile, reports on the country’s fiscal surplus and higher export
earnings for the first two months of 2008 improved investors’ sentiment.
Philippine credit default swap (CDS) spreads narrowed to 216 basis
points on 17 April from 221 basis points on 9 April and 240 basis points in
end-March.

   - Similarly, the EMBI+ Philippine spreads tightened to 227 basis points on
17 April from 258 basis points on 9 April and 272 basis points on 31
March.

**E. Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

   - Domestic liquidity or M3 grew by 6.6 percent year-on-year in February
2008, slower than the growth of 7.2 percent in January 2008. This was
also lower than the 22.0 percent expansion recorded in February
2007.

   - The slowdown in the growth of domestic liquidity can be traced to both
the decline in net domestic assets (NDA) and the slowdown in the
growth of net foreign assets (NFA).

   - Outstanding loans of commercial banks, thrift banks, and rural banks
(excluding reverse repurchase or RRPs) continued to expand in
February 2008, posting a growth of 9.4 percent year-on-year. This
was higher than the 9.3 percent growth in January 2008 and the 5.4
percent growth registered in February 2007. Inclusive of banks’ RRP
placements with the BSP, bank lending increased by 4.7 percent yearon-year in February 2008, lower than the 5.4 percent expansion in
January 2008. This was also lower than the 8.4 percent growth
recorded in February 2007.

   - Consumer credit increased by 15.9 percent year-on-year in Q4 2007 but
this was lower than the 21.1 percent growth recorded in Q4 2006 and the
20.9 percent growth registered in Q3 2007.

   - Capital-raising activities in the PSE were weak in the period JanuaryMarch 2008. Likewise, corporate bond issuances dropped during the
first three months of 2008. It is worth noting that for the first three
months of 2008, banks account for a larger share of capital-raising in
the PSE as well as corporate bond issuances, unlike in the previous
year when non-banks accounted for the bigger share.

large international banks which indicated that banks were finally revealing

**F. Fiscal developments**

   - The National Government (NG) posted a fiscal deficit of P32.9 billion
for the first two months of 2008, higher by P14.3 billion than the P18.6
billion deficit incurred during the same period in 2007. The lower
deficit last year resulted mainly from the sale of Philippine
Telecommunications Investment Corporation (PTIC) shares to Metro
Pacific Assets Holdings.

   - The full-year public sector external debt-to-GDP ratio in 2007 was
26.1 percent of GDP, lower by 5.4 percentage points compared to
31.5 percent in 2006.  This can be attributed to the increase in GDP
to US$144.1 billion for 2007 from US$117.6 billion in 2007. This
offsets the increase in the stock of public sector external debt which
rose to US$37.7 billion from US$37.1 billion in 2006.

**G. External developments**

   - Against the background of financial market volatility and a possible
protracted slowdown in the US economy, an extended period of slower
growth is expected in the near term as the rest of the world may not be
able to decouple from the US despite the strong fundamentals of
emerging market economies.

   - Central banks are now faced with the challenge of keeping fiscal stimulus,
monetary tightening, and exchange rate policies in balance against the
backdrop of rising oil and non-oil commodity prices and weakening
economic growth.

   - The US Fed eased monetary policy settings aggressively while most
major central banks remained on hold. The Fed lowered its target for
the federal funds rate 75 basis points to 2.25 percent on 18 March
2008.

   - As of their latest policy meetings in March or early April 2008,
monetary policy settings were maintained in Asia (Indonesia,
Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, India and Japan), New Zealand,
Australia and the Euro region, whereas the US, UK, and Canada
reduced their policy rates.

   - Meanwhile, only Taiwan in Asia increased its policy rates, while Chile
and Colombia in Latin America and several Eastern European
countries tightened monetary policy settings as well. Meanwhile,
China last raised its policy rates by 18 basis points to 7.47 percent in
December 2007.

**II. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

   - The Monetary Board noted that prevailing price and output conditions
suggest that the stance of monetary policy continues to be appropriate
for the present.

   - The Monetary Board observed that BSP’s baseline inflation forecasts
indicate that, depending on the movements in oil and non-oil
commodity prices, inflation could settle above the 2008 inflation target
range but will be within the 3.5 percent ± 1.0 percentage point target
range for 2009.

   - In its assessment, the Monetary Board observed that the balance of
risks to the inflation outlook is tilted to the upside. Core inflation has
drifted upward, with the March 2008 reading at its highest level since
November 2006. The pending requests for wage and transport fare
adjustments could raise the upside risks to inflation coming from
demand-side pressures. On the other hand, the consensus view of a
prolonged slowdown in the US economy, and the resulting weaker
outlook for global economic growth, could reduce demand pressures
and moderate price increases in global oil and non-oil commodities.

   - Containing inflation is the BSP’s predominant policy objective. It will
act decisively and adjust monetary policy settings accordingly as and
when second-round effects of supply shocks become evident. The
Board noted that the economy’s underlying growth momentum
provides ample room for a decisive policy response by monetary
authorities.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

   - After considering the inflation outlook and the balance of risks to the
inflation outlook as well as the evidence that has become available
since its previous meeting on monetary policy, the Monetary Board
approved the recommendations of the Advisory Committee.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board on the monetary policy
stance is scheduled on 5 June 2008.
