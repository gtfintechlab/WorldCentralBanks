**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 6 OCTOBER 2008[1]**


**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

On the basis of its discussions on the balance of risks to the inflation
outlook and given the ongoing global financial market turbulence, the
Monetary Board decided to maintain the current monetary policy settings as
follows:

a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at 6.00 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 8.00 percent for the
overnight RP (lending) rate;

b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs and the
current interest rates on SDAs; and

c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratio.

The policy decision to keep interest rates steady was arrived at in the
process of balancing the BSP’s concern over price stability and its resolve to
undertake policy actions that will ensure the soundness and stability of the
financial system.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

   - The Monetary Board discussed extensively the current conditions in
the global economy, including the stresses being experienced in the
global financial markets. The Board paid particular attention to the
ongoing talks on proposed liquidity provision measures of the central
banks in advanced economies that are considered pivotal in
restoring global financial stability and reviving the flow of credit to
support global economic growth. The Monetary Board also assessed

1 The discussions presented herein reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the
information available at the time of the policy meeting. The sets of economic information were provided by
the technical secretariat of the Advisory Committee (AC). The Advisory Committee is composed of the
Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely: the Deputy Governor for the Monetary
Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the Managing Director of
the Treasury Department, and the Managing Director of the Monetary Policy Sub-sector. The highlights of
the discussions on the 6 October 2008 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular
meeting on held 23 October 2008. The next meeting of the Monetary Board is scheduled on
20 November 2008.

the impact of the expected global economic slowdown on the
domestic economy.

- The Monetary Board then discussed the following developments:

� Food and energy prices may have peaked, and are expected
to stabilize—and could even retreat─ in the coming months.
This development could lead to lower headline inflation,
providing monetary authorities more room for flexibility.

� However, commodity prices are expected to remain at
elevated levels for the remainder of 2008, and will probably
continue to be volatile, as the supply and demand balance
remains tight.

� While core inflation is rising, there is no additional evidence of
second-round effects, with wage demands contained and
further petitions for transport hikes deferred.

� There are also early signs of improving inflation expectations:
```
    o The term structure of interest rates appears to have

```
stabilized and the differentials between short and long-term
tenors have narrowed;
```
    o Various forecasts suggest lower inflation for 2009; and
    o Inflation expectations have stabilized, with the recent 

```
abatement of oil and rice prices.

- The emerging outlook indicates that inflation will decelerate to
single-digit levels by the first quarter of 2009. With the full effects of
the earlier increases in policy rates yet to be felt, future headline
inflation is expected to slow down towards the target-consistent path
by 2010.

- On balance, the risks surrounding the inflation outlook over the
policy horizon are tilted to the downside.

- However, there is a need to remain mindful of the following possible
sources of upside risks:

� Weaker peso
� Volatility in oil prices
� Increases in utility charges
� Positive output gap

   - In addition, a steady monetary policy will ensure the effective
functioning of the transmission channels for monetary policy, which,
in turn, will be helpful in preventing any credit crunch, and will
reinforce confidence in the financial markets and the economy as
whole.

III. **Recent Developments in Economic Indicators**

The Monetary Board’s decision took into account the recent
developments in various economic indicators:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Headline inflation climbed to 12.5 percent year-on-year in August,
higher than the 12.3 percent (revised) posted in July.

  - By geographical location, inflation went up both in the National Capital
Region (NCR) and in areas outside the NCR.

  - Core inflation rose to 7.0 percent in August from 6.3 percent in July.

**B.  Inflation Expectations**

  - The Board noted that recent Business and Consumer Expectations
surveys showed more respondents expecting inflation to move up in
Q3 with some improvement in Q4. The Asia Pacific Consensus
Forecasts for the Philippines in September showed lower inflation
expectations for 2009 compared to the previous month’s forecast.

**C.  Demand conditions**

Recent data confirm that economic activity is moderating as higher
fuel and food costs have slowed down the demand for commodities and
services.

  - GDP grew at a slower rate of 4.6 percent in Q2 2008 compared to the
growth posted in the previous quarter and the comparable period last
year. GNP also decelerated to 5.5 percent.

  - Monthly NSO data showed merchandise imports increasing by 16.0
percent in July 2008, compared to their month- and year-ago growth
rates of 12.7 percent and 14.3 percent, respectively.

  - Meanwhile, exports growth decelerated in July at 4.3 percent from the
month-and year- ago growth of 8.8 percent and 5.8 percent,
respectively.

           - In addition, a steady monetary policy will ensure the effective
functioning of the transmission channels for monetary policy, which,

- Selected demand indicators suggest a slight moderation in demand
conditions.

� Colliers International Research estimates showed that the
increase in land and rental values have generally moderated
compared to 2007.

� Passenger car sales improved in August due to increased
preference for cars with smaller engines. Meanwhile, commercial
vehicle sales declined while sales growth of trucks and buses
slowed down due to undelivered fleet orders.

� Year-on-year energy sales of Meralco declined further by 1.3
percent in July after shrinking by 1.0 percent in the previous
month. This was a reversal of the 6.7 percent growth recorded in
the same period last year. Year-to-date sales registered a 1.4
percent growth, although lower than the 4.6 percent expansion
recorded in the comparable period in 2007.

� Appliance sales recovered, registering a 34.9 percent year-on-year
growth in July, a turnaround from the 3.8 percent contraction in the
same period last year and more than twice the 17.4 percent
growth in June. Likewise, year-to-date appliance sales increased
by 12.3 percent year-on-year compared to 8.9 percent in the
comparable period last year.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing increased to 81.6
percent in July 2008 from 81.1 percent (revised) in June as it
continued its gradual but steady uptrend since January this year.

� The value of production index (VAPI) posted two-digit growth at
13.9 percent year-on-year in July 2008 after increasing by 9.4
percent (revised) in June 2008. Likewise, the volume of production
index (VOPI) was higher year-on-year in July 2008 at 8.1 percent
from 5.0 percent (revised) in June.

- Based on the results of the July 2008 Labor Force Survey (LFS), the
unemployment rate declined to 7.4 percent in July 2008 from 7.8
percent a year ago.

- The National Wage and Productivity Commission has completed its
recent round of wage and COLA adjustments in all regions in 2008,
increasing the daily compensation of workers by 5.8 percent
nationwide.

**D.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - Latest data from the National Income Accounts showed that the
agriculture, fishery and forestry output grew by 4.9 percent in Q2 2008
from 4.2 percent in the same period last year.

  - Average retail prices of commercial rice started to decline since the
third week of July and up to September, but rice price levels remain
elevated when compared to the 2007 levels.

Oil Price Developments

  - Dubai crude oil prices were lower in September due to worries about
weaker global demand. Meanwhile, the import tariff on specific crude
and refined petroleum products remained at zero in September 2008.
Oil companies reduced the domestic pump prices of petroleum
products further, with the latest reduction implemented on 19
September.

  - In the transport sector, a consumer group, the National Council for
Commuters Protection, submitted a petition to the Land Transportation
Franchising and Regulatory Board (on 19 September 2008) for a
reduction in the minimum fare for Metro Manila jeepneys and buses.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

  - The pending petitions before the Energy Regulatory Commission and
the volatility in the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market will likely create
upside pressures on electricity rates in the coming months.
Meanwhile, water rates are expected to increase in the fourth quarter.

**E. Financial Market Developments**

  - Inflation concerns, risk aversion, and economic uncertainty in the US
continued to dictate financial market sentiments.

Market Interest Rates

  - Market interest rates generally rose in August, reflecting market
participants' expectations of higher BSP policy rates. Consequently,
interest rate differentials between domestic market interest rates and
comparable foreign rates as well as the spread of lending rates over
the Treasury bill rates widened. Meanwhile, real lending rates
remained negative with the higher August inflation outturn.

**D.  Supply-side indicators**

Stock Market

  - In September, the market generally succumbed to grave external
pressures following the collapse of the Lehman Brothers, the sale of
Merrill Lynch & Co. to Bank of America, and the US Fed’s takeover of
the American International Group, Inc. (AIG).

Foreign Exchange

  - The peso continued to weaken in September as it depreciated by 3.8
percent (month-on-month) to average at P46.76/US$1 amid rising risk
aversion on concerns of a slowing global economy, particularly in the
Euro area, as well as the worsening financial turmoil caused by the
U.S. subprime crisis.

  - On a year-to-date basis, the peso depreciated against the US dollar by
12.3 percent on 30 September 2008, closing at P47.05/US$1, as
investors shunned emerging markets’ assets.

Global Bond and Credit Default Spreads

  - As the Lehman collapse triggered a significant spike in risk aversion,
particularly against emerging market assets, the risk of owning
Philippine bonds increased.

  - The EMBI+ Philippine spreads widened to 319 basis points on 16
September, a 52-basis points jump from the 12 September level of
267 basis points, reaching a new high of 323 basis points on 17
September. The cost of protecting the country’s bonds against default
likewise climbed significantly to its year’s peak with the Philippine fiveyear credit default swap spread widening to 294 basis points on 16
September from the 12 September level of 239 basis points.

  - The coordinated liquidity measures by major central banks provided
market relief as spreads eased from their peak levels.

**F. Balance of Payments**

  - The balance of payments yielded a surplus of US$221 million in Q2
2008 as both the current and capital and financial accounts registered
net inflows.

**G. Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

  - Based on the Depository Corporations Survey, domestic liquidity or
M3 grew by 4.1 percent year-on-year in July 2008, slightly lower than
the 5.1 percent growth in June. The expansion in domestic liquidity
continued to be driven by net foreign assets coupled with a marginal
increase in net domestic assets.

  - Outstanding loans of universal and commercial banks including
reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) continued to register strong
growth in July at 23.9 percent, a slight deceleration from the previous
month’s growth of 24.2 percent. Net of RRPs, loans outstanding
continued to accelerate at 18.5 percent in July from 18.1 percent in
June.

  - The equity raised in the Philippine Stock Exchange for the first eight
months of 2008 was only around a fifth of the level reached in the
same period in 2007. Meanwhile, bond issuances by the corporate
sector in January-August 2008 reached P84.0 billion, 57.0 percent
higher relative to the comparable period last year. This suggests that
local firms have been turning to the corporate bond market to raise
funds.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

  - The National Government registered a fiscal surplus in August
amounting to P1.7 billion, lower than the P13.9 billion surplus in the
comparable period last year. Cumulatively, the fiscal deficit reached
P31.7 billion for the period January-August, higher than last year’s
P25.5 billion deficit for the same period.

  - The public sector external debt-to-GDP ratio in Q2 2008 was 23.9
percent of GDP, lower by 4.7 percentage points compared to 28.6
percent registered in Q2 2007.

**I.  External developments**

  - The global economy is facing its most difficult challenge in many years
as it continues to be hit by the combination of an imminent economic
slowdown, still high commodity and oil prices and global financial
turmoil:

1. Despite strong Q2 GDP growth, the US economy is on a
gradual downslope. More recently, the US financial system has
been shaken to its core, with the closure of two of the most
prominent financial institutions in Wall Street.

2. In response to the financial turmoil, major central banks around
the world acted as one to soothe tensions in the financial
system by pumping liquidity in global credit markets.

3. Meanwhile, growth is falling sharply in the Euro area, while
inflation also seems to have peaked.

4. The headwind from commodity prices seems to be receding in
Japan, but the downside risks remain high.
