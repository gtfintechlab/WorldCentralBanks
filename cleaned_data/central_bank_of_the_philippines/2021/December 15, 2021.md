**_HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON THE_**

**_MONETARY POLICY STANCE HELD ON 16 DECEMBER 2021 [1]_**

**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Keep the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate unchanged at 2.00

percent; and

b) Maintain the accommodative levels of overnight deposit and

overnight lending rates at 1.50 percent and 2.50 percent,
respectively.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

       - The decision of the Monetary Board is based on the assessment that, while

latest inflation forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are higher, the projected
inflation path remains within the inflation target band of 2-4 percent over
the policy horizon. Supply-side price pressures are also being actively
addressed through non-monetary measures. Meanwhile, inflation

expectations continue to be anchored within the inflation target band.

       - The risks to the inflation outlook continue to lean towards the upside for

2022 while remaining broadly balanced for 2023. Upside risks are linked
mainly to the potential impact of continuing constraints on the supply of
key food items and petitions for transport fare hikes. Strong global
demand amid lingering supply-chain bottlenecks could also exert further
upward pressures on international commodity prices. The effective
implementation of non-monetary interventions to ensure adequate
domestic food supply must be sustained in order to mitigate potential
supply-side pressures on inflation. Meanwhile, the emergence of new
COVID-19 variants continues to pose downside risks to the outlook for
growth and inflation. Nonetheless, the Monetary Board observed that
economic growth now appears to be on firmer ground, supported by the
Government’s accelerated vaccination program and calibrated relaxation
of quarantine protocols. In particular, credit activity has gradually
recovered in recent months, reflecting improved business activity and
market sentiment.

       - Upon consideration of these key developments, the Monetary Board sees

enough scope to keep a patient hand on the BSP’s policy levers owing to

a manageable inflation environment. At the same time, downside risks to
the economic recovery emanate from the emergence of new COVID-19
variants as well as the potential tightening of global financial conditions.
Hence, preserving ongoing monetary policy support at this juncture shall
help sustain the economy’s momentum over the next few quarters.

**III.** **Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook**

The Monetary Board considered the following macroeconomic and

financial developments in deciding on the monetary policy stance:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Headline inflation eased to 4.2 percent in November 2021 on the back of

lower food inflation. Inflation for food slowed down in November, driven by
slower price increases of major food items such as, meat, fish, and
vegetables. This was due in part to base effects from the significant price
increases for these commodities a year ago. By contrast, energy-related
inflation continued to drive non-food inflation higher as a result of the
increase in electricity rates and still elevated domestic petroleum prices.
The year-to-date average inflation to 4.5 percent is above the
government’s annual target range of 2-4 percent.

  - At the same time, demand-driven inflation has remained subdued. Core

inflation, which excludes selected volatile food and energy items to depict
underlying demand-side price pressures, eased in November to 3.3
percent year-on-year (from 3.4 percent in the previous month). Year-todate core inflation is at 3.3 percent.

**B.  Inflation expectations**

  - Meanwhile, the December 2021 survey round for inflation expectations

reflected steady mean inflation forecasts for 2021 and lower mean inflation
forecasts for 2022-2023. Private sector economists expect inflation to
average at 4.4 percent for 2021.[2] By contrast, mean inflation forecasts for
2022 and 2023 declined to 3.3 percent (from 3.5 percent) and 3.1 percent
(from 3.2 percent), respectively.

  - Similarly, the preliminary Q4 2021 results of the BSP’s Consumer

Expectations Survey showed that households anticipate inflation to
remain within the government’s 2–4 percent inflation target range in 2021
and 2022.

**C.  Inflation outlook**

  - The latest baseline inflation forecasts are 4.4 percent for 2021, 3.4 percent

for 2022, and 3.2 percent for 2023. Inflation is seen to ease below the high

end of the target range by December 2021 and further decelerate to below
the midpoint of the target range in Q1 2022 due to negative base effects as
global oil and non-oil prices moderate from their high levels in the previous
year. Inflation is then expected to accelerate close to the high end of the
target range by Q3 2022 due to the continued recovery in domestic
economic activity and the reversal to positive base effects, before
decelerating close to the midpoint of the target by 2023. At the same time,
inflation forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are slightly higher due mainly to the
higher-than-anticipated inflation outturn in November 2021 partly offset
by the decline in the average global oil prices. Meanwhile, forecast for 2023
is broadly unchanged compared to the previous round.

2021 4.3 4.4

2022 3.3 3.4

2023 3.2 3.2

  - The risks to the inflation outlook are weighted slightly on the upside for

2022, but are broadly balanced for 2023. The potential impact of weather
disturbances on the prices of key food items and petitions for jeepney fare
hikes due to higher oil prices are the upside risks over the near term. The
uptick in global prices of non-oil commodities due to strong global
demand amid supply chain bottlenecks along with the possibility of a
prolonged shortage in pork supply are additional sources of upward price
pressures. Meanwhile, the potential impact on domestic growth prospects
of delays in the easing of containment measures as well as a weaker-thanexpected global recovery owing to the spread of new COVID-19 variants
are seen as the main sources of downside risks. In addition, proposals for a
six-month suspension in the excise taxes of petroleum products could
temporarily reduce inflation, but the impact will like be reversed once
excise tax rates revert to previous levels.

**D. Demand conditions**

  - Economic recovery appears to be gaining traction with domestic output

projected to expand in Q4 2021, driven by the further loosening of
quarantine classification from Alert Level 3 to Alert Level 2 of the whole of
Philippines.[3] Similarly, economic expansion is expected to continue in 2022
and 2023, supported by the implementation of the Corporate Recovery
and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Law and Financial Institutions
Strategic Transfer (FIST) Act as well as improvements in external demand.

  - Mobility indicators have trended upward in recent months following the

nationwide rollout of the Alert Levels System by the National Government

3 Per IATF Resolution No. 151-C Series of 2021, all provinces in the country were placed under level 2 except
for Apayao. However, Apayao was classified under level 2 effective 3 December 2021 as per IATF Resolution

(NG). For the first week of December, the increase in mobility for the
Philippines can also be attributed to seasonal factors related to the
Christmas holidays. Driving indicators like Apple and Waze continued to
rise in December albeit still below baseline, suggesting that economic
activity while still below pre-pandemic levels, has been improving with the
shift to less stringent quarantine measures.

The impact of easing restrictions on economic activity can also be seen in
data on purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs). The composite PMI
published by the Philippine Institute for Supply Management (PISM)
increased to 50.3 in October, breaching the 50-point expansion threshold.
Likewise, the IHS Markit Philippines Manufacturing PMI grew faster in
November after gaining 0.7 index point to 51.7 from 51.0 in October. The
manufacturing sector expanded for the third consecutive month as easing
quarantine restrictions, increased vaccinations, and declining COVID-19
cases underpinned demand recovery.

  - The major employment indicators point to better labor market conditions

relative to a year ago and the previous month (except for the
underemployment rate). The implementation of less stringent quarantine
measures in major economic areas in the country resulted in greater
economic activities in October 2021, based on the latest round of the labor
force survey (LFS). Some of the employment losses since the start of the
pandemic In 2020 have also been gradually recovered with the
employment level in October 2021 rising above the pre-pandemic level.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - Nationwide average rice prices showed mixed trends based on the

November (2nd phase) price survey. Nonetheless, domestic retail rice
prices remained generally stable as envisioned with the enactment of R.A.
No. 11203.

  - Meanwhile, livestock production, particularly the local hog sector

contracted at a slower pace in Q3 2021 relative to the previous quarter,
which could be attributed to declining African Swine Fever (ASF) cases
amid stricter surveillance and monitoring efforts under the Bantay ASF sa
_Barangay_ program, as well as the hog repopulation initiative

implemented by the Department of Agriculture (DA) in partnership with
local government units (LGUs), hog raisers, and the private sector. The DA
has also rolled-out temporary measures targeted to help stabilize
domestic supply of agricultural commodities such as pork, rice, and fish.

  - On weather conditions, according to the latest climate advisory of the

Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services
Administration[4], weak La Niña conditions persist and are expected to

continue through Q1 2022. La Niña event is associated with above normal
rainfall condition, which is anticipated to adversely affect highly vulnerable
areas and sectors of the country.

Oil Price Developments

  - International oil prices in early December 2021 declined sharply due to

demand concerns amid rising cases in Europe along with the emergence
of the COVID-19 omicron variant. This downtrend was also supported by
the decision of the US, UK, and other Asian countries to release oil reserves
to ease elevated prices. Despite demand concerns, Saudi Arabia decided
to raise its price for buyers in Asia and the US.

  - The futures price curve remained in backwardation, though the path

appears to be noticeably lower compared to early November given
increased downside risks to global oil demand. In addition, significant
uncertainty remains over developments concerning the Omicron variant
and possible government responses.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

  - The overall electricity rates increased in December 2021 due mainly to

higher generation charge. According to Meralco, the upward adjustment
in the generation cost was on the back of the inclusion of the first of the
four monthly installments covering the deferred costs from the November
bill as well as the increase in charges from the Power Supply Agreements
(PSAs).[5]

**F. Financial market developments**

  - The peso depreciated slightly against the US dollar for the period

1-13 December 2021 following (i) hawkish statements from the US Federal
Reserve amid emerging inflation risks; (ii) concerns over the Omicron
variant; and (iii) the release of wider-than-expected Philippine trade deficit
in October.[6] Nonetheless, depreciation pressures were partly tempered by
positive market sentiment amid (i) the easing of inflation for the third
straight month in November; (ii) the decline in unemployment rate in
October; (iii) the rise in manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI)
in November; and (iv) the seasonal increase in Overseas Filipino Workers

5 The deferred cost pertains to the generation costs arising from the impact of the shutdown of Malampaya natural
gas facility on 2-25 October 2021. The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) directed Meralco to defer the collection
of portions of their suppliers’ generation costs and to bill these on a staggered basis beginning this December
until March 2022. Meanwhile, charges from the PSA increased due to higher prices of international coal and lower
plant dispatch of some PSAs
6 Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed that the country’s trade deficit widened to $4.01 billion
in October from the $2.04-billion gap a year earlier. It was also the biggest deficit since the $4.27 billion posted in

(OFW) remittances ahead of the Christmas holiday.[7] The extension of the
NG’s three-day massive vaccination drive likewise supported the peso.[8]

  - Amid continued limitations and economic challenges from the ongoing

crisis, the Philippine banking system (PBS) sustained its solid footing
characterized by continued growth in assets and deposits, positive net
profit, ample capital and liquidity buffers, and adequate loan-loss reserves.
Meanwhile, the expiry of mostly of the BSP’s relief measures by endDecember 2021 has been timed to coincide with the full operationalization
of the FIST Act this year. The FIST Act is expected to bolster banks’ capital
and liquidity position by allowing them to dispose non-performing assets
(NPAs). Moreover, the Act will enhance the financial institutions’ (FIs) riskbearing capacity and strengthen their capability to provide financial
services to productive sectors of the economy.

**G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions**

  - Liquidity in the financial system continues to be ample. Preliminary data

show that domestic liquidity (M3) expanded by 8.2 percent year-on-year to
₱14.6 trillion in October, slightly slower than the 8.3-percent (revised)
growth recorded in September

  - At the same time, accommodative monetary policy settings continue to

support the normalization and easing of domestic financial market
conditions. Credit activity has shown signs of recovery in recent months,
reflecting the expansion in business activity amid easing quarantine
restrictions, declining COVID-19 cases, and increasing vaccinations.
Preliminary data show that outstanding loans of universal and commercial
banks (U/KBs), net of RRP placements with the BSP, increased at a faster
rate of 3.5 percent year-on-year in October from 2.7 percent in September.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

  - The NG recorded a P1,203.4 billion fiscal deficit for January – October 2021.

Netting out the interest payments in NG expenditures, the primary deficit
amounted to ₱832.5 billion, thirty-seven percent higher from the
₱605.5 billion deficit recorded in the previous year. The NG continues to
have ample fiscal space to help cushion the pandemic’s impact and
provide further support to economic recovery.

**I.  External developments**

  - Global economic output expanded at a faster rate in November as reduced

quarantine restrictions and increased vaccinations supported demand

7 The PSA reported that CPI Inflation rate slowed down to 4.2 percent in November from 4.6 percent in October.
The unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent in October from 8.9 percent in September. Meanwhile, the Philippine
manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 51.7 in November from 51 in October. (Source:

conditions in the manufacturing and service sectors. However, prices of
raw materials and other production inputs also continued to rise as supply
chain disruptions intensified in most advanced economies and their
trading partners. The JP Morgan All-Industry Output Index marginally rose
to a PMI reading of 54.8 in November from 54.5 in October as higher
output, increased new orders, and improving labor prospects underpin
demand prospects in the manufacturing and service sectors. In addition,
Nikkei ASEAN Manufacturing PMI continued to expand in November at
52.3 as both output and new orders improved due to easing quarantine
restrictions. However, the expansion is slower compared to the
53.6 recorded in October as materials shortages and longer delivery times
weighed on the sector's overall performance.
