**_HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON THE_**

**_MONETARY POLICY STANCE HELD ON 18 NOVEMBER 2021[1]_**


**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Keep the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate unchanged at

2.00 percent; and

b) Maintain the levels of overnight deposit and overnight lending rates

at 1.50 percent and 2.50 percent, respectively.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

  - The decision of the Monetary Board is based on its assessment that

inflation is likely to decelerate in the remaining months of 2021 with fullyear inflation slightly exceeding the upper end of the target band.
Meanwhile, the inflation forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are seen to return to
within target range of 2-4 percent as the sharp rise in global crude oil
prices, the stronger recovery in domestic growth, and the slight
depreciation of the peso were mostly offset by the recent lower-thanexpected inflation outturns. Moreover, inflation expectations remain firmly
aligned with the baseline projection path.

  - In assessing the monetary policy stance, the Monetary Board also noted

that the risks to the inflation outlook have shifted slightly toward the
upside for 2022 even as they remain broadly balanced for 2023. Upside risks
may emanate from the potential impact of weather disturbances on prices
of key food items, petition for jeepney fare hikes due to higher oil prices,
uptick in international non-oil commodity prices amid strong global
demand and supply-chain bottlenecks, and the possibility of prolonged
shortage in pork supply. Meanwhile, main sources of downside risks
include the negative impact on domestic economic growth prospects of
possible delays in the easing of containment measures and a weaker-thanexpected global recovery due to the spread of new and more virulent
COVID-19 variants.

  - The Monetary Board likewise observed that economic growth appears to

be gaining solid traction, driven by improved mobility and sentiment amid
the calibrated easing in quarantine protocols and progress in the
Government's vaccination rollout. Nonetheless, the Monetary Board noted

of macroeconomic and financial information available at the time of the policy meeting. The next meeting
of the Monetary Board on the monetary policy stance is scheduled on 16 December 2021

that sustained measures to safeguard public health and welfare remain
crucial to facilitate the recovery in investment and employment.

  - On balance, the Monetary Board was of the view that there remains scope

to hold monetary policy settings steady amid a manageable inflation
environment. The Monetary Board maintains that keeping a patient hand
on the BSP’s policy levers, along with appropriate fiscal and health
interventions, will help sustain the economic recovery over the next few
quarters.

  - Looking ahead, the Monetary Board emphasized that the BSP will

continue to prioritize providing policy support for the economy while
keeping an eye on the potential risks to future inflation. At the same time,
the BSP stands ready to respond to potential second-round effects arising
from supply-side pressures, in line with its price and financial stability
objectives.

**III.** **Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook**

The Monetary Board considered the recent macroeconomic and financial
developments listed below in deciding the appropriate monetary policy
stance:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Headline inflation eased to 4.6 percent in October 2021, stemming from

slowdown in food inflation. Inflation for food slowed down in October,
mainly driven by price stabilization for meat and fish prices with the
availability of imported supply. Conversely, non-food inflation increased
due to higher energy-related price upticks. This brought the year-to-date
average inflation to 4.5 percent, exceeding the government’s annual
target range of 2-4 percent.

  - Core inflation, which excludes selected volatile food and energy items to

depict underlying demand-side price pressures, inched up to 3.4 percent
year-on-year in October 2021 from the previous month’s print of
3.3 percent.

**B.  Inflation expectations**

  - The November 2021 survey round on inflation expectations show steady

mean inflation forecasts for 2021 and 2023 and a higher mean inflation
forecast for 2022 - albeit still within the government’s target range of
2-4 percent. The results of inflation forecasts show that private sector
economists expect inflation to average at 4.4 percent for 2021.[2,3] By

2 There were 21 respondents in the BSP’s survey of private sector economists in October 2021. The survey

was conducted from 6 to 26 October 2021.

contrast, the mean inflation forecasts for 2022 increased to 3.5 percent
(from 3.4 percent in the previous month’s survey round) while it remained
at 3.2 percent for 2023.

**C.  Inflation outlook**

  - The latest baseline inflation forecasts are 4.3 percent for 2021, 3.3 percent

for 2022, and 3.2 percent for 2023. The inflation path is seen to revert to
within the target in November 2021 and further decelerate close to the low
end of the target range in Q1 2022. This may be attributed to the expected
further moderation in food inflation due to the direct supply-side measures
implemented by the National Government as well as the negative base
effects due to the deceleration in the uptick of global oil and non-oil
commodity prices. The lower inflation forecast for 2021 is due to the lowerthan-expected inflation prints in September and October 2021. Meanwhile,
the inflation forecasts for 2022 and 2023 were unchanged compared to the
previous round as the sharp rise in global crude oil prices, the stronger
recovery in domestic growth, and the slight depreciation of the peso were
mostly offset by the recent lower-than-expected inflation outturns.

2021 4.4 4.3

2022 3.3 3.3

2023 3.2 3.2

  - The risks to the inflation outlook are now seen to be weighted slightly

toward the upside for 2022 but remains broadly balanced for 2023. The
potential impact of weather disturbances on the prices of key food items,
jeepney fare hike petitions, and the possibility of a prolonged recovery in
domestic pork supply are the major domestic upside risks. Furthermore,
the uptick in global prices of non-oil commodities due to strong global
demand amid supply chain bottlenecks are additional external sources of
upward price pressures. Meanwhile, the negative impact on domestic
economic growth prospects of possible delays in the easing of
containment measures as well as a weaker-than-expected global recovery
owing to the spread of new and more virulent COVID-19 variants are the
main sources of downside risks. Additionally, proposals for a six-month
suspension in the excise taxes of petroleum products could temporarily
reduce inflation, but the impact is seen to be offset once the excise tax
rates revert to previous levels.

**D. Demand conditions**

  - The staff’s full-year growth forecasts for 2021 and 2022 were revised

upwards to reflect the higher-than-expected Q3 2021 growth figure as well
as the easing of quarantine measures in Metro Manila and surrounding
provinces. In addition, election-related spending is expected to contribute

to domestic economic activity in the first half of 2022. Meanwhile, the
economic recovery in 2022 to 2023 is expected to be supported by the
implementation of the CREATE and FIST laws as well as improvements in
external demand buoyed by stronger outlook in the country’s major
trading partners. The latest forecasts also show that the country’s real GDP
will return to its 2019 level by Q3 2022. This implies that the economy will
likely operate below full capacity in the near term with firms and
households gradually adjusting to post-pandemic economic conditions
over time.

  - Mobility indicators have trended upward in recent months as the National

Government moved to a more granular approach to lockdowns with the
implementation of the Alert Levels System. Mobility data from Google are
at an all-time-high since March 2020 and this is likewise mirrored in the
near-normal congestion levels for Manila.

  - Substantial spare capacity remains in the labor market. The

unemployment rate slightly increased in September to 8.9 percent as
major economic areas in the country remained under stringent and
blanket quarantines during the month. Meanwhile, the labor force
participation rate declined as more young people resumed classes in
public schools. Nonetheless, some of the employment losses brought on
by the onset of the pandemic in 2020 have been gradually recovered as
the employment level in September 2021 was above the pre-pandemic
level. However, the quality of employment shows a rather slow recovery as
the recent employment gains were mostly low-skilled and

nonremunerative.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - **Nationwide average rice prices fall in October survey amid the onset of**

**the main harvest season.** Moreover, private sector import arrivals
continued to boost the supply of rice. Based on the results of the PSA Retail
Price Survey (RPS) from selected trading centers in key cities per region,
average prices of regular milled rice (RMR) in key cities outside NCR
declined in the second phase of the October survey round. RMR prices in
NCR likewise fell, and the nationwide average price for RMR eased.
Meanwhile, even as well milled rice (WMR) prices in NCR declined
significantly as the harvest from nearby provinces boost supply, the
nationwide average still recorded a marginal increment in the latest round
as average prices of WMR in key cities outside NCR inched up in the second
phase of the October 2021 survey round.

  - Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture (DA) has rolled-out temporary

measures targeted to help stabilize domestic supply of agricultural
commodities such as pork, rice, and fish.

- On the developments in the African Swine Fever (ASF) situation in the

country, the DA reported that as of 23 October 2021, ASF-affected areas
were down to only 20 cities and municipalities in 5 provinces from the total
of 624 cities and municipalities in 50 provinces affected since ASF hit the
country in 2019. The improvement may be attributed mainly to the impact
of stricter surveillance and monitoring efforts under the _BABay ASF_
program, as well as the hog repopulation initiative implemented by the DA
in partnership with local government units (LGUs), hog raisers, and the
private sector.

- On weather conditions, weak La Niña conditions persist and are expected

to continue until Q1 2022. For the period November 2021 to February 2022,
around 3 – 6 tropical cyclones (TCs) may enter or develop within the
Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR). Two to three TCs will likely develop
in November, one to two in December, and zero to one TC per month for
the period January-April 2022.

Oil Price Developments

- International oil prices surged for most of October due to some tightness

in the global energy market. There has been a strong demand for oil
products amid gradual easing of coronavirus-related restrictions, seasonal
heating demand with upcoming winter, and gas-to-oil switching amid
elevated gas and coal prices. The increase in global oil prices were reflected
in the domestic pump prices of petroleum products, which were the main
drivers of non-food inflation. Consequently, transport groups have decided
to submit a petition with LTFRB requesting for a fare hike in jeepney fares.
In response, the government has approved a ₱1.0-billion fuel or cash
subsidy to mitigate the impact of higher fuel prices.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

- **The overall electricity rate increased slightly in October 2021 due**

**mainly to higher transmission charges. The higher ancillary service**
charges, which accounted for about 33 percent of the National Grid
Corporation of the Philippines’ (NGCP) total transmission charge, led to the
increase in transmission charge according to MERALCO.

- Meanwhile, the decline in generation charges partly offset the rise in the

overall electricity rate. Charges from Wholesale Electricity Spot Market
(WESM) fell on the back of lower average capacity on outage and average
demand in the Luzon grid for the September 2021 supply month. Similarly,
charges from Independent Power Producers (IPPs) also eased. Meralco
noted that the cost of the usage of alternative liquid fuel during the
Malampaya gas supply restriction in September 2021 is not yet included in
the charges and will be billed in subsequent months. The decline in WESM
and IPP charges were offset by the increase in charges from Power Supply
Agreements (PSAs) as a result of higher fuel prices and the depreciation of
the peso against the US dollar.

**F. Financial market developments**

  - In November, the Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) continued to rise

on investor optimism over the further easing of restrictions in the country
amid the continued decline in COVID-19 cases. On 8 November, the PSEi
closed at 7,396.22 index points, higher by 4.8 percent than the closing index
in end-October and by 3.6 percent year-to-date. The rise in the index was
also supported by reports on improving manufacturing activity and easing
headline inflation in October, upward revision in the Q2 GDP estimate to
12 percent, and continued strong Q3 corporate earnings released by index
heavyweights.

  - The peso appreciated against the US dollar in early November amid

positive market sentiment following the release of strong Philippines
Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data for October 2021. On a year-to-date
basis, the peso depreciated against the US dollar along with most Asian
currencies, except the Chinese yuan and New Taiwan dollar.

  - Amid continued limitations and economic challenges from the ongoing

crisis, the Philippine banking system (PBS) sustained its solid footing
characterized by continued growth in assets and deposits, positive net
profit, ample capital and liquidity buffers and adequate loan-loss reserves.
Meanwhile, the latest supervisory data on the PBS’s non-performing loans
(NPL) indicate a continued weakening in loan quality but remaining
manageable and within the BSP’s expectations.

  - The expiration for most of the BSP’s relief measures by end-December

2021 has been timed to coincide with the full operationalization of the
Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer (FIST) Act by 2021 which is
expected to bolster banks’ capital and liquidity position by allowing them
to dispose non-performing assets (NPAs). Moreover, the Act will enhance
the financial institutions’ (FIs) risk-bearing capacity and strengthen their
capability to provide financial services to productive sectors of the
economy.

**G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions**

  - The BSP’s current accommodative monetary policy settings support the

easing of domestic financial market conditions, with market interest rates
at record-low levels and an on-going budding recovery in bank lending.
Recently, there is an observed pick up in credit activity, reflecting modest
recovery in banks’ lending attitude on improved economic prospects.
Results of the Q3 2021 SLOS also show that fewer number of banks
reported tightened lending standards compared to Q2 2021.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

  - **The NG recorded a ₱1,139.1 billion fiscal deficit for January – September**

**2021. Netting out the interest payments in NG expenditures, the primary**


-----

deficit amounted to ₱799.8 billion, forty-one percent higher from the
₱566.2 billion deficit recorded in the previous year. This implies that the NG
continues to have ample fiscal space to help cushion the pandemic’s
impact and provide further support to economic recovery.

**I.  External developments**

  - **Global economic activity expands in October as businesses resume**

**operations on the back of easing quarantine restrictions, declining**
**COVID-19 cases, and increasing vaccinations. Meanwhile, supply chain**
**disruptions suppress the global economy’s recovery momentum.**
Services activities registers a faster rate of expansion which reduced the
impact of a mild deceleration in the manufacturing, as indicated by the
higher PMI reading for the JP Morgan Global All-Industry Output Index of
54.5 in October from 53.3 in the previous month.

  - In its October 2021 WEO Update, the IMF lowered its growth projection for

2021 compared to its July 2021 WEO forecasts, citing the worsening
pandemic dynamics and the prolonged supply chain disruptions. At the
same time, balance of risks to the global growth outlook remains tilted to
the downside in view of rising inflation and an abrupt tightening of global
financial conditions, continued volatility in financial markets, and worries
over the possible emergence of more transmissible and fatal COVID-19
variants.
