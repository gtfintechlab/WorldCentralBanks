**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 2 JULY 2003[∗]**


**Background**

The Monetary Board held its eighth meeting for the year on monetary
policy issues on 2 July 2003. This was preceded by the meeting of the
Advisory Committee[1] on 1 July 2003. Given the information presented by the
Advisory Committee during the meeting, the members of the Monetary Board
deliberated on the merits of the various policy options available to the BSP.
The Monetary Board’s monetary policy decision was based on their
assessment on the implications of macroeconomic and financial
developments on the country’s inflation outlook and growth prospects.

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

� Headline inflation decelerated to 2.7 percent in May 2003 from 2.8
percent in the previous month and 3.6 percent in the same month a year
ago. This reflected the continued absence of significant demand-pull
pressures on prices as well as the impact of positive supply-side factors
particularly, the pass through effect of lower fuel prices. Similarly, the
BSP’s measure of core inflation slowed down in May to 2.4 percent from
the previous month’s 2.5 percent, reflecting the lack of demand pressures
on consumer prices.

� Going forward, the Monetary Board maintains its view that both demand
and supply factors point to subdued price conditions. For 2003, the
average annual inflation is expected to be way below the Government’s
target of 4.5-5.5 percent. For 2004, average inflation is expected to be
broadly in line with the 4-5 percent target.

∗ The highlights of the discussions of the 2 July 2003 Monetary Board meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its meeting held on 7 August 2003.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy
Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the Managing Director, In-Charge of Research and the
Director of the Treasury Department.

� Latest available indicators of economic activity generally pointed to
overall sluggishness in aggregate demand conditions. This supports the
view that demand-side influences on prices are likely to remain tamed.

� The growth in the volume of production index (VOPI) for
manufacturing slowed down to 1.2 percent (revised) year-on-year in
April from a 6.9 percent (revised) increase in the previous month.
Similarly, the increase in the value of production index (VAPI) for
manufacturing decelerated to 8.6 percent (revised) in April from 17.8
percent (revised) a month ago.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing for April declined to 77.5
percent from 80.1 percent (revised) in the previous month.

� External demand for Philippine goods likewise appeared to be
moderate. Merchandise exports fell by 1.8 percent in April following
an 8.6 percent increase in March.

� Improvements in the demand for credit continued but at a slower
pace. Commercial bank lending rose for the eighth consecutive
month, rising by 3.0 percent year-on-year in April 2003. This was,
however, a deceleration from the 3.2-percent increase in the previous
month.

� Other indicators for demand showed similar signs of weakness. For
instance, electricity sales by Meralco slowed to 5.4 percent year-onyear in April from a 10.8 percent-growth in the previous month.
Passenger car sales declined sharply by 37.7 percent year-on-year in
May 2003 following an increase of 8.6 percent in the preceding
month.

� The supply-side risks to inflation have weakened significantly with the end
of the El Niño weather phenomenon and the decline in international crude
oil prices relative to pre-US-Iraq war levels.

� Food prices remained stable given that the El Niño has receded along
with the onset of the rainy season. The risk of the possible entry of the
La Niña weather disturbance was still being assessed.

� Despite the uptick in world crude oil prices due to production cut by
OPEC, domestic pump prices of petroleum products remained
unchanged from their end-May levels. Moreover, the domestic oil

industry inventory level remained substantial at around 68 days[2] of
supply. This was a carry over of the large reserves build-up by
domestic oil companies in compliance with the government’s oil
contingency plan during the pre-Iraq war episode.

� Recent developments in the electric power sector—particularly, the
relatively small increase in Meralco’s unbundled selling rate as well as
the reduction in rates by several electric cooperatives—implied an
evident but minimal impact on inflation. Meanwhile, the
implementation of a refund by Meralco could help ease inflation
expectations.

� Treasury bill (T-bill) rates continued to decline. During the Bureau of
Treasury’s (BTr) 23 June 2003 auction, the benchmark 91-day T-bill rate
fell to 5.498 percent from 5.666 percent in the previous auction. This
resulted into narrower RP-US interest rate differentials as US interest
rates were generally steady for the review period until the Fed cut its key
target rate by 25 basis points on 24-25 June 2003.

� There was continued excess liquidity in the system as indicated by
oversubscriptions of T-bill offerings, decline in Interbank Call Loan (IBCL)
rates and higher bank placements with the BSP. The bids for T-bills have
been oversubscribed by an average of P4.6 billion per auction for the
period January-May 2003. Meanwhile, financial and banking institutions
have been net lenders in the interbank market since January 2003. In
June, the average number of lenders was 9 compared to the average
number of borrowers, which stood at 6. The average IBCL rate also
declined further in June. From a high of 7.1947 percent in April, the
average IBCL rate continued to fall to reach 7.0625 percent in the second
week of June. Moreover, bank placements with the BSP have continued
to expand in June relative to their levels in May. Preliminary estimate of
domestic liquidity growth in May also showed an improvement to 4.0
percent from the 2.5 percent annual rise in April.

� On a nominal basis, the peso depreciated against the US dollar in June
due to increased corporate demand and weakening regional currencies.
Similarly, on a real and trade-weighted basis, the peso also weakened
against the basket of currencies of our competitor countries, implying an
improvement in the country’s external competitiveness.

� The National Government (NG) deficit for the January-May period at
P75.4 billion was 29.9 percent lower compared to the P107.5 billion deficit
posted for the same period last year. The better-than-expected
developments put fiscal performance well on track and generated positive
sentiment in the financial market. This should augur well for growth and
price conditions, going forward.

� World economic activity remained subdued. The US economy has yet to
exhibit sustainable growth while economic conditions in other major
economies suggested that the pace of a global recovery may still be
sluggish.

� In the US, there have been some signs of economic improvements
particularly, in business sentiment. Retail trade and food services
sales for May increased by 0.1 percent from the previous month and
was up by 5.1 percent from its year-ago level. Likewise,
manufacturing activity displayed an improvement in May as indicated
by the rise in ISM manufacturing index to 49.5 in May from 45.4 the
previous month. However, there were indications that consumer
sentiment in the US was still relatively weak. The Conference Board's
Consumer Confidence Index remained relatively stable at 83.5 in
June after a moderate improvement in May to 83.6 from 81.0 in April.[3]
Meanwhile, the closely-watched University of Michigan sentiment
index slipped to 87.2 in June from  92.1 in the previous month after
rising in the past two months.[4] Moreover, despite the positive news on
retail sales and manufacturing, US unemployment rate edged up in
May to 6.1 percent from 6.0 percent in the previous month.

� In the Euro zone, the overall economic activity remained restrained.
The European Central Bank (ECB) noted that economic growth in the
first half of 2003 was likely to be very weak and that expectations for
growth for the whole year of 2003 as well as for 2004 continued to
be subdued.[5]

� The UK economy slowed down in the first quarter as household
spending decelerated and investment declined. This could be

attributed, in part, to the slowdown in real disposable income and
incipient cooling of the housing market.

� In Japan, the quarter-on-quarter growth of real GDP was virtually flat
at 0.1 percent in the first quarter of 2003 following a 0.5 percent rise in
the fourth quarter of 2002. Deflationary conditions remained as the fall
in consumer prices has been sustained in the last 6 years since April
1998.

� With a generally favorable outlook on inflation, the recent monetary policy
actions of the major central banks have remained stimulative to spur
sustainable economic recovery. During their respective June 2003
monetary policy meetings, the US Fed and the ECB have decided to ease
their stance by reducing their key target rates.[6] Meanwhile, both the Bank
of England and the Bank of Japan have maintained their monetary policy
guidelines.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� During the Monetary Board’s discussion on the implication for the BSP’s
monetary policy stance of the prevailing macroeconomic and price
environment, the members of the Monetary Board highlighted the
following points:

� Going forward, both demand and supply factors point to subdued
price conditions.

� The main inflationary risks that were considered in setting the targets
for 2003 and 2004 have diminished significantly.

� The current monetary conditions and other economic developments
as well as continued easing in foreign interest rates led by the 25basis point cut in the federal funds target rate by the US provided
added flexibility for the BSP to ease the stance while remaining
cautious of possible resurgence of inflationary threats.

� Easing further the current monetary policy settings would help build
up momentum for economic activity. By contrast, a further delay in
easing monetary policy settings may risk the prospects for a sustained
upturn in economic activity such that later monetary easing moves

might be less able to support growth. However, the members of the
Monetary Board underscored the need for caution against excessive
easing which may not lead to an appreciable improvement in credit
growth and economic activity.

� Based on these observations, the Monetary Board evaluated several
alternative monetary policy moves. In particular, the members of the
Monetary Board deliberated on the advantages and disadvantages of the
following options:

� Maintaining the current monetary policy settings;

� Reducing the BSP’s key policy rates by 25 basis points;

� Reducing the regular reserve requirement by one-percentage point; or

� Reducing the liquidity reserve requirement by one-percentage point.

� Maintaining the current monetary policy settings

Some members of the Monetary Board noted that maintaining the current
monetary policy settings could help preserve the relative stability in the
foreign exchange market. However, given evidence of weakness in
domestic demand conditions and benign inflationary setting, some
members of the Monetary Board also noted that current monetary policy
stance might risk being too tight. Holding the key rates steady could delay
the stimulatory impact toward a sustainable growth path.

� Reducing the BSP’s key policy rates by 25 basis points

Based on BSP’s estimate, a reduction in the BSP’s policy rates by 25
basis points could lower intermediation cost by about 3.7 basis points.
Majority of the seven-member Monetary Board were of the view that a
policy rate cut could ease further the market interest rates, which in turn,
could help enhance credit demand to support economic activity. All
members of the Monetary Board shared the view that a reduction in the
key policy rates would provide a clear-cut sign to the market that the BSP
would like to see lower interest rates. Relative to a reduction in banks’
reserve requirements (either regular or liquidity reserves), the members of
the Monetary Board pointed out that a reduction in the BSP’s policy rates
would not necessarily translate into an unwarranted expansion in liquidity
in the system. In addition, they also stressed that this measure was not
expected to lead to capital outflows as interest rate differentials would just
be maintained.

� Reducing the regular reserve requirement by one-percentage point

The Monetary Board noted that a one-percentage point reduction in the
regular reserve requirement could lead into higher savings for banks as
this could reduce intermediation cost estimated at 6.5 basis points.
However, all the members of the Monetary Board pointed out that
reducing the reserve requirement would infuse additional liquidity into a
system, which already has ample liquidity. They expressed concern over
the possibility that the excess liquidity could find its way into the foreign
exchange market. This could induce some volatility in the exchange rate,
which in turn, could lead to a build-up of inflationary pressures. Moreover,
it would be costly on the part of the BSP to mop up the resulting excess
liquidity.

� Reducing the liquidity reserve requirement by one-percentage point

The members of the Monetary Board explored the possibility of a
reduction in the liquidity reserve requirement. They argued that a
reduction in the liquidity reserve requirement could lower intermediation
cost by about 1.8 basis point. Relative to a reduction in the regular
reserve requirement, the Monetary Board also noted that it would be less
costly for the BSP to mop up the excess liquidity that could result from
this policy move since reserve-eligible government securities that would
be purchased back by the BSP earn market interest rates.

� Other comments raised by the Monetary Board members:

� All members of the Monetary Board noted that the implementation of
any of the above policy easing options should not translate into a
breach of the inflation targets over the policy horizon. This was based
on the estimates presented by the Advisory Committee.

� Given a benign inflationary setting, all members of the Monetary
Board were of the view that the BSP has the flexibility to ease further
the monetary settings to help spur domestic economic activity.

� All members of the Monetary Board shared the view that the current
reserve requirements should be maintained. The members of the
Monetary Board agreed that a reduction in either the regular or
liquidity reserve requirement could lead to unnecessary infusion of
additional liquidity into the market.

� Some members of the Monetary Board initially raised concerns
over the possible implications on the exchange rate of lowering the

BSP’s policy rates which could translate into increased inflation
expectations. However, following a discussion of the possible
exchange rate pass-through, the members recognized that a 25
basis point-cut in the BSP’s policy rates would only have minimal
impact on the peso-dollar rate. This is inasmuch  as the interest
rate differentials with the US can be maintained since the proposed
policy rate reduction would match exactly the 25 basis cut in the
federal funds target rate following the meeting of the US Fed on 24-25
June 2003.

� Moreover, a member of the Monetary Board emphasized that there is
room to ease policy rates given a subdued inflationary conditions,
consistent with the framework of inflation targeting.

� A member of the Monetary Board noted that the key policy rates have
remained relatively stable since the establishment of the BSP in 1993.
A reduction of the overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) rate by 25
basis point to 6.75 percent would thus bring the overnight RRP rate to
its lowest level since May 1992.

**III.  Monetary Policy Decision**

� After a careful assessment of the balance of risks on inflation and
inflationary expectations and the evolving domestic demand conditions,
the Monetary Board, by a unanimous vote, decided to reduce the BSP’s
overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and overnight repurchase (RP)
rate by 25 basis points to 6.75 percent and 9.0 percent, respectively. For
banks’ placements with the BSP under the overnight RRP window, the
interest rates were set as follows:

(1) First P5 billion      - 6.75 percent;
(2) Over P5 billion-P10 billion      -  3.75 percent; and
(3) Over P10 billion      - 0.75 percent.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting was scheduled on 31 July 2003.
