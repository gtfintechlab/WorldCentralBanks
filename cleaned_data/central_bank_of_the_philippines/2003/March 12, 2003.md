**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES  HELD ON 13 MARCH 2003[∗]**


**Background**

The Monetary Board held its third meeting for the year on
monetary policy issues on 13 March 2003. This followed the Advisory
Committee meeting held on 11 March 2003.[1] The Advisory Committee
submitted for the Monetary Board’s consideration a policy paper
focusing on the developments in various key macroeconomic and
financial indicators and their implications on the inflation and inflation
outlook. In particular, the policy paper contained a comprehensive
discussion of the emerging trend in the agriculture sector, foreign
exchange market, oil prices, user charges in utilities, interest rates,
domestic credit conditions and other key demand indicators as well as
the developments and outlook in the world economy. During the 13
March 2003 meeting of the Monetary Board, the said policy paper
served as the basis for the Monetary Board’s discussion and
assessment for the appropriate monetary policy stance.

**I. Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

**Domestic Price Developments and Outlook**

**1. Year-on-year headline inflation rose to 3.1 percent in February 2003**
from 2.7 percent in the previous month. Average headline inflation for
the first two months of 2003 at 2.9 percent was lower compared to the
6.8 percent average recorded during the same period last year and the
4.5-5.5 percent target for the year. The increase in February was traced
to higher year-on-year inflation rates for food items such as fish, fruits
and vegetables, meat and dairy products as well as increases in

∗ The highlights of the discussions of the 13 March 2003 Monetary Board meeting were
approved by the Monetary Board during its meeting held on 14 April 2003.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and
four members, namely the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research
and Treasury, the Deputy Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the
Managing Director, In-Charge of Research and the Director of the Treasury Department.

petroleum prices, which fed into the fuel, light and water (FLW), and
services components of the CPI basket. Similarly, estimates of core
inflation showed a slight increase during the month. The BSP’s main
measure of core inflation rose to 2.7 percent in February from 2.6
percent in the previous month, and averaged 2.6 percent for the first two
months.[2]

**2. The overall strength of aggregate demand may be gauged from the**
mixed trends in various indicators of economic activity. For example, the
growth in the MISSI Value of Production Index (VAPI) for manufacturing
slowed down to 0.6 percent year-on-year in December 2002 following a
4.6 percent rise in November. Meanwhile, the Volume of Production
Index (VOPI) continued to decline in December, falling by 5.0 percent
year-on-year compared to a 0.9 percent decline in the previous month.
Spare capacity in manufacturing remained as capacity utilization
declined slightly further to 74.8 percent in December 2002 from 75.2
percent in the previous month. Moreover, labor conditions remained soft
as unemployment reached 10.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2002, up
from the 9.8 percent recorded a year ago. Meanwhile, the contraction in
passenger car sales slowed to 3.6 percent in January 2003 from 14.8
percent in December 2002. Power consumption also showed an
improvement in the form of faster year-on-year growth of 11.6 percent in
January from 4.7 percent in December 2002. A recovery in credit
demand has also been observed as bank lending  increased by 2.4
percent, year-on-year in December 2002, reflecting the fourth
consecutive month of year-on-year growth.

**_Movements in overall inflation remain confined to specific_**
**_components of the CPI basket (notably food and fuel) rather than_**
**_to broad price changes across commodity groups. This suggests_**
**_that current pressures are driven mainly by supply-side factors,_**
**_which may be transitory. On the whole, therefore, current price_**
**_trends continue to underlie expectations of a generally subdued_**
**_inflation environment going forward. The favorable inflation_**
**_outlook has been supported by an appropriately prudent monetary_**
**_policy stance of the BSP._**

2 The BSP’s measure of core inflation abstracts from  the effects of temporary
disturbances on headline CPI by excluding food and fuel components, which comprise
25.5 percent of the CPI basket.

**Developments in Agriculture**

**3.** Agricultural production is expected to grow by 3.0-4.0 percent in
2003 despite an anticipated drop in rice production in the second
semester due to farmers’ expectations of the lingering effect of the El
Niño. Standing _palay crops are expected to yield 3.2 million metric tons_
(MT) of rice for January to March 2003—about 4.9 percent higher than a
year ago—due to the favorable weather in the last quarter of 2002. A
positive first-quarter growth of 21.4 percent for corn production (2.1
million MT) is likewise expected due to the expansion in area planted
and increase in yield with the use of higher-yielding varieties.
Meanwhile, based on farmers’ planting intentions, the expected harvests
during the second quarter of 2003 may decline by 8.6 percent for _palay_
(2.4 million MT) and 9.3 percent for corn (749,000 MT).[3]

**4. To mitigate the impact of El Niño on agricultural production in 2003,**
the Department of Agriculture (DA) has allocated some P700 million for
the following activities: (1) providing irrigation facilities and cloud
seeding; (2) shifting of planting calendars or early planting; (3) planting
of early maturing crops requiring less water and/or more tolerant to
drought; (4) providing livelihood assistance to compensate for loss of
income from farm and fishery; and (5) emergency food assistance.

**5. The government’s rice importation program could also help cushion**
the adverse impact of the El Niño phenomenon on domestic supply.
Total rice import requirement under the new system of importation for
2003 is estimated at 800 thousand MT for 2003.[4] As of 24 February
2003, the total rice imports reached 33,742 MT. Meanwhile, the national
rice inventory of 2.45 million MT as of 4 March 2003 is sufficient to last
for 93 days.[5] Of this stock, the share of the National Food Authority
(NFA) amounting to 749.6 thousand MT (about 31 percent) is sufficient
to last for 28 days.

November 2002
4 This is being implemented by the NFA under the letter circular dated 10 December
2002, which amended the NFA Council Resolution No. 14-2K2 dated October 2002.[4]
Under the new circular, all rice importations other than NFA’s shall be covered by letters
of credit (LCs) to be opened initially only with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).
5 The national rice inventory consists of NFA palay and rice stocks as well as
commercial and household inventories.  Rice self-sufficiency is estimated based on the
daily consumption of 26.4 thousand MT of rice. (Source: NFA)

**6.** In addition to the ongoing government programs, the NFA has also
launched “Oplan Paghahanda” aimed at addressing food security in the
event of war. Under this program, the NFA has started to intensify its
procurement and milling of palay to ensure the availability of high quality
rice for emergency and stabilization purposes and to augment the rice
stocks in high consumption areas such as Manila, Cebu and Davao.

**_The lingering El Niño weather phenomenon could impact_**
**_adversely on the production of rice and corn. However, various_**
**_government measures have been undertaken to mitigate the_**
**_impact of dry weather conditions. These measures are expected_**
**_to yield favorable harvests, indicating that prices of agricultural_**
**_products could be relied upon to remain relatively stable in the_**
**_near term._**

**Exchange rate developments**

**7. The peso weakened further against the US dollar, averaging at**
P54.11/US$1 for the period 1-28 February 2003 compared to the
P53.59/US$1 average in January 2002. As of 7 March 2003, the peso
dipped to a 25-month low of  P54.847/US$1 amid rising security
concerns in the South. Moreover, uncertainties over the escalating
tensions in the Middle East, higher dollar requirements by local oil
companies and the corporate sector as well as apprehensions over
possible global sanctions on the Philippines of the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF)—prior to the amendment of the Anti-Money Laundering
Law—weighed down on the local currency.  However, the peso was
less volatile  during the period 1-7 March 2003 as the standard
deviation in the daily exchange rate averaged P0.15 compared to P0.19
in February 2003.

**8. On a real, trade-weighted basis, the peso continued to slightly**
depreciate relative to the currencies of the major trading partners by 2.7
percent in February 2003 from its level in December 2002, as shown in
the real effective exchange rate (REER) index.[6] The peso also showed
a similar depreciation trend over the same period vis-à-vis the two sets

6 The basket of the major trading partners is composed of the currencies of the US,
Japan, the euro area and the United Kingdom. The broad basket of competitor
countries is composed of the currencies of Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong while the narrow basket is composed of the
currencies of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand only.

of currencies of the Philippines’ competitor countries. The REER for the
broad and narrow baskets of competitor currencies declined by about
3.0 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively. These developments
indicated an improvement in the country’s external price
competitiveness.

**9. The possibility that the depreciation of the peso could persist for**
some time poses a risk to future inflation and inflation expectations.
There are, however, indications of spare capacity in the economy as
reflected by the fairly modest level of average capacity utilization in
manufacturing—at 74.8 percent in December 2002—and relatively
high unemployment rate of 10.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2002.
These indicators suggest that the pass-through coefficient for the
exchange rate may be relatively low in the near-term  estimated at
about 0.15 percentage point increase in the average annual rate of
inflation for every one peso depreciation of the exchange rate.
Moreover, the impact of a currency depreciation on oil and non-oil
imports may be mitigated by the fact that current import demand is
relatively low and the country has reduced its dependence on imported
oil in the last few years[7] Nevertheless, the possibility of a sustained
currency depreciation in amidst a difficult geopolitical environment
presents a concern for monetary authorities since this could lead to
increased inflationary expectations.

**_The nominal depreciation of the peso translated into real_**
**_depreciation as measured by the decline in the average REER in_**
**_March_** **_2003_** **_from_** **_December_** **_2002,_** **_which_** **_indicates_** **_an_**
**_improvement in external competitiveness._** **_Meanwhile,_** **_the pass-_**
**_through impact of a peso depreciation on inflation  could be_**
**_limited in the near-term due to the presence of spare capacity in_**
**_the economy and the relative decline in the dependence on oil_**
**_imports. However, the possibility of a sustained episode of_**
**_depreciation could threaten the inflation target which, in turn,_**
**_deserves a close watch by monetary authorities._**

7 For example, the share of imported oil in the total energy mix for the Philippines has
already declined to an estimated 39 percent in 2002 from 63 percent in 1990 and is
expected to fall further to about 38 percent in 2003.

**Oil price developments**

**10.** The price of Dubai crude in the international market continued to
rise since the end of 2002, averaging at US$30.02 per barrel in
February 2003 or about 7.1 percent higher than the January 2003 level
and 16.7 percent higher than  December 2002 level.  World oil prices
continued to be volatile due to falling commercial crude oil stocks in the
US and rising fears over the impact of the US-led war against Iraq on
Middle East oil supplies.[8]

**11.** The higher world oil prices translated into increased retail prices of
local petroleum products. Domestic oil companies raised their pump
prices in the first week of March 2003 for the fifth time since the
beginning of the year bringing the total increase in petroleum prices to
P2.23 per liter for gasoline products, P1.34-P1.51 per liter for other fuel
products and P1.51 per liter for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
Meanwhile, local oil companies have intensified efforts to build up
their inventory levels in compliance to the government’s directive aimed
at ensuring adequate domestic supply in light of the war in the Middle
East. As of 4 March 2003, the estimated oil inventory level of domestic
oil companies was equivalent to about 70 days’ consumption.[9] This was
more than the 15-30 days required oil inventory level.

**_Rising_** **_costs_** **_of_** **_crude_** **_imports—due_** **_to_** **_geopolitical_**
**_conditions—have translated into a series of upward adjustments in_**
**_domestic pump prices of oil. This, in turn, could present risks  to_**
**_the inflation outlook since oil is an input to production of most_**
**_goods and services._**

**Developments in the Utilities Sector**

**12. In an order dated 24 February 2003, the Energy Regulatory**
Commission (ERC) approved the Implementing Rules for the adoption
of new cost-recovery mechanisms. The generation rate adjustment
mechanism (GRAM) and the incremental currency exchange adjustment
(ICERA)—which will replace the purchased power adjustment (PPA)
and currency exchange rate adjustment (CERA)—will effectively remove

automatic adjustments by distribution utilities. The new recovery
mechanisms require distribution utilities to file a petition with the ERC
before introducing a rate adjustment to recover costs. The new schemes
also call for quarterly cost-recovery related adjustments in electricity
rates in contrast to the old schemes, which allowed adjustments on a
monthly basis. Distribution utilities are expected to implement these
deferred recovery mechanisms once their rates are unbundled.[10]

**13.  The ERC is expected to release the Meralco’s rate unbundling**
petition soon.[11] However, power rates may eventually increase with the
recomputation of Meralco’s revenue requirements using a new base
year and the inclusion of the company’s under-recovered PPA charges
in the computation of the new unbundled rates.[12]

**14. The upward pressures on the power rates could be mitigated**
should the Supreme Court uphold its 15 November 2002 decision on
Meralco’s overcharging case.[13] Meralco has filed an appeal on the said
case. Moreover, the implementation of the Special Program to Enhance
Electricity Demand (SPEED) and the planned establishment of the

Currency Exchange Recovery Adjustment (ICERA),“ ERC Case No. 2003-44, 24
February 2003, available at http://www.erc.gov.ph
11 The ERC released its decision on Meralco’s rate unbundling petition on 20 March
2003. Although the unbundling of power rates per se is not expected to increase nor
decrease the rates, the use of a new test year (FY 2000 as prescribed in the Uniform
Filing Requirements) could change the existing rate levels. (Source: ERC, Unbundling of
Rates, available at http://www.erc.gov.ph)
12 In its order dated 19 December 2002, the ERC authorized Meralco to collect its underrecovered purchased power adjustment (PPA) charges amounting P5.8 billion. The ERC
said that the “collection should be through the inclusion of the amortized amount as part
of the unbundled generation rate schedule to be approved by the commission in ERC
Case Nos. 2001-646 and 2001-900”. (Source: ERC, Order on Meralco’s application for
the approval of the rate schedule to implement the NPC rate reduction, ERC Case No.
2001-383 (ERB Case No. 97-18), 19 December 2002, available at
http://www.erc.gov.ph)
13 In its decision issued on 15 November 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that Meralco
should implement a rate adjustment of P0.017 per kwh (instead of the original P0.184
per kwh) and reimburse Meralco’s customers or credit in their favor for future
consumption the “overcharged” average amount of P0.167 per kwh with respect to
Meralco’s billing cycles beginning February 1994 to February 1998. (Source: Supreme

Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) would also likely bring down
power rates.[14]

**15. The Manila Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) approved**
a staggered water tariff adjustment for both Manila Water Company and
Maynilad Water Services, Inc. Since 1 January 2003, Manila Water has
started to implement a P4.25 per cubic meter increase in its weighted
average all-in water tariff. The next phase of the approved water rate
adjustment will be in 2005. Meanwhile, Maynilad has not yet
implemented the MWSS-approved P5.35 per cubic meter increase in its
weighted average all-in water tariff as it has already tendered a notice of
early termination of its concession agreement with the government.

**_the CPI._**

**Interest rates and interest rate differentials**

**16. The auction rate on the 91-day T-bill rose further to 6.097 percent**
on 3 March 2003 from 5.672 percent a month earlier amid market
concerns over the repercussions of the possible war in the Middle East.
Similarly, yields for the 182-day T-bill rate and the 364-day T-bill rate
increased to 6.87 percent and 7.89 percent, respectively, from 6.6
percent and 7.609 percent. Nevertheless, the auction for T-bills and Tbonds have continued to attract oversubscription in bids from banks,
indicating ample liquidity in the financial system.

14 The  SPEED is a price incentive scheme for large end-users of electricity
whereby discounts are provided to industrial and commercial customers for
incremental use of energy above a specified base load. Meanwhile, the WESM is a
spot market for the trading of electricity in which power generation companies
(gencos) submit their offers to sell electricity to distribution utilities at their desired
price. Distribution utilities, in turn, submit their demand  requirements to a market
operator who is assigned to match the supply and demand for power. The Electric
Power  Industry  Reform Act of 2001 (R.A. 9136) requires the Department of
Energy (DOE) to  establish the WESM in  coordination  with  electric power
industry participants to ensure greater supply and rational pricing of electricity.

**17.** As of 3 March 2003, the differentials between the RP 91-day T-bill
rate (net of withholding tax) and the 90-day LIBOR and US 90-day T-bill
rate widened to 353.8 basis points and 368.8 basis points, respectively,
from the 318.8 basis points and 337.4 basis points registered in 3
February 2003.[15]

**18. The differential between the BSP’s policy interest rate (overnight**
borrowing or RRP rate) and the US federal funds target rate was
unchanged at 575 basis points as the BSP policy rates and the US
federal funds target rate remained steady at their 15 March 2002 and 6
November 2002 levels, respectively.

**19. Adjusted for the risk premium (measured by the differential between**
the 10-year ROP note and the 10-year US Treasury note), the
differential between the BSP policy interest rate and the US federal
funds target rate narrowed to 27 basis points as of 3 March 2003. This
developed as the risk premium  on the 10-year ROP increased while
the yield of the 10-year US Treasury note declined. The  increase in
the 10-year ROP yield can be traced to higher risk aversion of
investors from less than investment grade papers amidst the ongoing
geopolitical conflict in Iraq.

**_The differentials between RP and US interest rates continued_**
**_to widen in March as the rising benchmark RP T-bill rate was_**
**_accompanied by relatively steady foreign interest rates.  The_**
**_uptrend in the 91-day T-bill rate—despite ample liquidity in the_**
**_system and the past interest rate easing in the BSP’s policy_**
**_rates—was driven largely by geopolitical uncertainties surrounding_**
**_the war in Iraq._**

**20. During the period 20-26 February 2003, the Philippines’ real lending**
rate (based on the low-end of the range of banks’ lending rates) rose
anew to 5.9 percent from the 5.51 percent registered during the review
period 23-29 January 2003.[16] The uptick in the RP real lending rate
could be traced primarily to the rise in the lower end of the range of
banks’ lending rates. At 5.9 percent, the Philippines’ real lending rate
stayed within the midrange among a sample of Asian countries.

**_The Philippine real lending rate inched up but remained_**
**_within midrange in the Asian region._**

**21. The yield curve for government securities in the secondary market**
on 3 March 2003 shifted upward relative to that which prevailed on 3
February 2003.[17 ] The yields rose across all tenors reflecting the uptrend
of interest rates in the primary market. Relative to selected countries in
Asia, the yields for Philippine instruments for 1-10 year maturities are
generally higher compared to those in Malaysia and Taiwan but are
comparable with those of Indonesia.

**_The upward shift in the yield curve for government securities_**
**_in the secondary market mirrored the uptrend of interest rates in_**
**_the primary market associated with the growing concerns over the_**
**_conflict in the Middle East._**

**Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

**22.** Domestic liquidity (M3) grew by 7.7 percent year-on-year to reach
P1.7 trillion as of end-January 2003. The sustained expansion in the
net foreign assets (NFA) of the monetary system and the improvements
in the levels of domestic credits of both the public and private sectors—
supported by the recovery in bank lending—contributed to the rise in
M3.

**23. Growth in the total volume of outstanding loans of commercial**
banks (KBs) accelerated to 4.4 percent year-on-year as of end-January
2003 compared to 2.4 percent in the previous month. This reflected the
fifth consecutive month of positive growth in bank lending. Moreover, the
7.7 percent year-on-year growth in bank lending to the manufacturing
sector in January marked the second straight month of increase after 17
months of consecutive year-on-year contractions.

**24. Banks continued to place funds with the BSP. The total volume of**
banks’ placements under the RRP window reached P80.8 billion as of 4
March 2003, lower by P3.5 billion from the end-February level.
Meanwhile, banks placements in SDAs as of 4 March 2003 reached
P1.3 billion, up by P99.0 million from end-February level.

**Domestic stock market developments**

**25.** Activity in the Philippine stock market remained bearish as the
average PHISIX in February 2003 slipped further by 15.7 index points to
1,031 from the previous month’s average of 1,046.7. Investors
continued to be sidelined and opted to stay liquid as the local bourse
faced a series of negative developments. In particular, uncertainties
surrounding the Middle East crisis, the possible sanctions that the FATF
could impose on the Philippines (prior to the passing of the amendments
to the Anti-Money Laundering Act), the continuing weakness of the peso
against the dollar and indications of increasing domestic interest rates
have weakened investors’ appetite for stocks. In addition, domestic
security concerns following the spate of bombings in the Southern
Philippines also weighed down on the market.

**_A generally cautious environment prevailed in the local_**
**_stock market due to persistent domestic and external concerns,_**
**_which tended to overshadow some evidence of improvements in_**
**_the domestic economy, such as the modest growth in bank lending_**
**_and continued growth in consumer demand._**

**Fiscal developments**

**26. For the month of January 2003, the budget deficit of the National**
Government (NG) was recorded at P13.9 billion, lower than the P15.0
billion budget gap recorded in the same month a year ago. The strict
enforcement of revenue reform measures and prudent expenditure
management policies during the month helped keep the fiscal deficit
within target. The revenue reform measures included, among others,
the strengthening of anti-graft measures at the BIR and the closure of
customs bonded warehouses involved in anomalous transactions.

**Developments and outlook in the rest of the world**

**27.** Recent economic data  in the advanced  economies continued
to point to a hesitant and uneven US-led economic recovery. The
growth in industrial production has been sluggish, labor markets
remained soft and other leading indicators have weakened.  Output
growth  has decelerated  as consumer and business sentiment
weakened.   Based on the revised data from the US Department of
Commerce, US GDP grew by 1.4 percent year-on-year in real terms
during the fourth quarter of 2002. This marked a deceleration from the
4.0 percent year-on-year rise in the previous quarter. Consumption
expenditures, which account for about two-thirds of GDP, rose by only
1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, sharply lower than the 4.2 percent
expansion registered in the previous quarter and the slowest since the
third quarter of 2001 following the 11 September events.[18]  Moreover,
the University of Michigan’s (UM) index of consumer sentiment dropped
from 82.4 in January 2003 to 79.9 in February 2003, the lowest since
1993.[19] The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) index of
manufacturing declined further by 3.4 percent to 50.5 percent in
February from 53.9 percent in January 2003.[20] US unemployment edged
up to 5.8 percent in February from 5.7 percent in  the previous month.
With generally benign inflation in a weak domestic and external
environment, analysts are of the view that the Fed is likely to keep rates
steady in the near term or even turn more accommodative.

**28.  Economic activity also remained sluggish in the euro area.**
Euroland real GDP grew by 1.3 percent year-on-year in the fourth
quarter in 2002 from 0.9 percent in the previous quarter.[21] Geopolitical
tensions and rising oil prices have continued to dampen consumer and
business confidence and undermined the growth prospects in the euro
area.  In view of the need to provide stimulus for growth without

jeopardizing the medium-term prospects for growth and inflation, the
Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) voted to cut the
benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.5 percent in its last
meeting on 6 March 2003. The ECB Governing Council also indicated
that it stands ready to cut interest rates again should economic
prospects worsen.[22] Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, the Monetary
Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England (BOE) kept the
benchmark repo rate steady at a 48-year low of 3.75 percent during its
meeting on 6 March 2003 after the 25-basis point cut a month ago. The
MPC has revised downwards its outlook for growth in the UK economy
over the next two years due mainly to weaker prospects for the world
economy, further falls in equity prices as well as business investment.[23]
Despite the growing evidence of a slowing economy and the spectre of
war in Iraq, the MPC decided to maintain the key policy rate to cushion
price pressures and keep inflation within the 2.5 target over the mediumterm while keeping a close watch for signals that may show signs that
the cooling economy could worsen.”[24]

**29. Meanwhile, data on Japan was mixed, indicating mainly that the**
economic recovery that had been apparent in 2002 seems to have
faltered. According to the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the Japanese economy
is unlikely to show clear signs of recovery for some time as business
investment remains weak and as high levels of  unemployment and
debt persist.[25] During its monetary policy meeting held on 5 March 2003,
the Policy Board of the BOJ voted unanimously to increase its current
account balance target[26] to a range of 17-22 trillion yen beginning April
2003 from 15-20 trillion yen.[27]

monetary policy stance to support domestic economic activity as the

balanced of risks weighed heavily on the weakness in their respective
domestic economies combined with heightened geopolitical
uncertainties. Despite some price pressures, the BOE and the ECB
have  eased monetary policy, recognizing that such pressures
emanating the recent upturn in oil prices may be temporary. Both central
banks noted that the current easing are consistent with the  mediumterm objectives for growth and inflation. In the other Asian economies,
the Monetary Policy Committees of the  Bank of Thailand (BOT) and
the Bank of Korea (BOK) decided to maintain their policy rates during
their  respective meetings on 3 and 6 March 2003.[28]  Despite higher
crude oil prices which are exerting some pressures on  consumer
prices, the BOK decided to keep its benchmark overnight call rate at
4.25 percent to support economic activity as investors’ sentiment have
weakened and geopolitical developments have reduced the prospects of
early recovery in the global economy. Similarly, the BOT maintained the
14-day repurchase rate at 1.75 percent to keep the momentum for
economic growth in Thailand given the external uncertainties with
respect to the recovery of industrial economies, higher oil prices and
increased volatility in the financial markets.[29]

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

**31.** During the Monetary Board’s discussion on the appropriate
monetary policy stance, the members of the Monetary Board shared the
view that the continuing evidence of a generally subdued inflation
environment going forward underlie expectations that average inflation
in 2003 will be broadly in line with the government’s full-year target of
4.5–5.5 percent. They pointed out that the recent movements in

headline inflation have remained largely confined to specific
components of the CPI basket—notably food and fuel, which suggests
the predominance of supply-side factors in current price movements. In
addition, they noted that the relative absence of broad price changes
across commodity groups implies that present demand conditions
remain consistent with a benign inflation setting for the future. Moreover,
an examination of the major risks to future inflation by the members of
the Monetary Board pointed mainly to cost-push influences, such as
those arising from the impact on farm prices of the El Niño phenomenon
and the escalation in world oil prices due to Middle East geopolitical
developments. These risks are for the most part expected to be
transitory.

**32. However, the members of the Monetary Board acknowledged that**
the depreciating trend of the peso against the US dollar poses risks to
future inflation and inflation expectations. They shared the view that
although present levels of unemployment and manufacturing capacity
utilization suggest that the degree of exchange rate pass-through may
be relatively low, the possibility of a sustained episode of currency
depreciation in the current geopolitical environment presents a concern
given its likely impact on inflation expectations. They noted that the risk
of higher future inflation stemming from exchange rate movements may
require a preemptive policy response to moderate the feed-through
effects on consumer prices.

**33.** The members of the Monetary Board also observed that the lack of
significant demand-side risks to inflation coincides with the continued
presence of weak areas in domestic economic activity. They argued that
the overall strength of aggregate demand remained tentative, as may be
gauged from the mixed trends in various indicators of economic activity.
They noted that labor market conditions remained soft, with sizeable
unemployment preventing strong calls from labor groups for wage
adjustments. In addition, there is still some spare  capacity in
manufacturing, suggesting that previous monetary stimulus still has
adequate room to work its way through the real sector. They
emphasized that lack of clear-cut signs of a sustained upturn in
domestic demand is complicated by indications of weaker economic
activity overseas, implying continued sluggishness in external demand.

**34.** Thus, abstracting from the possibility of a sustained exchange rate
shock, the members of the Monetary Board stressed that the near-term
risks to the inflation outlook appear to be largely contained. They

likewise expressed the view that the relative absence of demand-side
influences on the outlook for inflation and growth supports the
arguments for ensuring that liquidity conditions remain appropriate for
the domestic economy’s requirements.

**35.** In light of these considerations, discussions by the Monetary Board
revolved around the following policy questions:

a. Do the risks to the inflation outlook warrant an increase in policy
rates in order to contain a possible build-up in price pressures?

b. Given the uncertainty in domestic and external conditions and
the need to support domestic economic growth, is there scope
for further monetary easing in order to sustain the stimulus to
the economic activity?

c. Looking at both perspectives, should the policy stance remain
cautious, one that is sufficiently accommodative by ensuring
adequate liquidity to support growth while guarding firmly
against the risks to the inflation outlook, and thus maintain the
current monetary policy settings?

**36. Increase in policy rates**

In principle, the members of the Monetary Board noted that a
tighter monetary policy stance is pursued as a preemptive action
against the risks to the inflation outlook due to potential build-up of
demand-side pressures. The members of the Monetary Board argued
that monetary tightening may be necessary during periods of prolonged
exchange market pressure, when movements in the exchange rate
threaten to feed on to inflation expectations and pose a danger to the
inflation target. Moreover, given the need to assure the sustainability of
domestic economic growth, an increase in policy rates—which would
lead to higher market interest rates—could dampen incentives for
increased consumption and investments. Thus, a rise in policy rates
could derail efforts to steer the economy toward a sustainable recovery
path.

**37. Reduce policy rates**

The members of the Monetary Board expressed the view that a
further easing of the BSP’s monetary policy stance at this time, would

#                           Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas

infuse additional liquidity in the system, which already has ample
liquidity. Given that monetary policy affects inflation with a lag, a more
accommodative stance now could undermine the attainability of the
inflation target over the policy horizon. Moreover, the members of the
Monetary Board noted that the scope for reducing policy rates may be
limited by the following considerations:

� There has been substantial monetary policy easing in the past–
amounting to a cumulative 800 basis points for the period 4
December 2000-15 March 2002–which  could limit the present
scope for monetary easing.

� The relatively slow pace by which the stimulatory impact of
monetary easing becomes evident can be traced to the long lags
in monetary policy.  This implies that sufficient time should be
allowed for monetary policy actions to work its way fully to the
real sector.

� Further monetary easing, either through a reduction in the BSP’s
policy rates or in  liquidity reserve requirement would infuse
more liquidity in the system, which could fan inflation. This, in
turn, poses the risk of a sharp adjustment in interest rates later
should inflationary pressures become evident.

� A reduction in the BSP’s policy rates would narrow anew the
country’s interest rate differentials with foreign interest rates,
which could lead to greater volatility in the exchange rate and
undermine the stability of the peso. This could generate higher
inflation and fuel inflationary expectations.

**38. Maintain policy rates**

The Monetary Board expressed the view that monetary policy
should remain accommodative by providing a supportive environment,
one that ensures the availability and sufficiency of liquidity to fuel the
economy’s growth requirements. At the same time, the members of the
Monetary Board believed that monetary policy should remain cautious to
guard against any potential build-up of price pressures that could
dampen the growth momentum. The stance of the Monetary Board
was based on the following considerations:

   - The level of inflation remains consistent with the outlook of a
generally subdued inflation environment in the near term.
However, there are foreseeable risks to inflation in the months
ahead in the form of cost-push pressures arising from the
potential impact on the prices of agricultural products of the El
Niño weather disturbance, a likely further increase in oil prices
due to escalating geopolitical tensions, and an increase in
electricity and water rates.

   - The prospects for sustained economic growth going forward is
clouded by the risks of a slower-than-expected global
economic recovery and uncertainties surrounding the
geopolitical developments.

   - In the face of the current pressures in the peso, monetary policy
would need to carefully strike a balance between stabilizing the
foreign exchange market  and the likely contractionary impact
of  higher interest rates on domestic economic activity.

**III.  Monetary Policy Decision**

**39.** Based on the analysis of various indicators on the macroeconomy
and the financial sector that have become available since the review of
the BSP’s monetary policy stance by the Monetary Board on 12
February 2003 and a careful assessment of the balance of risks on
inflation and inflationary expectations, the Monetary Board believed that
the current monetary policy stance continued to be  appropriately
supportive of the economy’s growth objective while ensuring price
stability. For this reason, the Monetary Board, by a unanimous vote,
decided to approve the following measures:

a. maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 7.0
percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.25 percent
for the overnight RP (lending) rate;

b. maintain the tiering scheme on banks’ placements with the BSP
under the RRP and SDA windows;

c. maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

d. maintain the reserve requirements at their current levels given
the adequate level of liquidity in the system.

**40. However, the Monetary Board expressed growing concerns  over**
the recent movements in the exchange rate. In particular, the members
of the Monetary Board indicated their willingness in the future to
resort to monetary tightening  measures should conditions in the
foreign exchange market continue to point to a severe depreciation of
the peso which could threaten the inflation target over the policy
horizon.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting was scheduled on 10 April 2003.[30]
