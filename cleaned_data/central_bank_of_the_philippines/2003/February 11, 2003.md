**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES  HELD ON 12 FEBRUARY 2003[∗]**


**Background**

The Monetary Board held its second meeting on monetary policy issues
for the year on 12 February 2003. This followed the Advisory Committee meeting
held on 11 February 2003.[1] The Advisory Committee prepared for the Monetary
Board’s consideration a policy paper focusing on the latest readings on the
movements of various economic and financial indicators and the developments in
the world economy that could influence the Philippines’ inflation outlook and
growth prospects. This served as the basis for the Monetary Board’s discussion
and assessment for the appropriate monetary policy stance.

**I. Considerations in  the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

**Domestic Price Developments and Outlook**

**1. Year-on-year inflation rose slightly in January 2003 to 2.7 percent from 2.6**
percent a month earlier. However, inflation in January was lower than the yearago inflation of 3.8 percent. Month-on-month headline inflation in January 2003
was also higher at 0.5 percent compared to 0.4 percent in December 2002. The
increases in the prices of domestic fuel products, medicines, unregulated bus
transport fares, personal services, as well as water and electricity charges
contributed to the upward movement of consumer prices in January 2003.[2]
Meanwhile, the BSP estimates of core inflation, which take out the effects

∗ The highlights of the discussions of the 12 February 2003 Monetary Board meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its meeting held on 20 March 2003.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely
the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy Governor for
Supervision and Examination Sector, the Managing Director, In-Charge of Research or the Director of the
Department of Economic Research, and the Director of the Treasury Department.

of temporary disturbances on headline CPI by excluding food and fuel
components, slowed down to 2.6 percent in January 2003 from  2.7 percent in
the previous month. This suggested that the slight uptick in headline inflation
was influenced mainly by cost-push factors, particularly, the increase in fuel
prices.

**2.** Various indicators show continuing signs of improvement in economic
activity. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 4.6 percent in 2002, with
growth in all production sectors surpassing expectations.  In particular, domestic
demand rose significantly by 5.7 percent, year-on-year in the fourth quarter of
2002 bringing the full year growth to 2.9 percent.[3] The growth in domestic
demand was boosted mainly by robust consumption spending and the sustained
increase in government spending. Power consumption expanded by 6.4 percent in
November from only 0.9 percent in the previous month. Nevertheless, other data
pointed to weak spots in domestic demand. For example, car sales dropped by
14.8 percent, year-on-year in December 2002. Bank lending posted positive
though small year-on-year growth rates for four consecutive months until
December 2002. Capacity utilization in manufacturing also continued to be fairly
low at 75.2 percent for November 2002. Moreover, unemployment rose to 10.2
percent in the fourth quarter of 2002 as against 9.8 percent in the same period a
year ago. The presence of spare manufacturing, soft labor market conditions and
other indications of weak areas in overall demand suggest relatively mild
demand-side pressures on consumer prices in the near term.

**Despite the presence of cost-side risks, inflation is expected to stay**
**broadly in line with the government’s target range for 2003 of 4.5-5.5 percent**
**and thus, remain supportive of the economy’s growth objectives.**

**Developments in Agriculture**

**3.** The agriculture sector grew by 3.7 percent in 2002 despite the dry spell
experienced in some parts of the country in the fourth quarter with the onset of
the El Niño weather phenomenon. This performance exceeded the projected 3.13.5 percent growth for 2002 by the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS).

3 Domestic demand refers to the sum of personal consumption expenditures, government consumption and
capital formation or investments.

**4. For 2003, agriculture is expected to grow by 3.0-4.0 percent despite an**
anticipated drop in rice production in the second semester due to farmers’
expectations of the lingering effect of the El Niño weather disturbance. The
favorable weather during the last quarter of 2002 is expected to generate a 4.9
percent increase in palay production and a 21.4 percent growth in corn production
during the first quarter of 2003. However, the current natural conditions pointed
to continuing warming conditions over the next two to four months, and some
parts of the country are likely to continue to experience below normal rainfall.
Farmers’ planting intentions indicated that the expected harvests during the
second quarter of 2003 could drop by 8.6 percent for palay and 9.3 percent for
corn. Meanwhile, the livestock and other crop subsectors were expected to
sustain the good production figures into 2003.[4]

**5.  With the rehabilitation and upgrading of existing irrigation systems as well**
as the timely delivery of high-yielding seed varieties, total rice production could
reach 14.2 million metric tons (MT) in 2003.[5] The government’s rice importation
program could also cushion the adverse impact of the El Niño phenomenon on
domestic supply. Meanwhile, the national rice inventory[6] of 2.8 million MT as
of 26 January 2003 would last for 105 days. Of this stock, the share of the
National Food Authority (NFA) amounting to 829.3 thousand MT (about 30
percent) is sufficient to last for 31 days.

**6.** The agricultural sector is also expected to gain from other government
programs aimed at boosting production and mitigating the impact of the El Niño
phenomenon. These programs include the P1.2 billion worth of loans extended by
the Quedan and Rural Credit Guarantee Corporation (Quedancor) for grains,
livestock and poultry, fisheries and various agribusiness production during the
first eleven months of 2002[7] as well as the P1.3 billion released by the
Department of Budget and Management (DBM) for irrigation projects and other

inventories.  Rice self sufficiency is estimated based on the daily consumption of 25.7 thousand MT of rice.

El Niño-mitigating projects of the Department of Agriculture (DA)[8] and the P50
million for the seven-year Coconut Development Zone Program.[9]

**With the aid of timely government intervention, the agricultural**
**sector should overcome the possible adverse effect of the El Niño weather**
**disturbance and sustain its favorable performance into 2003. This, in turn,**
**would help ensure relative stability in food prices during the year.**

**Exchange rate developments**

**7.  The peso weakened against the US dollar, averaging at P53.95/US$1 for the**
period 1-11 February 2003 compared to the P53.59/US$1 average in January
2003 due mainly to rising fears over the impending outbreak of  hostilities in the
Middle East and the associated risks of disruptions in oil supply.[10] The increase
in the demand for US dollars by oil companies to fund their inventory build-up
also exerted pressure on the peso. This was in compliance with the government’s
directive to maintain a minimum oil inventory level equivalent to 15-30 days of
consumption as part of the country’s oil contingency plan.[11] However, the peso
was less volatile for the period in review with the standard deviation in the daily
exchange rate averaging at P0.05 from P0.13 registered in January 2003.

**8.  On a real, trade-weighted basis, the peso depreciated relative to the currencies**
of the major trading partners by 2.3 percent in January 2003 from its level in
December 2002, as measured by the real effective exchange rate (REER) index.[12]
The peso similarly depreciated vis-à-vis the two baskets of currencies of the
Philippines’ competitor countries. The REER for the broad and narrow baskets of
competitor currencies fell by about 0.7 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively in

10 Based on real-time foreign exchange transactions in the Philippine Dealing System (PDS)
11 As per Department of Energy’s Circular No. DC 2003-01-001 (issued 20 January 2003),  refiners are
required to maintain an inventory of petroleum crude oil and refined petroleum products equivalent to 30
days of consumption while other oil companies are required to maintain 15 days supply of petroleum
products excluding  liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which shall be maintained at 7 days supply.
12 The basket of the major trading partners is composed of the currencies of the US, Japan, the euro area and
the United Kingdom. The broad basket of competitor countries is composed of the currencies of Singapore,
South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong while the narrow basket is composed of
the currencies of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand only.

January 2003 relative to their December 2002 levels. These developments
indicated a slight improvement in the country’s external price competitiveness.

**The peso weakens against the US dollar in February as demand by oil**
**companies and other corporations for foreign exchange rose amidst**
**escalating tensions in the Middle East. Some of the pressures on the domestic**
**currency, however, could ease with the resolution of the US-Iraq crisis.**

**Oil price developments**

**9.  The price of Dubai crude in the international market climbed to US$29.59 per**
barrel as of 7 February 2003, about 5.6 percent higher than the US$28.02 per
barrel posted in January 2003. The uptrend in  world oil prices was  driven
mainly by increased world demand arising from heightened tensions in the
Middle East which has prompted countries to build up their oil inventory levels.
At the same time,  tighter supply in the world oil market due to the decline in
US crude inventory to its lowest level in five years and the  impact of the 65day general strike in Venezuela exerted pressure on oil prices.[13]

**10.** Meanwhile, local oil companies and dealers continued to pass on to
consumers the higher costs of crude oil imports to the retail pump prices of
petroleum products in the first week of February 2003, when local oil prices were
increased for the third time this year. The prices of kerosene, gasoline, and diesel
oil were raised by P0.26 per liter, P0.39 per liter and P0.45 per liter, respectively,
while that of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was raised by P0.95 per liter.[14] To
ensure adequate domestic supply in the light of near-term supply bottlenecks,
domestic oil companies have built up their inventory levels in compliance with
a directive of the government. As of end-January 2003, the estimated oil
inventory level of domestic oil companies is equivalent to about 50-60 days
sufficiency.[15] This was more than the 15-30 days required oil inventory level.

**increase in prices of crude products. The resulting increases in the price of**
**domestic oil products could trigger similar upward adjustments in the prices**
**of other commodity groups including wages and transport fares.**

**Developments in the Utilities Sector**

**11. In its advisory dated 20 January 2003, the Department of Energy (DOE)**
informed the public of higher electricity charges for January in areas serviced by
the Manila Electric Co. (Meralco). The purchased power adjustment (PPA)
component of electricity bill rose by P0.13 to P2.74 per kilowatt hour (kwh) in
January 2003 from P2.61 per kwh in December 2002. The increase in Meralco’s
PPA charges could be attributed to higher selling rates of power producers and the
lower consumption of electricity during the colder month of December.[16] It could
be noted that the PPA has been on the uptrend since October 2002.[17]

**12. In the near term, the direction of power rates would depend on several**
factors. In particular, the outcome of Meralco’s rate unbundling petition with the
Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) and the Supreme Court’s final decision on
Meralco’s “overcharging” case would be key factors in determining the direction
of power rates. In addition, the Special Program to Enhance Electricity Demand
(SPEED) and the planned establishment of the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market
(WESM) would also likely influence power rates.[18]

**13. Meanwhile, the water services regulatory agency, Manila Waterworks and**
Sewerage System (MWSS), approved a P5.35 per cubic meter increase in the
weighted average all-in water tariff of utility company Maynilad Water Services,

16 “Expect higher power costs in Metro Manila-DOE alerts consumers”, 20 January 2003, available at
http://www.doe.gov.ph
17  Meralco’s PPA increased by another P0.04 per kwh to P2.78 per kwh in February 2003 from January’s
level of P2.74 per kwh.
18 The WESM is a spot market for the trading of electricity in which power generation companies
(gencos) submit their  offers to sell electricity to distribution utilities at their desired price. Distribution
utilities, in turn, submit their demand requirements to a market operator who is assigned to match the
supply and demand for power. The Electric Power Industry  Reform Act of 2001 (R.A. 9136) requires
the Department of Energy (DOE) to  establish the WESM in coordination  with  electric power
industry participants to ensure greater supply and rational pricing of electricity. Meanwhile, the SPEED
is a price incentive scheme for large end-users of electricity whereby discounts are  provided to
industrial and commercial customers for incremental use of energy above a specified base load. The
program is aimed at enhancing demand for electricity and ensuring that excess power capacity is fully
utilized.

Inc. (MWSI). This should bring the weighted average all-in water tariff of MWSI
to P29.79 per cubic meter of water from the current rate of P24.44 per cubic
meter. However, MWSI has not yet implemented the MWSS-approved rates as
the company has tendered a notice of early termination of its concession
agreement with the government. Meanwhile, Manila Water Company (MWC) has
started to implement the MWSS-approved rebased rates since 1 January 2003,
raising the MWC’s water tariff by P4.25 per cubic meter to P14.23 per cubic
meter from P9.97 per cubic meter.

**The outlook for power rates remains uncertain at present. The ERC’s**
**decision on the Meralco’s rate unbundling petition and the Supreme Court’s**
**final ruling on the “overcharging” case would determine the direction of**
**Meralco’s power rates in the near term. Meanwhile, the higher water rates in**
**Metro Manila could exert a transitory cost-push pressure on inflation.**

**Interest rates and interest rate differentials**

**14. Domestic interest rates are on the rise. The benchmark 91-day T-bill rate rose**
to 5.672 percent during the Bureau of Treasury’s (BTr) 3 February 2003 auction
from 5.248 percent during the previous auction a fortnight ago, amid concerns
over the impact on Philippine domestic borrowings of a possible war in the
Middle East. Similarly, yields for the 182-day T-bill rate and the 364-day T-bill
rate increased to 6.6 percent and 7.609 percent, respectively, from 6.277 percent
and 7.201 percent. The auction was oversubscribed, with bids reaching P10.5
billion pesos, a tenth more than the government’s offered amount of P9.5 billion,
indicating continued ample liquidity in the system. The government, however,
awarded P7.86 billion only in order to cap the rise in interest rates.

**15.** As of 3 February 2003, the differentials between the RP 91-day T-bill rate
(net of withholding tax) and the 90-day LIBOR and US 90-day T-bill rate
widened to 318.8 basis points and 336.8 basis points, respectively, from the 270.7
basis points and 288.2 basis points registered in 6 January 2003.[19] The
differentials between RP and foreign interest rates trended upward as the rising
benchmark RP rate was accompanied by falling foreign interest rates.

**16. The differential between the BSP’s policy interest rate (overnight borrowing**
or RRP rate) and the US federal funds target rate was unchanged at 575 basis
points as the BSP policy rates and the US federal funds target rate remained
unchanged from their 15 March 2002 and 6 November 2002 levels, respectively.

**17. Adjusted for the risk premium—as measured by the differential between the**
10-year ROP note and the 10-year US Treasury note—the differential between the
BSP policy interest rate and the US federal funds target rate widened to 63 basis
points as of 3 February 2003 from 55 basis points as of end-December 2002.[20]
This developed as the risk premium dropped to 512 basis points from 520 basis
points on 30 December 2002. Both the yields on the 10-year ROP and the 10year US Treasury note increased, with the yields on the latter rising by a larger
magnitude due to higher risk aversion on concerns over the Middle East
tensions.

**The spread between RP and US interest rates widens in early February**
**relative to January levels as concerns over the impact on the domestic**
**financial market of a possible war in the Middle East pushed up the RP**
**benchmark rates. Likewise, the risk-adjusted RP-US interest rate margin**
**widens for the period in review.**

**18. During the period 23-29 January 2003, the Philippines’ real lending rate**
(based on the low-end of the range of banks’ lending rates) eased further to 5.51
percent from the 5.54 percent registered during the review period 23-27 January
2003 due primarily to the marginal decline in the low-end of the range of banks’
lending rates.[ 21 ]At 5.51 percent, the Philippines’ real lending rate was within the
midrange among a sample of countries in the Asian region.

**The Philippine real lending rate declines slightly and is within**
**midrange in the Asian region.**

**19.  The yield curve for government securities in the secondary market on 3**
February 2003 shifted upward relative to that which prevailed on 7 January

2003.[22 ] The yields rose across all tenors, reflecting market concerns over the
increasing tensions in the Middle East.

**Impending outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East exerts pressure on**
**yields of government securities in the secondary market.**

**Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

**20.  Domestic liquidity (M3) growth accelerated by 9.5  percent year-on-year**
to reach P1.7 trillion in December 2002, mainly on account of the seasonal
inflow of dollars from OFW remittances and the strong demand from banks for
government securities.

**21. At the same time, the total volume of outstanding loans of commercial banks**
(KBs) grew by 2.4 percent  year-on-year  to reach P1.4 trillion as endDecember 2002. At this level, the growth of bank lending accelerated from the
1.4 percent year-on-year growth in the previous month. This was the fourth
consecutive month of growth in bank lending and marked the upturn in bank
lending to the manufacturing sector, which rose by 1.7 percent after 17 months of
consecutive year-on-year contractions.

**22. Relative to the end-January 2003 levels, the total volume of banks’**
placements under the RRP window and the SDA facility declined  by P12.9
billion and P58 million to reach P74.9 billion and P1.4 billion, respectively, as of
5 February 2003 as banks continued to reallocate portfolios following the large
withdrawals from their placements with the BSP in December 2002.

**The steady improvement in domestic liquidity was accompanied by**
**continued improvements in bank lending activities. The acceleration in bank**
**lending growth in December provides encouraging signs of a recovery in the**
**demand for credit.**

**Domestic stock market movements**

**23.** The average Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index (PHISIX)
advanced by 25.2 index points to 1,046.7 index points in January 2003 from
1,021.5 index points in December 2002. The PHISIX averaged higher in the first
month of the year on account of market optimism following the signing into law
of the Special Purpose Asset Vehicle (SPV) bill as well as higher foreign
participation in the local bourse. However, the PHISIX dropped anew in
February as market concerns over an imminent US-led assault on Iraq persisted.
As of 11 February, the PHISIX  declined slightly by 2.0 index points to
1,044.7 index points from the January average level.

**The equities market continues to be sluggish and may remain so over**
**the near term due to lingering geopolitical uncertainties. Most market**
**analysts are of the view that the unfolding of events in the Middle East**
**would dictate the movements in the domestic equities market.**

**Fiscal developments**

**24.  The deficit of the National Government (NG) stood at P212.7 billion for the**
year 2002. This was lower than the government’s revised ceiling of P223.0
billion but wider  than the P147.0 billion budget gap in 2001. The deficit was
equivalent to 5.3 percent of GDP, less than the 5.6-percent cap earlier set by the
government. The impact  of the higher NG deficit in 2002 on financial markets
appeared to have been significantly muted by the ample liquidity in the system.
This was  reflected in the downtrend in the average 91-day T-bill rate to 5.5
percent in 2002 from 8.9 percent recorded a year ago.

**25. For 2003, the NG expects the fiscal deficit to be around 4.7 percent of GDP**
(approximately P202 billion), with total revenues amounting to P854.1 billion and
expenditures amounting to P786.1 billion. The financing mix in 2003 would
consist of about 48 percent foreign borrowing and 52 percent domestic borrowing
compared to the 41 percent and 59 percent domestic-foreign financing mix in
2002. This implies that the NG would have to borrow more heavily from the
domestic market.  This could put some pressure on domestic interest rates and
increase financing costs, which, in turn, could pose downside risks to the outlook
for inflation.

**The fiscal position and its possible implications on inflation remain a**
**concern for monetary authorities.**

**Developments and outlook in the rest of the world**

**26. Latest indicators in the major economies showed that the growth of**
industrial production has been sluggish,  labor markets remained soft and
leading economic indicators have weakened. In the US, for example, recent data
showed that the recovery has not taken a firm hold. Growth in the US economy
slowed down sharply in the fourth quarter of 2002, with GDP rising by 1.4
percent as consumers reined in their spending in the face of  persistent worries
over the possible war against Iraq, the volatility of the stock market and the
large number of unemployed. Consumption expenditures, which account for
about two-thirds of the GDP, rose only by one percent in the fourth quarter, the
weakest growth since  1993 and  sharply lower than the 4.2 percent
expansion registered in the previous quarter.[23] During its meeting on 28-29
January 2003, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) unanimously voted
to keep the federal funds target rate at a four-decade low of 1.25 percent. The
FOMC believed that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with
sustained growth in productivity, would support an improving economic climate
over time.[24]

**27.  In the euro area, economic growth has been sluggish, with GDP rising by**
only 0.8 percent year-on-year in the third quarter in 2002 from 0.7 percent in
the previous quarter.  Economic recovery has been delayed given that the
outlook for economic activity has remained broadly unchanged. The weakness in
the overall domestic demand conditions in the euro zone  was driven mainly by
the marked slowdown of the German economy, which is the largest in Europe.
Moreover, the appreciation of the  euro relative to the US dollar could also slow
down the growth in net exports which could limit the main source of growth in
the region. During its meeting on 6 February 2003, the Governing Council of the
European Central Bank (ECB) maintained the benchmark interest rate at 2.75
percent.[25] Despite the uncertainties posed by  geopolitical developments  on the

euro area and the world economy in general, the ECB  opted to “wait-and-see”
noting that the current interest rates are appropriate to maintain price stability.[26]
Meanwhile, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England
(BOE) reduced the Bank’s repo rate by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent on 6
February 2003. The MPC believed that the policy rate reduction was necessary
to support the UK economy while keeping inflation on track over the medium
term.[27]

**28. In Japan, the recovery which began early last year on the back of increased**
consumer spending and an upturn in exports has stalled. In its latest assessment,
the Bank of Japan (BOJ) believed that  “a noticeable recovery is unlikely for the
time being due to, among other factors, substantial uncertainty regarding
conditions overseas.”[28] During its monetary policy meeting on 21-22 January
2003, the  Policy Board of the BOJ decided to maintain the guidelines for its
open market operations, aimed at keeping the outstanding balance of current
accounts of banks with the BOJ at 15-20 trillion yen.[29]

**The prospects for global economic recovery continue to be clouded**
**by rising fears of a US-led war against Iraq and the risk of weaker**
**domestic demand conditions in the major economies.**

**II. Discussion on the Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

**29.** In their deliberation on the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the
members of the Monetary Board shared the view that the inflation path remained
consistent with the outlook of a generally subdued inflation environment in the
near term. Despite foreseeable risks to the inflation outlook—arising from the
potential impact on the prices of agricultural products of the El Niño weather
disturbance, a likely further increase in oil prices due to escalating tensions in the
Middle East as well as the possible further adjustments in user charges—the

Monetary Board remained confident that the average inflation in 2003 would
broadly track the  government’s full-year target of 4.5–5.5 percent.

**30.** The members of the Monetary Board noted that the Philippine economy
posted a better-than-expected real GDP growth for 2002, driven mainly by the
upturn in consumption spending and the recovery in exports. However, they also
pointed out that some weak spots remain. They observed that the pick-up in the
demand for credit was still relatively slow, spare capacity in manufacturing
sector continued to persist and labor market conditions remained soft. Moreover,
the members of the Monetary Board added that the tepid pace of the global
economic recovery and heightened uncertainty due to geopolitical  events in the
Middle East could threaten the prospects for sustained upturn of domestic
demand.

**31. The Monetary Board believed that while the near-term risks to the inflation**
outlook are well contained, possible upside pressures on prices could set in
over the 2-year policy horizon. They recognized the implications on the domestic
economy of the growing downside risks to the global economic outlook due to
rising tensions in the Middle East that continued to dampen  business and
consumer sentiment in the major economies. Under these conditions, the
discussion of the members of the Monetary Board focused on the following policy
questions:

a. Do the risks to the inflation outlook warrant an increase in policy rates
in order to contain a possible build-up in price pressures?

b. Given the uncertainty in external conditions and the need to sustain
economic growth, is there scope for  a  reduction in policy rates in
order to    preserve  the  stimulus  to the economy?

c. Looking at both perspectives, should  the policy stance remain
cautious, one that  is  sufficiently  accommodative by ensuring
adequate liquidity  to support growth while  guarding firmly against the
risks to the inflation outlook, and thus  maintain the current monetary
policy settings?

**32.  Increase policy rates**

In principle, the Monetary Board pointed out that a tighter monetary
policy stance may be adopted as a pre-emptive action against the risks to the
inflation outlook due to potential build-up of demand-side pressures. In the case
of the Philippines, the members of the Monetary Board noted that the risks to
future inflation appear to come mainly  from supply-side or cost-push factors
such as higher food prices associated with the impact of the El Niño weather
disturbance and the increase in oil prices,  power rates as well as water charges.
Given the need to assure the sustainability of economic growth, the members of
the Monetary Board were of the view that an increase in policy rates—which
would lead to higher market interest rates—could  dampen incentives for
increased consumption and investments. Moreover, a high-interest rate
environment would hurt further the domestic stock market, increase the debt
service burden of firms and the NG and stifle  the  observed  recovery  in
bank lending.

**33. Reduce policy rates**

The members of the Monetary Board noted that a further easing of the
BSP’s monetary policy stance at this time would infuse additional liquidity in
the system, which already has ample liquidity at present. Given that  monetary
policy affects inflation with a lag, the Monetary Board expressed the view that a
more accommodative stance now  could undermine the attainability of the
inflation target  over the policy horizon. Moreover, the Monetary Board argued
that the scope for reducing policy rates may be limited by the following
considerations:

� There has been substantial  monetary policy easing in the past two
years. Given ample liquidity in the system, further monetary easing may
not necessarily contribute to an improvement in credit growth.

� The relatively slow pace by which the stimulatory impact of monetary
easing becomes evident can be traced to the long lags in monetary policy.
This implies that sufficient time should be allowed for monetary policy
actions to work its way fully to the real sector.

� Further monetary easing, either through a reduction in the BSP’s policy
rates or in the liquidity reserve requirement, would  infuse  more
liquidity in the system, which could  fan  inflation.

� A reduction in the BSP’s policy rates would narrow down the country’s
interest rate differentials with foreign interest rates, which could lead to
greater volatility in the exchange rate and undermine the stability of the
peso. This could generate higher inflation and fuel inflationary
expectations.

**34. Maintain policy rates**

The Monetary Board’s assessment of the domestic economy showed that
the present path of inflation remained consistent with the outlook of a generally
subdued inflation environment in the near term, despite foreseeable risks to
inflation in the months ahead in the form of cost-push pressures. At the same
time, the members of the Monetary Board noted that the prospects for sustained
economic growth going forward is clouded by the risks  of a slower-thanexpected global economic recovery and uncertainties over geopolitical events.
Against this backdrop, the members of the Monetary Board expressed the view
that monetary policy should remain accommodative by providing a supportive
environment that would ensure sufficient liquidity to fuel the economy’s growth
requirements. The Monetary Board also stressed that monetary policy should
remain cautious to guard against any potential build-up of price pressures that
would dampen the growth momentum.

**III.  Monetary Policy Decision**

**35.** Based on the analysis of various indicators on the macroeconomy and the
financial sector that have become available since the review of the BSP’s
monetary policy stance by the Monetary Board on 16 January 2003 and a careful
assessment of the balance of risks on inflation and inflationary expectations,
the Monetary Board believes that the current monetary policy stance continues to
be  appropriately supportive of the economy’s growth objective while ensuring
price stability. For this reason, the Monetary Board, by a unanimous vote, decided
to approve the following measures:

a. maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 7.0 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight RP
(lending) rate;

b. maintain the tiering scheme on banks’ placements with the BSP under the
RRP and SDA windows;

c. maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs; and

d. maintain the reserve requirements at their current levels given the adequate
level of liquidity in the system.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary policy
setting was scheduled on 13 March 2003.
