**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 5 JUNE 2003[∗]**


**Background**

The Monetary Board held its seventh meeting for the year on
monetary policy issues on 5 June 2003. This was preceded by the Advisory
Committee[1] meeting on 3 June 2003. During the Monetary Board’s
meeting, the discussions by the Monetary Board members revolved around
the presentation of the Advisory Committee focusing on a comprehensive
assessment of key economic and financial indicators relevant for the
Monetary Board’s deliberation. The results of the discussions of the
Advisory Committee as well as their recommendations on the appropriate
stance of monetary policy were also presented to the Monetary Board.
These served as inputs for the Monetary Board’s review of the BSP’s
monetary policy stance.

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

� Headline inflation slowed down to 2.7 percent year-on-year in May
2003 from the previous month’s 2.8 percent. Similarly, the BSP’s
measure of core inflation decelerated to 2.4 percent in May from 2.5
percent in April 2003.

� Average inflation for the whole year of 2003 would likely fall significantly
below the Government’s target of 4.5-5.5 percent. This was based on
the Monetary Board’s assessment which showed that:

� The continuing mixed trends in aggregate demand conditions
support a benign inflation environment going forward; and

∗ The highlights of the discussions of the 5 June 2003 Monetary Board meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its meeting held on 10 July 2003.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy
Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the Managing Director, In-Charge of Research and
the Director of the Treasury Department.

� Supply-side risks to inflation have shown evident signs of tapering
off, particularly with the abatement of the El Niño phenomenon and
the downtrend in international oil prices with the conclusion of the
US-Iraq war.

� For 2004, inflation is expected to rise but remain within the
Government’s target range of 4-5 percent. This outlook stemmed from
the following factors:

� Stronger pace of economic activity underpinned by robust
consumption and improved agricultural output;

� Stronger growth in domestic liquidity, underpinned by improving
demand for credit based on expectations of a continued supportive
monetary policy stance;

� Influence of cost-push factors such as one-off price adjustments in
utility charges; and

� Possible minimum wage adjustments to reflect increases in the cost
of living.

� Indicators of domestic demand showed improvement, particularly in
terms of stronger consumption spending and manufacturing activities.
However, the pace of credit demand remained modest with a mild
slowdown observed in March. The overall strength of aggregate
demand thus remained generally moderate.

� The Philippine economy grew strongly in the first quarter as real
GDP rose by 4.5 percent, which is the upper end of the
Government’s forecast of 4.0-4.5 percent. Similarly, real GNP
increased significantly in the first quarter by 5.6 percent, exceeding
the Government’s forecast of 4.3-4.8 percent.

� Consumer spending remained robust. Private consumption
spending grew by 4.9 percent in real terms during the first quarter of
2003, driven mainly by spending on food, transport and cellular
phone services, and utilities. This growth was stronger than the 3.5
percent increase reported a year earlier and was the highest growth
rate recorded since the fourth quarter of 1998.

� The year-on-year rise in the volume of production index (VOPI)
grew by 6.4 percent (revised) in March 2003, a marked turnaround
from the 1.1 percent (revised) decline in the previous month.

Meanwhile, the growth in value of production index (VAPI)
strengthened to 17.4 percent (revised) during the month from 10.0
percent (revised) in February.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing continued to improve,
rising to 80.0 percent (revised) in March from 76.7 percent (revised)
in the previous month.

� Commercial bank lending continued to rise for the seventh
consecutive month, rising by 3.2 percent year-on-year in March
2003. However, this was a deceleration from the 4.4-percent growth
registered in the previous month.

� Passenger vehicle sales declined further by 31.5 percent year-onyear in April 2003 following a similar decline of 18.0 percent in the
preceding month.

� The main risks to future inflation associated with cost-push influences,
have shown some signs of weakening. Weather conditions are
expected to normalize indicating continued favorable food production in
the near term. Meanwhile, prices of fuel products softened in May.

� Agricultural output growth slowed down to 2.8 percent in the first
quarter from the 5.2 percent gain posted for the same period last
year due mainly to the El Niño weather disturbance. However, food
production for the remainder of 2003 should be normal with
dissipating dry weather conditions, the onset of the rainy season,
and continuing government measures to support farmers. These
factors should help tame food inflation for the rest of the year.

� Pump prices of domestic petroleum products continued to trend
downward as world oil prices softened and domestic supply
remained relatively high. Compared with the end-April 2003 levels,
prices per liter of gasoline products, diesel oil, kerosene and
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as of 30 May 2003 were reduced
cumulatively by P1.20, P0.90, P0.60 and P0.56 respectively.
Meanwhile, as of 26 May 2003, the oil industry inventory level was
estimated at 72 days of supply, well above the required minimum
inventory level of 7-15 days.

� In the utilities sector, the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) has
already approved Phase 1 of Meralco’s refund scheme. On a
separate decision issued on 30 May 2003, the ERC issued its Order
on Meralco’s motion for reconsideration of the ERC’s decision on

the utility’s rate unbundling case. The Order authorized Meralco to
implement a P0.17 per kwh average increase over Meralco’s
average May selling rate.

� Treasury bill (T-bill) yields began to decline in May. The general
softening of the yields was due mainly to the improved fiscal
performance in April 2003 as well as the presence of ample liquidity in
the system. During the 26 May 2003 auction of the Bureau of the
Treasury, the average yield on the benchmark 91-day T-bill fell to 6.302
percent, 54 basis points lower than the 6.842 percent yield recorded in
the previous auction. This was the lowest level registered since the 17
March 2003 auction. The steady downtrend in the benchmark RP rates
was accompanied by relatively steady foreign interest rates, which in
turn translated into narrower interest rate differentials in May.
Meanwhile, the growth in domestic liquidity slowed down further in April
2003 due in part to the increase in the liquidity reserve requirement for
commercial and universal banks as well as the removal of the tiering
scheme on RRP placements.

� The peso further strengthened against the US dollar by 22 centavos to
average P52.54/US$1 in May 2003 compared to the P52.76/US$1
average in April 2003 due to the sustained inflow of remittances from
overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), the strengthening of regional
currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar and receipts from export dollar sales.
Meanwhile, on a real, trade-weighted basis, the peso depreciated
relative to the currencies of the major trading partners. The peso also
tracked a similar depreciating trend vis-à-vis the broad and narrow
baskets of competitor currencies. These developments indicated some
improvement in the country’s external price competitiveness.[2]

� For the period January-April, the National Government (NG) budget
deficit stood at P65.5 billion, lower by 21.1 percent compared to the
level registered in the same period a year ago. The favorable fiscal
performance was influenced largely by the strong growth in revenue
collections, reflecting partly the seasonal impact of quarterly/annual tax
payments, reform measures instituted by the primary collecting
agencies as well as the tight rein in public spending. The improvement
in the NG fiscal performance in April buoyed up expectations that the
fiscal sector could achieve its target budget deficit for the whole year.

2 The basket of the major trading partners is composed of the currencies of the US, Japan, the Euro
area and the United Kingdom. The broad basket of competitor countries is composed of the currencies
of Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong while the narrow
basket is composed of the currencies of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand only.

This should provide a positive influence on expectations on future
inflation and output growth.

� Although the uncertainties associated with the US-Iraq war were lifted,
the timing and extent of global recovery remain uncertain as significant
geopolitical, economic and policy risks remained in the major
economies. The risks over the pace of global economic recovery
remained predominantly on the downside.

� In the US, recent economic indicators showed mixed signs of
improvement but the overall picture indicated softness in domestic
demand over the near term.[3] US real GDP growth in the first
quarter of 2003 grew steadily by 1.4 percent (revised) as in the
previous quarter. Consumer sentiment continued to rise in May as
the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index increased
further to 92.1 (revised) from April’s reading of 86.0.[4] Similarly, the
Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index—another closely
watched gauge of consumer confidence—rose to 83.8 in May, the
highest in six months since November 2002.[5] However, the US
unemployment rate remained high at 6.0 percent in April while the
manufacturing sector remained weak as reflected in the decline of
the Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) manufacturing index to
45.4 percent in April compared to 46.2 in March.

� In the Euro area, initial estimates indicated that the Euro zone
posted a nil quarter-on-quarter GDP growth in the first quarter.[6]
While the appreciation in the euro would help ease further
inflationary pressures in the short term, it could also dampen
exports, which have been relied upon as the driver of economic
growth in the Euro area.

� In the UK, estimates of the Office of National Statistics (ONS)
showed that the first quarter real GDP grew by only 0.2 percent,
quarter-on-quarter or by 2.2 percent from the level a year ago. The
key uncertainty in the UK economy was the overall pressure on the

demand side, reflecting the balance between the pick-up in
government spending and the prospective improvement in net trade
and ultimately investment on one hand and the slowdown in
consumption, on the other.[7]

� Economic activity in Japan in the first quarter remained flat and
there is greater uncertainty about the economic outlook, stoking
fears that the economy would slip back into a shallow recession.

� While the main risk surrounding the US-Iraq war has been lifted, the
risks on the global economic recovery have been predominantly on the
downside. The US Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of
England maintained their policy rates during their last meetings on
monetary policy in May. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) continued
to ease liquidity conditions as it raised further the target for the current
account balance of banks held at the BOJ to 27-30 trillion yen from 2227 trillion yen during their monetary policy meeting held on 19-20 May
2003. The BOJ also signaled its readiness to provide more liquidity
irrespective of the target should there be a risk to the stability of the
financial markets in case of a surge in liquidity demand.[8]

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� The members of the Monetary Board agreed that the current demand
and supply conditions continued to point to a subdued inflation
environment going forward. For 2003, the Monetary Board expects the
average annual inflation to fall significantly below the Government’s
target of 4.5-5.5 percent. For 2004, the Monetary Board expressed
confidence that the average annual inflation would remain broadly in
line with the 4.0-5.0 percent target. Based on its assessment, the
Monetary Board believed that the near-term risks to inflation have
diminished. In particular, deliberations by the Monetary Board showed
that:

� Despite the observed improvements in some areas of domestic
demand—such as the robust growth in consumption spending and
improvements in manufacturing—there is still lack of clear-cut
evidence of a sustained pick-up in domestic economic activity.

The lack of momentum for a pick-up in credit demand as well as
continued restraint in bank lending stance—in part motivated by
banks’ need to preserve asset quality—have contributed to the lack
of price pressures.

� The supply-side risks to inflation have recently shown evident signs
of tapering off, particularly with the abatement of the El Niño
phenomenon and the downtrend in international oil prices with the
conclusion of the US-Iraq war.

� The exchange rate has reversed its decline since mid-March and
has remained relatively stable indicating that the risk to the inflation
outlook coming from a possible sustained depreciation of the
currency—which coincided with the war uncertainties—has
dissipated.

� Slower M3 growth in April relative to March indicated that the
demand for money remained moderate despite ample liquidity in
the system.

� In the external sector, the members of the Monetary Board observed
that the balance of risks on the global economic outlook remained on
the downside even as the uncertainty surrounding the war has been
removed. A slowdown in the pace of global recovery could impact
adversely on the demand for Philippine exports. The members of the
Monetary Board noted that this could weigh down on the growth
prospects of the Philippine economy.

� Based on these observations, the Monetary Board evaluated two
alternative policy moves. In particular, the members of the Monetary
Board deliberated on the merits of maintaining the current monetary
policy settings and the possibility of further easing the current monetary
policy stance.

� Maintaining monetary policy settings

Against a backdrop of favorable inflation environment and relatively
subdued demand conditions, the members of the Monetary Board
noted that current monetary policy stance could be maintained to
provide sufficient liquidity to fuel the economy’s growth requirements
while guarding against the resurgence of price pressures that could
dampen the growth momentum.

� Easing the monetary policy stance

� The Monetary Board argued that the lack of momentum for a
sustained build-up in aggregate domestic demand and the
downside risks in the external environment along with the quiescent
inflation path highlighted the need for a supportive monetary policy
setting, going forward. They expressed the view that recent
monetary conditions and other economic developments provided
added flexibility for the BSP to ease the stance while remaining
cautious against potential inflationary threats given that the main
risks to the inflation outlook have largely dissipated.

� The Monetary Board considered the option of restoring the tiering
scheme on banks’ placements with the BSP. They noted that based
on the staff’s estimates, the possible impact on inflation of the
restoration of the tiering scheme on banks’ placements with the
BSP under the RRP and SDA facilities would only be minimal and
would not lead to a breach of the Government’s inflation targets
over the BSP’s policy horizon. They also stressed that easing the
monetary policy setting—through the restoration of the tiering
scheme—could help build up momentum for economic activity and
consumer confidence without endangering the inflation goals. They
also noted that the restoration of the tiering scheme would help
compel banks to increase their lending activities for productive
purposes instead of parking their excess funds with the BSP.

� The members of the Monetary Board also underscored that the BSP
would remain watchful of the evolving economic and financial
developments, including the policy moves by other central banks such
as the US Fed.

**III.  Monetary Policy Decision**

� After a careful assessment of the balance of risks on inflation and
inflationary expectations on one hand and the evolving domestic
demand conditions, on the other hand, the Monetary Board, by a
unanimous vote, approved to restore the tiering scheme on banks’
placements with the BSP under the RRP and SDA windows. In
particular, banks’ placements with the BSP under the overnight RRP
window would be subject to the following interest rates:

(1) First P5 billion          - 7 percent;
(2) Over P5 billion-P10 billion          -     4 percent; and

(3) Over P10 billion         - 1 percent.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting was scheduled on 2 July 2003.
