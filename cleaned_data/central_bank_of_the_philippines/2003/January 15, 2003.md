**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES  HELD ON 16 JANUARY 2003[∗]**


**Background**

The Monetary Board held its first meeting on monetary policy issues for
2003 on 16 January 2003, two days after the Advisory Committee meeting on 14
January 2003.[1] The Advisory Committee presented to the Monetary Board a
policy paper containing the committee’s assessment of the macroeconomic
conditions and their implications on the inflation outlook as well as their
recommendations on the appropriate stance of monetary policy. The Advisory
Committee also submitted a comprehensive set of economic and financial
indicators relevant for the Monetary Board’s deliberation on monetary policy
issues. The Monetary Board’s discussion on the developments in the factors that
affect inflation and inflation expectations—in particular, the trends and forecasts
in agricultural production, movements of the exchange rate, direction of world oil
prices, adjustments in power rates and water tariff, monetary conditions, trend in
demand and output indicators, fiscal position, world economic conditions and
outlook—served as the basis for Monetary Board’s decision on the appropriate
monetary policy stance of the BSP.

**I. Considerations in  the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

**Domestic Price Developments and Outlook**

**1. Year-on-year inflation rose slightly in December 2002 to 2.6 percent compared**
to 2.5 percent a month earlier. Month-on-month headline inflation in December
was also higher at 0.4 percent compared to 0.1 percent in November. Specifically,

∗ The highlights of the discussions of the 16 January 2003 Monetary Board meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its meeting held on 20 February 2003.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely
the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy Governor for
Supervision and Examination Sector, the Managing Director, In-Charge of Research or the Director of the
Department of Economic Research, and the Director of the Treasury Department.

the increases in the prices of fuel products, medicines, selected construction
materials (which raised the inflation rate for housing and repairs) and personal
services, as well as  higher purchased power adjustment (PPA) and the currency
rate adjustment (CERA) for electricity in the National Capital Region (NCR)
contributed to the upward  movement in consumer prices in December 2002.[2]
Average headline inflation for 2002 was 3.1 percent, more than a full percentage
point below the low end of the 2002 target range and lower than the average of
6.1 percent in 2001. Similarly, BSP estimates of core inflation, which weed out
the effects of temporary disturbances on headline CPI by excluding food and fuel
components, showed a slight increase during the month. The BSP’s main measure
of core inflation rose to 2.7 percent in December from 2.6 percent in the previous
month, and averaged 3.8 percent in 2002. Nevertheless, this represented a
downtrend from the average core inflation rate of 6.5 percent in 2001.

**2. The benign trend in core inflation suggested muted demand-side influences on**
future inflation as the continuing mixed signals concerning domestic demand
translate into limited pricing power on the part of producers. Indications of
strengthening demand for goods and services may be gleaned from data on
passenger car sales, which registered a modest turnaround from a 17.4 percent
year-on-year decline in October to a 2.7 percent rise in November. Similarly,
power consumption expanded by 6.4 percent in November from only  0.9
percent in the previous month. However, data on manufacturing activity based on
the Monthly Integrated Survey of Selected Industries (MISSI) published by the
National Statistics Office (NSO) suggested weakness in domestic demand. The
Value of Production Index (VAPI) of the manufacturing industry in October 2002
rose by 2.2 percent (revised) from its year-ago value, slower than the 2.4 percent
(revised) rise in September. Meanwhile, the Volume of Production Index (VOPI)
continued to decline in October, falling by 3.0 percent (revised) year-on-year
compared to 2.5 percent in the previous month. This was the sixth consecutive
month of decline in the volume of manufacturing output since May 2002.
Meanwhile, capacity utilization in manufacturing also continued to be fairly low
at 76.0 percent for October 2002.

**The full-year average inflation of 3.1 percent for 2002—the lowest**
**since 1988—is significantly lower than the government’s target range of 4.5-**

**5.5 percent. Price pressures are kept at bay as demand-side influences on**
**prices remained muted while supply-side factors are generally favorable.**
**This strengthens expectations of a subdued inflation environment in the near**
**term. In particular, the average inflation for 2003-2004 is expected to be**
**broadly in line with the government’s target of 4.5-5.5 percent.**

**Developments in Agriculture**

**3.  The production of palay in the fourth quarter was expected to benefit from the**
rainfall brought about by the southwest monsoons and the government’s programs
to raise  agricultural output such as the Department of Agriculture’s (DA) quick
turnaround (QTA) planting scheme[3] and the promotion of the hybrid rice
technology.[4] Thus, palay production was expected to grow by 8.9 percent yearon-year to 5.4 million metric tons (MT) in the fourth quarter of 2002. This could
make up for the crop losses in the third quarter, and lead to a full-year palay
production growth of 1.2 percent to 13.1 million MT. This production level could
help achieve a 3.1-3.5 percent target growth of the agriculture sector in 2002.[5]

**4. In the first quarter of 2003, palay production could decline by 1.9 percent**
year-on-year to 3.0 million MT as irrigated rice farmers have tempered their
planting activities due to apprehensions over the effect of the El Niño
phenomenon.[6]

**5. The government’s rice import program has helped mitigate the upward price**
pressure from the low palay production in the third quarter of 2002, as the
National Food Authority (NFA) allowed 1.2 million MT of rice imports from 1

3 The quick turnaround scheme (QTA) is part of the Ginintuang Masaganang Ani (GMA) Rice Program of
the DA, which aims to compensate for possible losses in rice output brought about by drought, flooding
caused by typhoons, and also to mitigate the impact of El Niño. Under the scheme, irrigated rice areas which
had been harvested in August or early September were immediately replanted with early maturing rice
varieties and certified seeds within two to three weeks to make up for the delays in planting during the second
quarter. Farmer participants to the program may also avail of fertilizer on credit under the Quedancor. The
program expects to produce an additional 339,598 metric tons of rice for 2002. (Source: DA)
4 President Arroyo signed Administrative Order (AO) No. 25 last December 2001, directing the DA, the
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the NFA and their respective allied agencies to promote the largescale use of the hybrid rice technology. This is expected to be a major technological option to achieve rice
sufficiency, increase by at least threefold the average yield of palay, and generate jobs. Available at

January-22 December 2002. As of 22 December 2002, the national rice inventory
stood at 2.7 million MT, equivalent to 105 days of rice sufficiency.[ 7]

**6. In addition to the rice import program, the agricultural sector could also gain**
from other government programs aimed at boosting production and mitigating
the impact of the El Niño phenomenon. These programs included the P1.2 billion
worth of loans extended by the Quedan and Rural Credit Guarantee Corporation
(Quedancor) for grains, livestock and poultry, fisheries and various agribusiness
production during the first eleven months of 2002[8] as well as the P1.3 billion
released by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) for irrigation
projects and other El Niño-mitigating projects of the DA[9] and the P50 million for
the seven-year Coconut Development Zone Program.[ 10]

**Government programs could help boost agricultural production and**
**contribute to mitigating the possible cost-push pressures on food prices**
**arising from the impact of the El Niño weather disturbance.**

**Exchange rate developments**

**7. The peso strengthened slightly against the US dollar as of 9 January 2003,**
averaging at P53.48/US$1 for the period 2-9 January 2003 compared to the
P53.50/US$1 average in December 2002.[11] Foreign currency inflows due mainly
to remittances from overseas Filipino workers helped boost the  peso.  However,
some pressure on the peso could be expected as post-holiday inflows of  foreign
exchange were likely to taper off. For the first six trading days  of  the year,
the volatility of the peso averaged P0.04, an improvement compared to the P0.18
registered for the whole month of December 2002.

7 The national rice inventory consists of NFA palay and rice stocks as well as commercial and household
inventories.  Rice self sufficiency is estimated based on the daily consumption of 25.7 thousand MT of rice.

**8.  On a real, trade-weighted basis, the peso depreciated relative to the currencies**
of the major trading partners by about 7.6 percent in December 2002 from its
level a year ago, as shown in the real effective exchange rate (REER) index.[12]
The peso showed a similar depreciation trend over the same period vis-à-vis the
broad and narrow baskets of competitor currencies falling by about 5.0 percent
and 13.8 percent, respectively. These developments indicated the continued
improvement in the country’s external price competitiveness.

**The peso was slightly stronger against the dollar in January.**
**However, some pressure on the exchange rate remains as inflows of foreign**
**currency remittances are likely to slow down from their holiday levels.**

**Oil price developments**

**9. As of 10 January 2003, the price of Dubai crude oil settled at US$27 per**
barrel, significantly higher than the average price of US$25.73 per barrel in
December 2002. In the futures market, the price of benchmark Brent crude oil for
February 2003 deliveries also rose significantly  to US$30.77 per barrel from
US$25.19 per barrel quoted in the previous month.[13] The political crisis in
Venezuela, which is the fifth largest oil exporter in the world; the looming war in
Iraq; and the higher demand for heating oil during the winter season in the
Northern Hemisphere have combined to push up oil prices. However, in a move
to temper the rise in oil prices within the US$22-US$28 per barrel band target, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) raised the production
quota of members by 1.5 million barrels per day to 24.5 million barrels per day
following its meeting on 12 January 2003 in Vienna, Austria.[14]

**10.  In the local front, local oil companies and dealers raised the pump prices of**
petroleum products during the first week of January 2003.  In particular, the
prices of gasoline and diesel oil were raised by an average of 35 centavos while

the currencies of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand only.

the prices of kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) were raised by an
average of 32 centavos and 56 centavos, respectively.[15]

**The threat of a US-led offensive against Iraq remains a major**
**concern for the country’s inflation outlook. The possible war in the Middle**
**East could have repercussions on world oil supply and prices, which could**
**impact adversely on the country’s oil supply, domestic oil prices and**
**consequently, on consumer prices.**

**Developments in the Utilities Sector**

**11. In its order dated 19 December 2002, the Energy Regulatory Commission**
(ERC) allowed the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) to collect its underrecovered purchased power adjustment (PPA) charges amounting to P5.8 billion.
The ERC said that the “collection should be through the inclusion of the
amortized amount as part of the unbundled generation rate schedule to be
approved by the ERC in Case Nos. 2001-646 and 2001-900”.[16]

**12. The ERC is also expected to release soon its decision on Meralco’s rate**
unbundling petition. The use of a new test year in computing the utility’s revenue
requirements and the inclusion of Meralco’s under-recovered PPA charges in the
computation of the new unbundled rates could eventually lead to higher power
rates. According to Meralco—in its submission to the ERC on 26 December
2001—its proposed new rates as contained in its petition for the unbundling of
power rates could raise the cost of electric power consumption by an average of
P1.12 per kwh or an average increase of 19.6 percent from the November 2001
average tariff of P5.73 per kwh.[17] The impact of the unbundling of the power rates
would also need to be weighed against those of the Special Program to Enhance
Electricity Demand (SPEED) and the planned establishment of the Wholesale
Electricity Spot Market (WESM).[18]

**13. The ultimate impact on  inflation of any power rate increase could be**
mitigated should there be a possible reimbursement of “overcharges” made by
Meralco. However, the impact on power rates of the Supreme Court’s
decision—which ruled that  Meralco should “implement a rate adjustment of
P0.017 per kwh (instead of the original P0.184 per kwh) and reimburse
Meralco’s customers or  credit in their favor for future consumption the
overcharged average amount of P0.167 per kwh with respect to Meralco’s billing
cycles beginning February 1994 to February 1998”—is still uncertain as Meralco
has filed a motion for reconsideration on the said case.[19]

**14. Meanwhile, the Manila Water Company (MWC) has started to implement**
a P4.25 per cubic meter tariff rate hike in Manila’s east zone effective 1 January
2003.[20] This would bring the average weighted all-in water tariff of MWC to
P14.22 per cubic meter of water from its current rate of P9.97 per cubic meter.
Further rate adjustments could be implemented in 2005 as MWSS’ initial
estimates for MWC’s rate adjustment showed that the rates could be revised up to
P7.03 per cubic meter.[21]  Meanwhile, MWSS has also approved a P5.35 per cubic
meter increase in the weighted average all-in water tariff of Maynilad Water
Services Inc. (MWSI).[22] The approved rate increase would bring MWSI’s current
weighted average all-in water tariff of P24.44 per cubic meter to P29.79 per cubic
meter. However, it is still uncertain if MWSI will implement the revised rates as it
has already expressed its interest for an early termination of its concession
agreement with the government.

(suppliers), in turn, submit their demand requirements to a market operator who is assigned to match
the supply and demand for power. The Electric Power Industry  Reform Act of 2001 (R.A. 9136)
requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to  establish the WESM in coordination  with  electric
power industry participants to ensure greater supply and rational pricing of electricity. Meanwhile, the
SPEED is a price incentive scheme for large end-users of electricity whereby discounts are  provided
to industrial and commercial customers for incremental use of energy above a specified base load. The
program is aimed at enhancing demand for electricity and ensuring that excess power capacity is fully
utilized.

**The direction of Meralco power rates in the near term would depend**
**on the ERC’s decision on the utility’s rate unbundling petition and the**
**Supreme Court’s final ruling on the “overcharging” case. Meanwhile, water**
**rates in the Manila area are now higher as the MWSS has approved a**
**staggered water rate adjustment scheme for both water concessionaires.**

**Interest rates and interest rate differentials**

**15. The yield on the 91-day, 182-day and 364-day government securities declined**
during the Bureau of Treasury’s (BTr) 6 January 2002 auction—the first for the
year—indicating a huge market appetite for government debt papers. The demand
for government securities surged during the 6 January 2003 auction, as reflected
by the size of  tenders  amounting to P17.2 billion, which was about double
the size of the P9.5 billion T-bill offering. The auction was fully awarded.

**16. Following the results of the 6 January 2003 auction, the differentials between**
the RP 91-day T-bill rate (net of withholding tax) and the 90-day LIBOR and US
90-day T-bill rate narrowed to 270.7 basis points and 288.2 basis points,
respectively, from 271.1 basis points and 292.6 basis points registered on 9
December 2002.[23]

**17. The differential between the BSP’s policy interest rate (overnight borrowing**
or RRP rate) and the US federal funds target rate was unchanged at 575 basis
points as the BSP policy rate and the US federal funds target rate remained steady
at their 15 March 2002 and 6 November 2002 levels, respectively.

**18. Adjusted for the risk premium—as measured by the differential between the**
10-year ROP note and the 10-year US Treasury note—the differential between the
BSP policy interest rate and the US federal funds target rate narrowed to 55 basis
points as of end-December 2002. This developed as the risk premium rose to 520
basis points on 30 December 2002 from 474 basis points a month earlier. The
sharp rise in the premium was due mainly to fiscal deficit concerns, particularly
on news that the government would sell more yen-and euro-denominated bonds
for 2003.[24]

**The margin between RP and US interest rates is narrower in early**
**January compared to its December level as competition among banks during**
**the first auction of the year resulted into lower RP T-bill rates. Similarly, the**
**risk-adjusted RP-US interest rate differential is also narrower as fiscal**
**worries led to a sharp rise in the risk premium for RP bonds.**

**19.  During the period 2-8 January 2003, the Philippines’ real lending rate (based**
on the low-end of the range of banks’ lending rates) eased slightly to 5.54 percent
from the 5.61 percent registered during the review period 28 November-3
December 2002 due primarily to the marginal increase in the inflation rate for
December.[25] At 5.54 percent, the Philippines’ real lending rate was within the
midrange among a sample of Asian countries.

**The Philippine real lending rate declines slightly and is within**
**midrange in the Asian region.**

**20.  The yield curve for government securities in the secondary market shifted**
downward relative to that which prevailed on 5 December 2002[26] as rates dropped
across all tenors on 10 January 2003. The decline in yields was due to banks’
competition for government papers, supported by ample liquidity in the system.

**The yield curve shifts downward as ample system liquidity led to lower**
**yields for government securities in the secondary market.**

**Domestic Liquidity and Credit Conditions**

**21. Domestic liquidity (M3) growth rose by 9.3 percent year-on-year to reach**
P1.603 trillion as of end-November 2002. The higher level of net foreign assets
(NFA) of the monetary system as well as the increase in credits to the National
Government contributed to the rise in M3.

**22. The total volume of loans outstanding of commercial banks rose steadily  by**
1.4 percent in November 2002 from the 1.1 percent year-on-year rise posted in
the previous month. This was the third consecutive month of growth after  five
months of year-on-year declines. Meanwhile, lending by thrift banks—which are
engaged traditionally on lending for housing as well as small-and mediumsized enterprises—showed a steady improvement, rising by 10.6 percent yearon-year in August 2002  from 10.5 percent in the previous month.

**23. Relative to the end-December 2002 levels, the total volume of banks’**
placements under the RRP window and the SDA facility increased by P29.4
billion and P156 million to reach P81.7 billion and P220 million, respectively, as
of 6 January 2003. The increase in banks’ placements under the RRP and the
SDA facilities  reflected a post-holiday phenomenon  as banks started to reinvest their excess liquidity with the BSP,  which have been withdrawn in
December 2002  to finance  the seasonal increase in demand for liquidity during
the holiday season.

**Loans outstanding of commercial banks post third consecutive month**
**of growth, providing further indications of a recovery in bank lending.**
**Meanwhile, banks re-invest excess funds with the BSP under the RRP and**
**SDA facilities following large withdrawals in December, in anticipation of**
**increased demand for liquidity for the holidays.**

**Domestic stock market movements**

**24.  The expected year-end rally failed to materialize in December 2002 as the**
average PHISIX settled at 1021.5 index points, lower by 30 index points than
the November 2002 average level of 1051.1 index points.  However, trading
activities improved slightly during the first week of January 2003. As of  8
January, the PHISIX closed at 1042.4 index points as investors took advantage of
low share prices. Trading activity in the domestic stock market have been
generally subdued in 2002 as uncertainties weighed down investor sentiment. In
particular, worries over the burgeoning government budget deficit, the slow pace
of global economic growth, domestic and international security concerns as well
as the absence of positive corporate developments kept market appetite low.

**Market** **analysts expect investors in the local bourse to maintain their**
**cautious stance as the aforementioned concerns could persist in 2003. In**
**particular, geopolitical developments in the Middle East would remain a key**

**factor in setting the market’s direction. Most market analysts, however, are**
**of the view that bargain hunting of select issues should provide some boost to**
**the market.**

**Fiscal developments**

**25. The deficit of the National Government (NG) stood at P200.6 billion for the**
period January-November 2002, considerably higher than the full-year target
deficit of P130.0 billion (3.3 percent of GDP). This resulted from the shortfall in
revenue collections and the higher-than-programmed expenditures.

**26. For 2003, the NG expects the fiscal deficit to be around 4.7 percent of GDP**
(approximately P202 billion) from total revenues of P584.1 billion and
expenditure of P786.1 billion. The financing mix is expected to consist of about
48 percent foreign borrowing and 52 percent domestic borrowing.[27]  The primary
challenge for the fiscal authorities is to ensure that the measures put in place to
enhance revenue collections particularly, in the BIR and the BOC, would continue
to be promoted vigorously  along with maintaining prudence in government
spending.  This is in line with the thrust toward achieving  fiscal consolidation
over the medium term, consistent  with  the macroeconomic goals of price
stability and sustained economic growth.

**While the impact on inflation of the large deficit in 2002 appears to**
**have been muted by ample liquidity in the financial system, a continued**
**shortfall in the programmed fiscal deficit in 2003 could dampen market**
**expectations and pose risks to the inflation outlook.**

**Developments and outlook in the rest of the world**

**27. The US economy  expanded briskly in the third quarter, accelerating by  4.0**
percent (revised) from 1.3 percent in the previous quarter. However, economic
developments during the fourth quarter showed a mixed picture. On the positive
side, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) index of manufacturing activity
jumped to 54.7 in December  2003  from  49.2 a month  earlier.[28] Some

analysts considered the rise in the ISM index as a sign that the manufacturing
sector could  be on the recovery path following a period of prolonged
weakness.  Moreover, consumer confidence improved as reflected by the rise in
the  University of Michigan  index of consumer sentiment to 86.7 in December
2002 from 84.2 in November and 80.6 in October. Meanwhile, labor market
conditions remained soft. Analysts believed that the unemployment could still
rise further.[29] Consumers continued to be concerned about the prospects for
renewed growth in jobs and wages as  economic  recovery could proceed  at a
slow pace.[30]  This could be traced to intensifying risks over geopolitical events
in the Middle East as well the month-long Venezuela strife  with potential
consequence for oil prices; the recent tension between the US and North Korea
over the latter’s  nuclear weapons program; and the slow recovery of the stock
market. Meanwhile, market analysts were of the view that the US Fed will likely
keep the federal funds target rate steady for some time in 2003.[31]

**28. In the eurozone,  economic growth remained subdued, as GDP rose slightly**
by 0.8 percent (revised) in the third quarter of 2002 from the 0.6 percent
growth in the previous quarter. The 12-member countries face the twin
challenges of fiscal correction and structural rigidities in a weak economic
environment. Investment contracted  in 2002  as companies suffered from
declining consumer demand and lower share prices.[32] Given the weak external
and domestic conditions and signs of easing inflationary pressures, the European
Central Bank  cut  its policy rates by 50 basis points during the last meeting of
its  Governing Council on  5 December  2002.

**29. In Japan, private consumption continued to be weak, housing investment**
remained sluggish and public investment continued to decline. Based on the view
of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the economy was unlikely to show clear signs of
recovery in the near term  since exports and production were expected to be
virtually unchanged for some time. Based on these considerations, the BOJ have
opted to maintain an accommodative policy stance. In its Monetary Policy
Meeting held on 16-17 December 2002, the BOJ decided to keep its policy

**II. Discussion on the Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

**30. The members of the Monetary Board were of the view that the outlook for**
inflation suggested generally manageable price conditions over the BSP’s policy
horizon, despite foreseeable cost-side risks.  The Monetary Board noted that the
average annual inflation is expected to move broadly in line with the
government’s target for 2003.  They pointed out that there are still areas of
weakness in overall demand conditions, which implied that demand-side factors
are likely to continue to exert a muted influence on consumer prices.

**31. Meanwhile, the members of the Monetary Board also noted that the potential**
upside pressures arising  from supply-side or cost-push factors were likely to be
temporary. However, the Monetary Board also acknowledged that inflationary
risks from the impact of a Middle East war on oil prices and the uncertainty over
the fiscal performance have a significant bearing on the inflation outlook and
would, therefore, continue to inform prospective monetary decisions.

**32. The members of the Monetary Board were of the view that the mixed signals**
concerning the strength of domestic demand accompanied by a greater risk of
tepid global economic activity could likely translate into a muted export demand
which could add to the existing real sector weakness, particularly in
manufacturing activity.

**33. In their assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the members**
of the Monetary Board addressed the following issues:

a. With the potential risks to the inflation outlook, would an increase in policy
rates be warranted?

b. Given the uncertainties in external conditions—posed by heightened risks
in geopolitical events and the tepid pace of  global economic recovery—

combined with  areas of  weakness in domestic demand, should policy
rates be eased in order to provide greater stimulus to the environment?

c. Looking at both perspectives, should the policy  stance remain cautious—
one that  continues be accommodative while  at the same time  watching
closely the risks to the inflation outlook—and should authorities maintain
the current monetary policy settings?

**34.  Increase policy rates**

The Monetary Board noted that the main argument for tighter monetary
policy through  an increase in policy rates  was that the rate hike would serve
as a pre-emptive action against the risks to the inflation outlook  arising mainly
from demand-side pressures.   In the case of the Philippines, the Monetary
Board stressed that the potential risks to  inflation would likely emanate largely
from supply-side factors  such as the El Niño weather disturbance and the
increase in oil prices,  power rates as well as water charges. Given that the signs
of strength of the domestic economic recovery remained tentative,  the
members of the Monetary Board agreed that an increase in interest rates could
dampen incentives for increased consumption and investments. The members of
the Monetary Board, however, recognizes that a neutral monetary policy stance
could provide traction  as  economic growth recovers.

**35. Reduce policy rates**

The Monetary Board pointed out that a further easing of the BSP’s
monetary policy stance at this time would infuse additional liquidity in the
system, which is already very liquid. Given that monetary policy actions affect
the economy with some lag, the Monetary Board believed that reducing interest
rates now could undermine the attainability of the inflation target  over the
policy horizon. In particular, the Monetary Board discussed the following main
risk factors to  inflation and inflation expectations arising from  a reduction in
policy rates:

� The present scope for monetary easing is limited by the fact that policy rates
have already been reduced to a significant extent over the past year
(amounting to a cumulative 800 basis points for the period 4 December 200015 March 2002).

� The significant extent of monetary easing since December 2000 and the
resulting ample liquidity in the financial system should give the economy
ample room to expand without the need for further monetary stimulus.

� The traditional transmission channels of monetary policy impulses may be
weak under present conditions and that further easing could have little
impact on real sector activity. This could be attributed to  structural
constraints such as the still relatively  large level of NPLs of the banking
system—although there are signs of improvement—which  drives banks’
cautious lending stance.[33]

� The best approach to the problem of weak credit demand may simply be to
allow sufficient  time for the past  monetary  easing to work its way fully
through the real sector.

� In addition, the NG fiscal performance poses a significant concern for the
inflation outlook.

� Further monetary easing, either through a reduction in the BSP’s policy rates
or in liquidity reserves,  would  infuse  more liquidity in the system,
which could generate inflationary pressures.

� A reduction in the BSP’s policy rates  would narrow down further  the
country’s interest rate differentials with foreign interest rates, which could
trigger renewed volatility in the foreign exchange market and  impact
adversely on inflation and inflation expectations.

**36. Maintain policy rates**

The members of the Monetary Board were of the view that a combination
of a manageable inflation outlook, uneven domestic demand conditions, and the
prospect of weaker economic activity overseas underscored the need for
policymakers to focus on ensuring that monetary policy settings would remain
supportive of the liquidity requirements of a growing economy. To strengthen
further this argument, the members of the Monetary Board pointed out that the

33 As of end-September 2002, the ratio of commercial banks’ NPL to total loan portfolio fell to 16.4
percent  from 17.6 percent in the previous month.

previous monetary easing moves of the BSP have started to show a favorable
impact on the private sector credit demand and capital spending. This could, in
turn, signal a sustained rise in bank lending and economic activity. Nevertheless,
the Monetary Board also noted that the continuing presence of cost-side
inflationary risks, including those from movements in food and oil prices as well
as the fiscal performance, require a cautious monetary policy stance going
forward.

**37. In summing up, the Monetary Board emphasized that the overall assessment**
for future inflation and output supported continued caution on the part of
monetary authorities, with greater recognition of the lags in monetary policy in
order to gain a firmer indication of the extent to which monetary impulses have
begun to support real sector activity.

**III.  Monetary Policy Decision**

**38. Based on the analysis of various indicators on the macroeconomy and the**
financial sector that have become available since the review of the BSP’s
monetary policy stance by the Monetary Board on 19 December 2002 and a
careful assessment of the balance of risks on inflation and inflationary
expectations, the Monetary Board believed that the current monetary policy
stance continued to be  appropriately supportive of the economy’s growth
objective while ensuring price stability. In particular, the Monetary Board
decided to approve the following measures:

a. maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 7.0 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight RP
(lending) rate;

b. maintain the tiering scheme on banks’ placements with the BSP under the
RRP and SDA windows;

c. maintain the  current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs; and

d. maintain the reserve requirements at their current levels given the adequate
level of liquidity in the system.
