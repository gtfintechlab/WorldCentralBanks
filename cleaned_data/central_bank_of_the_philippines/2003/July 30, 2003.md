**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 31 JULY 2003[∗]**


**Background**

On 31 July 2003, the Monetary Board held its ninth meeting for the
year on monetary policy issues. At the meeting, the Advisory Committee[1]
presented its recommendations to the Monetary Board on the stance of
monetary policy of the BSP, based on the Committee’s assessment of the
outlook for inflation, the economy’s growth prospects, and the emerging
trends in key macroeconomic and financial indicators. The recommendations
served as basis for the Monetary Board’s discussion on the appropriate
course of action for monetary policy.

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The Advisory Committee recommended the following measures to
the Monetary Board: (1) maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current
levels of 6.75 percent as the borrowing rate under the overnight reverse
repurchase (RRP) facility and 9.0 percent as the lending rate under the
overnight repurchase (RP) facility; (2) maintain the tiering scheme on
banks’ placements with the BSP under the RRP and Special Deposit
Account (SDA) windows; (3) maintain the current interest rates on the
term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs; and (4) maintain the reserve requirements
at their current levels given the adequate level of liquidity in the system.
These recommendations were based on the following considerations:

� Headline inflation rose to its highest level for the year at 3.4 percent in
June 2003 from 2.7 percent in the previous month and 2.9 percent a year
earlier. This was due mainly to the temporary increase in food prices in
Metro Manila brought about by the series of typhoons  that caused heavy

∗ The highlights of the discussions of the 31 July 2003 Monetary Board meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its meeting held on 4 September 2003.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy
Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the Managing Director, In-Charge of Research and the
Director for the Treasury Department.

rains and flooding. Moreover, increased charges for electricity
consumption in Metro Manila in June as well as higher tuition fees and
prices of school supplies and other commodities coinciding with the
opening of the school year also exerted upside pressures on prices. Core
inflation also picked up during the month to 3.0 percent from 2.4 percent
in May.

� Abstracting from temporary price hikes and seasonal effects, inflation
continued to be relatively low. This mainly reflected the continued
absence of significant demand-pull pressures on consumer prices as well
as the positive impact of supply-side factors. The outlook for inflation for
the remainder of the year thus continued to be benign.

� The strength of domestic demand remained moderate. The tentativeness
of the pace and strength of a pick-up in domestic demand reinforced
expectations of limited demand-side influences on prices.

� The growth in the volume of production index (VOPI) for
manufacturing accelerated to 2.6 percent year-on-year in May from
1.2 percent (revised) in the previous month. Similarly, the increase in
the value of production index (VAPI) for manufacturing improved to
10.7 percent in May from 8.6 percent (revised) in April.

� Average capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector rose to 78.4
percent in May from 77.5 percent in the previous month.

� The pace of bank lending remained modest, with outstanding loans of
commercial banks rising by 3.4 percent year-on-year in May 2003.
This rate of increase was an improvement from the 3.0 percent growth
recorded in the previous month.

� Import demand improved. Total merchandise imports recorded by the
National Statistics Office (NSO) showed a 12.2 percent year-on-year
rise in May 2003, following a 7.6 percent decline in April and an 11.4
percent increase in March.

� Meanwhile, demand for Philippine exports weakened further.
Merchandise exports fell by 4.0 percent year-on-year in May following
a 1.8 percent decline in April. This reflected the downside impact of
the continued softness in global market conditions.

� Other demand indicators displayed similar signs of weakness. The
number of car sold registered a 4 percent year-on-year decline in
June 2003 following a steep 40 percent decrease in the previous

month. Meanwhile, growth in sales of electricity by Manila Electric
Company (Meralco) slowed down to 2.7 percent in May from 5.4
percent in the previous month.

� Positive supply-side developments reaffirm expectations of a benign
inflation setting, going forward.

� Increased agricultural production due to government programs, the
end of the El Niño weather disturbance and normal rainfall conditions
are expected to temper food prices.

� Tighter supply conditions in the world market brought about by lower
production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) combined with delays in Iraqi exports led to higher
international oil prices in July. In spite of this, domestic oil prices were
stable during the month due to large inventory levels of local oil
companies.

� The ERC-approved new generation charges for NPC are relatively
lower than those applied for by the NPC. This helped support
expectations of a benign impact of power rates on future inflation.
Meanwhile, the continued implementation of Meralco’s refund scheme
could support a favorable outlook on consumer sentiment.

� The benchmark 91-day T-bill rate continued its downtrend in July’s
average yield falling by about 16 basis points to 5.17 percent at the BTr
auction on 21 July 2003. The BSP’s monetary easing stance, improved
fiscal performance and continued presence of ample liquidity in the
system have contributed to the easing of interest rates. Meanwhile,
interest rate differentials were narrower for the early part of July following
the BSP’s policy rate cut by 25 basis points.

� Growth in the demand for money improved in May relative to the previous
month’s level. Domestic liquidity grew by 4.0 percent year-on-year in May
2003 from 2.5 percent in the previous month. The continued
oversubscriptions of offerings of T-bills and T-bonds and sizable
placements in government securities by banks also indicated the
presence of ample liquidity in the system.

� The peso was relatively stable against the US dollar for most of July, but
exhibited some volatility in the fourth week as domestic peace and order
concerns were reignited following the escape from prison of a suspected
international terrorist and 27 July 2003 failed mutiny. Meanwhile, on a real
and trade-weighted basis, the peso weakened against the basket of

currencies of the country’s major trading partners and competitor
countries. This suggested an improvement in the country’s external price
competitiveness.

� The fiscal gap narrowed by about a third in the first half of 2003 to P79.6
billion relative to its year-ago level and by about 22 percent relative to the
January-June 2003 target. The narrowing gap reflected the gains from
stronger revenue collection performance and the strict enforcement of tax
laws and measures to increase collection efficiency along with tight
spending policy.

� Global economic recovery remained generally hesitant as a result of
uneven and tentative improvements in macroeconomic conditions in the
major economies.

� Recent signs pointed to a firming up of the US economy as consumer
spending continued to hold up and financial conditions showed
marked improvement following a rebound in the stock market.
However, there were still elements of fragility owing to continued
weakness in labor market conditions, relatively high spare capacity
and the external downside risks posed by the softness in major
trading partners’ economies.

� In the euro zone, the latest data pointed to a continued subdued
economic activity and lack of confidence. Recent economic
indicators suggested broadly that conditions have stabilized but there
were no clear signs yet of the underlying strength in production and
market confidence.[2]

� In the UK, output growth has recently been below trend due in part to
slower consumer demand and subdued private investment along with
the decline in exports which have offset the impact of higher public
spending.[3]

� In Japan, the overall economic activity has remained virtually flat due
to weak consumer spending and housing investment combined with

the decline in public investments. Meanwhile, the recovery in
Japanese exports has also stalled.[4]

� In the prevailing environment, the major central banks continued to
maintain a supportive monetary policy stance by reducing policy rates to
help sustain economic recovery. In the case of the US, the easing was
also aimed at guarding against the possibility—although remote—of a
substantial further disinflation.[5] Following the 25-basis point reduction in
the federal funds target rate by the US Fed on 25 June 2003, the  Bank
of England, the Swedish central bank—Riksbank, the Bank of Canada,
the Bank of Thailand and the Bank of Korea reduced their key policy
rates.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� Based on the information presented by the Advisory Committee, the
members of the Monetary Board agreed that the outlook for inflation has
not significantly changed since the previous review of the monetary policy
stance on 2 July 2003. In particular, they expressed the view that the
assessment of various indicators of demand and supply conditions
suggested that price dynamics will continue to be benign going forward.

� The members of the Monetary Board emphasized that the prospect for
subdued inflation combined with moderate growth in domestic demand
and downside risks to external demand pointed to the need for the
monetary policy stance to continue to help establish a firmer footing for
economic activity.

� The members of the Monetary Board recognized, however, that the need
to provide monetary impetus to growth should be balanced with the need
to guard against excessive easing as well as the need to maintain
operational latitude in preserving the inflation target from potential
pressures.

� Most of the members of the Monetary Board were of the view that the
current monetary stance would help check any possible build-up of
vulnerabilities in the economy that could arise from renewed volatility in
the foreign exchange market, excessive debt accumulation by both the

private and public sectors and the possibility of incipient rise in asset price
inflation.

� In light of these considerations, the members of the Monetary Board
considered the following monetary policy options:

� Ease monetary policy stance; or

� Maintain current monetary policy stance.

� The considerations on easing monetary policy stance were as follows:

The members of the Monetary Board noted that a further easing of the
monetary policy settings would infuse more liquidity into the financial
system, which already has ample liquidity.[6] The majority of the members
of the Monetary Board shared the view that given that monetary policy
affects inflation with a lag, the recent 25-basis point cut in the policy rates
should be given sufficient time to work its way through the system.

� The considerations for maintaining current monetary policy stance were
as follows:

The Monetary Board’s assessment was that the current monetary policy
stance remained supportive of the economy’s growth path given subdued
inflationary expectations. They emphasized that while there is room for
more easing, this should be weighed against the need to remain cautious
and vigilant against any possible resurgence of inflationary threats. A
member of the Monetary Board also noted that there may not be a need
to ease the monetary settings at the moment since there is already ample
liquidity in the system as evidenced by the downtrend in the benchmark
91-day T-bill rate and the oversubscriptions of T-bill offerings. The
Monetary Board concluded, therefore, that maintaining the current
monetary settings would help preserve the BSP’s operational latitude in
maintaining price stability.

� The Monetary Board also briefly discussed the possible implications of
the 27 July 2003 coup attempt on the domestic economy. The members
of the Monetary Board reviewed the economic impact of past coup
attempts, particularly the 1989 coup attempt, on key demand indicators.
They noted that the 1989 coup attempt did not have an independent
impact on inflation and that, based on simulations, the main channel of

6 Based on estimates, a one-percentage point reduction in the reserve requirement would release
additional liquidity of about P14.4 billion.This was estimated as one percent of the sum of deposits and
deposit substitute liabilities of commercial banks amounting to P1.435 trillion as of end-May 2003.

impact of the 1989 coup on the economy appeared to come in the form of
higher risk premium. The resulting higher interest rates along with coup’s
impact on market sentiment and expectations led to a reduction in private
investment. However, the Monetary Board stressed that the economic
impact of the 27 July 2003 mutiny is likely to be considerably less, since
the mutiny was confined to a particular area, did not result in bloodshed
and was resolved quickly.

**III.  Monetary Policy Decision**

� After a careful assessment of the balance of risks on inflation and
inflationary expectations and the evolving domestic demand conditions,
the Monetary Board, by a unanimous vote, decided to:

a. Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent
for the overnight Reverse Repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for
the overnight Repurchase (RP) rate;

b. Maintain the tiering scheme on banks’ placements with the BSP under
the RRP and SDA windows;

For banks’ placements with the BSP under the overnight RRP
window, the interest rates shall be maintained at the following rates:

(1) First P5 billion      - 6.75 percent;
(2) Over P5 billion-P10 billion      - 3.75 percent; and
(3) Over P10 billion      - 0.75 percent.

c. Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs;
and

d. Maintain the reserve requirements at their current levels given the
adequate level of liquidity in the system.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting was scheduled on 28 August 2003.
