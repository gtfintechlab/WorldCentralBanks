**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 18 DECEMBER 2003***


**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The Advisory Committee[1] submitted for the consideration of the
Monetary Board the following recommendations: (1) maintain the BSP’s
policy rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent for the overnight reverse
repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight repurchase (RP)
rate; (2) maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
Special Deposit Account (SDAs); and (3) maintain the current reserve
requirement ratios given the adequate level of liquidity in the system.

These recommendations were based on the following
considerations:

� Inflation continued to be benign as headline inflation fell in line with
forecasts for November. Year-on-year headline inflation rose to 3.3
percent in November 2003 from 3.1 percent in the previous month.
The higher inflation in November was traced mainly to the increase in
the prices of food, beverage and tobacco products as well as upward
adjustments in energy prices. Nevertheless, the November inflation
was well within the staff’s inflation forecast of 3.1-3.5 percent for the
month. Meanwhile, core inflation estimates by the BSP showed a
gradual rising trend in recent months due to the higher inflation rates for
services, particularly education, housing and health services. The BSP’s
main measure of core inflation (CPI excluding food and energy) was
recorded at 3.6 percent in November, a slight uptick compared to the
previous month’s 3.5 percent.

- The highlights of the discussions of the 18 December 2003 Monetary Board meeting were approved
by the Monetary Board during its meeting held on 15 January 2004.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy
Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the Managing Director, In-Charge of Research and
the Director of the Treasury Department. The 18 December 2003 meeting of the Monetary Board—the
13th meeting for the year to discuss monetary policy issues—followed the Advisory Committee meeting
held on 15 December 2003.

� Prevailing cyclical conditions continued to support a benign path for
inflation over the policy horizon. Average annual headline inflation
should see a moderate increase from around 3 percent in 2003 to 4-5
percent for 2004-2005, consistent with the Government’s inflation
targets, as output growth strengthens, aggregate demand conditions
improve, and supply-side factors provide a modest cost-push impact on
consumer prices.

� The pace and strength of domestic economic activity have shown some
improvements but remained uneven across indicators. This suggests
generally manageable demand-side price pressures over the near term.

� Private consumption spending grew by 4.9 percent in real terms
during the third quarter of 2003, slightly lower than the 5.2 percent
growth reported in the second quarter of 2003. Real GDP and real
GNP rose by 4.4 percent and 5.9 percent, respectively, during the
quarter. The growth performance in the first three quarters
strengthened expectations that the full-year real GDP target of 4.25.2 percent will be achieved.

� The volume of production index (VOPI) for manufacturing fell by 3.7
percent year-on-year in September 2003 after a 4.7 year-on-year
increase in August 2003. Meanwhile, the growth in the value of
production index (VAPI) for manufacturing slowed down to 3.1
percent year-on-year in September following an 11.2 percent rise in
the previous month.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing fell slightly to
77.5 percent in September 2003 from 78.6 percent in the previous
month.

� External trade activity remained generally weak. Total imports
showed an 8.5 percent and 4.5 percent year-on-year decline in
August and September 2003, following a 1.3 percent increase in
July. Growth in exports improved for the second straight month,
rising by about 6.3 percent in October 2003. On a cumulative basis,
however, imports rose by only 4.8 percent in the first nine months
while exports grew by only 1 percent in the first ten months of 2003.

� Car sales registered a sizeable increase of 81.9 percent year-onyear in units of passenger cars sold in October 2003 following a 2.7
percent decrease in the previous month. This can be traced to the
recent adjustment in excise taxes, which effectively reduced the
price of certain passenger cars.

� Registered energy sales by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco)
continued to slow down at 0.3 percent year-on-year in October from
0.4 percent annual rise posted in September.

� Conditions in the food and energy sectors suggest generally
manageable supply-side risks to prices going forward. The outlook for
food prices remained positive given the continued favorable
performance of the agricultural sector, particularly in palay production.
Meanwhile, the international price of crude oil softened in November
owing to stable OPEC production, although domestic prices saw
another increase in late November.

� The strong performance in palay production in the third quarter
boosts the outlook of the overall agricultural output in 2003. Thus,
expectations of favorable farm output given continued government
support should help keep prices relatively stable in the near term.

� The international spot price of Dubai crude oil eased to US$27.47
per barrel for the period 1-9 December 2003 from the US$27.66 per
barrel average in November 2003. The decision by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) to maintain its current
production ceilings eased market concerns over possible tighter oil
supply in the world market.[2] By contrast, the domestic prices of
major petroleum products were raised during the last week of
November. These included the prices of gasoline, kerosene and
diesel, rising by an average of 30 centavos relative to their prices as
of 8 November 2003. Meanwhile, prices of liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG) was adjusted by 83 centavos during the first week of
December 2003 from its level as of 8 November 2003. The price
increases reflected the sustained increase in the international prices
of crude and finished oil products in the previous month.

� The Energy Regulatory Commission granted the Manila Electric
Company (Meralco) a provisional rate increase amounting to an
average of 12 centavos per kwh effective January 2004. The
approved adjustment will be reflected in increases in the distribution
charge, supply charge and metering charge components of
Meralco’s unbundled bill.

� Demand for money and credit slowed down while nominal and real
interest rates continued to trend upward. The increase in interest rates

reflected an increase in the risk premia as market concerns over
political noise persisted.

� Domestic liquidity (M3) growth eased to 2.5 percent year-on-year as
of end-October 2003 from 3.4 percent in September.

� The total volume of commercial bank (KB) loans grew by 0.8
percent year-on-year to P1.43 trillion as of end-October 2003. The
increase was slower than the 3.9 percent annual increase in the
previous month.

� Treasury bill (T-bill) rates rose steadily in November due to
concerns over the domestic political front. During the 24 November
2003 T-bill auction, the average yield on the benchmark 91-day Tbill went up by 27 basis points relative to the previous auction on 10
November 2003 to settle at 6.532 percent, the highest since the 26
May 2003 auction.

� The Philippine peso maintained its relative stability during the review
period. During the period 1-10 December 2003, the peso was relatively
steady at its November 2003 average level of P55.39/US$1 as the yearend influx of overseas Filipino workers’ remittances offset the impact of
persistent market concerns over political developments relating to the
forthcoming May 2004 elections. The peso was also less volatile, with
the standard deviation dipping to an average of P0.10 in 1-10
December 2003 compared to P0.17 registered in November 2003.

� The National Government (NG) posted a below-target budget deficit of
P163.9 billion for the period January-October 2003, lower than the
program level for the period by P7.9 billion. This reinforced
expectations that the 2003 target deficit will be achieved, which has
positive implications for inflation expectations.

� In the external sector, key indicators pointed to a moderate to strong
economic recovery for the world’s major economies. Prospects for
external demand consequently appeared to be firmer. Stronger
economic performance has been particularly evident in the United
States, where recovery has been accelerating on the basis of record
growth in output in the third quarter. Gains in performance in the euro
area and Japan have been equally encouraging although slightly less
brisk.

� Output growth in the US was even stronger than earlier announced,
owing to strong improvements in private consumption and business

fixed investment. Manufacturing activity also enjoyed a better
performance in recent months, although the unemployment rate
remained largely unchanged. Nevertheless, news of stronger
economic activity helped prop up consumer confidence and
dispelled fears of deflationary pressures.

� Output performance in the euro area improved in the third quarter.
The European Central Bank (ECB) noted that  indicators pointed
increasingly to a gradual improvement in economic activity,
suggesting that the euro area economy would likely post a slow
but gradual recovery. However, the recent appreciation of the euro
against the dollar poses downside risks to the Eurozone’s export
performance, which in turn could dampen the growth prospects of
the region.

� The UK economy continued to strengthen in the third quarter on
account of robust household spending along with stronger activity in
the services sector. However, business investment declined during
the quarter due to a fall in spending on plant and machinery.

� Japan's economy has shown steady signs of recovery owing to
robust exports and production, despite lingering weakness in other
components of final demand, notably private consumption, housing
investment and public investment. Most observers agree that the
country’s recovery prospects remained intact, but weakness in the
above areas has put a drag on overall growth.

� Amid increased evidence of stronger economic activity in major
economies, central banks generally took a wait-and-see attitude and
opted to leave their monetary policy settings unchanged. The US
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the European Central Bank
(ECB), the Bank of England (BOE) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) have
all opted to keep their monetary policy settings unchanged during their
respective monetary policy meetings in December 2003.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� The members of the Monetary Board were of the view that the balance
of risks for consumer prices has not changed significantly during the
inter-meeting period in the context of the review of the BSP’s monetary
policy stance. They pointed out that present cyclical conditions continue
to support a moderate, on-target path for headline inflation over the

policy horizon. In addition, expected cost-push risks to consumer
prices appeared not to pose a major threat to the inflation objective.

� However, the members of the Monetary Board also noted that the
observed slowdown in money and credit demand and the restrained
pace of bank lending and the generally uneven character of the trends
in other economic indicators tend to suggest downside risks for the
overall strength of economic activity.

� Taken together, the Monetary Board believed that the benign inflation
outlook and subdued domestic demand conditions over the next several
quarters support the argument for maintaining the policy stimulus
without any undue risk of demand-pull inflation. The monetary policy
stance should therefore continue to recognize the liquidity needs of
economic growth against a backdrop of manageable inflation. The
Monetary Board also highlighted the need to ensure that the
macroeconomic environment remains conducive to credit demand and
investment activity.

� Based on the information presented by the Advisory Committee, the
Monetary Board considered the following monetary policy options:

a. An active approach through further monetary easing to
increase the stimulus to economic activity and respond to
the lingering weakness in overall demand; and

b. Cautious optimism in the form of maintaining the current
monetary policy settings to preserve the ongoing stimulus to
the real sector.

� Further easing of the monetary policy stance:

The members of the Monetary Board shared the view that the
principal argument for further easing is to stimulate economic
activity and guard against the downside risks stemming from the
slowdown in the demand for money and credit as well as the
uneven conditions of other indicators of aggregate demand.
However, some members of the Monetary Board argued that easing
the BSP’s monetary stance is premised on the assumption that the
continuing economic weaknesses can be addressed mainly by
monetary policy. They clarified that in addition to the still sizable
level of spare capacity, the large NPLs of the banks contributed also
to the observed weakness in credit. In addition, monetary easing
could also add pressure on the foreign exchange market.

Members of the Monetary Board argued that the possibility of
disorderly adjustments in the foreign exchange market due to
political developments and shifts in market sentiment suggest the
need for caution in formulating the monetary policy stance. On the
other hand, it was also noted that the present pass-through impact
of exchange rate movements on consumer prices is likely to be low
given indications of a negative output gap—such as the high
unemployment rate and relatively large spare capacity—so that a
monetary response may indeed not be warranted.

In addition, a member of the Monetary Board expressed the view
that easing the current monetary policy stance through a reduction
in the policy rates may contribute to even higher demand for public
sector credit, which could eventually constrain the sustainability of
the NG’s fiscal position.

� Maintaining current monetary policy stance:

The members of the Monetary Board noted that the alternative to
active stimulus is one that emphasizes caution in the face of
uncertainty and involves keeping policy interest rates unchanged.
The following arguments were raised by the members of the
Monetary Board in favor of a cautious stance:

a. the outlook for 2004 inflation suggested that average inflation
will be in line with the target, implying that monetary tightening
may not be necessary;

b. there continued to be evidence of sufficient liquidity to fuel the
economy’s growth requirements, hence, further easing may not
be necessary; and

c. the monetary policy stance should be sufficiently cautious to
guard against any possible renewed price pressures that may
emerge over the near term.

In conclusion, the members of the Monetary Board believed that the
decision to maintain the monetary policy stance would continue to
ensure adequate liquidity to support growth in domestic demand
while helping guard against potential price risks.

**III.  Monetary Policy Decision**

� After a careful assessment of the balance of risks on inflation and
inflationary expectations and the evolving domestic and external
conditions as presented by the Advisory Committee, the Monetary
Board, by a unanimous vote, approved the following policy measures:

a. Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent
for the overnight RRP rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight RP
rate;

b. Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

c. Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios given the adequate
level of liquidity in the system.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting was scheduled on 15 January 2004.
