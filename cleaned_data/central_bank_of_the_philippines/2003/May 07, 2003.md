**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 8 MAY 2003[∗]**


**Background**

The Monetary Board held its sixth meeting for the year on
monetary policy issues on 8 May 2003. This followed the 6 May 2003
meeting of the Advisory Committee.[1] The Advisory Committee submitted,
for the Monetary Board’s consideration, a policy paper containing the
committee’s assessment of the economic conditions and their
implications on the inflation outlook as well as the committee’s
recommendations for the appropriate stance of monetary policy. During
its 8 May 2003 meeting, the Monetary Board’s discussion revolved
around the factors that could influence inflation and inflation expectations,
in particular, the forecasts of agricultural production, movements of the
exchange rate, direction of international and domestic oil prices, possible
adjustments in utility rates, liquidity and credit conditions, trends in
demand and output indicators, fiscal developments, world economic
conditions and outlook, and the implications of these factors on the BSP’s
monetary policy stance.

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

� Headline inflation decelerated to 2.8 percent in April from 2.9 percent
in the previous month as the lower food inflation cushioned the impact
of higher fuel prices. The BSP’s measure of core inflation also eased
to 2.5 percent in April from 2.6 percent in March.

� Inflation is expected to be below the Government’s target of 4.5-5.5
percent in 2003 but broadly in line with the 4-5 percent target for
2004. This is based on the assessment that (1) the current state of
domestic demand continued to support a benign inflation setting and

Monetary Board during its meeting held on 12 June 2003.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy
Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the Managing Director, In-Charge of Research
and the Director of the Treasury Department.

(2) supply-related influences such as the El Niño and fuel prices have
shown evident signs of tapering off.

� Some of the main cost-push risks to future inflation have already
receded from the present environment.

� The impact of the present mild El Niño episode on rice and corn
production is expected to weaken as weather conditions improve.
Meanwhile, improved planting conditions and government support
measures to avert possible supply problems of basic commodities
are expected to keep food prices low or stable.

� The decline in international crude oil prices has led to
corresponding cutbacks in the prices of local petroleum products.
Compared with end-March 2003 levels, the prices of premium
gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
as of 5 May 2003 were reduced cumulatively by 60 centavos, 20
centavos, 40 centavos, and P1.10, respectively. Domestic oil
prices could go down further after local oil companies run down
their current inventory of crude and finished products, which were
imported at a time of rising world market prices.

� In the utilities sector, the Supreme Court upheld its 15 November
2002 decision on the Manila Electric Company’s (Meralco)
overcharging case on 30 April 2003.[2] While this implies a
favorable influence on inflation expectations, the ultimate impact
on future inflation would depend also on the final decision of the
Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) on Meralco’s pending
petition for rate unbundling.[3]

� Indicators of economic activity continued to show encouraging signs
but do not, as yet, provide conclusive evidence of a strong and
sustained pickup in demand.

� The year-on-year rise in the volume of production index (VOPI)
slowed to 1.8 percent in February 2003 from 3.7 percent in the
previous month. The value of production index (VAPI) likewise
slowed to 11.4 percent In February from 12.8 percent in January.

2 The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) released its decision on the refund scheme for the said
case on 12 May 2003.
3 Subsequently, the ERC issued its Order on Meralco’s Motion for Reconsideration on its unbundling
case on 30 May 2003, allowing Meralco to increase its rate by an average of 17 centavos per kwh
compared to the average selling rate in May 2003 (ERC Case No. 2001-646).

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing improved slightly to
76.5 percent in February from 76.1 percent in the previous month.

� Commercial bank lending continued to rise for the sixth
consecutive month with an increase of 4.4 percent year-on-year in
February 2003.

� As of end-December 2002, consumer lending activity continued to
strengthen as credit card receivables of both commercial and thrift
banks (including their credit card subsidiaries) grew by 5.1 percent
compared to the third quarter of 2002 and by 13.8 percent from a
year earlier. Credit card receivables comprise about 3 percent of
banks’ total loan portfolio.

� The year-on-year growth in energy sales of the Manila Electric
Company (Meralco)—a leading indicator of overall power
consumption—slowed down to 5.6 percent to 1,847 million kwh in
February after an 11.6 percent annual rise in the previous month.

� Labor market conditions remained soft in the first quarter, with the
unemployment rate remaining at 10.6 percent compared to 10.2
percent in the previous quarter and 10.3 percent in the first quarter
of 2002.

� Treasury bill rates were generally higher in April. The general increase
in the yields reflected the market’s demand for higher premium on Tbills owing to the implementation, beginning 1 April 2003, of the
10 percent value-added tax on banks’ earnings from trading
securities, which effectively replaced the 5 percent gross receipts tax
(GRT)[4] as well as the market’s concerns over the downgrade of the
country’s credit standing by Standard and Poor’s. During the 28 April
2003 auction, the average yield on the benchmark 91-day T-bill
reached an 11-month high of 7.34 percent—although this was 12
basis points lower compared to the rate in the previous auction on 14
April 2003. Meanwhile, domestic liquidity (M3) remained adequate

4 Of the 10 percent VAT liability on interest income from all government securities, 6 percent is
automatically withheld by the BTr as replacement for the old gross receipts tax (GRT), while the
remaining 4 percent is remitted by the banks themselves to the government. On 24 April 2003,
however, the NG decided to temporarily suspend the withholding of the 6 percent GRT-equivalent
portion of the VAT pending clarifications by the BIR on the application of the VAT. This resulted in
the slight decline in 91-day T-bill yields on 28 April 2003 compared to the 91-day T-bill yield on 14
April 2003.

despite the slowdown in M3 growth to 4.3 percent year-on-year in
March 2003 from the previous month’s 6.3 percent growth.

� The peso stabilized in April and gained further ground against the US
dollar. The peso’s recovery, which started around mid-March, could
be attributed partly to the reduced uncertainty in the Iraq situation as
the market priced in a quick resolution of the conflict in the Middle
East. The implementation by the BSP of a number of measures to
curb speculative demand for dollars also contributed to the
moderation of market volatility. The peso settled at an average of
P52.76/US$1 during the month, a 3.4 percent nominal appreciation
from its average level in March.

� The National Government’s fiscal deficit in the first quarter of 2003 at
P58.9 billion was slightly above the target of P55.2 billion, but lower
than the P61.2 billion deficit posted a year ago.

� Business and consumer sentiment in the major industrial economies
remained cautious, weighed down by weak labor market conditions,
sharp falls in equity markets, and lingering geopolitical uncertainties.

� In the US, real GDP rose by 1.6 percent, year-on-year in the first
quarter of 2003, up slightly from the 1.4 percent growth in the
fourth quarter of 2002. Consumer spending continued to be
resilient as advance estimates of retail and food services sales
increased by 2.1 percent in March from a decline of 1.3 percent in
the previous month. Likewise, the University of Michigan’s
consumer sentiment index gained, rising to 86.0 in April from 77.6
in March. Meanwhile, other indicators continued to point to
weakness in the economy as the US unemployment rate rose to
6.0 percent in April from 5.8 percent in March. Likewise, the
Institute for Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing index has
remained below 50 percentage points in April, falling to 45.4
percentage points from 46.2 percentage points in March.

� In the euro area, recent data suggest that economic growth is
likely to remain weak in early 2003. Manufacturing activity for the
euro area contracted in March as the purchasing managers index
(PMI) fell to 48.4 from previous month’s level of 50.1.[5]

� In Japan, domestic demand has not shown any clear sign of
recovery as both public investment and private consumption
showed a declining trend. Meanwhile, deflationary pressures have
somewhat eased due to the recent uptick in crude oil prices and
other international commodity prices.[6]

� Indications of weakness have not yet prompted an easing bias by
most of the major central banks. The US Federal Reserve, the
European Central Bank and the Bank of England all voted to keep
policy interest rates unchanged during their latest monetary policy
meetings. However, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) continued to ease
liquidity conditions as it decided to raise further its main operating
target for money market operations—the target outstanding balance
of current accounts held at the BOJ–from “around Y17-22 trillion” to
“around Y22-27 trillion”. The Bank of Japan also pledged to “provide
more liquidity irrespective of the above target when necessary to
secure financial market stability.”[7]

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� The Monetary Board’s assessment of the current macroeconomic
environment showed that the greater balance of available economic
data pointed to demand conditions that continue to support a subdued
inflation setting going forward. The members of the Monetary Board
noted that BSP’s estimates of core inflation continued to track a
benign trend, suggesting the relative absence of broad-based price
pressures across consumer commodity groups. They argued that this
is consistent with the mixed trends in various indicators of aggregate
demand, the modest pace of credit creation, sluggish employment
and wage conditions, and partial capacity utilization in key sectors
such as manufacturing.

� At the same time, the members of the Monetary Board expressed the
view that some of the main risks to future inflation associated with
cost-push influences, notably the impact on farm prices of the El Niño
phenomenon and adverse movements in world oil prices, have to
some extent receded from the present environment.

� The Monetary Board believed that these conditions strengthened
expectations that headline inflation would remain broadly in line with
the government’s target over the policy horizon. Moreover, the
Monetary Board’s macroeconomic assessment also highlighted the
greater risk of economic weakness faced by monetary authorities here
as in other parts of the world.

� However, the Monetary Board noted that the major risks to future
inflation have not all dissipated. The problem of a possible prolonged
exchange rate volatility and its implications for inflation expectations
has subsided without recourse to sharp policy rate responses. Hence,
the possibility of renewed exchange market pressure should not be
entirely discounted, particularly given that market sentiment is also
vulnerable to changes in the NG’s fiscal performance.

� Given these considerations, the Monetary Board believed that the
current monetary policy settings are consistent with the preservation
of price stability and are appropriately calibrated to support the
economy’s growth objectives.

**III.  Monetary Policy Decision**

� After a careful assessment of the balance of risks on inflation and
inflationary expectations given the various macroeconomic and
financial sector indicators which have become available since its 10
April 2003 monetary policy meeting, the Monetary Board concluded
that the current monetary policy stance continued to ensure price
stability while remaining supportive of the economy’s growth objective.
Thus, the Monetary Board, by a unanimous vote, approved the
following measures:

a. Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 7.0
percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate—without the
tiering scheme—and 9.25 percent for the overnight RP (lending)
rate; and

b. Maintain the reserve requirement ratios for banks at their current
levels of 9 percent for regular reserves and 8 percent for liquidity
reserves.

� For its future discussions, the Monetary Board also agreed to consider
the option of reassessing present monetary settings, particularly the

level of liquidity reserve requirements given that the risks to the
inflation outlook have abated.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting was scheduled on 5 June 2003.
