**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 20 NOVEMBER 2003***


**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The Advisory Committee[1] submitted for the consideration of the
Monetary Board the following recommendations: (1) maintain the BSP’s
policy rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent for the overnight reverse
repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight repurchase (RP)
rate; (2) maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
Special Deposit Account (SDAs); and (3) maintain the current reserve
requirement ratios given the adequate level of liquidity in the system.

These recommendations were based on the following considerations:

� Domestic price conditions have remained benign as headline CPI inflation
fell in line with forecasts for October while core inflation estimates
continued to be relatively low. Year-on-year headline inflation rose to 3.1
percent in October from 2.9 percent in the previous month. This was
within the BSP’s inflation forecast of 2.9-3.2 percent for the month.
Meanwhile, estimates of core inflation registered marginal increases
during the month but remained relatively low. The BSP’s main measure of
core inflation (CPI less food and energy) was unchanged at 3.5 percent
year-on-year in October 2003.

� The outlook for headline inflation remains unchanged. Expectations of
subdued inflation continue to be supported by subdued improvements in
aggregate demand, soft labor market conditions, the diminished influence
of cost-push factors such as energy prices, and broadly stable conditions

- The highlights of the discussions of the 20 November 2003 Monetary Board meeting were approved by
the Monetary Board during its meeting held on 18 December 2003.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy
Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the Managing Director, In-Charge of Research and the
Director of the Treasury Department. The 20 November 2003 meeting of the Monetary Board—the 12th
meeting for the year to discuss monetary policy issues—followed the Advisory Committee meeting held on
17 November 2003.

in the foreign exchange market. The average annual inflation for 2004 is
expected to track broadly the  4-5 percent target.

� The pace and strength of domestic economic activity have shown
improvement but remained uneven across indicators. The overall strength
of aggregate demand is still moderate. These conditions underpin the
Monetary Board’s view of generally manageable demand-side price
pressures over the near term.

� Production in the manufacturing sector improved in August 2003 as
the growth in the volume of production index (VOPI) accelerated to
7.0 percent year-on-year in August from 4.5 percent in the previous
month. Meanwhile, the increase in the value of production index
(VAPI) slowed down to 11.9 percent year-on-year in August from
13.1 percent in July.

� Average capacity utilization of the manufacturing sector was
registered at 78.6 percent in August, a slight decline compared to
July’s reading of 78.8 percent.

� Demand for Philippine exports rose in September. Earnings from
merchandise exports in September 2003 grew by 2.3 percent to
$3.264 billion from $3.191 billion during the same month a year
earlier. This marked a reversal from the 2.1 percent (revised) decline
registered in August.

� Car sales increased sharply by 81.9 percent year-on-year to 3,170
units in October, a turnaround from the 2.7 percent year-on-year
contraction recorded in the previous month. Car sales performance in
October was also about twice the sales volume recorded in
September at 1,703 units.

� Power sales by Meralco slowed down to 0.4 percent year-on-year in
September following a 6.7 percent annual rise in the August.

� Meanwhile, conditions in the food and energy sectors pointed to generally
favorable supply-side influences on prices, going forward. The outlook for
food prices remained positive given the continued favorable performance
of the agricultural sector. This should help offset any possible rise in utility
rates.

� Agricultural production grew by 2.9 percent in the first nine months of
the year, drawing mainly from the robust rebound in the crops sector
in the third quarter. The strong performance in palay production in the

third quarter augured well for the outlook of the overall agricultural
output in 2003. Combined with continued government support,
expectations of favorable farm output should help keep food prices
relatively stable in the near-term.

� The international price of crude increased slightly to US$27.37 per
barrel during the period 1-17 November 2003 from
US$27.27per barrel average price in October. The uptick in world oil
prices was traced to security and supply concerns as well as the
onset of the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere and in other
countries.  Meanwhile, domestic oil prices also rose in the first week
of November to reflect the uptrend in world oil prices in October.

� In the power sector, the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) has a
pending petition with the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) for a
13.58 centavos rate adjustment of its charges, representing a 2.3
percent increase over the current overall average rate of P5.9893 per
kwh.

� Money and credit demand continued to grow, although the pace of
improvement has been modest. At the same time, nominal and real
interest rates registered marginal increases in early November as the
market priced in concerns over the domestic political front.

� Domestic liquidity (M3) grew at a moderate pace of 3.4 percent
(revised) year-on-year as of end-September 2003, slower than the
3.8 percent growth posted in August.

� Credit demand continues to improve. Loans outstanding of
commercial banks rose further by 3.9 percent year-on-year in
September from 3.8 percent rise in the previous month. This marked
the 13th month of sustained positive year-on-year growth in
commercial bank lending.

� Treasury bill (T-bill) rates continued to trend up in October and early
November, fueled mainly by concerns over domestic political
developments. In addition, banks’ anticipation of the National
Government’s (NG) issuance of retail treasury bonds (RTBs) on 27
November also exerted some pressure on market interest rates.
During the 10 November 2003 T-bill auction, the average yield on the
benchmark 91-day T-bill went up by 29.6 basis points relative to the
previous auction on 27 October 2003 to settle at 6.262 percent, the
highest since the 26 May 2003 auction.

� The domestic currency weakened against the US dollar during the review
period due to increased dollar demand by banks, oil companies, and
other corporates. Uncertainties in the political arena also weighed down
on the peso. However, the expected inflow of OFW remittances for the
holiday season should help prop up the local currency.

� The National Government (NG) fiscal deficit for October reached P21.17
billion, 5.2 percent better than the P22.33 billion programmed for the
month due mainly to the turnaround in revenue collections and continued
prudent spending. This brought the first ten months of 2003 fiscal deficit
to P163.88 billion, still P8 billion or 4.7 percent better than the program of
P171.88 billion.

� The prospects for external demand remain uneven. Output growth in the
US has strengthened while the pace and scope of improvements have
been less strong in other major economies and the rest of the world. The
sustained growth of the UK economy has been driven mainly by the
expansion in household spending and the housing sector. Similarly,
steady improvements in Japanese exports and share prices as well as
the slowdown in deflation provided encouraging signs for the economy’s
gradual recovery. Meanwhile, economic growth in the euro area remained
subdued.

� The US economy continued to show tangible signs of a turnaround as
GDP growth accelerated in the third quarter, fueled mainly by sharp
gains in consumer and business spending as result of the stimulus
from tax cuts and low mortgage refinancing rates. Meanwhile, the
continued fall in the number of initial jobless claims, slowdown in job
losses in manufacturing and the decline—though only slightly—in the
overall unemployment rate in October point to improving prospects in
US labor market conditions.

� The euro area economy slowed down in the second quarter.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) noted that indicators
pointed increasingly to a gradual improvement in economic activity,
suggesting that the euro area economy is poised for a slow but
gradual recovery.[2]

� The UK economy continued to strengthen as household spending and
corporate investment showed stronger-than-expected growth.

Moreover, recent data revisions on national income and output
revealed that economic growth has been stronger in the past. With
said revisions, the estimate of the recent path of aggregate demand
has also been raised.[3] The continuing build-up in household debt and
expansion in the housing sector suggested underlying upside
pressures on future inflation.

� In Japan, the foundation for a gradual recovery of the economy has
been set as shown  by the steady improvements in business fixed
and investment net exports. Other components of final demand
consisting of private consumption, housing investment and public
investment, however, remained weak.[4]

� In general, the prospects for world economic recovery has improved
considerably compared to those prevailing in the early part of 2003.
However, the pattern and pace of strength as well as the nature of risks
varied widely across economies. As a result, the major central banks
have responded differently. The US Federal Reserve, the ECB and the
Bank of Japan (BOJ) have opted to leave their monetary policy settings
unchanged, while, the Bank of England (BOE) and the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) tightened theirs. The BOE raised its repo rate by 25 basis
points to 3.25 percent during its 6 November 2003 meeting while the RBA
increased its official cash rate by 25 basis points to 5.0 percent on 5
November 2003.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� During the Monetary Board’s deliberation on monetary policy stance, the
members expressed the view that the prevailing balance of risks for
consumer prices has not altered significantly over the past six months.
They noted that the inflation environment has remained very benign
because of moderate demand, and the outlook continued to suggest an
on-target path for inflation for the next several quarters. At the same
time, they also pointed out that the risk of a deflationary episode
remained low because private consumption spending continued to be
robust while private investment has shown signs of a recovery.

� Some members of the Monetary Board expressed the view that
expectations of a subdued path for both inflation and domestic demand
over the next several quarters support the argument for undertaking
monetary stimulus without undue risk of a rise in demand-pull inflation.
They argued that monetary policy stance should continue to recognize
the liquidity needs of economic growth against a backdrop of essentially
benign inflation.

� Meanwhile, the members of the Monetary Board also noted that concerns
about the possibility of disorderly conditions in the foreign exchange
market due to political developments and shifts in market sentiment
suggest the need for caution in formulating the monetary policy stance. At
the same time, however, they pointed out that monetary policy should
discern and weigh carefully factors that could exert long-duration
pressures on consumer prices. They stressed that this would help
preclude the risk of having the policy stance respond to the noise rather
than the signal generated by economic data.

� With the information presented by the Advisory Committee, the Monetary
Board deliberated on the following possible courses of monetary policy
action to the Monetary Board:

a. An active approach through further monetary easing to increase the
stimulus to economic activity and respond to the lingering weakness
in overall demand; and

b. Cautious optimism in the form of maintaining the current monetary
policy settings to preserve the ongoing stimulus to the real sector.

� Further easing of the monetary policy stance:

The members of the Monetary Board argued that easing the current
monetary policy settings would help build up momentum for economic
activity and the observed improvement in consumer confidence.
However, they also maintained the view that there is a need for
monetary authorities to guard against excessive easing, particularly
given the ample liquidity in the system. Moreover, they also believed
that there is some ambiguity on whether further relaxation would
translate to a significant improvement in credit growth and aggregate
demand.

� Maintaining current monetary policy stance:

As in the previous review of the monetary policy stance by the
Monetary Board, the members of the Monetary Board raised the
following points in favor of maintaining the current monetary policy
stance: (a) the outlook for 2004 inflation suggests average inflation
will be in line with the target, implying that monetary tightening may
not be necessary; (b) there continues to be evidence of sufficient
liquidity to fuel the economy’s growth requirements, hence, further
easing may not be necessary; and (c) the monetary policy stance
should remain sufficiently cautious to guard against any possible
renewed price pressures that may emerge over the near term.

**III.  Monetary Policy Decision**

� After a careful assessment of the balance of risks on inflation and
inflationary expectations and the evolving domestic and external
conditions as presented by the Advisory Committee, the Monetary Board,
by a unanimous vote, approved the following policy measures:

a. Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent
for the overnight RRP rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight RP rate;

b. Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs;
and

c. Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios given the adequate
level of liquidity in the system.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting was scheduled on 18 December 2003.
