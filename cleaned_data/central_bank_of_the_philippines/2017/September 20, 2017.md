**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON THE MONETARY POLICY**


**STANCE HELD ON 21 SEPTEMBER 2017[1]**

**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Maintain the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate at 3.0 percent;

b) Maintain the current overnight deposit and overnight lending rates; and

c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

  - The Monetary Board’s (MB) decision to keep monetary policy settings steady was based on

its assessment that the inflation environment remains manageable. Latest forecasts show
the future inflation path will continue to be within the target range for 2017-2019.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations remain firmly anchored close to the midpoint of the
Government’s 3 percent ± 1 percentage point target over the policy horizon.

  - The MB also recognized that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook continues to be

on the upside. While the proposed tax reform program may exert potential transitory
pressures on prices, various social safety nets and the resulting improvement in output
and productivity will likely temper the impact on inflation over the medium term.

  - At the same time, while prospects for global economic growth have stayed broadly

upbeat, geopolitical tensions and lingering uncertainty over macroeconomic policies in
advanced economies continue to pose downside risks to external demand. The outlook for
domestic economic activity remains firm, supported by positive consumer and business
sentiment and ample liquidity. Moreover, as credit for production activities continues to
expand in line with output growth, the economy’s improving absorptive capacity is
likewise seen to be sustained, thus mitigating inflation pressures over the long run.
Nonetheless, the Monetary Board remains watchful over evolving economic growth and
liquidity conditions and their implications for price and financial stability.

1 The discussions herein reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on a comprehensive set of economic information available at
the time of the policy meeting. The highlights of the discussions during the 21 September 2017 monetary policy meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its regular meeting held on 5 October 2017. The next meeting of the Monetary Board on the monetary policy stance is

**III.   Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook**

The MB considered the following developments in deciding on the monetary policy stance:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - The year-to-date inflation of 3.1 percent (as of August 2017) remained well within the

National Government’s (NG) inflation target range of 3.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point
for 2017. August headline inflation rose to 3.1 percent from 2.8 percent in the previous
month on higher prices for both food and non-food items. The higher August inflation was
driven by increases in non-food items such as electricity, domestic petroleum products,
and air and sea passenger fares. Likewise, food inflation went up as prices of fish, corn, and
vegetables increased due to some tightness in domestic supply caused by adverse weather
conditions during the month.

  - Core inflation—which excludes certain volatile food and energy items to better capture

underlying price pressures—rose to 3.0 percent from 2.6 percent. Likewise, alternative
measures of core inflation were generally increasing – the trimmed mean, net of volatile
items, and principal component analysis accelerated while the weighted median was
steady during the month.

**B.  Inflation expectations**

  - Inflation expectations—based on forecast surveys of private sector economists by the

BSP—continued to be in line with the BSP’s within-target inflation outlook. Results of the
BSP’s August 2017 survey of private sector economists showed a lower mean inflation
forecast for 2017 of 3.1 percent (from 3.2 percent) while mean inflation forecasts for 2018
and 2019 remained broadly steady at 3.4 percent.

**C.  Inflation outlook**

  - Average inflation was projected to settle near the midpoint of the NG’s target range of

3.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point in 2017-2019. The latest average baseline inflation
forecasts for 2017-2019 were slightly higher compared to the previous forecast round due
to the depreciation of the peso, higher global crude oil prices, increased domestic liquidity
growth, and the higher-than-assumed increase in the minimum wage.

  - The risks to future inflation remained weighted toward the upside. The transitory impact

of the government’s fiscal reform program and the pending petitions for adjustments in
electricity rates were considered as the main upside risks to the inflation outlook.
Meanwhile, slower global economic growth due to policy uncertainty in advanced
economies and geopolitical tensions continued to be the main downside risks to inflation.

**D. Demand conditions**

  - Domestic demand conditions remained firm, with GDP growth momentum sustained in

Q2 2017. GDP expanded by 6.5 percent year-on-year in Q2 2017 and 6.4 percent in the
first half of the year. Growth in the second quarter was supported by sustained growth in
household consumption and capital formation, particularly durable equipment and

construction. On the production side, the faster growth of the industry sector (particularly
manufacturing) and the recovery in agriculture mainly contributed to the overall expansion
in output. Domestic demand expansion meanwhile was driven by private consumption,
government spending, and capital formation.

 - Prospects for aggregate demand in the next few quarters are expected to remain positive.

Consumer sentiment for Q3 2017 remained upbeat but turned more optimistic for
Q4 2017 due to respondents’ expectations of additional income, an improvement in peace
and order situation and availability of more jobs. Meanwhile, business sentiment turned
less optimistic in Q3 2017 but rose for the quarter ahead (Q4 2017) due to anticipated
holiday spending and harvest season.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

 - Agriculture, Hunting, Forestry and Fishing sector expanded by 6.3 percent in Q2 2017, a

turnaround from the 2-percent contraction in Q2 2016 and faster than the 4.9-percent
growth in Q1 2017. In particular, the agriculture subsector grew by 7.9 percent during the
quarter brought about by output increases in palay, corn, coconut, sugarcane and other
various crops.

 - The National Food Authority (NFA) reported that the country’s total rice inventory as of

end-August 2017 stood at 1,984.9 thousand metric tons, estimated to last for about
63 days from 73 days in the previous month. The decline in NFA rice stocks was due to low
_palay procurement during the harvest season, as the prevailing farmgate prices were_
higher than the NFA buying price. Likewise, the lower rice inventory in the commercial and
household sectors was attributed to the ongoing lean season.

 - Weather forecast models (as of September 2017) predicted an increasing chance of a La

Niña phenomenon in Q4 2017.

Oil Price Developments

 - Global crude oil prices were higher in September 2017 amid production outages in Libya

and lower US crude oil inventory. At the same time, the MB noted several factors
contributing to the uncertainty in global oil prices including weather-related supply
disruptions, global geopolitical tensions and US commercial crude stockpiles. Meanwhile,
generally tracking the movement of international oil prices, prices of domestic petroleum
products were adjusted upward in August 2017.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

 - The overall electricity rate slightly increased by around ₱0.86 per kilowatt hour (kWh) in

September 2017 due mainly to the rise in generation charge brought about by the increase
in Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) prices, peso depreciation, and the end of the
refund from over-recovery on pass-through charges from January 2014 to December 2016.

**F. Financial market developments**

 - In the first two weeks of September 2017, the peso depreciated on a year-to-date basis

due to the following factors: (i) geopolitical tensions between North Korea and United
States of America; (ii) hawkish comments of New York Fed President William Dudley
supporting another rate hike in the US and the planned unwinding of the US Fed’s bond
holdings; and, (iii) investor concerns following a terror attack in Spain. Meanwhile, the
Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) increased despite geopolitical concerns in North
Korea, closing at 8,180.85 index points as of 15 September 2017.

**G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions**

 - Prevailing credit and liquidity conditions continued to support the appropriateness of

present monetary policy settings. As of July 2017, domestic liquidity increased by
13.5 percent while bank lending grew by 19.7 percent. Demand for credit remained the
principal driver of money supply growth, offsetting the slowdown of net foreign assets.
Broad-based bank lending growth reflected solid demand for loans across key economic
sectors and households.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

 - Fiscal spending remains on track as NG expenditures (excluding interest payments)

increased by 11.0 percent year-on-year in January-July 2017. The NG also recorded a fiscal
deficit of P205.0 billion for the period January – July 2017, higher by 20.0 percent
compared to the P171.0-billion deficit posted in the previous year. After excluding interest
payments from NG expenditures, the primary deficit amounted to P8.8 billion, a
turnaround from the P22.7-billion primary surplus recorded in the previous year.

**I.  External developments**

 - The recovery in global economic growth appears to have broadened. Economic activity in

the US, euro area, and Japan expanded faster while GDP growth in China was stronger
than expected. Based on the PMI indices, global economic activity improved generally due
to the stronger growth of manufacturing production in developed economies.

 - The US Fed maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 1.00 – 1.25 percent

during its September 2017 meeting as inflation in the US is projected to remain below
2 percent despite continued strengthening in economic activity and labor market
outcomes. The US Fed also announced the start of its balance sheet normalization
program in October 2017.
