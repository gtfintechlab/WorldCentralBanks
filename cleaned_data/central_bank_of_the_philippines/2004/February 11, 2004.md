**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD**

**ON MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 12 FEBRUARY 2004***


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted for the consideration of the
Monetary Board the following recommendations: (1) maintain the BSP’s
policy rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent for the overnight reverse
repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight repurchase (RP)
rate; (2) maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
Special Deposit Account (SDAs); and (3) maintain the current reserve
requirement ratios given the adequate level of liquidity in the system.

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The above recommendations took the following into consideration:

� Headline inflation in January 2004 was slightly higher at 3.4 percent
year-on-year compared to 3.1 percent in the previous month using the
1994-based series for consumer price index (CPI). The uptick in
January inflation can be traced mainly to the movements in food
(notably, meat and poultry products) and fuel-related components of the
CPI.

� Based on the new CPI series released by the National Statistics Office
(NSO) using 2000 as the reference or base year, inflation picked up
slightly to 4.1 percent in January 2004 from 3.9 percent in December
2003. The new 2000-based CPI series was derived from an updated
basket of goods and services that captures the current spending patterns
and preferences of Filipino consumers. Preliminary analysis

- The highlights of the discussions of the 12 February 2004 Monetary Board meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its meeting held on 11 March 2004.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely the
Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy Governor for Supervision
and Examination Sector, the Managing Director, In-Charge of Research and the Director of the Treasury
Department. The 12 February 2004 meeting of the Monetary Board—the 2nd monetary policy meeting for 2004—
followed the Advisory Committee meeting held on 9 February 2004.

nevertheless, showed that the historical trends of the two CPI series are
broadly parallel.[2]

� Official core inflation statistics (both 1994- and 2000-based) released by
the NSO continued to show a moderate uptrend but remained essentially
close to their headline rates. Based on the 1994-series, the core inflation
rate trended up to 3.6 percent in January 2004 from 3.4 percent in
December. Similarly, core inflation increased modestly to 4.0 percent
year-on-year in January 2004 from 3.8 percent a month ago based on the
2000-series.

� Looking ahead, the average annual headline inflation is expected to track
generally the 4.0-5.0 percent target over the policy horizon. Headline
inflation is expected to rise moderately over the coming year or so, in
accordance with improving aggregate demand conditions, but should
continue to be broadly in line with Government target of 4-5 percent for
both 2004 and 2005. However, the recent volatility in the foreign
exchange market could pose upside risks to the inflation outlook.

� Recent data on domestic demand indicators showed improvements but
continued to be mixed. There continued to be soft spots in domestic
demand, which indicate downside risks to aggregate demand moving
forward.

� The country’s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 4.5
percent in the fourth quarter, driven by the sustained improvement in
private consumption and modest growth of non-public sector forms
of investments such as private construction and durable equipment.
The full year real GDP growth (4.5 percent) was well within the
Government’s target for the year while real GNP growth (5.5
percent) was higher than the target.

� The value of production index (VAPI) for manufacturing declined by
0.4 percent in November 2003 following the 3.2 percent (revised)
and 3.7 percent growth in October and September 2003,

2 On 5 February 2004, the National Statistics Office (NSO) started releasing the 2000-based CPI-series and official
core inflation series alongside the 1994-based CPI series. The 2000 and 1994 headline and core inflation series
will continue to be published until June 2004, after which, only the 2000–based CPI headline and core inflation
data will be reported.

respectively. Meanwhile, the volume of production index (VOPI) for
manufacturing dipped further by 8.4 percent year-on-year (revised)
in November, following a 5.1 percent (revised) decline in October
and a 3.1 percent drop in September.

� Average capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector declined
slightly in November 2003 at 78.2 percent (revised) from 78.6
percent in October 2003 but was higher than the 75.7 percent
recorded a year ago.

� Revised data on Philippine exports from NSO showed that exports
grew by 9.0 percent year-on-year in December 2003 as against the
0.6 percent decline in November (revised from -4.6 percent). The
full year 2003 export growth was registered at 1.5 percent.

� Total merchandise imports reported by the NSO showed a 7.1
percent (revised) year-on-year increase in October 2003, reversing
the past two consecutive months of declines.

� Registered energy sales by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco)
accelerated by 3.9 percent year-on-year in December 2003,
following an increase of 3.6 percent in November 2003. Total energy
sales of Meralco for 2003 grew by 4.4 percent from the year ago.

� The growth of car sales doubled to 109.7 percent year-on-year in
December 2003 from 53.3 percent in November. This brought the
growth of car sales at 11.9 percent in 2003.

� The near-term outlook on the supply side continued to be favorable,
boosted by the on-target output growth of the agricultural sector in 2003
as well as forecasts of robust production in the first semester. These
factors could help cushion the risks to inflation arising from potential
demand-pull pressures.

� The agriculture sector grew by 3.8 percent in 2003, well within the
3.0-4.0 percent target growth of the Government for the year.
Expectations of higher yields due to favorable weather conditions
and continued Government support foster conditions for stable food
prices going forward.

� The international price of Dubai crude oil trended higher in January
due to continued demand for heating fuel in the Northeastern
countries—as the cold spell persisted—and higher demand for oil in
growing Asian economies. In turn, local oil companies raised pump
prices of gasoline and other oil products in January and in the first
week of February to reflect the higher cost of imported crude oil.

� There continued to be evidence of ample liquidity in the domestic
financial market despite the slower growth in M3. Meanwhile, the rise in
nominal interest rates in January mirrored the market’s response to the
downgrade of the country’s credit ratings by Moody’s Investors Service
and the continuing concerns over political developments in the run-up to
May elections.

� Domestic liquidity (M3) grew by a slower 3.3 percent (revised) yearon-year in December 2003 from 4.9 percent in November.

� The total volume of commercial bank (KB) loans increased by 4.3
percent year-on-year to reach P1.49 trillion as of end-November
2003, reflecting 14 straight months of sustained expansion. The
increase in bank lending also represents an improvement from the
0.8 percent annual rise in the previous month.

� The benchmark 91-day Treasury bill rate inched up during the 2
February 2004 auction, reflecting the negative market sentiment over
the credit rating downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service and
uncertainties relating to the current political landscape. The average
yield on the bellwether 91-day T-bill rose to 6.216 percent from the
6.16 percent registered during the 19 January 2004 auction.

� The peso weakened in January and early February due to increasing
political noise ahead of the May elections and the downgrade of the
country’s credit rating by Moody’s Investors Service combined with
higher corporate demand for US dollars and the seasonally lean postholiday inflows from OFW remittances.

� The National Government posted a fiscal deficit of P199.9 billion in
2003, slightly lower than the P202.0 billion target for the year. This can
be traced largely to higher–than-programmed revenue collections of

major revenue offices during the year. The favorable fiscal outturn
should contribute to positive inflationary expectations.

� Global economic recovery continued to show signs of firming up. This
was most evident in the United States with indications of sustained
growth in productivity and output, improving labor conditions and
buoyant consumer optimism. Activity in the major economies has
picked up in the course of the second half of 2003. However, overall
growth remains largely unbalanced, with the euro area and Japan
experiencing more modest upturns. Moreover, the projected recovery
may be hampered by rising oil prices and, in the case of the euro area, by
sharp effective exchange rate appreciation. These developments suggest
a moderate improvement in external demand in the Philippines.

� Output in the US has expanded briskly, buoyed by the recovery in
manufacturing and also by stronger consumer optimism. Although
new hiring remains subdued, other indicators suggested some
improvement in the labor market. Increases in headline and core
consumer prices continued to be muted.

� In the euro area, the revival of activity has been more modest. While
manufacturing activity is staging a comeback, domestic demand has
remained generally sluggish. Fixed investment continued to decline
while household consumption remained subdued. However, the
sizeable appreciation of the euro since late 2003 could impact
adversely on exports growth which could dampen the prospects for
growth.

� The UK economy has been picking up strongly. Strong GDP growth
was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003, fueled by strong retail
sales and record consumer borrowing, against a backdrop of steady
inflation.

� Japan's economy has been recovering gradually. Investments and
exports have picked up—largely as a result of stronger activity in
China—which has supported the recovery in industrial production.
Deflation showed signs of easing, but consumers remained largely
cautious about spending.

� Amid increasing signs of stronger economic activity in major
economies, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank
opted to leave their monetary policy settings unchanged during their
respective monetary policy meetings. Meanwhile, the Bank of England
decided to raise the Bank’s key repo rate by 0.25 percentage point to 4.0
percent on 5 February 2004 while the Bank of Japan decided to raise the
target balance of current accounts held at the Bank from “around 27 to
32 trillion yen” to “around 30 to 35 trillion yen” on 20 January 2004.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� Based on the assessment of the information presented by the Advisory
Committee, the members of the Monetary Board believed that the
outlook for consumer prices over the policy horizon continued to be
manageable. They also shared the view that the modest pace of money
and credit demand continued to suggest downside risks for the overall
strength of economic activity. They noted that future monetary policy
actions should continue to recognize the liquidity needs of economic
growth against a backdrop of manageable inflation and ensure that the
macroeconomic environment remains conducive to credit demand and
investment activity.

� However, the members of the Monetary Board also noted that the recent
pressures on the peso have again raised concerns of a possible sustained
episode of currency depreciation, with adverse implications for inflation
and inflation expectations. Thus, in a pre-emptive move to address the
potential inflationary impact of the volatility in the foreign exchange
market, the Monetary Board raised the liquidity reserve requirement by
two percentage points to 10 percent effective 6 February 2004.

� The members of the Monetary Board agreed that prospective monetary
policy decisions must take place within the larger setting of an inflation
targeting regime, which focuses mainly on the outlook for inflation to
guide monetary policy actions.

� Given these considerations, the Advisory Committee presented the
following monetary policy options to the Monetary Board:

(a) policy changes geared toward preventing further nominal
depreciation and its potential inflationary impact, through

(i) increasing policy interest rates
(ii) other active measures; and

(b) maintaining the current monetary policy settings.

� The members of the Monetary Board noted that monetary tightening
may be resorted to during periods of significant and prolonged
exchange market pressure, when movements in the exchange rate
threaten the inflation target. However, the members of the Monetary
Board believed that an increase in policy rates would lead to higher
market interest rates, which could dampen incentives for increased
consumption and investments, the expected drivers of growth in
2004 and 2005. Moreover, the Monetary Board also pointed out that
the movements in the exchange rate were, in large part driven by
political noise and therefore, were neither structural nor persistent in
nature. Under these circumstances, the Monetary Board believed that
countermeasures to offset these shocks through an increase in the
BSP’s policy rates could be costly to the economy.

� The members of the Monetary Board recognized that other active
measures can be undertaken to help temper a further depreciation of
the peso. In particular, the BSP could tighten further the regulations
on the foreign exchange transactions of banks.

� The Monetary Board’s main argument in favor of maintaining the
monetary policy stance centered around the notion that increases in
domestic interest rates are likely to hamper the available stimulus to
the real sector. Moreover, the degree of exchange rate pass through
on inflation could be mitigated by the continued presence of output
gap, as evidenced by spare capacity in manufacturing and the
unemployment rate. In addition, the members of the Monetary
Board noted that the impact of currency depreciation on oil and nonoil imports may also be mitigated by the fact that current import
demand is relatively low and the country has actually reduced its

dependence on imported crude oil over the last few years. Thus, the
decision to maintain current monetary policy settings reflected the
Monetary Board’s belief that the current monetary policy stance is
appropriately supportive of the price stability objective and is
consistent with the need to ensure sufficient liquidity to sustain
domestic demand.

**III.  Mone tary Policy Decision**

� After an assessment of the balance of risks to inflation and the available
data on domestic and external conditions presented by the Advisory
Committee, the Monetary Board, by a unanimous vote, approved the
following policy measures:

a. Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent
for the overnight RRP rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight RP rate;

b. Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

c. Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios given the adequate
level of liquidity in the system.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting was scheduled on 11 March 2004.
