## HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD
 ON MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 6 MAY 2004*


The Advisory Committee1 submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board: (1) maintain the BSP’s policy
rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent for the overnight reverse
repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight repurchase (RP)
rate; (2) maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
Special Deposit Accounts (SDAs); and (3) maintain the current reserve
requirement ratios.

**I.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The above recommendations were based on the following
considerations:

� Headline inflation in April rose to 4.1 percent year-on-year from 3.8
percent in the previous month using the 1994-based series for
consumer price index (CPI). The increase in April inflation was due
mainly to higher prices of selected food items, gasoline and other oil
products and selected construction materials as well as the adjustment
in transport fares. The average inflation for the first four months of the
year was 3.7 percent, lower than the Government-announced target of
4.0-5.0 percent.

� Based on the new CPI series released by the National Statistics Office
(NSO) using 2000 as the reference or base year, inflation remained at
4.2 percent in April 2004, bringing the average inflation for the first four
months to 4.1 percent.

� Meanwhile, core inflation, defined as CPI inflation after excluding food
and energy items, increased to 4.3 percent in April from 4.0 percent in

- The highlights of the discussions of the 6 May 2004 Monetary Board meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its meeting held on 3 June 2004.

the previous month (1994=100). Similarly, the 2000-based core inflation
edged up to 4.7 percent in April from 4.6 percent in March.

� Forecasts generated by the BSP inflation forecasting models indicated
a slight uptrend in the 2004-2005 inflation, broadly tracking the
government-announced target of 4.0-5.0 percent. The higher inflation is
in line with expectations of improvements in real sector activity and the
emergence of some cost-side risks.

� Selected indicators of demand showed steady yet subdued
improvements. Some soft spots in the domestic economy remain as
indicated by the still fairly high unemployment rate and sizable level of
underutilized resources.

� The value of production index (VAPI) for manufacturing grew for the
third consecutive month in February 2004 by 4.8 percent following
the 0.8 percent contraction reported in November 2003. However,
the February growth rate was slower than the 5.5 percent growth
rate registered a month ago. Meanwhile, the volume of production
index (VOPI) for manufacturing was unchanged year-on-year in
February as against the 0.7 percent drop in the previous month.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing increased slightly to
78.5 percent in February 2004 from 78.3 percent in January, but
was higher than the 76.7 percent a year ago. About 13.7 percent of
the responding establishments operated at full capacity (90-100
percent) in January 2004, 48.5 percent reported operation at 70-89
percent capacity, and 37.8 percent operated below 70 percent
capacity.

� Exports posted a 7.6 percent increase in February 2004, higher than
the 4.1 percent growth recorded in the previous month as well as
the 6.1 percent growth posted a year ago. This brought the JanuaryFebruary 2004 exports annual growth to 5.8 percent.

� Total merchandise imports reported by the NSO continued to
expand for the fifth consecutive month but at a decelerated pace of
6.3 percent in February 2004 from 9.0 percent in January 2004 and
from 21.4 percent a year ago.

� Passenger car sales continued to post double-digit year-on-year
growth rates for six straight months at a hefty 86.3 percent based on
March 2004 preliminary data.

� Registered energy sales by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco)
increased by 7.8 percent year-on-year in March 2004 from 6.2
percent in February.

� The favorable outlook for agricultural production should help ensure
stable food prices and offset, in part, the possible cost-push pressures
on inflation. The potential cost-side risks to inflation could come from
the observed uptrend in world oil prices, the resulting adjustment in
transport fares and the possible increases in user charges in the utility
sector.

� The outlook for agricultural production remained positive consistent
with expectations of normal weather conditions and continued
implementation of government programs to assist the agricultural
sector. The Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS) forecasted _palay_
production to increase by 10.8 percent in the first quarter and by 8.7
percent in the second quarter of the year. Meanwhile, corn
production is estimated to rise by 12.5 percent and 8.3 percent in
the first and second quarters of the year, respectively. In turn, robust
agricultural production should help foster stable food prices, going
forward.

� The international price of Dubai crude oil increased in April following
reaffirmation of an oil production cut by the Organization of Oil
Exporting Countries (OPEC) effective 1 April 2004. The rising
hostilities in the Middle East, which could threaten the stability of oil
supply, also contributed to the upward pressure in world oil prices.
In the domestic market, pump prices of gasoline and other fuel
products increased to reflect the higher world crude oil prices in the
previous month. These developments led to the adjustment in the
minimum fare for the regulated transport sector.

� There are anticipated price increases in the utilities sector, given
that Meralco has filed a petition with the Energy Regulatory
Commission (ERC) for an adjustment in its generation charge.
Moreover, the ERC has also approved an increase in the
Incremental Currency Exchange Rate Adjustment (ICERA) of the
National Power Corporation (NPC).

� In the financial sector, the modest growth in domestic liquidity was
accompanied by relatively weak bank lending. Meanwhile, nominal
interest rates softened slightly in April as political uncertainties eased as
reports showed increasing lead of the incumbent President in the

electoral polls. This led to a narrowing of the margins between domestic
interest rates and foreign market rates.

� Domestic liquidity (M3) grew by 4.8 percent (revised) year-on-year
in March 2004, up from 4.4 percent in January and February.

� The loans outstanding of commercial banks declined by 1.5 percent
year-on-year as of end-February 2004 following a minimal 0.8
percent rise in the previous month.

� The yield for the bellwether 91-day T-bill eased during the 26 April
2004 to 7.161 percent from the 15 March 2004 auction rate of 7.616
percent. The decline in nominal interest rates along with the
recovery in the demand for government securities in April could be
attributed, in part, to easing concerns over domestic political
conditions.

� The peso strengthened in April, buoyed by the seasonal increase in
inflows from OFW remittances in time for the school opening in June
and the decision of a large US pension fund, the California Employees
Retirement System (Calpers) to keep the Philippines in its list of
investment sites. The peso appreciated by about 41 centavos to
average P55.89/US$1 for the period 1-30 April 2004 from its March
2004 average of P56.30/US$1.

� In the fiscal sector, the budget deficit of the National Government for the
first three months of 2004 reached P56.8 billion. This level was lower
than the program for the first quarter and the deficit for the same period
in 2003, both amounting to P58.9 billion.

� Global economic recovery has increasingly become well established as
reflected in the vigorous upturn in industrial production and business
investment, accompanied by marked improvements in business and
consumer confidence for most regions in the beginning of 2004.
However, global imbalances remain, such as the large current account
deficit of the US as against large surpluses elsewhere and significant
fiscal deficits in many industrial and emerging economies.

� The strong pick up of US economy has gained further momentum in
the first quarter of 2004. Household spending continued to move up
while improvement in business activity has become more
widespread. At the same time, labor market conditions somehow
strengthened suggesting that the missing piece in the US economic
recovery has been gradually falling into place.

� In the euro area, the strong external demand, rising corporate profits
and sharp pick-up in fixed investment underpinned the observed
growth. While these factors pointed to an overall positive outlook for
the economy, uncertainties related to weak domestic demand and
sluggish labor market conditions suggest continued weak spots in
the euro area economic activity.

� In the UK, latest indicators on employment, consumption spending
and external trade supported the view that the British economy was
poised to grow above trend.

� Japan’s economic recovery continued to gain momentum, boosted
by strong export performance and growing business fixed
investment.

� Amid sustained indications of stronger economic activity, monetary
authorities in the US, the UK, Japan, and although at a less brisk
pace—the euro area—kept their monetary policy settings unchanged
during the latest policy meetings. In its monetary policy statement on 4
May 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) noted that
“with inflation low and resource use slack, policy accommodation can be
removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.”2 This hinted that the
US Federal Reserve is not likely to raise the federal funds target
immediately.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� Based on the information provided by the Advisory Committee, the
members of the Monetary Board noted that there has been no
significant change in either the inflation outlook or in prevailing
macroeconomic and financial conditions since the previous assessment
of the policy stance by the Monetary Board on 15 April 2004.

� At the same time, the members of the Monetary Board expressed the
view that the continued evidence of double-digit unemployment, spare
manufacturing capacity, decline in bank lending and tepid export growth
over the past several quarters indicated that significant demand-driven
pressures on consumer prices would not likely materialize in the near
term.

� Meanwhile, the Monetary Board’s assessment of developments in the
macroeconomy showed that cost-side factors—notably transport fares,
utility charges, labor costs, fuel costs and the dollar cost of imports—
remained the principal source of risk to the inflation outlook.

� The Advisory Committee presented estimates of the impact of the
various cost-side risks to the average annual inflation in 2004 and 2005.

� In the short term, monetary authorities believed that the economy could
still face inflation risks from sentiment-driven volatile movements in the
nominal exchange rate. They noted that the volatility in the foreign
exchange market could be linked in part, to the possible resurgence of
concerns over the political environment and the sustainability of the
recent gains in tracking the fiscal deficit target towards fiscal
consolidation over the medium term. Thus, the members of the
Monetary Board stressed the importance of continuously monitoring the
developments and trends in the financial sector as well as in the real
sector.

� Overall, the members of the Monetary Board were of the view that the
outlook for inflation remained to be manageable over the near term
relative to the Government’s target of 4-5 percent in 2004. At the same
time, the Monetary Board underscored the need to monitor closely the
emerging risks to the inflation outlook over the policy horizon.

**III.  Monetary Policy Decision**

� After an assessment of the balance of risks to inflation and the evidence
that have been made available since the last meeting on monetary
policy presented by the Advisory Committee, the Monetary Board
approved unanimously the following policy measures:

a. Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent
for the overnight RRP rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight RP
rate;

b. Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

c. Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting was scheduled on 3 June 2004.
