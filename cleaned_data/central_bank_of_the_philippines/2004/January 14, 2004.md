**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 15 JANUARY 2004***


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted for the consideration of the
Monetary Board the following recommendations: (1) maintain the BSP’s
policy rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent for the overnight reverse
repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight repurchase (RP)
rate; (2) maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
Special Deposit Account (SDAs); and (3) maintain the current reserve
requirement ratios given the adequate level of liquidity in the system.

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The above recommendations took the following into consideration:

� In line with staff forecasts, the year-on-year headline inflation slowed
down in December 2003 to 3.1 percent from 3.3 percent in the previous
month. This brought the full-year average to 3.1 percent, below the
Government’s target of 4.5-5.5 percent and equal to the 2002 average
inflation. The low-inflation environment in 2003 may be traced largely to
the absence of significant demand-driven pressures on consumer prices
and the abatement of cost-push inflationary risks.

� Meanwhile, BSP’s estimates of core inflation showed a deceleration in
December. The BSP’s main measure of core inflation (CPI less food
and energy) was recorded at 3.4 percent year-on-year in December
2003, a slowdown from the previous month’s 3.6 percent. The full-year
average core inflation rate of 3.0 percent for 2003 was also lower than
the 3.8 percent average for the previous year.

- The highlights of the discussions of the 15 January 2004 Monetary Board meeting were approved by
the Monetary Board during its meeting held on 12 February 2004.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy
Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the Managing Director, In-Charge of Research and
the Director of the Treasury Department. The 15 January 2004 meeting of the Monetary Board—the 1st
meeting for 2004 to discuss monetary policy issues—followed the Advisory Committee meeting held on
12 January 2004.

� The Government inflation target of 4-5 percent for 2004-2005
represents a moderate rise in inflation, reflecting the impact of a
projected rise in output growth and improvements in aggregate demand,
possible wage adjustments as well as cost-push influences of planned
adjustments in import tariff rates and utility charges. At the same time,
the BSP’s assessment of the outlook for inflation also considered the
risks stemming from financial concerns over domestic political
conditions, which may influence the movements of foreign exchange
and other financial variables with potential inflationary effects.

� Demand-side price pressures are expected to remain manageable as
the pace and strength of domestic demand showed a modestly
improving trend but with continued soft spots.

� Registered energy sales by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco)
accelerated by 3.6 percent year-on-year in November 2003
following two consecutive months of very modest increases. The
rise was due mainly to the growth in consumption by the industrial
sector.

� The October 2003 Labor Force Survey published by the National
Statistics Office (NSO) showed an improvement in domestic labor
market conditions. The unemployment rate decreased to 10.1
percent in October 2003 compared to 10.2 percent in October 2002
and 12.6 percent in July 2003.

� Total merchandise imports recorded by the National Statistics Office
(NSO) showed a 7.1 percent increase in October 2003, reversing
the past two consecutive months of declines.

� Philippine exports recorded by the NSO declined by 4.9 percent in
November 2003 to US$2.95 billion, after two consecutive months of
expansion. Year-to-date exports growth, however, remained positive
at 0.5 percent.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing was steady at 78.6
percent (revised) in October 2003 from the previous month’s 78.7
percent (revised).

� The increase in the value of production index (VAPI) for
manufacturing in October 2003 slowed to 2.9 percent (revised) from
3.6 percent a month ago. On the other hand, the volume of
production index (VOPI) for manufacturing declined for the second
consecutive month by 5.5 percent (revised) year-on-year in October

2003 following a 3.1 percent (revised) year-on-year drop in
September 2003.

� Car sales sustained its increase but at a slower pace of 53.3
percent year-on-year to 2,783 units of passenger cars sold in
November 2003 from 81.9 percent in October

� On the supply-side, potential price pressures from adjustments in oil
prices and utility charges could be mitigated by the favorable outlook for
food supply.

� The international spot price of Dubai crude oil rose to an average of
US$28.10 per barrel in December 2003 from an average of
US$27.66 per barrel in November. The relatively tight inventory
situation and the projected increase in world oil demand imply that
the current high level of oil prices are likely to be sustained over the
near term.[2] In turn, increases in world oil prices are likely to be
passed on to domestic pump prices of oil products.

� In the utilities sector, the Energy Regulatory Commission granted
the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) a provisional rate increase
amounting to an average of 12 centavos per kwh effective January
2004. However, the Supreme Court suspended the implementation
of the rate increase on 15 January 2004 in response to a petition
filed by cause-oriented groups. The approved adjustment would
have been reflected as increases in the distribution, supply and
metering charge components of Meralco’s unbundled bill.

� Agricultural production grew by 2.9 percent in the first nine months
of 2003, drawing mainly from the robust rebound in the crops sector
(notably rice) in the third quarter. Given the agriculture sector’s
strong performance and the government’s sustained efforts to
ensure adequate supply, food prices are expected to remain fairly
stable in the near term.

� With ample liquidity in the financial system and improving market
sentiment over the Government’s fiscal performance, nominal interest
rates eased in early January.

� Domestic liquidity (M3) growth in November 2003 accelerated to 4.9
percent (revised) year-on-year from 2.5 percent in October.

� The total volume of commercial bank (KB) loans expanded by 4.3
percent year-on-year to reach P1.49 trillion as of end-November
2003, reflecting 14 straight months of sustained expansion. The
increase in bank lending also represents an improvement from the
0.8 percent annual rise in the previous month.

� Treasury bill rates eased in the first regular auction for 2004 as
banks, still awash with excess liquidity from the holiday season,
competed to bid lower rates for government debt papers. During the
5 January 2004 T-bill auction, the average yield on the bellwether
91-day T-bill fell by 28.6 basis points to 6.246 percent from the
6.532 percent yield registered during the last auction held on 24
November 2003 auction.

� The peso weakened slightly against the US dollar in December despite
the seasonal inflows of remittances from Overseas Filipino Workers
(OFWs). This was due to concerns surrounding the forthcoming national
elections as well as the higher corporate demand for dollars to cover for
anticipated short dollar positions in the first few months of 2004. The
peso-dollar exchange rate averaged at P55.43/US$1 in December
2003, weaker by about 4 centavos from November’s average of
P55.39/US$1

� The NG fiscal position remained on track as revenues improved further
while spending continued to be prudent. The NG fiscal deficit for
November reached only P8.3 billion, P9.5 billion lower than the target
deficit for November. This brought the NG budget deficit to P172.2
billion for the period January-November 2003, P17.5 billion below the
program for the same period.

� Prospects for external demand for the domestic economy appear to be
firmer. The world economy, led by the US, continued to show evidence
of a moderate to strong recovery ahead. The economic performance of
the euro area and Japan have been equally encouraging although
slightly less brisk.

� The US economy continued to gather strength in the fourth quarter
of 2003 after posting a significant third quarter real GDP growth of
8.2 percent, the strongest since 1984. The US Federal Reserve

noted that recent economic news have confirmed that “output is
expanding briskly and that labor markets are improving modestly.”[3 ]

� The European Central Bank (ECB) noted that indicators pointed
increasingly to a gradual economic recovery in the euro area over
the next quarters.[4] However, the recent appreciation of the euro
against the US dollar poses downside risks to the Eurozone’s export
performance, which in turn can dampen the growth prospects for the
region.

� The UK economy continued to strengthen in the third quarter of
2003 on account of robust household spending, supported by the
stronger activity in the services sector. However, business
investment spending declined during the quarter due to a fall in
spending on plant and machinery.

� Japan's economy  has shown a gradual recovery as  evidenced by
the  steady growth in exports and business investments (private
capital outlays).[5] However, consumption spending has remained
virtually flat due to still-weak labor market conditions. Moreover,
given persistent structural factors such as excessive debt, the Bank
of Japan (BOJ) expected that the increase in business fixed
investment would  remain moderate.

� Against the current global economic backdrop, the major central banks
remained generally cautious and kept their monetary policy settings
unchanged as they await for firmer evidence of a sustained economic
upturn. The US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the
Governing Council of the ECB, the Monetary Policy Committee of the
BOE and the BOJ have all opted to keep current monetary policy
guidelines unchanged.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� Following the Advisory Committee’s presentation on the developments
in key macroeconomic and financial indicators, the members of the
Monetary Board discussed the appropriate monetary policy stance. The
Monetary Board members shared the view that the absence of material
changes in the balance of risks for consumer prices over the policy
horizon strongly underlines the argument for maintaining the present
monetary policy settings to ensure continued stimulus to the real sector.

� The members of the Monetary Board argued that the modest pace of
money and credit demand as well as the generally uneven character of
the trends in other economic indicators suggested downside risks for
the overall strength of economic activity. They pointed out the need for
monetary policy to recognize the liquidity needs of economic growth
against a backdrop of manageable inflation and ensure that the
macroeconomic environment remained conducive to credit demand and
investment activity. This would also affect over time the supply factors
that could impinge on price stability.

� The following possible courses of action were presented by the
Advisory Committee to the Monetary Board:

a. An active approach through further monetary easing to increase the
stimulus to economic activity and respond to the lingering weakness
in overall demand; and

b. Cautious optimism in the form of maintaining the current monetary
policy settings to preserve the ongoing stimulus to the real sector.

� Further easing of the monetary policy stance:

The members of the Monetary Board agreed that the principal
argument for further easing is the evidence of uneven conditions in
aggregate demand, which pointed to downside risks to economic
activity. However, they stressed that expected uptrend in inflation
over the policy horizon suggests that a reduction in policy interest
rates may not be warranted as this could fuel further pressures on
consumer prices. The members of the Monetary Board also argued
that a reduction in the policy rates may contribute to even higher
demand for public sector credit, which could eventually constrain the
sustainability of the NG’s fiscal position.

In addition, the Monetary Board members raised the possibility of
exchange market pressure when monetary policy settings are
eased. The possibility of disorderly adjustments in the foreign
exchange market, particularly due to political developments and
shifts in market sentiment, underpin the need for continued caution
in formulating the monetary policy stance. The members of the
Monetary Board, however, pointed out that the pass through effect
of exchange rate movements should be small given indications of
negative output gap such as the sizable level of spare capacity in
the manufacturing sector and the double digit unemployment level.
However, they also noted that while the degree of exchange rate
pass through to inflation is presently small, this should be carefully
watched as a sharp and sustained depreciation of the peso could
upset the inflation target.

� Maintaining current monetary policy stance:

As in the previous Monetary Board meetings, the following
arguments were again raised by the members of the Monetary
Board in favor of maintaining current monetary policy settings:

a. the outlook for 2004 inflation suggested that average inflation
will be in line with the target, implying that monetary tightening
may not be necessary;

b. there continued to be evidence of sufficient liquidity to fuel the
economy’s growth requirements, hence, further easing may not
be necessary; and

c. the monetary policy stance should be sufficiently cautious to
guard against any possible renewed price pressures that may
emerge over the near term.

In conclusion, the members of the Monetary Board agreed that the
decision to maintain the monetary policy stance would continue to
ensure adequate liquidity to support growth in domestic demand
while helping guard against potential price risks.

**III.  Monetary Policy Decision**

� After an extensive discussion of the balance of risks to inflation and the
available data on domestic and external conditions presented by the
Advisory Committee, the Monetary Board, by a unanimous vote,
approved the following policy measures:

a. Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent
for the overnight RRP rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight RP
rate;

b. Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

c. Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios given the adequate
level of liquidity in the system.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting was scheduled on 12 February 2004.
