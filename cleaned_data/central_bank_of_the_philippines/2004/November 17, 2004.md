## HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON
 MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 18 NOVEMBER 2004*


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current uniform rates of 6.75
percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.0 percent for
the overnight RP (lending) rate;

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
Special Deposit Accounts (SDAs); and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

2) Continue to strengthen support for the use of non-monetary measures to
address supply-side risks, particularly those relating to food prices,
through representation and coordination with the relevant government
agencies.

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The above recommendations were based on the following
considerations:

� Year-on-year headline inflation (1994=100) accelerated further to 7.1
percent year-on-year in October from 6.9 percent in September. This
brought the average inflation for the period January to October 2004 to
5.1 percent, marginally exceeding the upper end of the Government-set
inflation target of 4.0-5.0 percent for 2004. As in previous months, the
increase in the prices of food and energy-related CPI components
accounted for the largest contribution to the observed increase in
inflation.

- The highlights of the discussions of the 18 November 2004 Monetary Board meeting were approved by
the Monetary Board during its meeting held on 16 December 2004.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely: the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy
Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor, In-Charge of Research and
the Director of the Treasury Department.

� The 2000-based headline inflation rate displayed a similar uptrend,
reaching 7.7 percent in October 2004 from 7.2 percent in the previous
month, with a year-to-date average inflation of 5.4 percent.

� Core inflation (defined as headline inflation excluding selected food and
energy products) also edged higher in October. The 1994-based core
inflation increased to 6.9 percent in October from 6.6 percent in
September, while the 2000-based core inflation also rose to 6.7 percent
in October from 6.6 percent in September.

� Forecasts generated by BSP inflation forecasting models continue to
indicate that inflation is likely to exceed the 4.0-5.0 percent inflation target
set by the Government for 2004 and 2005 before easing back to 4.0-5.0
percent by 2006.

� Aggregate demand indicators showed positive trends but unemployment
and loan growth rates continue to point to soft spots in the domestic
economy.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing has remained at close
to 80 percent in recent months. Data for August 2004 showed
average capacity utilization at 79.2 percent (revised), a slight
deceleration from the 79.7 percent in July. This level was higher than
the 78.7 percent registered for the same month a year ago.

� The value of production index (VAPI) for manufacturing increased by
3.2 percent year-on-year (revised) in August, a slowdown from the
7.7 percent registered in July. Meanwhile, the volume of production
index (VOPI) for manufacturing declined by 3.6 percent year-on-year
(revised) in August following a 0.2 percent contraction in July.

� Exports posted an 8.4 percent year-on-year growth in September
2004, slower than the 13.7 percent recorded in the previous month.
This brought the January-September 2004 annual exports growth to
8.5 percent.

� Total merchandise imports accelerated to 8.9 percent year-on-year in
August 2004 from 5.6 percent growth in July 2004. For the January
to August 2004 period, the cumulative annual growth of imports was
7.1 percent.

� Growth in passenger car sales was flat in October as reported by the
Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines, Inc.
(CAMPI). This came after a 76.6 percent sales increase in the
previous month. This also represented a deceleration from the 81.9
percent increase in October 2003. Meanwhile, the combined truck

and bus sales posted an 8.7 percent year-on-year growth in October,
a reversal from the 7.8 percent dip in September.

� Energy sales by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) increased by
5.7 percent year-on-year in September, higher than the 3.0 percent
growth in August, and the 0.4 percent rise in September of last year.

� Unemployment rate remained relatively high at 11.7 percent in July
2004. Nevertheless, the July 2004 unemployment rate represented
an improvement from the 12.6 percent registered for the comparable
period in the previous year. This is still considerably higher than 7.4
percent, the lowest unemployment rate recorded during the peak
growth years 1993-1996.

� The demand for money and credit continued to post modest growth.

� Domestic liquidity (M3) rose by 5.3 percent year-on-year in
September 2004, a slight deceleration from the 6.1 percent rise
posted in the previous month. At 5.3 percent, however, the growth in
M3 remained significantly below the double-digit levels posted in the
growth years during the pre-Asian crisis period of 1993-1996.

� Commercial bank lending rose by 1.9 percent year-on-year to P1.5
trillion as of end-September 2004. This was a marked slowdown
from the 5.5 percent increase recorded in the previous month, and
lower than the double-digit growth rates registered during the preAsian crisis period of 1993-1996.

� At the same time, domestic interest rates continued to rise. Reference
yields for the 91-day and 182-day T-bills rose during the 8 November
2004 auction of the Bureau of the Treasury relative to those of 11
October 2004. By contrast, the yield for the 364-day T-bill declined
during the said auction. The rise in yields reflected market concerns that
rising oil prices would push inflation higher as well as worries relating to
sustainability of the fiscal position and the country’s credit rating.

� Supply-side factors continue to dominate the risks to the inflation outlook.
These risk factors include primarily the rise in world oil prices, which will
affect the cost of producing other goods and services. Nonetheless, the
prospect of favorable agricultural output for the rest of the year is
expected to provide a cushion for food prices.

� The agriculture sector posted a robust 6.6 percent growth in the first
semester of 2004. This supports expectations of favorable
agricultural production for the rest of the year. However, the
possibility of a weak El Niño episode in early 2005 could pose upside
pressures to food prices in the first quarter of 2005.

� The international price of Dubai crude oil eased somewhat in early
November 2004 after peaking in the previous month. The
international oil market was slightly calmed after seeing that stocks
remained adequate and the growth in demand for oil could moderate
due to high oil prices. In the domestic oil market, retail pump prices
of petroleum products increased five times in October from their endSeptember levels, reflecting the recent uptrend in world oil prices.

� The peso weakened slightly against the US dollar in October through
early November due to continuing market jitters over rising global oil
prices, and the consequent inflation uptrend, weaker regional currency
markets, the increase in dollar purchases by oil and other manufacturing
companies, and renewed worries over the government’s fiscal position.

� In the fiscal sector, data showed that the NG budget deficit in the third
quarter of 2004 reached P61.8 billion, lower than the deficit level for the
same period last year of P63.1 billion. This deficit for the first three
quarters of P141.9 billion was likewise lower than the P142.7 billion fiscal
gap recorded in the same period a year ago.

� Global economic activity continued to show signs of firming up,
underpinned by robust industrial production and rising corporate profits.
This was accompanied by the strengthening of consumer demand and
labor market conditions in most regions. On the price front, stronger
global inflationary pressures are likely to persist over the near term owing
to the volatility in oil prices.

� US economic activity remained on track as indicated by continued
improvements in consumer spending, business investment, and
employment conditions.

� Recovery of real economic activity in the euro area continued with the
upturn in private consumption, rise in business investment, and
robust export performance.

� UK’s economic expansion moderated in the third quarter, as indicated
by the decline in housing prices, which suggest that interest rates
have peaked and that further increases in borrowing rates could be
deferred until 2005.

� Japan’s economic recovery appeared to be slowing down, based on
evidence of lower export demand for electronics and slower retail
sales.

� The US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised its policy rates
by 25 basis points at its 10 November 2004 meeting. Other central

banks which have tightened their policy rates were Canada, Thailand,
and New Zealand. The main reasons cited by these central banks for
raising policy rates were rising inflationary pressures due to robust
domestic demand and tight labor market conditions.

� Meanwhile, the Bank of England (BOE), Bank of Japan (BOJ), and the
European Central Bank (ECB) remained cautious and kept their
monetary policy settings unchanged during their respective policy
meetings. Similarly, monetary authorities in Australia and South Korea
opted to keep their policy settings unchanged. These decisions were
generally based on the possible impact of tighter monetary conditions on
output concerns given the sluggish growth in private consumption and
investments and soft labor market conditions.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� The members of the Monetary Board noted that average inflation is likely
to exceed the 4-5 percent target in 2004-2005 but should revert toward
the same range target by 2006.

� The Monetary Board also noted that the inflation dynamics have
remained largely unchanged since the previous assessment of the
monetary stance, and that prevailing price pressures continue to be
linked primarily to supply-side rather than demand-side factors, notably
the increases in commodity prices, particularly food and oil.

� The members of the Monetary Board noted that demand-driven
inflationary pressures remain for the most part limited and supply-side
factors continue to have a central influence on the inflation outlook. Such
conditions provide a strong argument for leaving policy interest rates at
their present setting. This argument was further amplified by lingering
concerns about the underlying strength of demand, particularly in view of
the relatively high unemployment rate and the moderate pace of credit
activity.

� On the other hand, price pressures reflected in seasonally-adjusted CPI
data and the observed rise in official and internally generated core
inflation measures suggest the possibility of demand-side effects from
ongoing supply shocks. Such conditions, although tentative, require
closer attention over the next few months, and should be complemented
by information on whether public inflation expectations continue to be
well-anchored in the face of sustained commodity price increases.

� The members of the Monetary Board were, therefore, of the view that the
accumulated evidence supports keeping present policy settings
unchanged, and suggests a greater need for the continued readiness of

monetary authorities to respond to inflation pressures. They noted that
the readiness to act will be particularly important given that the uptrend in
commodity prices is likely to persist over the policy horizon, and negative
market sentiment surrounding the fiscal situation could fuel a prolonged
episode of exchange market pressure, thereby feeding into inflation and
inflation expectations.

� The Monetary Board also stressed that prospective actions toward
monetary tightening, should they become necessary, would be oriented
primarily towards guiding inflation expectations. Significant monetary
tightening does not appear justified by present conditions, and is only
bound to do more harm than good to the ongoing recovery.

� Moreover, the Monetary Board believes that direct action against supplyside risks should remain a key policy priority, and all possible avenues for
non-monetary intervention in the importation, distribution and delivery of
goods and services should continue to be explored, evaluated and
pursued accordingly.

� On the basis of the discussion, the members of the Monetary Board
agreed unanimously to maintain current monetary policy settings.
However, the Monetary Board emphasized that monetary authorities
stand ready to respond to the potential second-order inflationary effects
of ongoing supply shocks and other conditions that could generate
persistent price pressures.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

� Upon assessment of the balance of risks to inflation and the evidence
that has become available since its previous meeting on monetary policy,
the Monetary Board approved unanimously the following measures:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current uniform rates of
6.75 percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.0
percent for the overnight RP (lending) rate;

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

2) Continue to strengthen support for the use of non-monetary
measures to address supply-side risks, particularly those relating to
food supply, by strengthening the BSP’s representation and
coordination with various government agencies.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting is scheduled on 16 December 2004.
