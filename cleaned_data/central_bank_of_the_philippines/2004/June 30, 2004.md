## HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON
 MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 1 JULY 2004*


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board: (1) maintain the BSP’s policy
rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent for the overnight reverse
repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight repurchase (RP)
rate; (2) maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
Special Deposit Accounts (SDAs); and (3) maintain the current reserve
requirement ratios.

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The above recommendations were based on the following
considerations:

� Headline inflation in May rose to 4.5 percent (1994=100) year-on-year
from 4.1 percent in the previous month. The increase in May inflation was
due mainly to higher prices of food items, particularly, meat, dairy
products and cooking oil, which exerted the most pressure on headline
inflation. The average inflation for the first five months of the year was 3.8
percent which remains lower than the Government-announced target of
4.0-5.0 percent for 2004.

� Based on the new CPI series released by the National Statistics Office
(NSO) using 2000 as the reference or base year, inflation increased to
4.7 percent in May from 4.2 percent in the previous two months, bringing
the average inflation for the first five months to 4.1 percent.

� Likewise, core inflation (defined as headline inflation excluding selected
food and energy products) edged up to 4.7 percent in May from 4.3
percent in the previous month (1994=100). Similarly, the 2000-based
core inflation rose to 5.2 percent in May from 4.7 percent in the previous
month.

- The highlights of the discussions of the 1 July 2004 Monetary Board meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its meeting held on 5 August 2004.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely: the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy
Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor, In-Charge of Research and
the Director of the Treasury Department. The 1 July 2004 meeting of the Monetary Board—the 7th
monetary policy meeting for 2004—followed the Advisory Committee meeting held on 28 June 2004.

� Forecasts generated by the BSP’s inflation forecasting models indicated
that average headline inflation is likely to track the upper end of the 4.05.0 percent target inflation in 2004 and could possibly rise above the
target in 2005 with the full impact of the various supply-side risk factors.
The uptrend in inflation in recent months was driven mainly by supplyside factors, including the rise in the prices of food products, increase in
the domestic pump prices of gasoline and other oil products as well as
the adjustments in transport fares and utilities charges.

� Selected indicators of demand showed improvements but there
continued to be some soft spots in the economy. This underpinned the
view of moderate demand-side pressures in the near term.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing remained stable at 78.8
percent in April 2004 as in March, but was higher than the 77.0
percent a year ago.

� The value of production index (VAPI) for manufacturing rose by 2.8
percent in April 2004, reversing the 5.0 percent contraction in the
previous month. However, the volume of production index (VOPI) for
manufacturing dipped by 5.2 percent year-on-year in April 2004
following a 10.3 percent contraction in March.

� Exports sustained its growth at 8.9 percent in April 2004 from 7.1
percent in the previous month. This brought the January-April 2004
annual growth of exports to 6.9 percent.

� Total merchandise imports expanded for the seventh consecutive
month by 8.3 percent year-on-year in April 2004 from 4.4 percent in
March. This brought the January-April 2004 annual growth of imports
to 6.9 percent.

� Passenger car sales continued to post double-digit year-on-year
growth rates for eight straight months at a hefty 145.8 percent based
on May 2004 report of the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of
the Philippines (CAMPI).

� Energy sales by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) sustained its
increase for the fourth consecutive month at 3.8 percent year-on-year
in May. This was slower than the 5.2 percent annual increase in
energy sales in April but was higher than the 2.7 percent growth in
May 2003.

� Based on the April 2004 Labor Force Survey conducted by the NSO,
unemployment rate rose to 13.7 percent, representing an increase in
the number of unemployed persons to 4.99 million in April 2004 from
4.22 million persons in April 2003.

� Supply-side factors continued to represent the major source of risk
to the inflation outlook over the policy horizon. However, the
favorable outlook for agricultural production, particularly, for the crops
subsector, should help ensure stable food prices and provide some
cushion against cost-side inflationary pressures. The potential cost-side
risks to inflation could come from the adjustments in transport fares and
utilities charges.

� Continued Government programs along with forecasts of normal
weather conditions suggested favorable prospects for agriculture in
2004. The observed supply shocks have been limited to a few
commodities, particularly, corn, meat and fish products. Overall food
supply conditions remain supportive of price stability.

� The international price of Dubai crude oil eased slightly following the
announcement of an increase in Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries’ (OPEC) production ceiling by 2.0 million barrels per day
(mbd) beginning 1 July 2004, and an additional 0.5 mbd beginning 1
August 2004. In the domestic market, pump prices of gasoline and
other fuel products increased following the rise in world crude oil
prices in the previous month. Such increases translated into an
increase in transportation costs.

� In the utilities sector, the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC)
approved Meralco’s 13.27-centavo per kwh increase in generation
charge by way of the periodic generation rate adjustment mechanism
(GRAM) on 2 June 2004. Similarly, the ERC has also released its
decision on the National Power Corporation’s (NPC) petition for an
adjustment in the generation charge allowing the NPC to raise its
rates by an average of 25.05 centavos per kwh.

� In the financial sector, domestic liquidity accelerated in April while bank
lending increased slightly. Meanwhile, nominal RP interest rates rose in
June relative to the previous month. This led to the widening of spreads
between RP and foreign interest rates.

� The growth in domestic liquidity (M3) in April accelerated to 6.5
percent year-on-year from 4.8 percent in the previous month.

� The loans outstanding of commercial banks (KBs) grew modestly by
0.9 percent year-on-year to reach P1.5 trillion as of end-April 2004,
following the 0.8 percent annual growth registered as of endMarch.

� The bellwether 91-day T-bill rate rose during the 21 June 2004
auction of the Bureau of the Treasury relative to that registered in

May reflecting market’s concerns over the perceived weakening
of fiscal position of the National Government (NG), the anticipated
increase in the US federal funds target rate as well as the risk
premium associated with the then protracted canvassing of
presidential and vice-presidential election results in Congress.

� The peso weakened in June, weighed down by concerns over the hike in
US interest rate, the increase in the country’s unemployment rate and
news reports regarding the NG’s plan to absorb the debt of the NPC.

� In the fiscal sector, the NG budget deficit in May 2004 widened to P12.7
billion from P7.8 billion in April as the growth in revenues was outpaced
by that of expenditures on account of election-related spending. This
brought the NG deficit to P77.4 billion for the first five months of the year,
only P2.2 billion away from the target for the semester.

� Recent developments in the world economy continued to point to a wellestablished and broader-based recovery, as evidenced by robust
industrial production alongside sustained improvements in consumer
demand and strong rebound in global trade in most regions. Overall, the
conditions for sustaining the global economic recovery over the medium
term remained in place. However, the sustained economic expansion in
the US and the UK along with declining spare capacity could exert further
pressures on inflation.

� US economy continued to strengthen. Labor market conditions
improved further while the manufacturing sector sustained its robust
performance in May. However, consumer prices continued to
accelerate due to the steep rise in energy and food prices.

� The recovery of real economic activity in the euro area has
strengthened in recent months supported by gradual improvements in
private consumption and robust export performance. Inflation has
remained in line with price stability although recent oil developments
exerted upward pressures on consumer prices.

� The UK economy continued to exhibit resilient growth. Against a
backdrop of increased consumer spending and rising consumer
prices, coupled with the gradual tightening of the labor market,
inflationary pressures continued to mount in the UK.

� Japan’s economic recovery gained further momentum on the back of
strong export performance as well as sustained improvements in
business fixed investment and corporate profits. However, deflation
continued to persist.

� Amid continued indications of robust expansion of global economic
activity, monetary authorities in Japan and the euro area remained
cautious and kept their monetary policy settings unchanged during their
latest policy meetings. However, the US Fed and the Bank of England
(BOE) raised their policy rates to ease the underlying pressures on
consumer prices as their economies continued to strengthen. The US
FOMC voted to raise federal funds target rate by 25 basis points to 1.25
percent during the 29-30 June 2004 meeting while the BOE raised its key
repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent during its 10 June 2004.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� Based on the latest information and inflation forecasts provided by the
Advisory Committee, the members of the Monetary Board noted that the
inflation outlook is likely to trend upward over the policy horizon. Inflation
is likely to track the upper end of the 4-5 percent target for 2004 and
could possibly rise above the target in 2005.

� The Monetary Board noted that the inflation environment in the months
ahead does not warrant a shift towards a monetary tightening bias. The
recent uptrend in inflation could be traced to relative price changes
involving selected CPI components and, therefore, is not broad-based.
Potential for demand-side pressures on consumer prices are likely to be
tempered by the presence of resource slack as evidenced by double-digit
unemployment, continued spare capacity in manufacturing as well as
subdued activity in lending and investments.

� In addition, the members of the Monetary Board believed that the
possibility of an above-target headline inflation rate in 2005 are largely
tied to supply-side developments particularly, higher energy prices, which
are also driving wage and transport cost adjustments, in addition to utility
charge increases. The members of the Monetary Board were of the view
that the impact of these supply-side factors on inflation is likely to be
transitory and thus, is not likely to be curbed by monetary action.

� The members of the Monetary Board agreed that there is a need to
exercise gradual caution in the path of monetary policy action in
responding to unforeseen developments in the economy. This is in line
with enhancing credibility in setting the stance of monetary policy.

� The Monetary Board recognized that the risk of sentiment-driven
exchange market volatility remained present. They noted that the
prospect of tighter monetary policy in the major economies—with its
implications for interest differentials and exchange market stability that
could, in turn, fuel inflationary expectations—could raise the possibility

that limited monetary tightening may become necessary in the near
future.

� Overall, the members of the Monetary Board shared the view that the
current policy settings remained appropriate for the macroeconomic
environment given the outlook for inflation. However, the Monetary Board
underscored the need to monitor closely the emerging risks to the
inflation outlook over the policy horizon.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

� After an assessment of the balance of risks to inflation and the evidence
that have been made available since the last meeting on monetary policy
on 3 June 2004 as presented by the Advisory Committee, the Monetary
Board approved unanimously the following policy measures:

a. Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent
for the overnight RRP rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight RP rate;

b. Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

c. Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting was scheduled on 29 July 2004.
