## HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD
 ON MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 3 JUNE 2004*


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following
recommendations for the consideration of the Monetary Board: (1)
maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent for the
overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight
repurchase (RP) rate; (2) maintain the current interest rates on the term
RRPs, RPs, and Special Deposit Accounts (SDAs); and (3) maintain the
current reserve requirement ratios.

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The above recommendations were based on the following
considerations:

� Headline inflation in April rose to 4.1 percent year-on-year from 3.8
percent in the previous month using the 1994-based series for
consumer price index (CPI). The increase in April inflation was due
mainly to higher prices of selected food items, gasoline and other oil
products, selected construction materials and the adjustment in
transport fares.  The average inflation for the first four months of the
year was 3.7 percent, lower than the Government-announced target of
4.0-5.0 percent.

� Based on the new CPI series released by the National Statistics Office
(NSO) using 2000 as the reference or base year, inflation remained at
4.2 percent in April 2004, bringing the average inflation for the first
four months to 4.1 percent.

� Meanwhile, core inflation (defined as headline inflation excluding
selected food and energy products) increased to 4.3 percent in April
from 4.0 percent in the previous month (1994=100). Similarly, the

- The highlights of the discussions of the 3 June 2004 Monetary Board meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its meeting held on 23 June 2004.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely: the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy
Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor, In-Charge of Research
and the Director of the Treasury Department. The 3 June 2004 meeting of the Monetary Board—the
6th monetary policy meeting for 2004—followed the Advisory Committee meeting held on 31 May
2004.

2000-based core inflation edged up to 4.7 percent in April from 4.6
percent in March.

� Forecasts generated by the BSP inflation forecasting models indicated
that the baseline average headline inflation is likely to trend higher but
will continue to track the 4-5 percent target for 2004-2005. However,
the recent transport fare adjustments and possible increase in utilities
charges could threaten the inflation target over the policy horizon. The
uptrend in inflation can also be attributed to expectations of improving
aggregate demand conditions and emerging supply-side risks.

� For the first quarter of 2004, GDP rose at a robust pace of 6.4 percent,
while real GNP grew by 6.2 percent from the year-ago level. The
economic expansion was broad-based with all the major production
sectors (supply-side) posting higher growth rates. On the demandside, private consumption continued to be the major driver of growth
along with the strong rebound in both investments and exports.

� Selected indicators of demand indicated continuing presence of some
soft spots in the economy as evidenced by the double-digit
unemployment rate and fairly sizable level of spare capacity in
manufacturing.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing remained relatively
steady at 78.6 percent in March 2004 from 78.4 percent in
February, but was lower than the 80.1 percent a year ago.

� Exports sustained its growth at a slower pace of 7.1 percent
growth in March 2004 from 7.6 percent in the previous month. This
brought the January-March 2004 exports annual growth to 6.3
percent.

� Total merchandise imports continued to expand for the sixth
consecutive month but at a decelerated pace of 4.4 percent in
March 2004 from 6.3 percent in February 2004 and from 11.6
percent a year ago.

� Passenger car sales continued to post double-digit year-on-year
growth rates for seven straight months at 119.1 percent based on
April 2004 report of the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of
the Philippines.

� Energy sales by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) increased
by 7.8 percent year-on year in March 2004 from 6.2 percent in
February.

� The favorable outlook for agricultural production should help ensure
stable food prices and provide some cushion against cost-side
inflationary pressures. The potential cost-side risks to inflation could
come from the observed uptrend in world oil prices, increase in
transport fares and the possible adjustments in user charges in the
utility sector.

� The agriculture sector grew by a strong 8.2 percent in the first
quarter of 2004, the sector’s highest expansion in 15 years and
more than twice the 3.6 percent growth registered in the same
quarter a year ago. Both _palay_ and corn production performed
better-than-forecasted, and benefited from favorable weather
conditions as well as better irrigation facilities and the use of highyielding seeds. Forecasts of robust rice and corn production are
expected to be sustained over the next quarters of 2004 which
should help keep prices stable over the near-term.

� The international price of Dubai crude oil continued to trend up due
mainly to the strong demand for oil from US and China as well as
the prospects of lower US crude inventory and continued hostilities
in the Middle East which could threaten the stability of global
supply. In the domestic market, pump prices of gasoline and other
fuel products increased following the rise in world crude oil prices
in the previous month. These developments prompted regulators
to allow an increase in the minimum transport fare.

� There are anticipated price increases in the utilities sector, given
pending petitions by the Meralco and the National Power
Corporation (NPC) with the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC)
for a 27-centavo increase in generation rate and 12-centavo
increase in distribution, metering and supply charge.

� In the financial sector, domestic liquidity accelerated in April while
bank lending increased slightly. Meanwhile, nominal RP interest rates
eased in May relative to the previous month. This, combined with the
increase in foreign interest rates, has led to the narrowing of spreads
between RP and foreign interest rates.

� The growth in domestic liquidity (M3) in April accelerated to 6.4
percent year-on-year from 4.8 percent in the previous month.

� The loans outstanding of commercial banks (KBs) registered a
modest 0.8 percent year-on-year growth to reach P1.47 trillion as
of end-March 2004. This was, however, an improvement from the
1.5 percent contraction in KB loans in the previous month.

� The bellwether 91-day T-bill rate eased during the 24 May auction
of the Bureau of the Treasury relative to that registered in April as
political uncertainties began to simmer. However, the 24 May 2004
auction rate was higher relative to the yield posted during the
11 May auction due to concerns over rising oil prices and market’s
expectation of an imminent rise in the US federal funds target rate.

� The peso continued to recover against the US dollar for the second
consecutive month to average P55.84/US$1 for the period 1-31 May
2004 from its April 2004 average of P55.89/US$1 due mainly to
easing political concerns after the 10 May 2004 elections and higher
inflows from remittances of overseas Filipino workers in time for the
school opening in June.

� In the fiscal sector, the budget deficit of the National Government (NG)
for April 2004 stood at P7.8 billion, the lowest monthly deficit since
June 2003. However, this level of deficit was 18.8 percent higher than
the P6.6 billion deficit recorded in April 2003. This brought the
cumulative level of deficit for the January to April 2004 period to P64.7
billion, 1.2 percent lower than the cumulative deficit for the
comparable period in 2003 and was 81.3 percent of the 2004 first
semester target of P79.6 billion.

� The expansion of the global economy, led by the US has been
proceeding robustly. Growth in most regions has been driven mainly
by industrial production and business investment, accompanied by
growing consumer demand. However, economic expansion in the US
and UK alongside rising consumer prices, declining spare capacity
and surging world oil prices suggested rising inflationary pressures,
which could pose risks to the sustainability of world economic
recovery.

� The strong pick up of the US economy has gained further
momentum in the first quarter of 2004. The labor market continued
to strengthen while the manufacturing sector returned to fairly solid
growth in April. Consumer prices, on the other hand, continued to
accelerate due to higher food and fuel prices.

� The recovery of real economic activity in the euro area continued,
albeit at a modest pace. The robust global economic recovery has
provided a favorable external environment while modest growth in
retail sales signaled improving consumer demand. While these
factors pointed to an overall positive outlook for the economy,
uncertainties related to the tepid investment climate and sluggish
labor market conditions indicate continued weak spots in the euro
economy.

� The UK economy continued to show strong growth, backed by
robust consumption and solid investment performance. Latest
economic indicators also supported the prospect of sustained
economic growth going forward.

� Japan’s economic recovery continued to gain momentum, boosted
by strong export performance and growing business fixed
investments. Industrial production trended up while private
consumption showed some positive movements as labor market
conditions improved.

� Amid continued indications of robust expansion of global economic
activity, monetary authorities in the US, Japan and the euro area
remained cautious as they kept their monetary policy settings
unchanged during their latest policy meetings. However, the Bank of
England (BOE) raised its policy rate by 25 basis points on 19 May
2004 in order to contain the underlying inflationary pressures.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� Based on the latest information and inflation forecasts provided by the
Advisory Committee, the members of the Monetary Board noted that
the inflation outlook is likely to trend upward over the policy horizon.

� The outlook for 2004 inflation continued to track the 4-5 percent target
for the year with a possibility of a further increase above the 4-5
percent target in 2005.

� Supply-side factors dominate the sources of risks to the inflation
outlook, which could threaten the inflation target over the policy
horizon. These risks include the rising oil prices, increase in transport
fares and the planned adjustments in utilities charges. The expected
inflationary pressures are transitory in nature and do not appear to
represent a permanent shift in the long-run price path. These supplyside risk factors are outside the sphere of monetary policy and, thus, a
monetary policy response may not be warranted. However, careful
monitoring should be sustained of the possible second round effects
of these supply pressures on the demand side.

� Meanwhile, the possible adjustments in wages could also exert
demand-side pressures on future inflation. However, the overall
likelihood of significant demand-driven pressure on consumer prices
developing in the near term remained low given continued evidence of
double-digit unemployment, spare manufacturing capacity and modest
bank loan growth.

� The Advisory Committee presented estimates of the impact of the
various cost-side risks to the average annual inflation in 2004 and
2005.

� The Monetary Board argued that there is need to exercise cautious
gradualism in considering any possible adjustments in policy rates in
the future. This is in line with the need to sustain price stability with the
flexibility of accommodating economic growth.

� The Monetary Board recognized that, in the short run, inflation risks
could still emanate from volatile movements in the nominal exchange
rate. They noted that the risk of exchange market volatility is linked
mainly to negative market sentiment concerning the medium-term
prospects for fiscal consolidation as well as the expected narrowing of
foreign interest differentials as a result of cyclical monetary tightening
in the major economies, particularly the US.

� Overall, the members of the Monetary Board were of the view that the
current policy settings remain appropriate for the macroeconomic
environment given the outlook for inflation. However, the Monetary
Board underscored the need to monitor closely the emerging risks to
the inflation outlook over the policy horizon.

**III.  Monetary Policy Decision**

� After an assessment of the balance of risks to inflation and the
evidence that have been made available since the last meeting on
monetary policy on 6 May 2004 as presented by the Advisory
Committee, the Monetary Board approved unanimously the following
policy measures:

a. Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 6.75
percent for the overnight RRP rate and 9.0 percent for the
overnight RP rate;

b. Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

c. Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting was scheduled on 1 July 2004.
