**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 29 JULY 2004***


The Advisory Committee1 submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board: (1) maintain the BSP’s policy
rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent for the overnight reverse
repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight repurchase (RP)
rate; (2) maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
Special Deposit Accounts (SDAs); and (3) maintain the current reserve
requirement ratios.

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The above recommendations were based on the following
considerations:

� Headline inflation in June rose to 5.1 percent (1994=100) year-on-year
from 4.5 percent in the previous month. The acceleration in June
inflation was driven mainly by price pressures on fish and meat, as well
as fuel, rentals, and services, including educational services. The
average inflation for the first half of the year at 4.1 percent remained
within the Government’s announced target of 4.0-5.0 percent for 2004.

� Based on the new CPI series released by the National Statistics Office
(NSO) using 2000 as the reference or base year, inflation increased to
5.4 percent in June from 4.7 percent in the previous month, bringing the
average inflation for the first semester to 4.3 percent.

� Likewise, core inflation (defined as headline inflation excluding selected
food and energy products) edged up to 5.4 percent in June from 4.7
percent in the previous month (1994=100). Similarly, the 2000-based
core inflation rose to 5.5 percent in June from the revised estimate of 4.9
percent in May.

- The highlights of the discussions of the 29 July 2004 Monetary Board meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its meeting held on 2 September 2004.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely: the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy
Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor, In-Charge of Research and
the Director of the Treasury Department. The 29 July 2004 meeting of the Monetary Board—the 8th
monetary policy meeting for 2004—followed the Advisory Committee meeting held on 26 July 2004.

� Forecasts generated by the BSP inflation forecasting models indicated
that the baseline average headline inflation is likely to settle at the upper
end of the 4-5 percent target for 2004 with the possibility of temporarily
exceeding the target in 2005, as the full impact of the supply-side risks
are felt. However, in the absence of any adverse supply-side shocks,
inflation is expected to decelerate to about 4-5 percent in 2006.

� Selected indicators of demand showed improvements in economic
activities but remained generally mixed.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing remained stable at 78.8
percent in April 2004 as in March, slightly higher than the 77.0
percent registered for the same month a year ago.

� The value of production index (VAPI) for manufacturing rose by 4.9
percent (revised) in April 2004, reversing the 5.0 percent contraction
in the previous month. However, the volume of production index
(VOPI) for manufacturing dipped by 1.5 percent (revised) year-onyear in April 2004 following a 10.3 percent contraction in March.

� Exports growth accelerated to 15.3 percent in May from 8.9 percent
in April 2004. This brought the January-May 2004 exports annual
growth to 8.6 percent.

� Total merchandise imports declined by 1.6 percent year-on-year in
May 2004 following an 8.3 percent growth in April. This brought the
year-to-date imports annual growth to 5.1 percent.

� Passenger car sales continued to post double-digit year-on-year
growth rates for nine straight months at 44.2 percent based on the
June 2004 report of the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the
Philippines (CAMPI).

� Energy sales by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) sustained its
increase for the fourth consecutive month at 3.8 percent year-on-year
in May. This was, however, slower than the 5.2 percent annual
increase in energy sales in April but was higher than the 2.7 percent
growth in May 2003.

� Based on the April 2004 Labor Force Survey conducted by the NSO,
unemployment rate rose to 13.7 percent, representing an increase in
the number of unemployed persons to 4.99 million in April 2004 from
4.22 million persons in April 2003.

� Supply-side factors continued to represent the major source of risks
to the inflation outlook over the policy horizon, particularly the risks
associated with volatile movements in energy prices and the
corresponding adjustments in local pump prices of oil, transport fares and
utility charges. There were also some observed increases in the prices of
selected food commodities, but these are expected to taper off given
forecasts of favorable agricultural production.

� Continued implementation of Government agriculture programs along
with forecasts of normal weather conditions suggest favorable
prospects for agriculture in 2004. The observed supply shocks have
been limited to a few commodities, particularly, corn, meat and fish
products. Such pressures should be addressed by appropriate
government policies other than monetary policy. Overall food supply
conditions remain supportive of price stability.

� The international price of Dubai crude oil increased further in July,
driven by strong demand for oil by rapidly growing economies and
concerns over the possibility of supply disruptions due to prolonged
tensions in the Middle East. In the domestic market, pump prices of
gasoline and other fuel products remained at their June 2004 levels
with the exception of LPG, which was reduced slightly on account of
the drop in the international contract price of LPG. However, the
recent uptrend in world oil prices could translate to potential further
adjustments in local pump prices in the near term.

� In the utilities sector, the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) began
implementing the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC)-approved
13.27-centavo per kwh increase in generation charge beginning with
its July 2004 billing. Likewise, the National Power Corporation (NPC)
started implementing the new ERC-approved rates beginning with its
26 May to 25 June 2004 billing cycle.

� In the financial sector, growth in money and credit demand continued to
be modest. Meanwhile, nominal RP interest rates declined in July
relative to the previous month.

� Domestic liquidity (M3) expanded by 6.1 percent year-on-year in May,
slightly lower than the 6.5 percent posted in the previous month.

� Growth in the loans outstanding of commercial banks (KBs) improved
to 1.7 percent year-on-year to reach P1.5 trillion as of end-May 2004,
following the 0.9 percent annual growth registered as of end-April.

� The bellwether 91-day T-bill rate declined during the 19 July auction
of the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) relative to that registered in June

due to ample liquidity in the system arising from the proceeds of
maturing T-bills.

� The peso recovered slightly against the dollar in July, supported mainly
by inflows from export earnings and OFW remittances.

� In the fiscal sector, cumulative NG budget deficit as of June 2004
reached P80.1 billion, slightly above the P79.6 billion target for the first
semester. This was lower than the market’s consensus forecast of P85
billion deficit due to prudent fiscal spending and improved tax collections
in June.

� Prospects for growth in the world’s major economies have strengthened
in recent months, although the pace and scope of growth in US have
slightly moderated. The sustained growth of the UK economy has been
driven forward by the expansion in household spending and business
investments. Similarly, steady improvements in exports and industrial
production in Japan as well as the gradual pick up of consumer demand
in the euro area provided encouraging signs for further recovery in these
economies.

� The US economy has moderated slightly compared to last year
based on data on real GDP, manufacturing activity and retail sales.
Nevertheless, US consumer confidence remained strong as many
consumers expect economic growth to continue at a healthy pace.

� The recovery in the euro area has remained strong due to robust
export performance and gradual improvements in private
consumption.

� The UK economy continued to exhibit resilient growth, buoyed by
strong household consumption and government expenditures
alongside the pick up in business investments.

� Japan’s economic recovery gained further momentum, driven by
robust export performance as well as sustained improvements in
industrial production and corporate profits.

� The US Federal Reserve raised its policy rate by 25 basis points
following its 29-30 June 2004 meeting. Meanwhile, monetary authorities
in Japan, euro area, and UK remained cautious and kept their monetary
policy settings unchanged.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� Based on the latest information and inflation forecasts provided by the
Advisory Committee, the members of the Monetary Board noted that
inflation is likely to trend upward over the policy horizon. Inflation is
expected to lie close to the upper end of the 4-5 percent target for 2004
and could possibly rise above the target in 2005. However, it is expected
to slow down to around 4-5 percent in 2006.

� The Monetary Board pointed out that prevailing conditions for output and
inflation continued to argue for maintaining present monetary settings.
The BSP’s forecasts extending to 2006 showed a hump-shaped inflation
path, reinforcing the argument that the inflation uptrend does not
represent a permanent shift in the inflation path that would otherwise
require monetary tightening. Moreover, the Monetary Board added that
the overall conditions for aggregate demand, credit activity and
investments continued to argue against monetary tightening.

� The members of the Monetary Board also recognized the need for the
BSP to issue an Open Letter to the President should actual inflation in
2005 exceed the target. This is part of the operational procedures under
the inflation targeting framework, and in line with the transparency
practices of inflation targeting countries. The said Open Letter would
explain in detail the reasons behind the deviation from the target and
what course of action was taken by authorities in response to the breach.

� The Open Letter will also discuss the deviation in the context of the
predefined set of circumstances of acceptable reasons for non-fulfillment
of inflation target. These factors include the following: (a) movements in
prices of agricultural products; (b) natural calamities; (c) movements in
international oil prices; and (d) changes in government administrative
measures.

� The members of Monetary Board likewise agreed that issuing a public
explanation is preferable to revising the inflation target, as the former
option upholds the credibility of the BSP, and is in line with international
best practice in monetary policy.

� Given the expected rise in inflation, the Monetary Board pointed out that
the BSP should continue to identify clearly the sources of pressures, both
on current and future inflation in its press statements or press releases as
well as in its public information campaign. This will help make clear to
the public the limited role of monetary policy in helping contain inflation
when it is driven mainly by supply-side factors. At the same time, the
Monetary Board argued that the BSP shall continue to ensure that the
level of liquidity in the system and the monetary policy settings are

appropriate and mindful of the need to exercise caution given the
emerging price pressures.

� The Monetary Board also emphasized the importance non-monetary
measures in addressing the inflation build up due to supply shocks.
These include government policies and programs to ensure the timely
importation of specific agricultural commodities such as corn and
feedstuffs as well as continued monitoring of prices of basic commodities.
Such measures can be carried out by concerned government agencies
such as the Department of Agriculture and Department of Trade and
Industry.

� Moreover, the members of Monetary Board likewise underscored the
need for continued public information campaigns in order to explain
carefully the ongoing inflationary process and the BSP’s responsibility in
line with the inflation targeting framework. The Monetary Board pointed
out the need to clearly explain to the public in simple and layman’s terms
both the demand and supply dynamics of the inflation process.

� The members of the Monetary Board stressed the need to continue
monitoring the evolving economic and financial developments and to
assess their impact on the long-run price path, with particular focus on
possible second-round effects of supply-side or cost-push factors on
inflation, which may require action on the part of monetary policies in
order to contain the build up in price pressures.

� At the same time, members of the Monetary Board pointed out the need
to strengthen the banking system. The Monetary Board argued that
despite adequate liquidity in the system, banks continued to be
constrained to lend actively in an effort to preserve asset quality or to
avoid a further deterioration in capital base.  There is a need, therefore,
to address the still high levels of banks’ non-performing loans (NPLs)
which constrains banks’ lending ability. Efforts to strengthen further the
balance sheets of the banking system would improve their capability to
provide more funds to the business and industry sector.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

� Upon assessment of the balance of risks to inflation and the evidence
that has become available since its previous meeting on monetary policy,
the Monetary Board approved unanimously the following policy
measures:

a. Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent
for the overnight RRP rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight RP rate;

b. Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

c. Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting was scheduled on 26 August 2004.
