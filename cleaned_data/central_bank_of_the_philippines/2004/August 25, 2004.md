**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 26 AUGUST 2004***


The Advisory Committee1 submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent
for the overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for
the overnight repurchase (RP) rate;

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
Special Deposit Accounts (SDAs); and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

2) Enhance the communication of the monetary policy stance through the
following measures:

(a) Continue to discuss and explain to the public the expected breach of
the inflation target in 2005 through press releases and other means,
with specific emphasis on the driving role of supply-side factors in the
inflation forecast and the notion that such factors cannot be
appropriately addressed by monetary action.

(b) In the event that the target is not met, issue an Open Letter to the
President clearly outlining the role of supply-related factors in the
deviation from the inflation target and making reference to the BSP’s
“explanation clause” under the inflation targeting framework.

3) Continue to articulate the BSP’s support for the use of non-monetary
government measures to address supply-side risks, particularly those
relating to food supply, by strengthening representation and coordination
with various government agencies.

- The highlights of the discussions of the 26 August 2004 Monetary Board meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its meeting held on 30 September 2004.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four mem bers,

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The above recommendations were based on the following
considerations:

� Headline inflation (1994=100) rose to 6.0 percent year-on-year in July
from 5.1 percent in the previous month. The acceleration in July inflation
was driven mainly by price pressures on food and energy-related CPI
components, as well as items classified under services, including
transportation and communications. The average inflation for the period
January to July 2004 was 4.3 percent, still within the Government’s
announced target of 4-5 percent for 2004.

� The 2000-based headline inflation also edged higher in July. It increased
to 6.6 percent from 5.4 percent in June to bring the average inflation for
the first seven months of the year to 4.6 percent.

� Likewise, both the 1994 and 2000 based core inflation (defined as
headline inflation excluding selected food and energy products) tracked a
similar uptrend in July. The 1994-based headline inflation inched up to
6.0 percent in July from 5.4 percent the previous month while the 2000based core inflation rose to 6.2 percent in July from the revised estimate
of 5.3 percent in June.

� Forecasts generated by the BSP inflation forecasting models indicated
that inflation could possibly exceed the upper end of the 4-5 percent
inflation target for 2004 and 2005 as the full impact of the supply-side
risks is felt. However, in the absence of any further adverse supply-side
shocks, average inflation is expected to revert to the 4-5 percent target in
2006.

� Selected indicators of demand showed improvements in economic
activities with a mild reduction in excess capacity in manufacturing.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing rose to 79.4 percent in
May 2004 from 78.8 percent in April, also higher than the 78.5
percent registered for the same month a year ago.

� The value of production index (VAPI) for manufacturing rose by 3.1
percent in May 2004 following a 4.9 percent annual growth in the
previous month. However, the volume of production index (VOPI) for
manufacturing continued to dip by 1.6 percent year-on-year in May
2004 following a 1.5 percent contraction in April.

� Exports growth moderated to 8.2 percent in June 2004 from 15.3
percent in May. This brought the first semester annual export growth
to 8.5 percent.

� Total merchandise imports increased by 18 percent year-on-year in
June 2004, a reversal from the 1.7 percent contraction in the previous
month for a cumulative imports annual growth for the period January
to June period of 7.2 percent.

� Passenger car sales posted an 8.2 percent year-on-year growth in
July, slower than the double-digit growth of 44.3 percent in the
previous month, based on the report of the Chamber of Automotive
Manufacturers of the Philippines (CAMPI). Meanwhile, the combined
truck and bus sales continued to decline by 55.7 percent year-onyear in July following a 25.7 percent dip in the previous month.

� Energy sales by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) sustained its
increase for the fifth consecutive month at 6.8 percent year-on-year in
July 2004. This was higher than the 3.8 percent annual increase in
energy sales in May and the 0.5 percent rise in June 2003.

� Based on the April 2004 Labor Force Survey conducted by the NSO,
the unemployment rate rose to 13.7 percent from 12.2 percent a year
earlier. In a related development, wage adjustments in the form of
increase in cost of living allowance (COLA) have been granted to
nine regions including Metro Manila as of 16 August 2004.

� Supply-side factors continue to represent the major source of risks to the
inflation outlook, particularly the risks associated with volatile movements
in world oil prices and the corresponding adjustments in domestic pump
prices of oil, transport fares, and utility charges. In addition, some
domestic supply constraints led to the uptick in selected food prices.
Nonetheless, the favorable outlook for agricultural production, along with
the timely implementation of Government policies should help stabilize
food prices and provide some cushion against inflationary pressures.

� The agriculture sector posted strong growth in the first semester of
2004 boosted by the expansion in crops and fisheries production.
However, the recurrence of the avian flu outbreak in other Asian
countries could raise demand for country’s poultry products and exert
pressures on prices of local poultry products. Nevertheless,
continued Government programs as well as forecasts of normal
weather conditions remain supportive of the favorable prospects for
agriculture in 2004. This should help ensure the broad stability of
agricultural products, moving forward.

� The international price of Dubai crude oil rose in August, driven by
both legitimate demand and supply concerns as well as short-term
uncertainties relating to production capacity given the developments
in major oil producing countries.

� Analysis of available data from the late 1980s to the present showed
that, in real terms, both the current world and local prices were still
below their peak levels in 1991. Moreover, past data also showed
that previous experiences with oil price hikes did not necessarily lead
to a contraction in output. The available data also revealed that
domestic oil price inflation influence overall inflation with a lag but
more recent evidence also showed that this correlation has
somewhat weakened.

� In the financial sector, the demand for money and credit remained
modest. Meanwhile, nominal RP interest rates declined during the 16
August 2004 auction relative to the previous month, but rose relative to
the previous auction.

� Domestic liquidity (M3) expanded by 5.7 percent year-on-year in
June, slightly lower than the 6.1 percent posted in the previous
month.

� Growth in loans outstanding of commercial banks (KBs) improved to
3.8 percent year-on-year to reach P1.5 trillion as of end-June 2004,
following the 1.7 percent annual growth registered as of end-May.

� Yields for the 91-day T-bill rate declined during the 16 August 2004
auction of the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) relative to those
registered during the 16 July auction. Compared to the previous
auction on 2 August 2004, however, T-bill yields were higher,
reflecting market’s expectation that the uptrend in global oil prices
could push inflation higher.

� The peso strengthened further in August owing to the continued
appreciation of other regional currencies against the US dollar, as well as
the sustained inflows of OFW remittances.

� In the fiscal sector, preliminary data showed that the cumulative NG
budget deficit as of July 2004 reached P99.4 billion, about P844 million
higher than the P98.6 billion target for the first seven months of 2004.

� Recent developments in the world economy indicated continued
broadening of the recovery process in the world’s major economies. On
the price front, while stronger inflationary pressures persist over the short
term, the outlook remains in line with price stability over the medium
term.

� The growth of the US economy moderated in the second quarter of
2004 due to higher oil prices, tepid employment growth and weak
consumer spending. However, analysts expect the US economy to
resume a stronger pace of expansion going forward.

� Recovery in the euro area has remained strong due to robust export
performance and gradual improvements in business investments.

� The UK economy continued to exhibit resilient growth, supported by
gains in the production industries and the continued rise in retail
spending.

� Japan’s economic recovery eased owing to the modest pick up of
private consumption and business investment in the second quarter.

� The US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of England (BOE) raised
their respective policy rates by 25 basis points following their 10 August
2004 and 5 August 2004 policy meetings, respectively. Meanwhile, the
Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the European Central Bank (ECB) remained
cautious and kept their monetary policy settings unchanged during their
latest policy meetings held on 9-10 August 2004 and 5 August 2004,
respectively.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� During the Monetary Board’s deliberation on the appropriate stance of
monetary policy, the members of the Monetary Board noted that inflation
is likely to marginally exceed the upper end of the 4-5 percent target and
could continue to rise above the target in 2005. However, the overall path
remains hump-shaped as average inflation is also expected to taper off to
around 4-5 percent in 2006, in the absence of continued adverse supplyside shocks. The Monetary Board’s assessment of the inflation outlook
was based on the latest information and inflation forecasts provided by
the Advisory Committee.

� The members of the Monetary Board were of the view that the prevailing
conditions for inflation as well as output growth continued to argue for
maintaining present monetary settings. The outlook for inflation continued
to be driven largely by supply-side pressures, mainly the rise in oil prices.
They believed that said price pressures are transitory in nature with no
permanent long-run impact on the overall inflation path. The transient
nature of the supply shocks as well as the overall conditions for
aggregate demand and credit activity argue against monetary tightening
at this time.

� The members of the Monetary Board also recognized the need for the
BSP to continue to discuss and explain to the public the reasons behind
the possible breach of the inflation target in order to promote
transparency and enhance the credibility of monetary policy. They noted
that communications with the public concerning the monetary stance
should highlight the role of supply-side factors.

� Moreover, the members of the Monetary Board noted the need for the
BSP to issue an Open Letter to the public addressed to the President, in
case the inflation target is breached. This forms part of the operational
procedures under the BSP’s inflation targeting framework and is
consistent with the transparency practices of inflation targeting countries.
The members of the Monetary Board agreed that the Open Letter would
include reference to “explanatory notes” in order to make clear to the
public that the deviations in the inflation target are due to supply-side
factors, which are beyond the sphere of influence of monetary policy.
The letter should also explain in clear terms why the target was
exceeded, and the policy actions, if any, taken by the monetary
authorities.

� The Monetary Board noted that the Open Letter should explain carefully
to the public the specific factors that caused the deviation of actual
inflation from the target. The members of the Monetary Board agreed to
refer to this predefined set of circumstances under which actual inflation
may deviate from target inflation as the BSP’s explanatory note. These
factors include price pressures arising from: (a) volatility in the prices of
agricultural products;  (b) natural calamities or event that affect a major
part of the economy; (c) volatility in the prices of oil products; and (d)
changes in government administrative or policy measures that directly
affect prices.

� The Monetary Board also emphasized the importance of non-monetary
measures in addressing the inflation buildup due to supply shocks.
Among other things, they identified the timely importation of specific
agricultural commodities such as corn and feedstuffs as well as
continued monitoring of prices of basic commodities as measures that
could help ensure adequate supply and ease supply related price
pressures.

� In addition, the members of the Monetary Board stressed further the
need to continue monitoring the evolving economic and financial
developments and to assess their impact on the long-run price path. The
Monetary Board also pointed out the need to monitor and measure
possible second-round effects of supply shocks on inflation which could
lead to inflation persistence, which may require measured action on the
part of monetary authorities, in order to arrest a further build up in
inflationary pressures and prevent inflation persistence.

� In conclusion, the members of the Monetary Board were all in agreement
that current monetary policy settings remain appropriate. They believed
that monetary tightening may be unwarranted at present given that the
supply-side pressures driving the current uptrend in inflation remain
dominant but are expected to be transitory. The members of the
Monetary Board agreed to draft a letter addressed to the President to
inform Her Excellency of the dynamics behind the upward trend in
headline inflation and to reassure the President and the general public of
the BSP’s firm commitment to delivering stable prices.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

� Upon assessment of the balance of risks to inflation and the evidence
that has become available since its previous meeting on monetary policy,
the Monetary Board approved unanimously the following measures:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current uniform rates of
6.75 percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.0
percent for the overnight RP (lending) rate;

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

2) Enhance transparency of the monetary policy stance through the
following measures:

(a) Continue to discuss and explain to the public the dynamics of the
inflation process and the expected breach of the inflation target
through press releases, press briefings and other means, with
specific emphasis on the driving role of other supply-side factors
in the inflation forecast and the notion that such factors cannot be
appropriately addressed through monetary action.

(b) The BSP Officer-in-Charge to write a letter to the President of the
Philippines informing her of inflation developments, the reasons
behind the inflation uptrend and measures undertaken by the BSP
and other Government agencies to mitigate the impact on
consumer prices.

food supply, by strengthening representation and coordination with
various government agencies.

policy setting is scheduled on 23 September 2004.
