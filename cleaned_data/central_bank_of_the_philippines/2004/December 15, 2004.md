## HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON
 MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 16 DECEMBER 2004*


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current uniform rates of 6.75
percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.0 percent for
the overnight RP (lending) rate;

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
Special Deposit Accounts (SDAs); and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

2) Continue to articulate support for the use of non-monetary measures to
address supply-side risks, particularly those relating to food supply, by
strengthening the BSP’s representation and coordination with various
government agencies.

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The above recommendations were based on the following
considerations:

� Supply factors continue to drive the headline inflation rate. Inflation in
November was recorded at 5.3 percent (1994=100) and 5.7 percent
(2000=100).

� Core inflation (defined as headline inflation excluding selected food and
energy products) also edged higher in November, reaching 7.3 percent
using the 1994-base CPI and 7.6 percent using the 2000-base CPI.

- The highlights of the discussions of the 16 December 2004 Monetary Board meeting were approved by
the Monetary Board during its meeting held on 20 January 2005.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely: the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy
Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor, In-Charge of Research and
the Director of the Treasury Department.

� Forecasts generated by BSP inflation forecasting models continue to
indicate that inflation will exceed the 4.0-5.0 percent inflation target in
2004 and 2005 but should ease back to the target by 2006.

� Although data on consumption and manufacturing activity continued to
suggest expansion in demand, other indicators pointed to soft spots in
the economy.

� Real GDP grew at a robust pace of 6.3 percent in the third quarter,
while real GNP expanded by 6.1 percent from a year-ago level.
Growth was boosted by the continued growth in personal
consumption along with the strong rebound in both investments and
exports.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing rose slightly to 80.0
percent in September 2004 from 79.2 percent in August and 78.7
percent in the same month a year ago.

� The value of production index (VAPI) for manufacturing increased
significantly by 13.9 percent in September following a revised annual
growth of 3.2 percent in the previous month. Likewise, the volume of
production index (VOPI) for manufacturing accelerated by 7.2 percent
year-on-year in September, a reversal of the 3.6 percent (revised)
contraction in August.

� Exports grew at an annual pace of 12.3 percent in October from 8.4
percent in the previous month. This brought the January-October
2004 annual exports growth to 8.9 percent.

� Year-on-year growth in merchandise imports edged up to 14.8
percent in September from 8.9 percent in August. For the January to
September 2004 period, the cumulative annual growth of imports
stood at 8.0 percent.

� Growth in passenger car sales was flat in October as reported by the
Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines, Inc.
(CAMPI). This came after a 76.6 percent sales increase in the
previous month. This also represented a deceleration from the 81.9
percent increase in October 2003. Meanwhile, the combined truck
and bus sales posted an 8.7 percent year-on-year growth in October,
a reversal from the 7.8 percent dip in September.

� Energy sales by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) increased by
8.0 percent year-on-year in October, higher than the 5.7 percent
growth in September, and the 0.3 rise in October of last year.

� Unemployment rate remained relatively high at 11.7 percent in July
2004. Nevertheless, the July 2004 unemployment rate represented
an improvement from the 12.6 percent registered for the comparable
period in the previous year. This is still considerably higher than 7.4
percent, the lowest unemployment rate recorded during the peak
growth years 1993-1996.

� Demand for money and credit also continued to post modest growth
while nominal RP interest rates eased during the 6 December 2004
auction of the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) relative to the previous
auction, leading to narrower spreads over foreign interest rates.

� Domestic liquidity (M3) grew by 6.2 percent (revised) year-on-year in
October, up from the 5.3 percent rise recorded in the previous month
but significantly below the double-digit levels posted in the growth
years during the pre-Asian crisis period of 1993-1996.

� Commercial bank lending grew by 1.9 percent year-on-year as of
end-September 2004, a marked slowdown from the 5.5 percent
increase in the previous month, and lower than the double-digit
growth rates registered during the pre-Asian crisis period of 19931996.

� Reference yields for the 91-day fell during the 6 December 2004
auction of the Bureau of the Treasury relative to the previous auction
rate. Healthy liquidity in the market helped soften the yields for the
91-day and 182-day T-bills.

� Supply-side factors continue to dominate the risks to the inflation outlook,
chief among them is the continued rise in world oil prices, which will
affect the cost of producing other goods and services. On the other hand,
the prospect of favorable agricultural output for the rest of the year is
expected to provide a cushion for food prices.

� Agricultural output grew by 6.8 percent in the first nine months of
2004, supporting expectations of a favorable performance for the
remainder of the year. However, the onset of a weak El Niño episode
poses upside risks to food prices, and highlights the importance of
timely intervention measures to limit adverse impact of the said
weather disturbance.

� Reports of increased US oil stocks and buoyant world oil production
helped moderate world oil prices in December 2004. In the domestic
market, pump prices of petroleum products increased by a range of
P0.30–P1.00 during the first two weeks of November, reflecting the
general uptrend in world oil prices.

� The peso strengthened slightly against the US dollar owing mainly to
remittances from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) for holiday-related
spending.

� In the fiscal sector, the January-October 2004 NG budget deficit of
P147.7 billion, was 10 percent lower than the figure recorded in the same
period a year ago.

� Global economic growth showed some signs of moderation as industrial
production and private consumption appeared to have slowed down in
most economies alongside tapering export growth. On the price front,
stronger inflationary pressures are expected to persist over the short term
due to world oil prices, but the medium-term outlook remains in line with
price stability.

� US economic activity continued to show strength in terms of
sustained improvements in consumer spending, business investment,
and employment conditions. However, the large current account
deficit could dampen prospects for sustained economic growth.

� Economic recovery in the Euro area moderated on weaker export
growth and subdued consumption spending alongside the observed
slowdown of the industries and services sector.

� The UK economy showed modest growth in the third quarter as
private consumption tapered off and the property market cooled
down, suggesting that growth for the short term had peaked and
further hikes in borrowing rates might be put off until next year.

� Japan’s economic recovery slowed down based on evidence of
moderating industrial output and lower export demand for electronics.

� The majority of central banks kept their policy settings unchanged at their
latest respective monetary policy meeting. However, some, like the US
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the Bank of Thailand
(BOT) raised policy rates by 25 basis points, citing mounting demandside pressures and tight labor conditions.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� The members of the Monetary Board noted that the medium-term outlook
for inflation remains essentially unchanged despite the recent higher
outturns. The overall pattern of price data remains consistent with the
assessment that (1) ongoing pressures on inflation remain tied to supplyside influences, and (2) the likely path of future inflation will be humpshaped, with the average inflation expected to exceed the 4-5 percent

target in 2004-2005 but should ease back towards the same range target
by 2006.

� The Monetary Board also noted some recent positive developments on
the price front, notably the direct policy actions undertaken by
Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI) on food prices and the easing conditions in world energy
markets which have led to a downward shift in the expected inflation
path.

� The Monetary Board also noted that that overall output conditions
continue to indicate slack in the domestic economy with a slight risk of a
slower pace of economic activity, particularly in view of indications of
reduced business optimism and possible output effects of higher oil
prices and recent weather disturbance.

� On the other hand, the members of the Monetary Board emphasized that
the risk of demand-side effects from ongoing supply shocks could
increase in the very near term, and therefore merits close attention. The
observed rise in various measures of core inflation could signal persistent
movements in prices, and consequent adverse changes in inflation
expectations. This underscores the need to avoid any spillover from
short-term price developments to inflation expectations over the policy
horizon.

� The members of the Monetary Board were, therefore, of the view that the
prevailing price and output conditions supports keeping present policy
settings unchanged but suggests a greater need for the continued
readiness among monetary authorities to undertake necessary policy
action ahead of time against inflation pressures to guide and prevent
unfavorable shifts in the public’s inflation expectations.

� At the same time, the Monetary Board believes that direct action against
supply-side risks should remain a key policy priority, and all possible
avenues for non-monetary intervention in key commodities should
continue to be explored and pursued.

� On the basis of the discussion, the members of the Monetary Board
agreed unanimously to maintain current monetary policy settings.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

� Upon assessment of the balance of risks to inflation and the evidence
that has become available since its previous meeting on monetary policy,
the Monetary Board approved unanimously the following measures:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current uniform rates of
6.75 percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.0
percent for the overnight RP (lending) rate;

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

3) Continue to articulate support for the use of non-monetary measures
to address supply-side risks, particularly those relating to food supply,
by strengthening the BSP’s representation and coordination with
various government agencies.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting is scheduled on 13 January 2005.
