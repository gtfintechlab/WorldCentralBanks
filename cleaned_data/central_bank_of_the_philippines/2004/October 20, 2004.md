## HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON
 MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 21 OCTOBER 2004*


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current uniform rates of 6.75
percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.0 percent for
the overnight RP (lending) rate;

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
Special Deposit Accounts (SDAs); and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

2) Continue to strengthen support for the use of non-monetary measures to
address supply-side risks, particularly those relating to food supply, by
strengthening the BSP’s representation and coordination with various
government agencies.

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The above recommendations were based on the following
considerations:

� Year-on-year headline inflation (1994=100) edged up to 6.9 percent
September from 6.3 percent in the previous month. As in the previous
months, the acceleration in September inflation was driven mainly by
price pressures on selected food and energy-related CPI components, as
well as items classified under services, particularly transport and
communications. The average inflation for the period January to
September 2004 was 4.8 percent, which was still within the 4-5 percent
target for the year.

- The highlights of the discussions of the 21 October 2004 Monetary Board meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its meeting held on 25 November 2004.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely: the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy
Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor, In-Charge of Research and
the Director of the Treasury Department.

� The 2000-based headline inflation rate likewise trended up in September
to 7.2 percent from 6.8 percent in August, for a year-to-date average
inflation 5.2 percent.

� Both the 1994– and 2000–based core inflation rate (defined as headline
inflation excluding selected food and energy products) rose to 6.6 percent
in September from 6.2 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively.

� Latest forecasts generated by the BSP inflation forecasting models
indicated that inflation could continue to rise over the next year or so, and
may exceed the 4-5 percent inflation target for 2004 and 2005. However,
average inflation is expected to revert to 4-5 percent in 2006 in the
absence of any further adverse supply-side shocks.

� Domestic demand indicators showed positive trends. However, some
soft spots in the domestic economy remained as other demand-side
indicators continued to post modest and uneven improvements.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing has remained at close
to 80 percent in recent months. Data for July showed average
capacity utilization at 79.7 percent, a slight deceleration from the 79.8
percent in June. This level was higher than the 78.7 percent
registered for the same month a year ago.

� The value of production index (VAPI) for manufacturing rose by 7.7
percent (revised) in July 2004 following a 9.7 percent (revised) annual
growth in the previous month. On the contrary, the volume of
production index (VOPI) for manufacturing dipped by 0.2 percent
(revised) in July 2004 following a 2.0 percent rise in June.

� Export growth increased by 13.7 percent year-on-year in August 2004
from 3.2 percent in July. This brought the January to August 2004
annual export growth to 8.5 percent.

� Total merchandise imports increased by 5.6 percent year-on-year in
July 2004, a marked slowdown from the 18.0 percent growth in the
previous month. For the January to July 2004 period, the cumulative
annual growth of imports was 6.9 percent.

� Passenger car sales posted an 80.1 percent year-on-year growth in
August, a considerable acceleration from the 8.2 percent posted in
the previous month. Meanwhile, the combined truck and bus sales
continued to decline by 11.3 percent year-on-year in August, lower
than the 55.7 percent decline reported in the previous month.

� Energy sales by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) increased by
3.0 percent year-on-year in August, slightly higher than the 2.9

percent growth in July 2004. However, this was lower than the 6.7
percent increase in August 2003.

� Unemployment rate remained high at 11.7 percent, although this was
lower than the 12.6 percent registered in the previous year. Despite
the improvement, this level remains considerably higher than 7.4
percent, the lowest unemployment rate recorded during the peak
growth years 1993-1996.

� Supply-side factors continued to dominate the risks to the inflation
outlook. These risk factors include primarily the rise in world oil prices,
which will impact on the cost of producing other goods and services.
Nonetheless, the favorable outlook for agricultural output for the rest of
the year is expected to provide some cushion for food prices.

� The agriculture sector showed robust performance in the first
semester of 2004. However, a warm episode—which may develop
into a weak El Niño—may affect domestic supply of agricultural
products and could pose upside pressures to food prices in the first
quarter of 2005.

� The international price of Dubai crude oil rose anew in October after
easing in the previous month. This was due to supply disruptions,
geopolitical concerns among major oil producers and the anticipated
rise in demand for heating fuel in the coming winter season in the
Northern Hemisphere. In the domestic oil market, retail prices of
kerosene, diesel and LPG also increased, reflecting the recent
uptrend in world oil prices.

� In the financial sector, the demand for money and credit continued to
post a modest growth. Meanwhile, nominal RP interest rates increased
during the 11 October 2004 auction of the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr)
from September 2004 levels.

� Domestic liquidity (M3) continued to grow by 6.1 percent year-on-year
in August 2004, a slight deceleration from the 6.7 percent rise posted
in the previous month. At 6.1 percent, however, the growth in M3
remained significantly below the double-digit levels posted in the
growth years during the pre-Asian crisis period of 1993-1996.

� Commercial bank lending expanded by 5.5 percent year-on-year to
P1.51 trillion as of end-August 2004. This was higher than the 3.6
percent growth registered in the previous month, but a sharp decline
relative to the double-digit growth rates registered during the preAsian crisis period of 1993-1996.

� Reference T-bill yields rose during the first regular auction of the BTr
in October relative to those recorded in September, reflecting market
concerns over the rising inflation, early passage of tax measures in
Congress and warnings of possible downgrade in the country’s credit
rating.

� The peso weakened against the US dollar in October due to continuing
market concerns over the uptrend in inflation, the sustainability of the
country’s fiscal position as well as the rising corporate demand for dollars
to fund the higher cost of oil and other key imports.

� In the fiscal sector, data showed that NG budget deficit for August 2004
of P11.7 billion was well below the deficit level of P18.2 billion posted in
August 2003. This brought the January to August 2004 deficit level to
P111.1 billion, slightly lower than the P114.5 billion deficit recorded in the
same period last year.

� Recent developments in the global economy continued to show signs of
firming up, underpinned by robust industrial production and rising
corporate profitability. These developments were accompanied by
gradual improvements in consumer demand and tightening of labor
market conditions in most regions. On the price front, the medium-term
outlook remains favorable although stronger inflationary pressures are
expected to persist over the short term.

� US economic activity remained on track as indicated by better
employment conditions, improved consumer spending, and the
uptrend in business investment.

� Recovery of real economic activity in the euro area continued with the
upturn in private consumption, rise in business investment, and
robust export performance.

� UK’s economic expansion continued, underpinned by strong
manufacturing output, buoyant private investment, and steady growth
in household spending.

� Japan’s economic recovery remained on course as evidenced by
robust export performance, increase in industrial production, and
uptrend in business fixed investment.

� The US Federal Reserve (Fed) raised its policy rates by 25 basis points
at its 21 September 2004 meeting. Other central banks which have
tightened their policy rates were Canada, Thailand, and New Zealand.
The main reasons cited by these central banks for raising policy rates
were rising inflationary pressures due to robust domestic demand, and
tight labor market conditions.

� Meanwhile, the Bank of England (BOE), Bank of Japan (BOJ), and the
European Central Bank (ECB) remained cautious and kept their
monetary policy settings unchanged during their policy meetings on 6-7
October 2004, 12-13 October 2004 and 7 October 2004, respectively.
Other central banks which have kept their monetary policy settings were
Australia and South Korea. These decisions were generally based on
output concerns, given the sluggish growth in private consumption and
investments, and softening labor market conditions.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� Recognizing the time lag required for monetary policy decisions to take
full effect (currently estimated at 15–21 months), the Monetary Board
noted that monetary actions undertaken at this point will primarily affect
inflation in 2006 and may only have a minimal impact in 2004-2005
inflation. The members of the Monetary Board, therefore, agreed that
prospective decisions should be oriented toward safeguarding the 2006
inflation target.

� The members of the Monetary Board also noted that the expected path of
headline inflation over the near term remains hump-shaped, with average
inflation expected to exceed the 4-5 percent target in 2004-2005 but will
revert toward the same range target by 2006. The members of the
Monetary Board believe that supply-side pressures driving the projected
uptrend in inflation cannot be addressed appropriately by monetary
policy, which restrains inflation pressures mainly by curbing demand for
goods and services.

� In particular, the members of the Monetary Board pointed out that three
main developments must be looked at before changing monetary policy
course, as follows:

1) Indications of demand pressures building up;
2) Evidence of second round effects from the ongoing supply shocks in
inflation; and
3) Risks of possible volatility in the foreign exchange market driven by
possible narrowing of interest rate differentials with potential impact
on inflation and inflation expectations.

� The Monetary Board noted that indications of sustained price pressures
from the seasonally-adjusted CPI data are outweighed by the presence
of relatively high unemployment and moderate credit activity in the
economy. Such conditions point to the conclusion that the current
inflation uptrend is originating mainly from the supply side rather than the
demand side.

� Furthermore, the members of the Monetary Board were of the view that
given the absence of clear evidence of demand-side effects of supply
shocks or mounting demand-side inflationary pressures, the balance tilts
in favor of maintaining the present neutral stance of monetary policy.
With the dominant role of supply-side developments in the inflation
outlook, the members of the Monetary Board believed that inflation can
be best mitigated by appropriate supply-side (which are non-monetary)
policy measures.

� Nonetheless, the Monetary Board recognized the risk of a sustained
period of rising oil prices, which could lead to a reduction in domestic
demand and self-sustaining inflation pressures reinforced by public
expectations of persistently high inflation. Monetary action will thus
become necessary when the available evidence begins to point more
strongly to inflation pressures that are over and above those generated
by ongoing supply shocks, or to emerging demand-side pressures on
prices.

� The members of the Monetary Board likewise recognized the risk of
exchange market pressures that may be caused by narrowing nominal
interest differentials, ample liquidity among banks, and negative market
sentiment that could feed into inflation and inflation expectations.

� At the same time, the members of the Monetary Board acknowledged the
need for the BSP to continue assessing economic and financial
developments for indications of potential threats to the inflation target
and, if necessary, undertake a well-timed policy adjustment.

� On the basis of the preceding discussion, the members of the Monetary
Board agreed unanimously to maintain current monetary policy settings.
However, the Monetary Board members emphasized that the monetary
authority is prepared to respond to the potential second-order inflationary
effects of ongoing supply shocks and other conditions that could
generate persistent price pressures.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

� Upon assessment of the balance of risks to inflation and the evidence
that has become available since its previous meeting on monetary policy,
the Monetary Board approved unanimously the following measures:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current uniform rates of
6.75 percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.0
percent for the overnight RP (lending) rate;

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

2) Continue to strengthen support for the use of non-monetary
measures to address supply-side risks, particularly those relating to
food supply, by strengthening the BSP’s representation and
coordination with various government agencies.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting is scheduled on 18 November 2004.
