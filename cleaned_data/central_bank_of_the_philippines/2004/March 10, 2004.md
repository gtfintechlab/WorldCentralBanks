**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD**

**ON MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 11 MARCH 2004***


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted for the consideration of the
Monetary Board the following recommendations: (1) maintain the BSP’s
policy rates at the current levels of 6.75 percent for the overnight reverse
repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight repurchase (RP)
rate; (2) maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
Special Deposit Account (SDAs); and (3) maintain the current reserve
requirement ratios.

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The above recommendations were based on the following
considerations:

� Headline inflation in February 2004 was steady at 3.4 percent year-onyear as in the previous month using the 1994-based series for the
consumer price index (CPI). The relative stability in overall consumer
prices was due mainly to steady food prices and lower inflation for some
services items in the CPI which cushioned the impact of higher prices of
fuel and oil-related products, clothing materials as well as the increased
costs for housing repairs. Based on the new CPI series released by the
National Statistics Office (NSO) using 2000 as the reference or base
year, inflation slowed down slightly to 4.0 percent in February 2004
from 4.1 percent in January.

� Meanwhile, the 1994-based core inflation showed a slight uptrend to 3.7
percent in February from January’s 3.6 percent. Likewise, core inflation

Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy Governor for Supervision
and Examination Sector, the Managing Director, In-Charge of Research and the Director of the Treasury
Department. The 11 March 2004 meeting of the Monetary Board—the 3rd monetary policy meeting for 2004—
followed the Advisory Committee meeting held on 8 March 2004.

derived from the 2000-based CPI series inched higher to 4.1 percent
from the previous month’s 4.0 percent.

� The overall outlook for inflation for 2004-2005 continued to point to a
moderate uptrend but should remain within the range of the
Government’s target of 4.0-5.0 percent. This outlook remained
consistent with expectations of improving aggregate demand conditions
as well as the impact of cost-side factors such as movements in fuel
prices.

� Domestic demand indicators continued to show modest improvements,
supported by a generally positive business outlook. However, unused
capacity in the manufacturing sector and the unemployment level
remained fairly high, posing downside risks to overall domestic demand.

� Based on the survey conducted by the BSP, the outlook of the
business sector remained optimistic in the first half of 2004. For the
first quarter of 2004, the overall business outlook index increased to
26.0 percent from 24.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003, due
mainly to the expected increase in consumption expenditures with
the forthcoming national elections. This was, however, dampened in
part, by persistent political uncertainty, stiff competition and the
weakening of the peso. For the second quarter of 2004, the overall
business outlook diffusion index rose to 25.2 percent compared to
20.1 percent recorded during the previous quarter as respondents
expected economic growth to continue.

� The value of production index (VAPI) for manufacturing rose by 3.6
percent (revised) in December 2003, a reversal of the 0.8 percent
(revised) contraction reported in the previous month. In contrast, the
volume of production index (VOPI) for manufacturing declined
further by 2.9 percent (revised) in December 2003 following an 8.4
percent (revised) drop in the previous month.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing in December 2003
improved slightly to 78.4 percent (revised) from the November level
of 78.2 percent (revised). This was also higher than the 74.5 percent
posted a year ago. About 13.4 percent of the responding
establishments operated at full capacity (90-100 percent), 51.2

percent reported operation at 70-89 percent capacity, and 35.4
percent operated below 70 percent capacity.

� Exports data from the National Statistics Office (NSO) showed a 4.1
percent increase in January 2004, higher than the 3.9 percent growth
posted a year ago but lower than the 9.0 percent growth in December
2003. Electronic exports—which accounted for 67.8 percent of the
aggregate export revenue in January—rose by 1.2 percent. This was
slower than the 7.0 percent annual growth registered in the previous
month and the 3.3 percent increase recorded a year ago.

� Growth in merchandise imports as reported by the NSO accelerated
to 14.9 percent (revised) in December 2003 from 4.3 percent in the
previous month. The December imports brought the full year growth
to 5.7 percent, slightly below the 7.2 percent recorded a year ago.

� Car sales increased by 31.4 percent year-on-year in January 2004 to
2,436 units. This was slower than 109.7 percent rise in December
2003.

� Registered energy sales by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco)
declined by 7.6 percent year-on-year in January 2004, the first
contraction since the 1.6 percent decline recorded in August 2002.

� On the supply-side, forecasts of neutral weather conditions along with
Government measures to enhance agricultural productivity support
expectations of continued stability in food prices. This should help
cushion against possible cost-side price pressures that could emanate
from fuel price adjustments.

� Based on the estimates of the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics
(BAS), rice production will be robust in the first half of 2004, with
an expected 10.8 percent year-on-year growth in the first quarter
followed by an 8.7 percent growth in the second quarter. Similarly,
strong corn output is expected to register a 12.5 percent growth in
the first quarter and an 8.3 percent growth in the second quarter.

� The international price of Dubai crude oil eased slightly to an
average of US$28.57 per barrel for the period 1-26 February 2004
relative to US$28.87 per barrel average price in January with the end

of the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere. However, the
futures price of crude oil continued to trend higher following the
announcement of an oil supply cut by OPEC in April. Domestic oil
prices were steady at their February levels, except for the P0.84
average decline in the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in the
first week of March. Meanwhile, transport fare has increased for the
deregulated transport sector while petitions for fare hike for the
regulated sector have been filed with the regulatory agency, the Land
Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).

� Moderate growth in liquidity and bank lending continued to characterize
domestic monetary conditions. Nominal interest rates showed an uptick
in February as persistent concerns over the political environment led to
high bids and thin appetite for government securities in the primary
market.

� Based on preliminary data, domestic liquidity (M3) growth in
January 2004 accelerated to 4.4 percent (revised) year-on-year from
3.3 percent in December 2003.

� The total volume of commercial bank (KB) loans grew by 3.8
percent year-on-year to P1.49 trillion as of end-December 2003,
recording 14 straight months of sustained expansion. However, the
December year-on-year growth in bank lending was slower than the
4.3 percent increase recorded in November 2003.

� All tenders were rejected during the 1 March 2004 Treasury bill
auction of the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) as banks displayed
generally weak appetite for government debt papers. Nominal
interest rates trended upward, reflecting higher risk premium
associated with concerns over political uncertainties ahead of the
May 2004 elections.

� The peso continued to weaken for the fourth consecutive month since
October 2003. It depreciated by about 54 centavos to average
P56.09/US$1 in February 2004 from its January 2004 average of
P55.55/US$1 due to persistent concerns over the fiscal deficit and preelection uncertainties.

� The deficit of the National Government (NG) for January 2004 stood at
P16.1 billion, 15.6 percent higher than the P13.9 billion deficit recorded
in January 2003, owing mainly to stronger growth in expenditures
relative to the revenue collection performance.

� Recent developments in the world economy continued to point to a
firmer recovery, with a solid pick-up in growth in the US and Japan
accompanied by less brisk improvements in the euro area. The main
downside risks facing the international economy over the past two
years—notably those pertaining to the geopolitical risks, corporate and
financial governance issues and the SARS outbreak in Asia—have
largely dissipated. Nevertheless, the global outlook has remained not
altogether risk-free as economic and structural imbalances in the major
economies may limit the pace and strength of the recovery process. This
outlook suggested a moderate improvement in external demand for the
Philippines.

� Prospects for the US economy continued to look firmer. The most
recent indicators suggested that the US economy has started the year
2004 strongly with good prospects for sustaining the expansion in
the period ahead. The one missing element in all this was a
convincing pick up in employment, although encouraging signs have
been observed recently.

� Growth in the euro area in 2003 was modest, although there were
signs of gradual improvement. The relatively slower pace in
recovery can be traced to structural factors, reflecting the economy's
underlying lack of flexibility. However, business confidence in
Europe has improved in recent months, which may be an indicator of
better prospects ahead.

� The UK economy has picked up strongly. Strong GDP growth was
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003, fueled by healthy retail sales
and record consumer borrowing, against a backdrop of steady CPI
and core inflation.

� The Japanese economy has gathered strength on the back of a rise in
domestic consumption, coupled with strong exports, especially to
China. Bank of Japan (BOJ) officials noted that the recovery

momentum has become stronger. Nevertheless, deflation remained a
problem, as core inflation continued to be negative.

� Amid increased evidence of stronger economic activity, monetary
authorities in the US, the UK, euro area and Japan kept their monetary
policy settings unchanged.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� Based on all the above considerations, the Monetary Board’s assessment
of future price movements pointed to a generally manageable inflation
over the policy horizon with some upside risks. They noted that the
current pace of economic activity could translate into a moderate
increase in average inflation to levels consistent with the Government’s
inflation targets. They were also of the view that the outlook for future
prices is accompanied by risks from the supply-side, beginning with the
impact of volatile movements in international oil prices, mounting calls
for transport fare adjustments, and possible adjustments in utility
charges.

� For the most part, however, the members of the Monetary Board pointed
out that the overriding risk to the inflation outlook could stem presently
from sentiment-driven movements in the exchange rate, which have
given rise to persistent concerns of a possible sustained episode of
currency depreciation which could have adverse implications on
inflation and inflation expectations.

� The members of the Monetary Board believed that the depreciation
pressures on the peso are likely to persist as long as excess money
balances remain in banks amid sluggish lending, and the public
continues to prefer holding foreign currencies due to uncertainty. They
were of the view that the incentive for financial institutions to seek
profits from currency trading is compounded by the present climate of
political uncertainty.

� Given the generally accepted difficulty of calibrating an optimal policy
response to potential inflationary risks arising from volatile exchange
rate movements, the members of the Monetary Board expressed the view
that the standard prescription for central banks is to adopt a conservative
approach. This approach would be in consonance with the observed

modest pace of money and credit demand, which points to downside
risks for the overall strength of economic activity. They highlighted the
need for monetary policy stance to ensure that the general
macroeconomic environment remains conducive to credit demand and
investment activity and financing conditions do not become unduly
restrictive to constrain economic activity. The members of the Monetary
Board considered this as the main argument against any monetary
tightening in response to perceived inflationary pressures.

**III.  Monetary Policy Decision**

� After an assessment of the balance of risks to inflation and the evidence
that have been made available since the last meeting on monetary policy
presented by the Advisory Committee, the Monetary Board approved
unanimously the following policy measures:

a. Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 6.75
percent for the overnight RRP rate and 9.0 percent for the
overnight RP rate;

b. Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

c. Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting was scheduled on 15 April 2004.
