**_HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON THE_**

**_MONETARY POLICY STANCE HELD ON 22 SEPTEMBER 2022 [1]_**


**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Raise the BSP’s current policy interest rate by 50 basis points to

4.25 percent for the overnight RRP rate; and

b) Increase the current interest rates on the overnight deposit facility

(ODF) to 3.75 percent and overnight lending facility (OLF) to
4.75 percent.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

  - The decision of the Monetary Board is based on the assessment of the

latest baseline inflation outlook which indicate a higher inflation path over
the policy horizon. Average inflation is projected to settle above the
government’s target band of 2-4 percent for 2022 and 2023. The higher
inflation forecast path reflects the continued depreciation of the peso and
the recently approved nationwide transport fare hikes. Nevertheless,
inflation is projected to decelerate back to the midpoint of the target range
in 2024 due to the impact of slower domestic and global growth outlook,
the lower assumptions for global crude oil and non-oil prices, as well as the
BSP’s policy rate hikes.

  - In deciding to raise the policy rate anew, the Monetary Board has noted

that price pressures continue to broaden. The rise in core inflation indicates
emerging demand-side pressures on inflation. Moreover, second-round
effects continue to manifest, with inflation expectations remaining
elevated in September following the approved minimum wage and
transport fare increases. Nonetheless, inflation expectations continue to be
broadly anchored to the BSP’s projected path over the medium term.

  - At the same time, the risks to the inflation outlook remain tilted to the

upside for 2022 and 2023 but are seen to remain broadly balanced for 2024.

  - Given elevated uncertainty and the predominance of upside risks to the

inflation environment, the Monetary Board has recognized the need for
follow-through action to anchor inflation expectations and prevent price
pressures from becoming further entrenched. The domestic economy can

accommodate a reasonable tightening of the monetary policy stance, as
demand has generally held firm owing to improved employment outturns
and ample liquidity and credit.

  - At the same time, the Monetary Board also continues to urge the National

Government to implement timely non-monetary interventions to mitigate
the impact of persistent supply-side pressures on food and other
commodity prices. The Monetary Board reiterates its commitment to take
all necessary actions to steer inflation towards a target-consistent path
over the medium term, consistent with the BSP’s primary mandate to
promote price and financial stability.

**III.** **Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook**

The Monetary Board considered the recent macroeconomic and financial

developments listed below in deciding the appropriate monetary policy
stance:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Headline inflation in August 2022 edged lower to 6.3 percent year-on-year

from 6.4 percent in the previous month owing to slower increases in the
prices of volatile food and energy items such as, meat, fish, and fuel. At the
same time, negative vegetable inflation due to base effects also
contributed to the moderation. Despite the slight deceleration due to
lower food and transport inflation, headline inflation has remained above
the government’s target range since April 2022.

  - Meanwhile, core inflation, which depicts underlying demand-side

pressures, has also breached the upper end of the target range at 4.6
percent year-on-year in August 2022 from 3.9 percent in July 2022, an
indication that second-round effects could translate into more persistent
inflation.

**B.  Inflation expectations**

  - Inflation expectations have also risen further over the policy horizon.
Private sector economists surveyed in September 2022 reported a higher
mean inflation forecast for 2022 at 5.5 percent from 5.4 percent in the
August 2022 survey.[2] Similarly, the mean inflation forecasts for 2023 and
2024 increased to 4.3 percent (from 4.2 percent) and 3.8 percent (from 3.7
percent), respectively.

  - Likewise, the results of the BSP’s Q3 2022 expectations survey on
businesses and consumers indicate that both sectors anticipate inflation

to breach the upper end of the government’s 2-4 percent target range for
2022 and 2023.

**C.  Inflation outlook**

  - The latest baseline forecasts indicate that inflation could settle above the

government’s target range of 3.0 percent ± 1.0 ppt at 5.6 percent for 2022
and at 4.1 percent for 2023. Inflation is projected to decelerate back to the
midpoint of the target range at 3.0 percent in 2024. The upward revision
in the forecasts for 2022 and 2023 is driven by the higher inflation nowcast
for September, the continued depreciation of the peso, and the recently
approved nationwide transport fare hikes. Meanwhile, the impact of slower
domestic and global growth outlook, lower assumptions for global crude
oil and non-oil prices, as well as the BSP’s 50-bps policy rate increase in
August have driven the downward adjustment in the 2024 inflation
forecast.

**MB Meeting** **MB Meeting**

2022 5.4 5.6

2023 4.0 4.1

2024 3.2 3.0

  - The risks to the inflation outlook remain tilted to the upside for 2022 and

2023 but are seen to remain broadly balanced for 2024. On the one hand,
the potential impact of higher global non-oil prices, pending petitions for
further transport fare hikes, increased prices of food items owing to
weather disturbances, and the sharp rise in sugar prices are the major
upside risks to the inflation outlook. On the other hand, the impact of a
weaker-than-expected global economic recovery is the primary downside
risk to the outlook.

**D. Demand conditions**

  - The Philippine economy is projected to remain on the recovery path over

the near term. GDP growth is projected to settle within the DBCC’s target
of 6.5-7.5 percent for 2022 and slightly below the 6.5-8.0 target for 2023 and
2024.[3] At the same time, the latest Philippine Business Cycle reading
remained in the positive territory for the fifth (5[th]) consecutive quarter and
is above the medium-term growth average of 3.6 percent (i.e., five-year
average) and long-term growth average of 5.5 percent (i.e., ten-year
average), indicating sustained growth momentum.

  - Mobility indicators continued to rise in early September as majority of the

provinces in the country retained their alert levels. Mobility indicators
across location categories have reverted to pre-pandemic levels beginning

implementation of full face-to-face classes by November 2022 is expected
to lower mobility in households and, consequently, increase mobility to
other location categories.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

- Nationwide average retail rice prices increased in August 2022 based on

the results of the 2018-based PSA Retail Price Survey (RPS) covering all
provinces and key cities in the country. While domestic production is
seasonally low during the lean months, recent reports attribute the
increase in rice prices more to the series of domestic fuel price hikes
affecting transportation and logistics costs, as well as farmgate prices,
prompting traders and retailers to adjust their selling prices.

- Domestic supply conditions continue to face challenges emanating from

animal diseases, as well as high production costs due to global supply
disruptions, and additional uncertainties brought about by the UkraineRussia crisis. To cushion the impact of these challenges on the country’s
food security, the Government has implemented crucial non-monetary
measures to fill supply gaps and boost local production, such as rice
imports to augment rice supply in the domestic market, extension of lower
tariff rates on pork imports, relaxation of quantitative import restrictions
for sugar processors over the near-term, among others. On a longer-term
basis, non-government measures for food security and sustainability
include restructuring the food value chain from research and development
up to retail, and promotion of urban aquaculture and agriculture as well as
unconventional production systems, among others.

- On weather conditions, based on the latest assessment as of 8 September

2022, prevailing La Niña conditions will likely persist through 2022, and
weaken by the January-February-March 2023 season. Nonetheless, La Niña
event is associated with above normal rainfall conditions, which could
improve availability of water supply in harvest areas and potentially
enhance agricultural production, particularly during dry season.

Oil Price Developments

- Global oil prices have been volatile recently though Dubai crude oil prices

have been generally declining in the first half of September 2022 as
concerns over weaker demand outlook offset worries over supply
tightness. On the one hand, concerns over supply disruption and OPEC+
decisions to reduce production continue to exert upward pressures on oil
prices. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia has decided to lower its official
selling prices for October for most of the world’s regions. Meanwhile, the
futures market remained in backwardation as of 16 September 2022.

- On domestic oil prices, the downward trend in global oil prices has

manifested in the recent rollbacks in domestic pump prices. However, fuel
cost remains elevated, prompting the approval of several transport fare
increase petitions (i.e., for jeepneys, buses, taxis). On 16 September 2022,
the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB)
decided to collectively raise transport fares across several public transport
vehicles.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

- Power generation charges from the Independent Power Producers (IPPs)

and Power Supply Agreements (PSAs) were adjusted upwards on the back
of higher fuel costs. According to MERALCO, the ongoing Malampaya gas
supply restriction necessitated the increased use of more expensive
alternative fuel to ensure continuous supply.

- In addition, the continued rise in international coal prices contributed to

higher cost from PSAs. Meanwhile, the rise in charges from the IPPs and
PSAs was partly offset by the decline in charges from Wholesale Electricity
Spot Market (WESM) due to improved supply situation in the Luzon grid.

**F. Financial market developments**

- The Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSEi) averaged 6,602.2 index points

for the period 1-20 September 2022, lower by 0.2 percent from its August
average of 6,615.6 index points. The benchmark index was weighed down
by investor concerns over the continued policy tightening of the US
Federal Reserve, the movements of the peso against the US dollar, and the
further weakening of global growth prospects.

- On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the peso depreciated against the US dollar

by 11.28 percent to close at ₱57.48/US$1 on 20 September 2022 from the
end-December 2021 closing rate of ₱51.00/US$1. The peso’s depreciation
reflected the market’s expectations of more aggressive policy rate hikes
from the US Federal Reserve amid strong US economic data and hawkish
comments from US Federal Reserve officials. In addition, concerns over the
global economic growth outlook and elevated global inflation continue to
drive safe-haven demand for the US dollar.

**G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions**

- Domestic liquidity and credit conditions remain adequate to support

broad-based economic recovery. Outstanding loans of universal and
commercial banks (U/KBs) for both production and consumption activities
increased in July 2022.

- Meanwhile, secondary market GS yields increased across all tenors on 27

September 2022, relative to 22-September 2022 yields, ranging from 0.280
basis point (bp) to 29.990 bps. The increase in yields, which already

suggested partial passthrough, reflected the ongoing adjustments in
short-term market interest rates following the 50-bps policy rate hike on
22 September 2022. The rise in yields could also be attributed to the
continued depreciation of the peso against the US dollar amid the hawkish
rhetoric of the US Fed.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

- The National Government (NG) recorded a deficit of P761.0 billion for

January - July 2022 which is 9.1 percent lower than the level recorded in the
same period in 2021. Excluding the interest payments in NG expenditures,
the primary deficit amounted to P451.7 billion, 20.7 percent lower than the
amount recorded in 2021. Meanwhile, revenues increased by 16.6 percent
to P1,746.4 billion in January – July 2022 from P1,490.4 billion in the same
period last year.

- Despite the constraints, timely social protection measures implemented

by the NG are expected to help alleviate the impact of rising crude oil prices
on the transportation and agriculture sectors, while sustained efforts to
ensure adequate domestic food supply could mitigate further supply-side
pressures on inflation. Fiscal support has been deployed through fuel
subsidies to the transport sector and vouchers to agriculture sector.

**I.  External developments**

- Global economic activity contracts as manufacturing and services output

in major economies such as the US, Japan, Germany, UK, and Italy declined
in August 2022. The weakening global growth reflects the deterioration in
investors’ sentiment, persistent high inflation, and rapid tightening of
global financial conditions. Nonetheless, the global economy's rate of
contraction was partially offset by the continued expansion in emerging
market economies, led by India, Brazil, and ASEAN countries.

- A number of central banks have raised their respective key policy rates in

September amid elevated inflation pressures and resurgent demand. The
depreciation of EM currencies against the US dollar has coincided with
inflationary pressures stemming from elevated global commodity prices.
Consequently, inflation in most emerging market economies has
broadened in recent months as weather-related disturbances, supply
chain issues, and war-related supply disruptions led to the emergence of
second-round effects.
