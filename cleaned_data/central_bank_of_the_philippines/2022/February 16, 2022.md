**_HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON THE_**

**_MONETARY POLICY STANCE HELD ON 17 FEBRUARY 2022 [1]_**

**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Keep the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate unchanged at 2.00

percent; and

b) Maintain the accommodative levels of overnight deposit and

overnight lending rates at 1.50 percent and 2.50 percent,
respectively.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

       - The decision of the Monetary Board is based on the assessment that

inflation could average within the 2-4 percent target range for 2022 and
2023. However, the inflation projections have slightly increased from the
previous monetary policy meeting, reflecting the impact of higher
domestic food inflation and global oil prices. Inflation expectations have
likewise risen marginally but continue to be anchored within the target
band.

       - The risks to the inflation outlook continue to lean slightly towards the

upside for 2022 but remain broadly balanced for 2023. Upside risks are
linked mainly to the continued shortage in domestic pork and fish supply
and the possible impact of higher oil prices on transport fares. The
implementation of non-monetary measures to ensure adequate supply of
key food commodities must be sustained in order to mitigate supply-side
pressures on inflation. At the same time, increased volatility in international
oil prices warrants close monitoring and appropriate interventions when
necessary in order to arrest potential second-round effects. Meanwhile,
downside risks still emanate from the lingering threat of COVID-19
infections owing to possible case resurgence from new variants, as delays
in the easing of containment protocols could temper domestic growth
prospects.

       - The Monetary Board also observed that the domestic economic recovery

has continued to gain traction on the back of the Government’s ongoing
vaccination program and the easing of mobility restrictions. However,
elevated global commodity prices, heightened geopolitical tensions, and

the uneven pace of vaccinations across countries could dampen the
outlook for global economic recovery.

  - On balance, the Monetary Board deems it prudent to maintain the BSP’s

accommodative policy stance given a manageable inflation environment
and emerging uncertainty surrounding domestic and global growth
prospects. Looking ahead, given the stronger signs of recovery in output
growth and labor market conditions and improvements in domestic
financial markets, the BSP will continue to carefully develop its plans for
the eventual normalization of its extraordinary liquidity measures when
conditions warrant, in keeping with our price and financial stability
mandates.

**III.** **Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook**

The Monetary Board considered the recent macroeconomic and financial

developments listed below in deciding the appropriate monetary policy
stance:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Using the 2018-based CPI series, headline inflation eased to 3.0 percent in

January 2022 from 3.2 percent in December 2021. Inflation slowed down in
January due to lower meat prices as pork supply stabilized owing partly to
targeted government and private sector measures. Similarly, non-food
inflation moderated, driven mostly by the slowdown in large-weighted CPI
items such as housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels, along with
restaurants and accommodation services. Electricity rates declined in
January due to lower generation costs while liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
prices also fell, offsetting the increase in domestic fuel prices.

**B.  Inflation expectations**

  - Inflation expectations remain anchored to the target range over the policy

horizon. The February 2022 survey results of inflation forecasts show that
private sector economists expect inflation to average at 3.5 percent for
2022 from 3.4 percent in the previous survey round.[2] Meanwhile, the mean
inflation forecasts for 2023 and 2024 were also within the government’s
target range of 2-4 percent at 3.1 percent (from 3.2 percent) and 2.9 percent
(from 3.3 percent), respectively.

**C.  Inflation outlook**

  - The latest baseline inflation forecasts are 3.7 percent for 2022 and

3.3 percent for 2023, using the newly released 2018-based CPI series. The
inflation forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are slightly higher relative to the
estimates from the previous forecast round. The higher inflation path in

2022 is mainly attributed to elevated domestic food and oil inflation.
Nonetheless, imported oil and food inflation is projected to ease in 2023 as
global supply chain disruptions are expected to dissipate. Inflation is seen
to decelerate in early 2022 due mainly to negative base effects from the
uptick in pork prices from the previous year. However, inflation is projected
to accelerate slightly above the target range in Q2 2022 driven by elevated
global oil and non-oil prices and positive base effects. Nonetheless,
inflation is projected to decelerate back to within the target in Q3 2022 and
in Q4 2022 as imported oil and food inflation is seen to ease amid
expectations of higher production and improvements in global supply
chain.

2023 3.2 3.3

  - The risks to the inflation outlook are now seen to be weighted slightly

toward the upside for 2022, but broadly balanced for 2023. The potential
impact of higher global food prices, the continued shortage in domestic
pork and fish supply, and possible jeepney fare hikes due to higher oil
prices are the major upside risks over the near term. Meanwhile, the
possible impact on domestic economic growth prospects of delays in the
easing of containment measures as well as a weaker-than-expected global
recovery owing to the spread of new COVID-19 variants are the main
sources of downside risks. Risks to the global growth outlook are tilted to
the downside in view of tight labor markets in advanced economies as well
as uncertainty on inflation and monetary policy.

**D. Demand conditions**

  - Domestic economic recovery appears to be gaining traction but the full
year growth forecast for 2022 is lower compared to the previous round due
to the impact of the stricter COVID-19 alert level imposed during the start
of the year as well as the slightly slower world GDP growth outlook. Global
economic output expanded at a slower pace as rising COVID-19 cases,
protracted supply chain disruptions, and persistent inflationary pressures
dampen output capacity as well as demand conditions and consumer
confidence. Meanwhile, household consumption and output for most
production sectors has remained below the levels recorded prior to the
pandemic period.

  - Mobility indicators have declined in recent months with the shift to a more

stringent alert level amid the surge in COVID-19 infections as well as the
detection of local transmission of the omicron variant. Using the 7-day
moving average, mobility in grocery and pharmacy, parks, retail and
recreation locations declined, which may be attributed to the stricter

mobility restrictions imposed on unvaccinated people such as stay-athome orders. Meanwhile, the duration for people staying in residential
areas rose during the period, consistent with the decline in mobility for
other location categories.

  - Meanwhile, labor market conditions improved, with some indicators
performing even better than during the pre-pandemic period. Relative to
the pre-pandemic period, employment rate was higher in January 2022 at
94.7 percent, while the unemployment rate of 5.3 percent is higher by only
about 881,000 unemployed compared to pre-pandemic level. However,
more granular data indicate that employment quality has not yet
recovered relative to pre-pandemic level as recent employment gains
were mostly low-skilled and less remunerative.

  - Nevertheless, economic recovery in 2022 to 2023 is expected to be

supported by the implementation of the Corporate Recovery and Tax
Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Law and Financial Institutions
Strategic Transfer (FIST) Act as well as improvements in external demand.
The latest forecasts also show that the country’s real GDP will return to its
2019 level by Q3 2022.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - Sustained import arrivals and improved local harvest have kept rice prices

at bay even amid the reimposition of mobility restrictions and ongoing
planting season. Nonetheless, domestic retail rice prices remained
generally stable as envisioned with the enactment of the Republic Act
(R.A.) No. 11203.

  - Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture (DA) has also rolled-out

targeted measures to help stabilize domestic supply of agricultural
commodities such as pork, rice, and fish.

Oil Price Developments

  - Global oil prices surged in January and early February 2022 due to

geopolitical tensions in Emerging Europe and the Middle East, combined
with tight supply conditions from disruptions even as OPEC+ gradually
raised production. Heating oil demand is also expected to strengthen
given snowfall in the Central and North-Eastern in the United States. At the
same time, still elevated natural gas prices, which could be exacerbated
with the ongoing Ukraine crisis, could drive oil prices higher as consumers
switch to oil products. Meanwhile, futures prices remained in

backwardation, which suggests that crude oil prices would decline going
forward.

Developments in the Utilities Sector


-----

  - The overall electricity rate continued to decline due mainly to lower

generation charge. The downward adjustment in the generation cost was
on the back of lower costs from Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and
Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM), according to Meralco. Charges
from the IPPs fell due to higher plant dispatch of Quezon Power and First
Gas – Sta. Rita. Similarly, WESM charges went down due to significant
reduction in Meralco’s WESM purchases which mitigated the impact of
higher spot market prices during the January 2022 supply month.

  - Meanwhile, the decreases in IPPs and WESM charges were partly offset by

the increase in costs from the Power Supply Agreements (PSAs) due to
lower demand that led to lower excess energy deliveries as well as the
lower plant dispatch of San Buenaventura amid scheduled maintenance.

**F. Financial market developments**

  - The peso depreciated against the US dollar in January 2022 relative to

December 2021. The peso depreciated due partly to concerns over the
impact of typhoon Odette on the economy and the reimposition of tighter
restrictions in NCR and some areas in the country due to a surge in
coronavirus cases. In addition, (i) expectations of hawkish stance from the
US Federal Reserve amid inflation risks; (ii) the increase in global oil prices
following geopolitical tensions in the Middle East; and (iii) the slowdown in
China’s economy alongside the surprise policy rate cut by the People’s
Bank of China (PBOC) likewise weighed down the peso.

  - Amid improving economic condition, lending picked up and loan quality

further improved. Non-performing loans (NPLs) displayed a downtrend.
Risk-based capital adequacy ratio (CAR) and Basel III leverage ratio of
Philippine banks including liquidity capital ratio (LCR) and net stable
funding ratio (NSFR) were well-above the BSP thresholds. The BSP relief
measures are still in place to support credit growth in the country and, at
the same time, provide continued access to financial services to
households and vulnerable sectors. The extension of prudential relief
measures intends to sustain the momentum of bank lending as well as
minimize the possible long term economic scarring brought about by the
COVID-19 pandemic.

**G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions**

  - Liquidity in the financial system continues to be ample. Preliminary data

show that domestic liquidity (M3) expanded by 7.7 percent year-on-year to
about ₱15.3 trillion in December 2021 following an 8.3-percent expansion
in November.

  - Credit activity continued to exhibit signs of recovery in recent months,

reflecting the improvement in business activity amid easing quarantine
restrictions, declining COVID-19 cases, and further progress in terms of

vaccination. Preliminary data show that outstanding loans of universal and
commercial banks (U/KBs), net of reverse repurchase (RRP) placements
with the BSP, grew at a faster rate of 4.6 percent year-on-year in December
2021 from 4.0 percent in November.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

  - The National Government (NG) recorded a ₱1,332.1 billion fiscal deficit for

January – November 2021. Netting out the interest payments in NG
expenditures, the primary deficit amounted to ₱930.0 billion, thirty
percent higher than the amount recorded in the previous year. The NG
continues to have ample fiscal space to help cushion the pandemic’s
impact and provide further support to economic recovery.

**I.  External developments**

  - Global economic activity expanded at a slower pace in January 2022 as

rising COVID-19 cases, protracted supply chain disruptions, and persistent
inflationary pressures reduce output capacity and dampen demand
conditions and consumer confidence. The JP Morgan Global All-Industry
Output Index posted a purchasing managers’ index (PMI) reading of 51.4
in January from 54.3 in the previous month as growth of output, new
business, and outstanding business moderated due mainly to surging
COVID-19 cases worldwide.

  - Persistent global supply chain disruptions continued to affect

manufacturing activity in some economies. The pace of expansion in US
manufacturing activity eased as new orders, production, and inventories
grew at a slower pace amid rising prices, protracted supply disruptions,
and labor shortages. China’s seasonally adjusted manufacturing PMI
returned to contraction territory as quarantine measures were reinstated
to curb rising COVID-19 cases. Meanwhile, manufacturing activity in the
euro area and Japan expanded at a faster rate due to favorable demand
conditions. However, the supply side of the manufacturing sector
continued to hinder efficient business operations. The Nikkei ASEAN
Manufacturing PMI settled at 52.7 in January 2022, unchanged from the
recorded PMI reading in December.
