**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 1 JUNE 2006***


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight RP
(lending) rate; and

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs.

2) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios; and

3) Continue to articulate the BSP's support for the Government's use of nonmonetary measures to address supply-side risks to basic commodity
prices and continue representation and coordination with concerned
government agencies for this purpose.

The Monetary Board then proceeded to review the recent developments,
and the key considerations in the formulation of the BSP’s monetary policy
stance.

**I. Review of Recent Developments**

**Inflation**

- Headline inflation decelerated to 7.1 percent in April from 7.6 percent in
March, as inflation for all commodity groups slowed down. Average
inflation for the first four months of the year was 7.2 percent. Meanwhile,
year-on-year core inflation slowed in April following two consecutive
months of increases, bringing the year-to-date core inflation to 6.2
percent.

- The arguments and information presented herein were the ones prevailing at the time of the Monetary
Board decision on 1 June 2006. The highlights of the discussions of the 1 June 2006 meeting were
approved by the Monetary Board during its meeting held on 29 June 2006.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely: the Deputy Governor for the Monetary Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor for Supervision and
Examination Sector, the Managing Director of the Treasury Department, and the Director of the
Department of Economic Research.

- World spot prices of crude oil rose in May on geopolitical concerns; but
futures prices softened due to reports of ample US gasoline inventories
and the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) downward revision of its
forecast for global oil demand growth in 2006. Meanwhile, domestic
pump prices of gasoline, diesel, kerosene and LPG increased during the
period.

**Demand**

- Selected demand indicators suggested limited pressures on prices.

��Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) accelerated to 5.5
percent in the first quarter of 2006 from 4.2 percent a year earlier and
5.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005. Meanwhile, the country’s
Gross National Product (GNP) rose by 5.8 percent, helped by the
sustained growth in Net Factor Income from Abroad (NFIA).

��Average capacity utilization in manufacturing rose minimally to 80.1
percent in March 2006 from 80.0 percent in the previous month.

��Growth in total energy sales by the Manila Electric Company
(Meralco) rose to 6.9 percent year-on-year in March from 4.6 percent
in February. This could be attributed to higher growth in consumption
by commercial and industrial users.

�� Passenger car sales declined at a faster pace of 17.7 percent year-onyear in April from 2.0 percent in the previous month, based on data
from the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines, Inc.
(CAMPI); while appliance sales continued to decline, registering a
14.7 percent reduction in volume in March.

�� Growth in merchandise export earnings accelerated to 26.3 percent
year-on-year in March from 14.9 percent in February due mainly to
higher growth in exports of manufactured goods, particularly electronic
products. Total merchandise imports rose at a faster pace of 8.0
percent in March compared to 4.6 percent in February, due to the
upturn in imports of raw materials and intermediate goods; faster
growth in imports of minerals fuel, lubricants and related materials;
and an increase in imports of consumer goods.

��Unemployment rose slightly in January 2006 to 10.7 percent from 10.3
percent in October 2005 but was lower than the year-ago figure of
11.3 percent, based on the old NSO definition of unemployment.
Based on the new definition of unemployment, the jobless rate

likewise increased to 8.1 percent in January from 7.4 percent in
October.[2]

��The results of the latest Business Expectations Survey (BES) of the
BSP indicated improving business optimism for the second and third
quarters of 2006.

**Domestic Liquidity**

- Growth in domestic liquidity increased somewhat, while outstanding loans
of commercial banks fell slightly.

��Domestic liquidity growth increased to 9.6 percent in April from 9.1
percent year-on-year in March (revised), based on data from the
BSP’s Depository Corporations Survey (DCS).[3]

��Outstanding loans of commercial banks (KBs) declined by 0.5 percent
year-on-year in March 2006. On a monthly basis, KB loans declined
by 1.6 percent.

**Financial Market and Other Domestic Developments**

- Compared with the auction on 2 May 2006, T-bill rates rose across all tenors
on 15 May 2006 to realign with those prevailing in the secondary market. The
T-bill rates for the 91-day, 182-day and 364-day tenors rose by 23.2 basis
points, 15.2 basis points and 15.6 basis points, respectively, to 5.0 percent,
5.734 percent and 5.955 percent.

- The peso weakened against the US dollar in May due largely to higher
corporate demand for US dollars and expectations of further interest rate
increases by the US Federal Reserve. Nonetheless, overseas workers’
remittances, export receipts, portfolio investment inflows, and the
possibility of a sovereign credit rating upgrade provided some support to
the peso.

- The January to April 2006 fiscal deficit of the National Government was
P50.0 billion, lower than the P60.1 billion deficit incurred during the same

2 Beginning in April 2005, a new Labor Force Survey (LFS) questionnaire was used to estimate the number
of unemployed, which includes all persons who are 15 years old and over as of their last birthday and are
reported as: (1) without work and currently available for work and seeking work; or (2) without work and
currently available for work but not seeking work for the following reasons: (a) tired/believed no work
available; (b) awaiting results of previous job application; (c) temporary illness/disability; (d) bad weather;
and (e) waiting for rehire/job recall. The old definition of unemployment did not consider the availability
criterion.
3 M3 refers to the stock of broad money based on data on the Depository Corporations Survey (DCS).
The DCS, which replaced the Monetary Survey (MS) as the basis for measuring domestic liquidity, features
an expanded list of surveyed institutions that includes the BSP, commercial banks, thrift banks, rural banks,
non-stock savings and loan associations and non-banks with quasi-banking functions.

period in 2005. Growth in revenue collections (16.1 percent) continued to
outpace that of disbursements (10.0 percent).

**External Developments**

- Global economic momentum continued to broaden on renewed strength
of domestic consumption and investments in major economies. Sustained
gains in employment, favorable financial conditions, and steady
improvements in business and consumer confidence also underpinned
global expansion. The resiliency of the services sector remained a major
driver of growth in most economies, while the solid pick-up in
manufacturing activity lent further support to growth. However, a number
of uncertainties remained, notably the sustained volatility in international
oil prices and the prospect of a considerable increase in global interest
rates.

- Except for the US Federal Open Market Committee (which raised its
policy rate during its 10 May 2006 meeting), the recent responses of
monetary authorities to the outlook for inflation and growth in their
respective economies were generally cautious. The Bank of England's
Monetary Policy Committee voted to keep the key repo rate steady during
its 3-4 May 2006 meeting, noting that inflation remained close to target
despite some upside risks in the near-term relating mainly to higher
commodity and energy prices. Similarly, the European Central Bank voted
to keep its key refinance rate unchanged at 2.5 percent, noting that wage
dynamics had remained moderate over the recent quarters while growth
in wages was expected to remain contained. The Bank of Japan,
meanwhile, voted to maintain its uncollateralized overnight call rate at
zero following the change in its operating target for money market
operations in March.

**II. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

- The expected path of inflation remained the chief argument for keeping
policy settings steady. Even after accounting for recent increases in oil
prices, latest BSP forecasts continued to suggest a deceleration in
inflation beginning in the second half of 2006. There were also indications
that average inflation for 2007 could hit the 4-5 percent target in the
absence of new supply shocks.

- Furthermore, core inflation and other demand indicators continued to point
to limited demand-based pressures on prices. Meanwhile, inflation
expectations remained well-anchored and there was relatively little
indication of second-round effects from supply shocks.

period in 2005. Growth in revenue collections (16.1 percent) continued to
outpace that of disbursements (10.0 percent).

- Nevertheless, the Monetary Board recognized that the balance of risks to
future inflation remained on the upside and closely related to movements
in oil prices. Steady world oil demand against a backdrop of limited
surplus production capacity would likely keep world oil prices high. Oil
prices would likely be vulnerable to market concerns of geopolitical risks
in major oil-producing economies. Possible adjustments in domestic
power costs could also lead to a continuing environment of supply-side
pressures. Such a scenario could increase the risk of an adverse shift in
the public’s inflation expectations as well as second-round effects in
wage- and price-setting.

- Given that price pressures were mainly rooted in the supply side, the
Monetary Board agreed that its key policy priority remained that of
managing the risks to inflation expectations and the risk of potential
second-round effects on wage- and price-setting. At the same time, the
Monetary Board agreed it would continue to support non-monetary
measures to address high oil prices by concerned government agencies.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

- Upon assessment of the balance of risks to inflation and the evidence that
had become available since its previous meeting on monetary policy, the
Monetary Board unanimously approved the measures recommended by
the Advisory Committee, with the following additional measure:

��  Increase the focus of the BSP’s public information campaign on the
dynamics and sources of price pressures in order to help guide the
public’s inflation expectations.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting is scheduled on 29 June 2006.
