**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 29 JUNE 2006***


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight RP
(lending) rate; and

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs.

2) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios;

3) Continue to articulate the BSP's support for the Government's use of nonmonetary measures to address supply-side risks to basic commodity
prices and continue representation and coordination with concerned
government agencies for this purpose; and

4) Increase the focus of the BSP’s public information campaign on the
dynamics and sources of price pressures in order to help guide the
public’s inflation expectations.

The Monetary Board then proceeded to review the recent
developments and the key considerations in the formulation of the BSP’s
monetary policy stance.

**I. Review of Recent Developments**

**Inflation**

- The headline inflation rate continued to slow down to 6.9 percent in May
from 7.1 percent in the previous month. This was due to slower price
increases for all major commodity groups in the CPI basket with the

- The arguments and information presented herein were the ones prevailing at the time of the Monetary
Board decision on 29 June 2006. The highlights of the discussions of the 29 June 2006 meeting were
approved by the Monetary Board during its meeting held on 20 July 2006.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely: the Deputy Governor for the Monetary Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor for Supervision and
Examination Sector, the Managing Director of the Treasury Department, and the Director of the
Department of Economic Research.

exception of clothing and services. Similarly, core inflation—defined as
headline inflation after excluding volatile food and energy items—slowed
down in May to 6.1 percent from 6.3 percent in the previous month.

- World spot prices of crude oil rose slightly in June owing to lingering
geopolitical issues, particularly in Iran and Nigeria. Following the trend in
the global oil market, domestic pump prices of gasoline, kerosene and
LPG as of 19 June 2006 increased by P1.50, P1.50 and P0.31,
respectively, relative to their end-May levels.

**Demand**

- Selected demand indicators suggested limited pressures on prices.

��Based on the results of the Monthly Integrated Survey of Selected
Industries (MISSI), which covers 509 establishments, manufacturing
firms utilized 80.1 percent of their capacity in April, unchanged from
March.

��Total energy sales by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco)
increased slightly by 1.1 percent in April relative to the same month in
2005. This was lower than the previous month’s growth rate due to the
slower rise in consumption by commercial and industrial users and the
decline in demand from residential users.

��Sales of passenger cars picked up by 22.1 percent, while sales of
trucks and buses rose by 40.8 percent year-on-year in May, based on
data from the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the
Philippines, Inc. (CAMPI) and the Truck Manufacturers Association
(TMA).

��Appliance sales continued to decline, with volume falling by nearly 20
percent in April relative to the same month in 2005.

��Based on estimates of Colliers International Research, land values in
the Makati Central Business District (CBD) and Ortigas Center
continued to rise by 15.0 percent year-on-year during the first quarter
of 2006. Meanwhile, vacancy rates of office and residential buildings
declined to 7.0 percent and 12.0 percent, respectively, from 9.1
percent and 13.6 percent in the same quarter in 2005.

��Merchandise exports expanded briskly by 20.5 percent year-on-year
in April. However, this was lower than the March growth rate of 26.3
percent due to the slower rise in exports of manufactured goods.

��Merchandise imports registered a lower year-on-year growth rate of
7.4 percent in April compared to 8.0 percent in March. Contributing to
this was the decline in imports of mineral fuels, lubricants and related

materials; consumer goods; and goods classified under special
transactions. The country’s top import, electronic products, surged
16.9 percent in April.

��Based on the new NSO definition of unemployment, the jobless rate
declined slightly year-on-year to 8.2 percent in April 2006. Relative to
the previous survey in January 2006, it increased with the seasonal
entry of new graduates into the labor force.[2]

��The results of the latest Business Expectations Survey (BES) and
Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) of the BSP suggest improving
optimism for the second and third quarters of 2006.

**Domestic Liquidity**

- Domestic liquidity, as measured by M3, rose at a faster pace of 9.7
percent year-on-year in April, based on data from the BSP’s Depository
Corporations Survey (DCS).[3] The expansion in liquidity was fueled mainly
by the increase in net foreign assets due to the continued inflows from
overseas Filipino workers (OFW) remittances and direct investments.
Latest available data reflected a further acceleration in domestic liquidity
at 12.7 percent in May.

- Outstanding loans of commercial banks (KBs) increased modestly by 1.3
percent in April relative to the same month in 2005. Loan growth in April
came from the following sectors: financial institutions, real estate and
business services; agriculture, fisheries and forestry; community, social
and personal services sector; mining and quarrying; and electricity, gas
and water.

**Other Domestic Developments**

- On the wage front, the Regional Tripartite Wage and Productivity Board
(RTWPB) in the National Capital Region (NCR) approved Wage Order
NCR-12 increasing the daily minimum wage of private sector workers in
the NCR by P25 (or 8 percent) to P350. Other RTWPBs have been
conducting consultations and deliberations on possible wage adjustments
in other regions.

## ��������������������������������������������
2 The same trend was observed for the jobless rate using the old NSO definition of unemployment.
Beginning in April 2005, the NSO released a new definition of unemployment, which covers all persons 15
years old and over and are reported as: (1) without work and currently available for work and seeking work;
or (2) without work and currently available for work but not seeking work for the following reasons:
(a) tired/believed no work available; (b) awaiting results of previous job application; (c) temporary
illness/disability; (d) bad weather; and (e) waiting for rehire/job recall. The old definition of unemployment
did not consider the availability criterion.
3 The DCS, which replaced the Monetary Survey (MS) as the basis for measuring domestic liquidity,
features an expanded list of surveyed institutions that includes the BSP, commercial banks, thrift banks,
rural banks, non-stock savings and loan associations and non-banks with quasi-banking functions.

- The near-term outlook for agriculture, particularly for _palay production,_
remains favorable. The Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS) estimates a
16 percent year-on-year increase in palay output for the second semester
of 2006, on expectations of normal weather conditions and higher yield
and harvest area.

- The peso depreciated against the US dollar in June on higher risk
aversion in global financial markets alongside concerns over the impact
on growth of further hikes in the US federal funds target rate.

- The National Government posted a budget surplus of P5.8 billion in May.
This brought the fiscal balance for the first five months to a deficit of P44.2
billion, lower than the deficit incurred during the same period in 2005 and
was only 48.9 percent of the deficit programmed for the first semester of
2006.

**External Developments**

- The global economy continued to grow in early 2006 on the renewed
strength of personal consumption and investments, the improvement in
employment conditions and corporate profits, and the continued growth of
services and manufacturing in major economies. Risks to global economic
growth include the continued volatility in world oil prices, rising global
interest rates, and the potential impact on consumer demand of higher
commodity prices.

- The US Federal Open Market Committee and the European Central Bank
raised their key policy rates by 25 basis points each during their latest
policy meeting on 10 May and 8 June 2006, respectively. Meanwhile, the
Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee kept its key repo rate
steady in June, noting that inflation remained close to target despite some
upside risks in the near-term. The Bank of Japan kept its uncollateralized
overnight call rate steady at zero.

**II. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

- The evidence on current and expected inflation continued to support the
maintenance of policy settings in the meantime. Core inflation and other
recent data continued to paint a scenario of limited demand-based
pressures, while latest BSP forecasts remained suggestive of a
deceleration in inflation in the second half, leading to within-target inflation
in 2007.

- In addition, inflation expectations appeared to be well-contained, judging
from the results of the BSP’s surveys among households and private
sector analysts.

- Nevertheless, the Monetary Board recognized that the balance of risks to
the inflation outlook remains tilted toward the upside, linked mainly to
movements in oil prices. The current high oil price environment is likely to
be sustained in the near term given a tight demand-supply balance in the
international oil market. Along with likely adjustments in domestic power
costs, this points to a continuing environment of supply-side pressures.
Such a prospect increases the risks to inflation expectations and the
likelihood of second-round effects, particularly on wage-setting.

- The Monetary Board agreed that managing the risks to inflation
expectations and the risk of potential second-round effects on wage- and
price-setting remains the key policy priority.

- The Monetary Board also pointed out that rising global interest rates need
to be closely monitored, in view of their impact on capital movements and
inflation.

- The Monetary Board reiterated that it remains strongly committed to
achieving the inflation target for 2007 and stands ready to act upon
evidence of escalating risks to the outlook for inflation and to inflation
expectations.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

- Upon assessment of the balance of risks to inflation and the evidence that
has become available since its previous meeting on monetary policy, the
Monetary Board unanimously approved the recommendations of the
Advisory Committee.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting is scheduled on 10 August 2006.
