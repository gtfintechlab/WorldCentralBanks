**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 2 NOVEMBER 2006***


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight RP
(lending) rate; and

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs.

2) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios at 10 percent for regular
reserves and 11 percent for liquidity reserves on the deposit liabilities of
universal banks (UBs) and commercial banks (KBs) and Non-Bank
Financial Intermediaries with quasi-banking and with trust license.

3) Adopt a tiering scheme on the aggregate placements by banks with the
BSP under the RRP and SDA windows as follows:

(a) First P5 billion – current BSP published rates;

(b) In excess of P5 billion up to P10 billion – current BSP published rates
less 200 basis points;

(c) In excess of P10 billion – current BSP published rates less 400 basis
points.

4) Continue to articulate the BSP's support for the Government's use of nonmonetary measures to address supply-side risks to basic commodity
prices and continue representation and coordination with concerned
government agencies for this purpose.

- The discussion presented herein reflects the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the
information available at the time of the policy meeting. The highlights of the discussions of the 2 November
2006 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular meeting held on 23 November
2006.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely: the Deputy Governor for the Monetary Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor for Supervision and
Examination Sector, the Managing Director of the Treasury Department, and the Officer-In-Charge of the
Department of Economic Research.

The Monetary Board then proceeded to review the recent
developments and the key considerations in the formulation of the BSP’s
monetary policy stance.

**I. Review of Recent Developments**

**Inflation**

- Headline inflation continued to slow down, falling to 5.7 percent in
September. All commodity groups registered slower price increases
except for clothing, for which inflation remained steady at 3.1 percent for
the past three months. Likewise, core inflation decelerated anew to 5.0
percent from 5.3 percent in August.

- The easing was driven mainly by lower oil prices. The spot price of Dubai
crude oil continued to soften in October on news of rising US crude
inventories. Similarly, local retail prices of gasoline, kerosene and diesel
were also reduced during the period.

**Demand**

- Available data generally showed mixed improvements in demand
conditions.

��Average capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector was relatively
unchanged at 80.3 percent in August compared to 80.2 percent in July
with about 60 percent of respondent firms reporting capacity utilization
rates between 70 and 89 percent.

��Growth in merchandise export earnings accelerated to 21.3 percent in
August. This was largely on account of the stronger growth in
manufactured exports, which comprised 87.5 percent of total. In
particular, electronics exports were up by 14.7 percent in August
compared to only 1.3 percent in July.

��Growth in merchandise imports rose slightly to 15.3 percent in August
from a revised rate of 14.8 percent in July with faster growth in imports
of raw materials and intermediate goods.

��Passenger car sales increased by 9.1 percent year-on-year in
September, higher than the previous month’s 6.5 percent. Similarly,
sales of trucks and buses rose by 18.6 percent year-on-year in
September, up from 16.1 percent in August.

��Total energy sales by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) declined
by 3.7 percent in August following a modest increase of 1.8 percent in

July. This was due to reduced energy consumption by the residential,
commercial and industrial sectors.

��Appliance sales remained weak, with total units sold falling by 16.6
percent year-on-year in August.

��Based on the new NSO definition of unemployment, the jobless rate
declined to 8.0 percent in July 2006 from 8.2 percent in the previous
quarter, but remained higher relative to the year-ago rate of 7.7
percent.[2] ��

**Domestic Liquidity**

- Demand for money increased further in September as domestic liquidity
or M3 growth based on data from the BSP’s Depository Corporations
Survey (DCS) accelerated to 14.5 percent year-on-year from 12.4 percent
in August.[3] The expansion in liquidity was traced largely to the increase in
the net foreign assets of depository corporations on the back of strong
foreign exchange inflows from overseas Filipino workers (OFW)
remittances, export receipts and portfolio investments.

- Nevertheless, private credit remained weak. Growth in outstanding loans
of commercial banks (KB) slowed to 2.5 percent year-on-year in August
from the 4.3 percent growth posted in the previous month.

**Other Domestic Developments**

- A dry spell is ongoing and could affect food production. The Philippine
Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration
(PAGASA) confirmed that an El Niño dry spell is in its early stage of
development. These dry weather conditions may continue until early
2007.

- The Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS) estimates a 0.8 percent
decline in rice production in the fourth quarter, given intensive planting by
farmers early in the year. Nonetheless, full-year production is still
expected to reach an all all-time high of 15.4 million metric tons, 5.7
percent higher than last year’s harvest, because of strong first semester
output.[4]

2 Starting April 2005, the new Labor Force Survey (LFS) questionnaire was used to estimate the
unemployed, which included all persons who were 15 years old and over as of their last birthday and were
reported as without work, currently available for work, and seeking work or not seeking work due to�valid�
reasons. The old unemployment definition did not consider the criterion on availability for work.
3 The DCS, which replaced the Monetary Survey (MS) as the basis for measuring domestic liquidity,
features an expanded list of surveyed institutions that includes the BSP, commercial banks, thrift banks,
rural banks, non-stock savings and loan associations and non-banks with quasi-banking functions.

- Treasury bill (T-bill) auction rates eased across all tenors on 23 October
2006 relative to 11 September 2006. The decline in yields may be
attributed to sustained investor confidence in the government’s fiscal
performance and ample liquidity among banks.

- The Philippine peso continued to advance against the US dollar due to
positive market sentiment given improving economic fundamentals.
Strong regional currencies due partly to market expectations of a pause in
the US tightening cycle, the BSP’s relatively high level of dollar reserves
and sustained dollar inflows from OFW remittances, exports and foreign
investments likewise contributed to the gains in the peso.

- The National Government (NG) posted a P16.2 billion fiscal deficit in
September, which brought the year-to-date fiscal deficit to P50.4 billion,
53.5 percent lower than the deficit for the comparable period in 2005. The
NG’s fiscal deficit for the first three quarters of the year is less than half of
the full-year program of P125 billion.

**External Developments**

- The global economic expansion has shown some signs of moderation in
the second quarter of 2006, with real GDP growth slowing in both the
United States and Japan relative to the previous quarter. However, world
growth is expected to remain fairly robust for the remainder of the year on
account of ongoing improvements in consumer spending, sustained gains
in employment, and still-favorable financial conditions. A number of risks
remain, notably the volatility in international oil prices, disorderly
unwinding of global imbalances, and the unexpected tightening of
financial markets—particularly those in industrial countries such as the US
and UK where housing markets are richly valued.

- The major central banks decided to maintain their policy rates at current
levels. The US FOMC maintained its target for the federal funds rate at
5.25 percent in its 24 October 2006 policy meeting as the country’s
economic growth slowed significantly in the second quarter, partly
reflecting the cooling housing market. However, the Committee
maintained that further policy rate increases may be needed going
forward to address existing inflation risks. Similarly, the Bank of England's
Monetary Policy Committee voted to keep the official bank rate steady at
4.75 percent during its 4-5 October meeting on account of the broadly
unchanged inflation outlook during the month relative to August 2006. The
Bank of Japan decided to maintain current policy settings as it
encouraged the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at around
0.25 percent in its 12-13 October 2006 monetary policy meeting.

**II. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

- The Monetary Board was of the view that the improving outlook for
inflation, given prevailing demand and supply-side conditions, provides
some policy flexibility. Latest forecasts continued to show a generally
declining path for inflation, with average inflation for 2007 expected to fall
within the 4-5 percent target in the absence of further adverse shocks.
The stronger peso should also help keep down the domestic prices of
imported commodities, particularly crude oil, while a moderate outlook for
agriculture should help ensure stable food prices.

- Meanwhile, the continued easing of core inflation suggests minimal
demand-based inflation pressures. Aggregate demand, to date, has
shown moderate improvements, driven largely by consumer spending.

- However, the Monetary Board also acknowledged that the balance of
risks to the inflation outlook remained on the upside, due to a number of
factors. Foremost among these are the potential cost-side pressures
arising from the uncertainty in world oil prices. Food prices may also be at
risk if the El Niño turns out more severe than expected, which can
significantly affect agricultural production. With these potential supplyside pressures, the Monetary Board remained watchful of a rise in the
public’s inflation expectations.

- The Monetary Board also noted that they will continue to pay close
attention to a possible excessive buildup in liquidity conditions that could
lead to higher inflation.

- The Monetary Board decided to adopt a tiering scheme on banks’
aggregate placements with the BSP under the RP/RRP and SDA
windows, effective today, 2 November 2006. The Monetary Board
believed that the restoration of the tiering scheme is expected to
encourage banks to seek alternatives to placing their excess funds with
the BSP, such as lending to the public.

- The Monetary Board reiterated its strong commitment to achieving the
inflation targets for the medium term and its readiness to act against
emerging risks to the outlook for inflation and to inflation expectations.
