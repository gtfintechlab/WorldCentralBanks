**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 6 APRIL 2006***


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight RP
(lending) rate; and

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs.

2) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios;

3) Continue to articulate the BSP's support for the Government's use of nonmonetary measures to address supply-side risks to basic commodity
prices and continue representation and coordination with concerned
government agencies for this purpose; and

4) Emphasize the short-term nature of the impact of the RVAT on prices in
the BSP’s policy pronouncements on the stance of monetary policy.

**I.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The Advisory Committee’s recommendations were based on the
following considerations:

? Headline inflation was unchanged at 7.6 percent year-on-year in March,
as lower inflation for services and steady inflation for clothing and food,
beverages and tobacco (FBT) offset higher inflation for housing and
repairs, fuel, light and water (FLW) and miscellaneous items. Average
headline inflation for the first quarter of 2006 settled at 7.3 percent.

- The arguments and information presented herein were the ones prevailing at the time of the Monetary
Board decision on 6 April 2006. The highlights of the discussions of the 6 April 2006 meeting were
approved by the Monetary Board during its meeting held on 4 May 2006.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely: the Deputy Governor for the Monetary Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor for Supervision and
Examination Sector, the Managing Director of the Treasury Department, and the Director of the
Department of Economic Research.

Meanwhile, year-on-year core inflation rose for the second consecutive
month in March, bringing the year-to-date core inflation to 6.1 percent

? The international spot price of crude oil declined in March as the winter
season ended. However, futures prices rose on expectations of higher
demand for gasoline and other transport fuel for the summer season in
the US, Europe and Asia. Domestic pump prices of petroleum products
saw mixed trends: gasoline and LPG prices fell while diesel and kerosene
rose in March.

? Latest turnouts for selected indicators indicate soft demand conditions

� Production indices generally showed a decline in manufacturing
output. Average capacity utilization in manufacturing in January 2006
declined slightly to 80.2 percent from 80.4 percent in the previous
month. The volume of production index (VOPI) for manufacturing
posted a year-on-year decline of 2.8 percent in January compared to
0.1 percent in the previous month. Meanwhile, the value of production
index (VAPI) increased by 16.1 percent year-on-year, higher than the
previous month’s 12.8 percent.

� Growth in total energy sales by the Manila Electric Company
(Meralco) fell to 1.1 percent year-on-year in January from 4.0 percent
in the previous month. This was due to reduced consumption by
residential users and the slowdown in commercial and industrial
demand for power.

� Passenger car sales registered a 15.6 percent year-on-year decline in
February 2006 based on data from the Chamber of Automotive
Manufacturers of the Philippines, Inc. (CAMPI). This was a reversal of
the 16.7 percent growth in January. According to CAMPI and the
Truck Manufacturers Association (TMA), the early months of the year
are historically sluggish months for the industry.

� Appliance sales continued to fall, registering a 17.4 percent decline in
volume in January 2006. On a month-on-month basis, appliance sales
posted a 9.4 percent growth, reversing the 35.4 percent decrease in
December 2005.

� Total merchandise export earnings declined by 0.9 percent year-onyear in January 2006 due mainly to the decline in manufactures. This
was a reversal of the 16.8 percent expansion in the previous month.

� Total merchandise imports rose by 5.1 percent year-on-year in
January 2006, a deceleration from the revised growth of 28.9 percent
in the previous month. Payments for electronic products, which
comprised 42.9 percent of the total import bill, declined by 7.9 percent.

� Unemployment rose slightly in January 2006 to 10.7 percent from 10.3
percent in October 2005 but was lower than the year-ago figure of
11.3 percent, based on the old National Statistics Office (NSO)
definition of unemployment. Based on the new definition of
unemployment, the jobless rate also increased to 8.1 percent in
January from 7.4 percent in October.[2]

� The latest Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) and Business
Expectations Survey (BES) of the BSP showed improving optimism for
the first and second quarters of 2006.

? Based on the latest available data for the fourth quarter of 2005,
agricultural output grew by 4.0 percent in real terms, the highest rate
recorded in the past five quarters. For 2005, the agriculture sector
expanded by 2.0 percent, lower than the previous year’s 4.9 percent.

? Growth in domestic liquidity and bank lending rose based on latest
available data. Treasury bill (T-bill) auction rates were generally lower.

� Domestic liquidity grew at a faster pace of 9.4 percent year-on-year in
February from 8.4 percent in the previous month, based on data from
the BSP’s Depository Corporations Survey (DCS).[3]

� Outstanding loans of commercial banks (KBs) grew by 3.0 percent
year-on-year in January 2006 compared to a 0.9 percent rise in the
previous month. Banks’ lending activities were channeled to the
following sectors: financial institutions, real estate and business
services (FIREBS) community, social and personal services,
agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector.

� Relative to the 27 February 2006 auction, the T-bill rate eased across
all tenors on 3 April 2006 due to improving fiscal outlook. Relative to
the 27 March 2006 auction, T-bill rate for the 91-day tenor rose slightly
by 1.5 basis points, while that for the 182-day and 364-day tenors
eased by 19.4 basis points and 26.0 basis points.

? The peso continued to gain against the US dollar due to growing
investors’ confidence. The peso was also supported by strong dollar

2 Beginning in April 2005, a new Labor Force Survey (LFS) questionnaire was used to estimate the number
of unemployed, which includes all persons who are 15 years old and over as of their last birthday and are
reported as: (1) without work and currently available for work and seeking work; or (2) without work and
currently available for work but not seeking work for the following reasons: (a) tired/believed no work
available; (b) awaiting results of previous job application; (c) temporary illness/disability; (d) bad weather;
and (e) waiting for rehire/job recall. The old definition of unemployment did not consider the availability
criterion.
3 M3 refers to the stock of broad money based on data on the Depository Corporations Survey (DCS).
The DCS, which replaced the Monetary Survey (MS) as the basis for measuring domestic liquidity, features
an expanded list of surveyed institutions that includes the BSP, commercial banks, thrift banks, rural banks,
non-stock savings and loan associations and non-banks with quasi-banking functions.

inflows from portfolio investments, OFW remittances due to school
graduation season, the appreciation of regional currencies against the US
dollar, and foreign direct investments.

? The NG posted a P25-billion fiscal deficit in February 2006, P2.2 billion
below the programmed ceiling of P27.2 billion and 6.0 percent lower than
the fiscal deficit for the comparable month in 2005. Revenues grew by 32
percent to reach P64.3 billion, while expenditures rose by 23.5 percent to
P89.2 billion. For the first two months of 2006, the NG fiscal deficit stood
at P48.1 billion or P7.7 billion below the program level.

? Global economic growth continued despite higher oil prices and various
natural disasters over the past year. The United States continued to lead
the global expansion amid the economic slowdown in the fourth quarter of
2005, while economic activity in emerging market economies remained
strong. The solid performance of the services sector underpinned growth
in most economies while a brisk pick-up of manufacturing activity was
seen starting mid-2005. Sustained gains in labor market conditions and
steady improvements in business and consumer confidence have aided
the rebound in domestic demand. While short-term price movements
appear to be dominated by developments in global oil prices, inflationary
pressures continue to be modest and inflation expectations remain
generally well-contained.

? Except for the Bank of England which voted to keep the key repo rate at
its current level of 4.50 percent during its 8-9 March 2006 Monetary Policy
Committee meeting, monetary authorities in major central banks in the
world opted to tighten their monetary settings. The US Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) raised the federal funds target rate by 25
basis points for the fifteenth time since June 2004 to 4.75 percent. The
European Central Bank voted to raise the minimum bid rate of the main
refinancing operations by 25 basis points to 2.50 percent to help ensure
that medium to long-term inflation expectations in the Euro Area remain
solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. In its March
monetary policy meeting, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) decided to change its
operating target of money market operations to the uncollateralized
overnight call rate, which the BOJ will encourage to remain at zero
percent.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

? Members of the Monetary Board agreed that prevailing conditions for
prices continue to provide room for the BSP to keep policy rates steady in
the near term. In particular, they noted that the recent easing in oil prices
and continued stability of the peso should help keep inflation pressures in
check. Demand and credit indicators continue to suggest softness, while

liquidity growth has stabilized to single-digit levels. Inflation expectations
on the whole appear to remain stable.

? The Monetary Board also noted that the outlook for inflation continues to
support keeping policy rates steady. The RVAT rate increase in February
appears to have caused mainly one-time increases in prices, and
sustained pressures do not appear to be a likely prospect. The March
inflation rate was within the BSP’s forecast range for the month, and was
thus consistent with the projected path for inflation. The BSP’s projected
path for inflation suggests a deceleration in the second half of 2006 as
cost-side pressures subside, and a reversion to the inflation target of 4-5
percent by 2007.

? Nevertheless, monetary authorities remain alert to the potential sources of
additional inflation pressures. Oil market futures data, for example,
continue to suggest an outlook of volatile oil prices over the policy horizon,
given that expectations of tight global supply remain. Pending adjustments
in domestic power transmission charges could also lead to increases in
retail energy costs. The continued strength of the peso also increases the
potential risk of a disorderly adjustment in the event of a reversal in
market sentiment, and authorities thus remain alert to signs of renewed
exchange market pressure.

? Under these conditions, the Monetary Board agreed that the BSP should
remain strongly committed to achieving the inflation target for 2007 and
addressing the risks to future inflation. In particular, authorities will
monitor closely for potential second-round effects in wage- and pricesetting and for indications of any adverse shift in inflation expectations.
The Monetary Board will continue to assess thoroughly the conditions for
prices, aggregate demand, domestic liquidity and other factors in order to
determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

? Upon assessment of the balance of risks to inflation and the evidence that
has become available since its previous meeting on monetary policy, the
Monetary Board unanimously approved the following measures:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight
RP (lending) rate; and

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs.

2) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios;

3) Continue to articulate the BSP’s support for the use of non-monetary
measures to address supply-side risks, particularly those relating to
food supply, energy conservation, and the development of alternative
energy sources, by strengthening representation and coordination with
various government agencies; and

4) Increase the focus of the BSP’s public information campaign on the
dynamics and sources of price pressures in order to help guide the
public’s inflationary expectations. Official policy pronouncements
concerning the stance of monetary policy will also emphasize the
short-term nature of the impact of the RVAT on prices.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting is scheduled on 4 May 2006.
