a) Raise the BSP’s current policy interest rate by 50 basis points to

6.0 percent for the overnight RRP rate; and

b) Increase the current interest rates on the overnight deposit facility

(ODF) to 5.50 percent and overnight lending facility (OLF) to
6.50 percent.

**Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

Inflation is projected to remain elevated in the coming months due to a

combination of persistent supply constraints and emerging demand-side
pressures. Projected inflation could remain above 4.0 percent until
Q3 2023, equivalent to 19 consecutive months of above-target inflation
outturns. Meanwhile, inflation is projected to revert close to the lower end
of the target range by January 2024 due mainly to negative base effects
and the likely deceleration in global oil and non-oil prices.


**_HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON THE_**

**_MONETARY POLICY STANCE HELD ON 16 FEBRUARY 2023 [1]_**

**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Raise the BSP’s current policy interest rate by 50 basis points to

6.0 percent for the overnight RRP rate; and

b) Increase the current interest rates on the overnight deposit facility

(ODF) to 5.50 percent and overnight lending facility (OLF) to
6.50 percent.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

       - Inflation is projected to remain elevated in the coming months due to a

combination of persistent supply constraints and emerging demand-side
pressures. Projected inflation could remain above 4.0 percent until
Q3 2023, equivalent to 19 consecutive months of above-target inflation
outturns. Meanwhile, inflation is projected to revert close to the lower end
of the target range by January 2024 due mainly to negative base effects
and the likely deceleration in global oil and non-oil prices.

       - Since November 2008, the Monetary Board noted that headline inflation

accelerated to its fastest pace in January. Meanwhile, various measures of
core inflation also rose sharply, indicating a further broadening of price
pressures. The risks to the inflation outlook now lean toward the upside for
both 2023 and 2024.

       - The Monetary Board deemed it necessary for a strong follow-through

monetary response to help further anchor inflation expectations and
demonstrate the BSP’s commitment to its price stability objective. The
main priority is to guide and prevent unfavorable shifts in the public’s
inflation expectations, which will also temper the emergence of further
second-round effects.

       - The Monetary Board was of the view that the higher near-term gross

domestic product (GDP) growth path suggests that the economy will be
able to retain its momentum despite a restrictive monetary policy stance.
In a high-inflation environment with robust pent-up demand, inflation
expectations remain at risk of de-anchoring until a deceleration in
headline inflation becomes evident.

financial information available at the time of the monetary policy meeting. The next meeting of the

  - At the same time, the Monetary Board noted that continued monetary

tightening will also provide a buffer against external spillovers that could
emanate from tightening global financial conditions as major central
banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, raise interest rates further.

**III.** **Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook**

The Monetary Board considered the recent macroeconomic and financial

developments discussed below in assessing the monetary policy stance:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Inflation increased further in January 2023, implying stronger inflation

persistence than initially expected. Headline inflation accelerated to
8.7 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in January 2023 due primarily to the faster
price increases in rent and utility rates, food as well as restaurant services.

  - Likewise, core inflation measures continued to increase, which suggests

second-round effects on a broader part of the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
basket. The official core inflation rose further to 7.4 percent in January 2023.
Alternative core inflation measures likewise increased.

**B.  Inflation expectations**

  - Inflation expectations have also increased for 2023-2025. The

February 2023 survey of economists showed a higher mean inflation
forecast for 2023 at 6.0 percent (from 4.9 percent based on the
January 2023 survey round). Similarly, the mean inflation forecasts for
2024 and 2025 rose to 4.0 percent and 4.1 percent (from 3.7 percent and
3.6 percent, respectively). Analysts expect inflation to remain above the
upper end of the government’s target range in 2023 given higher-thanexpected January 2023 inflation print, as well as due to demand-side price
pressures and supply shocks.

**C.  Inflation outlook**

  - The latest baseline forecasts indicate that inflation will remain elevated in

the coming months with inflation averaging at 6.1 percent for 2023 and
3.1 percent for 2024. The forecasts for 2023 and 2024 were adjusted
upwards by 1.6 percentage points (ppt) and 0.3 ppt, respectively, due to
more elevated near-term inflation compared to initially expected. The
upward revisions for 2023 and 2024 were driven mainly by the higherthan-expected inflation outturn in January 2023, following the sharp
uptick in the prices of housing rentals, electricity, and water rates as well
as key food items. The upward adjustment in the forecast path also
reflects the higher inflation nowcast for February 2023, higher global
crude oil prices, and faster GDP growth. These upside factors were offset
partly by the peso appreciation and the impact of the cumulative policy
rate adjustments of the BSP.

|Baseline Inflation Forecasts|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
||15 December 2022 MB Meeting|16 February 2023 MB Meeting|
|2023|4.5|6.1|
|2024|2.8|3.1|



  - The risks to the inflation outlook now lean toward the upside for both 2023

and 2024. The potential impact of uncertainties in the global food market,
increased domestic prices of key food items facing supply constraints,
additional transport fare hikes due to elevated oil prices, and higher-thanexpected wage adjustments in 2023 are the major upside risks to the
inflation outlook. Meanwhile, the impact of a weaker-than-expected
global recovery is the primary downside risk to the outlook.

**D. Demand conditions**

  - The outlook for domestic economic activity remains strong for 2023 and

2024 despite global headwinds and the BSP’s policy adjustments. An
improved global growth outlook for 2023 together with the higher-thananticipated domestic growth in Q4 2022 resulted in an upward revision in
the domestic growth forecast for 2023 which is now expected to settle near
the high end of DBCC’s target.[2].

  - Domestic labor market conditions continued to show overall

improvement. While the 4.3-percent unemployment rate in December
2022 was marginally higher than the 4.2 percent unemployment rate in
November 2022, unemployment rate during the month was considerably
lower than the 6.6 percent and 5.3 percent rates recorded a year ago and
during the pre-pandemic period, respectively.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - Nationwide average retail rice prices increased in December 2022. The

uptick in average rice prices in December 2022 could be attributed to the
lingering impact of agricultural damages and losses left by strong
typhoons that hit the country during the main harvest season.

  - Prices of key food items rose mainly due to lingering supply-side issues and

spillover effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict leading to persistent global
supply chain bottlenecks and soaring prices of fuel, feeds, and fertilizers.
Likewise, increasing food inflation highlights the country’s vulnerability to
natural calamities, animal diseases, and volatility in global commodity
prices. It also exposes gaps in the agricultural value chain as well as
indicate non-competitive practices. To cushion the impact of these
challenges on the country’s food security, the Government implemented

crucial non-monetary measures to fill short-term supply gap (e.g.,
temporary reduction of tariff rates and time-bound increase in import
volumes and expansion of import sources) and boost local production (e.g.,
longer-term productivity-enhancing programs).

  - Based on the latest assessment of weather conditions as of

12 January 2023, prevailing La Niña conditions will likely transition to
El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-neutral during the February-MarchApril 2023 season. Nonetheless, persisting La Niña conditions may
continue to bring above normal rainfall conditions that could lead to
potential adverse impacts such as heavy rainfall, floods, flashfloods and
landslides, which were observed in some parts of the country over the past
weeks.

Oil Price Developments

  - Dubai crude oil prices rose in January 2023 compared to the previous

month but has since eased to below US$80 per barrel in early February. On
average, Dubai crude oil prices rose in January 2023 due to expectations of
improved oil demand prospects amid easing of COVID-19 restrictions in
China. This was further supported by expectations of more mobility and
travel activity in observance of the Lunar New Year. Prices started to ease
around late January and early February following the decision of the US
Federal Reserve to raise its key policy interest rate by to combat inflation,
concerns that higher interest rates could weigh down on global growth
prospects, and expectations of sustained oil exports from Russia.

  - Meanwhile, global oil supply-demand balance remained highly uncertain

albeit industry projections show some inventory buildup in 2023 and 2024.[3]
The US Energy Information Administration’s (EIA’s) latest projection, as of
February 2023, already considers higher oil demand from China with the
rebound in activity, higher oil production from Russia—two of the main
sources of uncertainty. At the same time, projections of Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries+ (OPEC+) output were also revised
downward given the rise in global inventory.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

  - The overall electricity rate slightly decreased in February 2023 due mainly

to lower generation charge. According to Meralco, the generation charge
decreased due to the lower costs from the Wholesale Electricity Spot
Market (WESM) and Independent Power Producers (IPPs), which
effectively offset the increase in charges from Meralco’s Power Supply
Agreements (PSAs). At the same time, the remaining distribution-related
refund continue to temper the monthly Meralco bills.

**F. Financial market developments**

-----

- The peso appreciated against the US dollar, on a year-to-date basis, by

2.36 percent on 27 January 2023 from the end-December 2022 closing rate.
The appreciation is due partly to market expectations of a slower pace of
monetary policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve, following reports of
weaker-than-expected US wages and services activity, and lower US CPI
inflation in December. The increase in the gross international reserves
(GIR) as of end-December 2022 and optimism over the country’s economic
growth prospect, as the Philippines is expected to be one of the fastinggrowing economies in the region in 2023, likewise added support to the
peso.

- The Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSEi) averaged 6,909.5 index points

in January, higher by 5.4 percent compared to its average in December.
The rise in the benchmark index could be attributed to: (1) improved local
manufacturing activity in December; (2) expectation of less aggressive
monetary policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve amid improvement
in US labor data and moderation in US inflation in December ; and (3) the
strengthening of the peso.

**G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions**

- Domestic liquidity (M3) and credit remain ample to sustain a broad-based

economic recovery. Preliminary data show that M3 grew by 6.4 percent
y-o-y to about ₱16.3 trillion in December from the 5.5-percent (revised)
growth in November. Meanwhile, preliminary data on outstanding loans of
universal and commercial banks (U/KBs) for production and consumption
activities rose by 12.1 percent in December (from 12.6 percent in November)
and 24.8 percent (from 24.2 (revised)), respectively.

- Secondary market GS yields generally declined on 6 February 2023

particularly in the middle and long-end of the yield curve. Yields fell
following the widely anticipated policy rate hike of the US Fed and the
announcement of the retail Treasury bond (RTB) offering by the Bureau of
the Treasury (BTr). The decline in yields was also supported by market
players’ buying interest on expectation that the BSP is nearing the end of
its monetary tightening cycle.

**H.  Fiscal developments**

- Fiscal consolidation continued as the National Government (NG) recorded

a deficit of P1,1111.8 billion for January - October 2022, 7.6 percent lower than
recorded in the same period in 2021. Netting out the interest payments,
the primary deficit amounted to P678.7 billion, 18.5 percent lower than the
amount recorded in 2021.

**I.  External developments**

on global output growth but global interest rates are likely to remain

higher given sticky CPI. The World Bank (WB) downgraded both its 2023
and 2024 growth outlook as tightening global financial conditions and
protracted geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe weigh on global
economic output. Meanwhile, in its January 2023 World Economic Outlook
(WEO) Update, the IMF upgraded its full-year economic growth projection
for 2023 but revised downwards its forecast for 2024. Although adverse
risks have moderated since October 2022, risks to the outlook remain
firmly tilted toward the downside

- Global economic activity contracted slower in January 2023 as output, new

business, new export orders, and outstanding business declined at a more
moderate pace amid improving economies conditions in parts of Europe
and Asia. However, major economies such as the United States, United
Kingdom, Russia, Australia, Germany, France, Australia, and Kazakhstan
posted lower economic output, which weighed on overall global growth.

- Global economic output contracts for the sixth consecutive month. The JP

Morgan All-Industry Output Index contracted at a slower pace at 49.8 in
January 2023 from 48.2 in December 2022 as new business moved closer
to a stable level, driven by a rebound in the services sector. Despite the
continued decline in output and new business, more respondents expect
future output to increase in the next 12 months as low unemployment,
rising nominal wages, and China’s continued reopening prop up global
demand. However, prolonged geopolitical risks, elevated inflation, and
rising interest rates are expected to weigh on private demand in the
succeeding quarters.

- Several central banks have raised their respective key policy rates in

February to address price pressures and anchor inflation expectations.
