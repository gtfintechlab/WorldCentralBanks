**_HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON THE_**

**_MONETARY POLICY STANCE HELD ON 14 DECEMBER 2023 [1]_**

**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board decided to:

a) Maintain the current policy interest rate at 6.50 percent for the Target

RRP Rate; and

b) Maintain the current interest rates on the overnight deposit facility at

6.00 percent and overnight lending facility at 7.00 percent.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

       - Based on new information and its latest assessment of the impact of prior

monetary policy adjustments, the Monetary Board decided to maintain
the current monetary policy settings of the BSP. The Monetary Board
deemed it necessary to keep monetary policy settings sufficiently tight to
allow inflation expectations to settle more firmly within the Government’s
target range.

       - The latest risk-adjusted inflation forecast for 2024 has declined to 4.2

percent from 4.4 percent in the previous meeting in November. For 2025,
the risk-adjusted inflation forecast was unchanged at 3.4 percent. The
balance of risks to the inflation outlook also remained significantly skewed
to the upside from 2023 through 2025.

       - On domestic economic activity, the Monetary Board noted that the

country's medium-term growth prospects remained firm as easing price
pressures, improving real wages, and more favorable global economic
growth prospects offset the impact of the higher real policy interest rate
and El Niño weather conditions on domestic output.

       - The Monetary Board emphasized the need to maintain adequately tight

monetary policy settings until inflation expectations were firmly anchored
and inflation has reverted to the target range. In this regard, the Monetary
Board continues to closely monitor the impact of previous monetary policy
adjustments on inflation, inflation expectations, and overall economic
activity. Should inflation risks further escalate, the Monetary Board stands
ready to adjust monetary policy settings as necessary to steer inflation
toward a path consistent with the BSP’s price stability mandate.

1 The discussions herein reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on macroeconomic and financial

information available at the time of the monetary policy meeting. The next meeting of the Monetary Board on the

**III.** **Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook**

In assessing the monetary policy stance, the Monetary Board considered

the latest macroeconomic and financial developments as discussed below:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Headline inflation slowed further to 4.1 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in

November 2023 from 4.9 percent in October 2023 and 8.0 percent in
November 2022. The downtrend in overall inflation was due mainly to the
slower price increases in heavily weighted food and non-alcoholic
beverages amid the slower price increases in vegetables, tubers, and
plantains, among others. The decline in transport inflation resulting from
lower domestic pump prices as well as the deceleration in the price
increases for restaurants and accommodation services further contributed
to the moderation in overall inflation. In addition, the official core inflation
rate further slowed down to 4.7 percent in November 2023 from 5.3
percent in October 2023. Alternative measures of core inflation including
trimmed mean and weighted median likewise declined.

**B.  Inflation expectations**

  - Results of the BSP’s survey of external forecasters for December 2023

showed a lower mean inflation forecast for 2023 of 6.0 percent from 6.1
percent in the November 2023 survey round. Likewise, the mean inflation
forecast for 2024 declined further to 3.9 percent from 4.0 percent. By
contrast, the mean inflation forecast for 2025 rose marginally to 3.5 percent
from 3.4 percent. Analysts expected inflation to remain elevated in the
succeeding months but gradually ease toward the target range in 2024,
particularly as base effects manifest and as the BSP’s policy actions
continue to work their way in curbing inflation. Risks to the inflation
outlook are likewise seen to continue leaning toward the upside due
mainly to supply-side factors and second-round effects.

**C.  Inflation outlook**

  - The latest staff risk-adjusted inflation forecasts for 2023 to 2024 are lower

compared to the previous round, while continuing to indicate a potential
breach of the target in 2024. The risk-adjusted inflation is projected to
average at 6.0 percent for 2023 (from 6.1 percent), 4.2 percent for 2024
(from 4.4 percent), and 3.4 percent for 2025 (unchanged from the previous
forecast round). The downward revisions in the forecasts were driven by
the lower-than-expected inflation outturn in November, decline in world
crude oil prices, and peso appreciation, which offset the inflationary impact
of stronger-than-expected domestic economic activity, minimum wage
adjustments in areas outside NCR (AONCR), and strong El Niño weather
conditions.


-----

  - The risks to the inflation outlook remain significantly skewed to the upside

over the policy horizon. Transport charges may further increase given
pending fare hike petitions particularly for jeepneys, taxis, and the Metro
Rail Transit system. In addition, electricity rates could increase in 2024
following the Supreme Court decision in July 2022 to nullify the Energy
Regulatory Commission’s 2014 order to cap Wholesale Electricity Spot
Market prices in November to December 2013.

Other key upside risks to the inflation outlook for 2024 include the higher
global oil prices stemming from possible oil supply disruptions from the
Israel-Hamas conflict; higher-than-expected minimum wage adjustment
in AONCR; higher prices of key commodities due to the non-extension of
E.O. 10, s. 2022; the additional impact of a strong El Niño episode on food
prices and utility rates; and higher domestic food prices due to supply
constraints. Meanwhile, the impact of a weaker-than-expected global
recovery and successful implementation of government measures to
mitigate the impact of El Niño weather conditions are the primary
downside risks to the outlook.

**D. Demand conditions**

  - The Philippine economy grew stronger than expected at 5.9 percent in Q3

2023, faster than the 4.3 percent growth in the previous quarter following
increased private and public spending. This brought the year-to-date real
GDP growth to 5.5 percent. Recent indicators likewise affirm the view of a
stronger recovery in the near term. Labor market conditions have
remained generally stable compared to the previous month, with the
higher share of wage and salaried workers and the decline in
underemployment signaling an improvement in employment quality. In
addition, the sustained growth in vehicle sales in October likewise
suggested that private consumption remained relatively firm despite
tighter financial conditions.

  - The country’s growth prospects remain intact for 2023 to 2025 despite

global headwinds and tighter financial conditions. Full-year growth
estimates for 2023 to 2025 have been adjusted upwards from the previous
forecast round, reflecting the faster-than-expected growth outturn in Q3
2023, supported by strong private and public spending, improved labor
conditions, and sustained remittances from overseas Filipinos. However,
GDP growth could settle below the Development Budget Coordination
Committee’s target[2] from 2023 to 2025 as subdued global economic
conditions and the lagged impact of the policy rate adjustments weigh on
economic activity.

**E. Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

2 Government growth targets based on the 185th Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) Meeting on 9
June 2023. The DBCC forecasts the economy to grow by 6.0-7.0 percent in 2023 and by 6.5-8.0 percent in 2024 as well as
2025


-----

- Nationwide average retail rice prices increased in November 2023 after

falling during the start of the peak harvest season in October 2023. Average
rice prices increased anew with the end of the harvest season as local
traders bid up prices to ensure adequacy of their stocks amid the potential
impact of El Niño until the next harvest season as well as the recent uptick
in international prices. In particular, export quotes for Vietnam 5% broken
rice averaged 6.1 percent higher in November than the previous month as
traders executed previously contracted deals amid tightening supply.

- Based on the latest assessment of weather conditions as of 9 November

2023, prevailing El Niño conditions will likely continue through the
northern hemisphere spring months from April to June 2024. According to
PAGASA’s latest climate outlook as of 22 November 2023, strong El Niño is
present and may further strengthen toward end-2023 and early part of
2024 as sea surface temperature anomalies reach more than 1.5⁰C. In
addition, most climate models predict that current El Niño episode will
likely persist until Q2 2024.

Oil Price Developments

- Dubai crude oil prices declined in the first week of December 2023

compared to the full-month average price in November 2023. The decline
in prices may be attributed to concerns about oil demand as the impact of
tight financial conditions and weak global manufacturing activity more
than offset the voluntary oil output cuts agreed by OPEC+ for Q1 2024.
Uncertainty in the extent and duration of the OPEC+ voluntary oil output
reductions also contributed to the decline in global oil prices. However,
upside risks associated with potential oil supply disruptions persist amid
the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas as well as the recent
attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on several commercial ships in the Red
Sea.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

- Retail electricity rates went up in November 2023, reflecting higher

transmission charges following a significant increase in the National Grid
Corporation of the Philippines’ ancillary service charge for regulating
reserves. In addition, generation charge and other charges also rose during
the month due to higher charges from the Wholesale Electricity Spot
Market (WESM) and Independent Power Producers (IPPs). Tight supply
conditions in the Luzon grid pushed WESM charges upward while the
increase in price of Malampaya natural gas following its quarterly repricing
led to the rise in IPP charges.

**F.  Financial market developments**

- The peso strengthened in early December 2023 amid dovish remarks from

the US Federal Reserve signaling a possible pause in monetary policy
tightening The peso was also supported by positive domestic


-----

developments, including affirmation from S&P Global of the country’s
investment credit rating with a “stable” outlook, a narrower budget deficit
in October 2023, and the BSP’s remarks that monetary policy settings are
likely to remain sufficiently tight for some time. However, market
sentiment was partly tempered by uncertainty in the global oil market
amid the voluntary oil production cuts from OPEC+ and ongoing
geopolitical tensions in the West Philippine Sea.

- On a year-to-date basis, the peso closed at ₱55.31/US$1 on 6 December,

appreciating by 0.81 percent against the US dollar from the end-December
2022 closing rate of ₱55.76/US$.

**G. Liquidity and credit conditions**

- Preliminary data showed that domestic liquidity (M3) grew by 8.2 percent

y-o-y in October, unchanged from the growth rate recorded in September.
Meanwhile, outstanding loans of universal and commercial banks, net of
RRP placements with the BSP increased by 7.1 percent y-o-y in October,
faster than the 6.5-percent expansion in September.

**H. Fiscal developments**

- Government catch-up spending was evident in January-October 2023 as

overall National Government (NG) expenditures increased to 81.1 percent
of the full-year (FY) 2023 expenditure program from only 73.1 percent in
January-September 2023. NG spending also expanded by 4.5 percent y-oy in January-October 2023. The catch-up in NG spending was driven mainly
by the combined spending for personnel services (PS), maintenance and
other operating expenses (MOOE), and infrastructure and other capital
outlays (IOCO). NG disbursements for PS, MOOE, and IOCO grew by 10.7
percent in January-October 2023 following the improved spending
performance of government agencies such as the Department of Public
Works and Highways; Department of Transportation; Department of
Health; Department of Social Welfare and Development; Department of
Agriculture; and Department of National Defense.

- Meanwhile, the NG deficit settled at ₱1,017.9 billion in January-October

2023, about 8.5 percent narrower than the deficit in the same period in
2022 and 67.9 percent of the FY 2023 deficit program. Netting out the
interest payments in NG expenditures, the primary deficit amounted to
₱498.8 billion, 26.5 percent lower than the deficit recorded in 2022.

**I.  External developments**

- Global economic activity resumed expansion as the improvement in

service sector activity offset the decrease in the production volume of the
manufacturing sector. The JP Morgan All-Industry Output Index rose to
50.4 in November from 50.0 in October as new order intakes supported a
moderate increase in output. Among the 14 countries included in the
survey conducted by S&P Global the fastest rates of expansion were seen


-----

in India and Russia, with increases also recorded in the US, China, the UK,
Brazil, and Ireland. Meanwhile, Japan, Germany, and France were among
the countries that posted contractions. Meanwhile, China’s real GDP
growth slowed to 4.9 percent in Q3 2023 from 6.3 percent in the previous
quarter due to the contraction in construction; wholesale and retail trade;
accommodation and catering; leasing and businesses services; and
information transmission, among others. ASEAN manufacturing

conditions stabilized in November, with the PMI improving to 50.0 from
49.6 in October.
