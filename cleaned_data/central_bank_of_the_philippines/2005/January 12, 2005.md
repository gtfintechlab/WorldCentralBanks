## HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON
 MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 13 JANUARY 2005*


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current uniform rates of 6.75
percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.0 percent for
the overnight RP (lending) rate;

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
Special Deposit Accounts (SDAs); and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

2) Continue to articulate support for the use of non-monetary measures to
address supply-side risks, particularly those relating to food supply, by
strengthening the BSP’s representation and coordination with various
government agencies.

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The above recommendations were based on the following
considerations:

� Both the 1994- and 2000-based headline inflation series continued their
uptrend in December 2004. In line with expectations, the full-year 2004
average inflation reached 5.5 percent (1994=100), exceeding the 4–5
percent target for 2004, and 6.0 percent (2000=100).

� Core inflation (defined as headline inflation excluding selected food and
energy products) also edged higher in December 2004. Full-year core

- The highlights of the discussions of the 13 January 2005 Monetary Board meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its meeting held on 10 February 2005.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely: the Deputy Governor for the Banking Services Sector, Research and Treasury, the Deputy
Governor for Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor, In-Charge of Research and
the Director of the Treasury Department.

inflation was registered at 5.5 percent (1994=based) and 5.7 percent
(2000=100).

� The inflation uptrend and the consequent increase in the average annual
inflation above the 4-5 percent target in 2004 may be characterized as a
predominantly supply-side phenomenon.

� Forecasts generated by the BSP’s inflation forecasting models show that
inflation will likely begin to decelerate in the first quarter of 2005 and fall
further to the 4-5 percent range in 2006.

� Although data on consumption and manufacturing activity continued to
show positive trends, other indicators pointed to soft spots in the
economy.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing rose slightly to 80.1
percent in October 2004 from 79.9 percent (revised) in September
and 78.7 percent a year ago.

� The value of production index (VAPI) for manufacturing increased by
14.8 percent (revised) in October from a 13.4 percent (revised)
growth in the previous month. Meanwhile, the growth in volume of
production index (VOPI) for manufacturing decelerated to 4.9 percent
(revised) year-on-year in October, from a 6.6 percent (revised)
increase in September.

� The country’s major corporations posted strong revenue and profit
growth in the first nine months of 2004. However, some firms
registered marked slowdown in their third quarter income growth from
the previous two quarters’ outturn.

� Exports grew at an annual pace of 19.5 percent in November, the
fastest since July 2002 when it registered 24.2 percent. This brought
the January-November 2004 annual exports growth to 9.9 percent.

� Merchandise imports grew by 16.3 percent year-on-year in October
from 14.8 percent in September. For the January to October 2004
period, the cumulative annual growth of imports stood at 8.8 percent.

� Passenger car sales declined by 0.8 percent year-on-year in
November, from zero growth in October as reported by the Chamber
of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines, Inc. (CAMPI). This
also represented a significant downturn compared to the 53.2 percent
annual growth in November 2003. Meanwhile, the combined truck
and bus sales posted an 8.7 percent year-on-year growth in October,
a reversal from the 7.8 percent dip in September.

� Energy sales by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) declined by
0.2 percent year-on-year in November 2004, a reversal from the 8.0
percent increase in the previous month and 3.6 percent expansion in
November 2003.

� Unemployment rate remained relatively sizeable at 10.9 percent in
October 2004 from the 10.2 percent registered for the comparable
period in the previous year. The October unemployment rate,
however, was lower than the 11.7 percent posted in July 2004. This is
still considerably higher than 7.4 percent, the lowest unemployment
rate recorded during the peak growth years 1993-1996.

� Money and credit demand continued to post modest growth while
nominal RP interest rates increased during the 3 January 2005 auction of
the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) relative to the previous auction, leading
to narrower spreads over foreign interest rates.

� Domestic liquidity (M3) grew by 6.9 percent (revised) year-on-year in
November from the 6.2 percent (revised) rise recorded in the
previous month.

� The total volume of commercial bank (KB) loans rose by 3.6 percent
year-on-year as of end-October 2004. This was a slight improvement
over the 1.9 percent increase in the previous month.

� Relative to the 6 December 2004 auction, T-bill rates increased
across all tenors during the 3 January 2005 auction. The increase in
yields reflected expectations of higher inflation as well as banks’
weak appetite for government securities as they remained cautious
over the increase in the BTr’s offering from P11.0 billion to P15.0
billion and the possibility that the BSP might raise its policy rates.

� Supply-side factors would likely continue to exert the central influence on
the inflation outlook, particularly the volatility in global oil prices. In
addition, the forecasted reduction in agricultural production in the first
quarter of 2005—with the onset of a weak El Niño—poses an upside risk
to food prices.

� Agricultural output grew by 6.8 percent in the first nine months of
2004, an improvement from the 2.9 percent growth posted for the
comparable period a year ago and the highest since 2000. However,
the onset of a weak El Niño episode poses upside risks to food
prices, and highlights the importance of timely intervention measures
to limit adverse impact of the said weather disturbance.

� Dubai crude oil price declined slightly in December 2004 following the
build-up in world crude oil stocks and mild weather conditions in the

Northern Hemisphere. Consequently, pump prices of petroleum
products in the domestic market eased in December 2004, reflecting
the decline in world oil prices. However, in early January 2005, some
increases in both the spot price of Dubai crude oil and the futures
price of Brent crude oil were observed.

� The peso strengthened on the back of seasonally strong dollar inflows
from OFW remittances during the holiday season and the relative
weakness of the dollar in regional currency markets.

� In the fiscal sector, the National Government’s (NG’s) budget deficit in
November 2004 widened to P12.5 billion, higher than the deficit level
registered in the comparable month last year of P8.3 billion. However,
the January-November 2004 NG budget deficit of P160.2 billion, was 7
percent lower than the figure recorded in the same period a year ago,
providing indication that the full-year fiscal deficit would be within the
NG’s program.

� Global economy continued to show sustained but moderating growth as
industrial production and private consumption appeared to have slowed
down in most economies. Stronger inflationary pressures are expected
to persist over the short term owing to the volatility in world oil prices, but
the medium-term outlook remains in line with price stability.

� The US economy continued its solid recovery as shown by the
resilient consumer spending and robust expansion of business
investment. However, the mounting budget and current account
deficit could dampen prospects for sustained economic growth.

� Economic growth in the euro area slowed down slightly in the third
quarter on weaker export gains and subdued private consumption
alongside the observed slowdown in production growth in the
industries and services sector.

� UK economic growth moderated in the third quarter of 2004 on
account of a decline in investment alongside flat consumption growth
and cooling property market.

� Japan’s economic recovery remained on track despite weak
movements in industrial production and exports. This was supported
by the growth in business investment and improvement in private
consumption.

� The majority of central banks kept their policy settings unchanged during
their latest respective monetary policy meetings. However, some, like the
US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the Bank of Thailand

(BOT) raised policy rates by 25 basis points, citing uptrend in inflation
and tight labor market conditions.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� The Monetary Board noted that under the inflation targeting approach,
the monetary assessment process focuses primarily on forecasted
inflation rather than contemporaneous inflation in order to ensure that the
monetary policy stance has a forward-looking orientation at all times.

� Recognizing the time lag required for monetary policy decisions to take
full effect (currently estimated at 15–21 months), the Monetary Board
noted that monetary actions undertaken at this point will primarily affect
inflation in 2006 and may only have a minimal impact in 2005 inflation.
The members of the Monetary Board, therefore, agreed that prospective
decisions should be oriented toward safeguarding the 2006 inflation
target.

� The members of the Monetary Board also noted the latest staff forecasts
showing a declining trend for inflation over the next few quarters. With
some easing of international oil prices from peak levels in 2004, latest
forecasts indicate that inflation would settle below 5.0 percent in the last
quarter of 2005. The 2006 average inflation is expected to be within the
4-5 percent range (2000=100).

� In addition, the Monetary Board decided to propose an adjustment of the
2005 inflation target to the Development Budget Coordination Committee
(DBCC). The members of the Monetary Board also emphasized that the
proposed adjustment in the 2005 target is intended mainly to reflect the
dynamics of the new inflation data series. In particular, the Monetary
Board noted that the 2000 CPI inflation series are higher than the1994
series. In addition, a revision of the 2005 inflation target takes into
account the additional risks on prices that have emerged since the target
was originally set in 2004.

� The members of the Monetary Board pointed out that monetary policy
action may be undertaken when the available evidence begins to point
more strongly to the following conditions: (1) emergence of demand-side
pressures on consumer prices; (2) emergence of inflationary pressures
that are over and above those generated by ongoing supply shocks; and
(3) increased risk of possible exchange rate market pressures arising
from narrowing interest rate differentials which could feed into inflation
and inflation expectations.

� The members of the Monetary Board were of the view that the outlook for
inflation and other economic evidence support keeping present policy

settings unchanged, accompanied by a continued readiness to undertake
any necessary policy action ahead of time against inflation pressures.

� Furthermore, the Monetary Board emphasized the need for the BSP to
continue supporting measures being undertaken by the Department of
Agriculture (DA) to mitigate the negative impact on agricultural production
as well as the steps to rehabilitate the typhoon-damaged areas. These
intervention measures would help ensure adequate food supply and
temper the potential inflationary impact of the El Niño weather
disturbance.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

� Upon assessment of the balance of risks to inflation and the evidence
that has become available since its previous meeting on monetary policy,
the Monetary Board approved unanimously the following measures:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current uniform rates of
6.75 percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.0
percent for the overnight RP (lending) rate;

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

3) Continue to articulate support for the use of non-monetary measures
to address supply-side risks, particularly those relating to food supply,
by strengthening the BSP’s representation and coordination with
various government agencies.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting is scheduled on 10 February 2005.
