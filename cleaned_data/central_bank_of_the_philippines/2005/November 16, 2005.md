**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON**

**MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 17 NOVEMBER 2005***


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight RP
(lending) rate; and

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs and RPs.

2) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios;

3) Reprice the Special Deposit Account (SDA) to make it more competitive
by offering a premium over current SDA rates; and

4) Continue to articulate support for the use of non-monetary measures to
address supply-side risks, particularly those related to food supply and oil,
by strengthening representation and coordination with various government
agencies.

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The Advisory Committee’s recommendations were based on the
following considerations:

- Headline inflation was unchanged at 7.0 percent in October, which
brought the year-to-date average inflation to 7.9 percent. Core inflation
maintained its decelerating trend, indicating a continued absence of
demand-side pressures on consumer prices. These price developments
are in accordance with BSP’s expectations of easing price pressures for
the remaining months of 2005.

- The highlights of the discussions of the 17 November 2005 Monetary Board meeting were approved by
the Monetary Board during its meeting held on 15 December 2005.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely: the Deputy Governor for the Monetary Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor for Supervision and
Examination Sector, the Managing Director of the Treasury Department, and the Director of the
Department of Economic Research.

- Food and energy items continued to account for more than half of the
October inflation rate: food accounted for 2.7 percentage points; fuel, light
and water (FLW), 1.2 percentage points; and transport and
communication (which includes gasoline and diesel), 1.2 percentage
points.

- Inflation pressures will continue to be driven by movements in
international oil prices while the implementation of the Reformed Value
Added Tax (RVAT) law will also likely yield a short-lived but significant
impact on prices. The continued rapid growth in domestic liquidity and
potential shifts in the public’s inflation expectations remain a risk to
inflation.

- Selected indicators showed some improvements in demand, but evidence
of resource slack remains.

��Average capacity utilization in manufacturing increased slightly to 80.3
percent in August 2005 from 80.2 percent in the previous month.

��The value of production index (VAPI) for manufacturing rose by 20.4
percent year-on-year in August, higher than the revised July growth
rate of 12.3 percent. The volume of production index (VOPI) climbed
by 7.3 percent year-on-year in August from 0.6 percent in July.

��Preliminary data show that merchandise exports declined by 1.2
percent year-on-year in September. This was traced to softening
foreign demand for electronics exports, which decreased by 2.1
percent and accounted for 67.3 percent of the aggregate export
revenue in September.

��Merchandise imports increased by 10.1 percent year-on-year in
August, a turnaround from the 3.1 percent contraction in the previous
month. Imports of mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials,
which comprised 16.2 percent of aggregate imports, posted a 55.2
percent increase in August due to higher world prices and volume of
imported fuel, diesel and fuel oil.

��The country’s major corporations posted strong revenue growth for the
first six months of 2005. Net income results were mixed, however, as
some firms reported slower profit growth.

��Property values rose while vacancy rates declined during the second
quarter, based on estimates by Colliers International Research.

��The year-on-year growth in passenger car sales in September
declined by 0.9 percent, a reversal from the 22.1 percent rise in the

��Energy sales by the Manila Electric Company decelerated by 0.1
percent year-on-year in September, as the increase in commercial
energy consumption failed to offset the slowdown in the consumption
of residential and industrial users.

��Appliance sales fell for the 10[th] straight month since December 2004,
declining by 14.3 percent year-on-year in September. This was a
slight improvement from the previous month’s 17.9 percent fall and a
reversal of the previous year’s 8.2 percent expansion.

��The unemployment rate declined to 10.9 percent in July 2005 from
11.7 percent a year ago and 12.7 percent in April 2005, using the old
definition of unemployment. Based on the new definition of
unemployment, the jobless rate declined to 7.7 percent in July from
8.3 percent in April.[ 2]

��The third quarter 2005 BSP Business Expectations Survey showed
that business optimism in the third quarter declined, but firms
expected conditions to improve in the fourth quarter. The latest
Consumer Expectations Survey showed weaker consumer outlook for
the third and fourth quarters of 2005.

- Agriculture output grew by 1.3 percent in the first half of 2005, lower than
the 6.4 percent increase recorded a year ago as the El Niño-induced
drought affected adversely the production of major crops such as rice and
corn.

- World oil prices eased in early November as demand for expensive oil
weakened and as cold weather conditions in the Northern Hemisphere
turned out to be milder than expected. However, tight spare capacity
remains a major risk factor in the outlook for oil prices. In the domestic
market, pump prices of oil products rose on 1 November 2005 alongside
the implementation of the RVAT law.

- In the financial sector, the growth in domestic liquidity and bank lending
decelerated. Meanwhile, Treasury bill (T-bill) rates continued to decline
during the 10 October 2005 auction.

## ��������������������������������������������
2 Beginning in April 2005, the new Labor Force Survey (LFS) questionnaire was used to estimate the
number of unemployed, which included all persons who were 15 years old and over as of their last birthday
and were reported as without work, currently available for work, and seeking work or not seeking work due
to valid reasons. The old definition of unemployment did not consider the availability criterion.

��Based on preliminary Depository Corporations Survey (DCS) data,
growth in domestic liquidity (M3) decelerated to 14.8 percent year-onyear in September from 15.0 percent in August.[ 3]

��Outstanding loans of commercial banks (KBs) grew by 0.5 percent
year-on-year to P1.505 trillion as of end-September 2005. This was
lower than the 3.3 percent growth in August.

��Relative to the 10 October 2005 auction, the T-bill rates for the 91day, 182-day and 364-day tenors declined during the 14 November
2005 auction. Relative to the 7 November 2005 auction, T-bill rates
eased further by 20.8 basis points, 11.4 basis points and 10.2 basis
points, respectively. Treasury bill rates continued to ease due to
ample liquidity and market optimism concerning fiscal performance
with the implementation of the RVAT law.

- The peso appreciated in early November, supported by sustained dollar
inflows from overseas remittances, which posted a 28-percent increase
from the same period last year. Sentiment was further boosted by positive
market reaction to the implementation of the RVAT law.

- The NG recorded a P27.7 billion fiscal deficit in September, 10.3 percent
lower than the year-ago deficit. Revenue collections rose by 9.9 percent
while expenditures grew by 2.6 percent. This brought the NG’s budget
deficit for the first nine months to P108.5 billion, which is P37.4 billion
below the programmed deficit for the period.

- Global economic expansion remained broadly on track in the third quarter
with the robust output performance of the services sector and the
moderate recovery of manufacturing activity in most major economies.
Meanwhile, the continued prospect of volatility in world oil prices has
weighed down on consumer sentiment despite generally favorable labor
market conditions.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

- The Monetary Board noted that there is evidence in favor of keeping
policy settings unchanged. The recent easing of foreign crude oil prices,
for example, and the appreciation of the peso imply reduced cost-push
pressures in the near term. There are also continuing soft spots in the

- However, the Monetary Board is of the view that risks to inflation remain
present and continue to necessitate the BSP’s readiness to respond
preemptively. In particular, growth in domestic liquidity, while showing
some easing, remains high despite recent increases in the key policy
rates and the reserve requirements.

- Potential shifts in the public’s inflation expectations also continue to be a
major policy concern, given the possibility of a sustained deviation from
the government targets until 2007. Deviations of actual inflation from the
target over a prolonged period pose a risk that the public may begin to
expect inflation to remain persistently well above the targets announced
by the Government.

- Looking ahead, therefore, the Monetary Board should continue to monitor
closely the evolving conditions for consumer prices, aggregate demand,
domestic liquidity and other factors in order to determine the appropriate
stance of monetary policy. The Monetary Board remains committed to the
BSP’s inflation objectives and stands ready to take the necessary action
to protect the Government’s inflation targets.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

- Upon assessment of the balance of risks to inflation and the evidence that
has become available since its previous meeting on monetary policy, the
Monetary Board unanimously approved the following measures:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the
overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight
RP (lending) rate; and

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs and RPs.

2) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios;

3) Reprice the SDA to make it more competitive by offering a premium
over current SDA rates;

4) Continue to articulate support for the use of non-monetary measures
to address supply-side risks, particularly those relating to food supply,
energy conservation, and the development of alternative energy
sources, by strengthening representation and coordination with
various government agencies; and

5) Intensify the BSP’s public information campaign with greater focus on
the dynamics and sources of price pressures in order to help guide
inflationary expectations.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting is scheduled on 15 December 2005.
