## HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON
 MONETARY POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 10 MARCH 2005*


The Advisory Committee[1] submitted the following recommendations
for the consideration of the Monetary Board:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current uniform rates of 6.75
percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.0 percent for the
overnight RP (lending) rate;

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
Special Deposit Accounts (SDAs); and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

2) Continue to articulate support for the use of non-monetary measures to
address supply-side risks, particularly those relating to food supply, by
strengthening the BSP’s representation and coordination with various
government agencies.

**I. Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy**
**Stance**

The above recommendations were based on the following
considerations:

� In line with expectations, headline inflation increased slightly to 8.5
percent year-on-year in February 2005 from 8.4 percent in January. This
was due to the higher inflation for food, beverage and tobacco (FBT),
housing and repairs (H&R) and miscellaneous items.

� Core inflation (defined as headline inflation excluding selected food and
energy products) likewise rose to 8.1 percent in February 2005 from 7.9
percent in the previous month.

- The highlights of the discussions of the 10 March 2005 Monetary Board meeting were approved by the
Monetary Board during its meeting held on 14 April 2005.
1 The Advisory Committee is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members,
namely: the Deputy Governor for the Monetary Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor for Supervision and
Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor, Monetary Policy Sub-Sector and the Acting Managing
Director of the Treasury Department.

� The risks to the inflation outlook continue to be linked primarily to supplyside factors particularly the volatile movements in world crude oil prices,
which could feed into the prices of other goods and services. However,
forecasts generated by the BSP’s inflation forecasting models indicated
that inflation will decelerate in the coming months and settle at around 5.0
percent by the fourth quarter of 2005. Average inflation is still expected to
exceed the full year target of 5.0-6.0 percent in 2005 but is projected to
fall within the target range of 4.0-5.0 percent in 2006.

� Selected indicators suggested improvements in domestic demand but
some evidence of resource slack remained. This supported the argument
that potential demand-side pressures on prices may still be limited at
present.

� Average capacity utilization in manufacturing remained relatively
steady at 79.9 percent in December 2004 from 80.0 percent (revised)
in November. This was also higher than the 78.4 percent posted in
December 2003.

� The growth in value of production index (VAPI) for manufacturing
decelerated slightly to 17.0 percent in December 2004 from 18.7
percent (revised) growth in the previous month. Likewise, the growth
in volume of production index (VOPI) for manufacturing slowed to 5.7
percent in December following an 8.1 percent (revised) increase in
November.

� Exports grew by 2.9 percent year-on-year in December 2004, the
slowest since November 2003. This also brought 2004 export growth
to 9.3 percent, lower than the 10.0 percent export growth target for the
year.

� Merchandise imports fell slightly by 0.9 percent year-on-year in
December 2004, the first decline in imports recorded in seven months.
Total merchandise imports for 2004 posted a 7.5 percent increase
from 2003.

� Passenger car sales registered a marginal growth of 0.1 percent yearon-year in January 2005 following a 9.7 percent decline in the
previous month. Sales of trucks and buses, meanwhile, fell further by
31.1 percent year-on-year in January from 4.6 percent in the previous
month.

� Energy sales by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) increased by
7.2 percent year-on-year in January 2005 from a slight decline of 0.2
percent in the previous month. This was also a reversal from the 7.6
percent contraction in same month last year.

� The unemployment rate remained relatively sizeable at 10.9 percent in
October 2004 compared to the 10.2 percent registered for the same
period in 2003. The October unemployment rate, however, was lower
than the 11.7 percent posted in the preceding quarter.

� In the financial sector, the growth in domestic liquidity accelerated. Bank
lending, however, remained sluggish. Meanwhile, Treasury bill rates
eased during the 28 February compared to their 31 January auction rates.

� Domestic liquidity (M3) grew by 9.2 percent (revised) year-on-year in
December 2004 from the 6.9 percent (revised) increase in the
previous month. Preliminary data for January 2005 showed that M3
based the Depository Corporations Survey (DCS) rose by 10.8
percent from 9.1 percent in the previous month.[2]

� The total volume of commercial bank (KB) loans grew by 2.6 percent
year-on-year as of end-December 2004, slower than the 3.6 percent
growth recorded in the previous month.

� T-bill rates eased across all tenors during the 28 February 2005
auction compared to their 31 January 2005 auction rates. The
downtrend was traced to the presence of ample liquidity in the system
amid improving market sentiment following the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF) decision to remove the Philippines from its list of noncooperative countries and territories (NCCTs) in the global fight
against money laundering.

� Supply-side factors, notably price fluctuations in the world oil market and
weather-induced pressures on agricultural food prices were expected to
remain the central influence on the path of inflation.

� Total agricultural production in 2004 accelerated despite the damages
on output caused by typhoons in the last two months of the year. For
2005, crop production is expected to be weak in the first quarter due
to the impact of the ongoing El Niño weather pattern but a rebound is
expected in the second quarter. This highlights the need for
government measures to prevent supply shortages.

� International oil prices again surged to new highs in early March as
the continued low temperature in the Northern Hemisphere fueled
stronger demand for heating oil. Similarly, domestic oil companies

Survey (DCS). The DCS, which replaces the Monetary Survey (MS) as the basis for measuring domestic
liquidity, features an expanded list of surveyed institutions that includes the BSP, commercial banks, thrift
banks, rural banks, non-stock savings and loan associations and non-banks with quasi-banking functions.

raised pump prices of petroleum products during the last week of
February.

� The peso extended gains against the US dollar, spurred by continued
inflows from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) remittances and offshore
investments as well as generally positive outlook on the domestic
economy

� In the fiscal sector, the National Government’s (NG) budget deficit in
January 2005 widened slightly by 2.4 percent to reach P16.5 billion, from
P16.1 billion in the same month last year owing to the 35 percent surge in
interest expenses. However, the actual deficit is only about a fifth of the
government’s P77.8 billion target for the first quarter, indicating that the
government forecast remained on track.

� Global economic expansion remained broadly on course in the fourth
quarter of 2004, supported by sustained gains in investment spending and
gradual improvements in labor market conditions. Industrial production
and export gains, however, appeared to have slowed down in most
economies, reflecting both a return to more sustainable pace of expansion
and the adverse impact of higher oil prices.

� Prospects for the US economy continued to look firmer but not
altogether risk-free given the uncertainty over the direction of world oil
prices, mounting budget and current account deficits, and uneven
gains in employment and earnings.

� Available information pointed to ongoing moderate growth in the euro
area in the fourth quarter of 2004. Labor market conditions remained
broadly stable while investment is expected to remain strong, boosted
by favorable financing conditions and improved corporate earnings.

� The UK economy grew at close to trend, boosted by the growth in
services and manufacturing in the fourth quarter of 2004. This was
further accompanied by solid growth in investment and public
consumption alongside a strong net trade position.

� The Japanese economy slid into recession as the economy contracted
further in the last three months of 2004 due to weak industrial
production and export growth, and subdued consumer spending.

� The US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) and the Bank of Thailand (BOT) raised policy rates by 25
basis points, citing uptrend in inflation and tight labor market conditions.
Meanwhile, the other major central banks kept their policy settings
unchanged during their respective monetary policy meetings.

**II. Review of the Monetary Policy Stance**

� The members of the Monetary Board noted that the outlook for inflation
continued to support the maintenance of present policy settings given that
inflation is expected to decline towards the target by 2006. Moreover,
expected price pressures over the two-year policy horizon continued to be
linked primarily to supply-side influences, particularly price fluctuations in
the world oil market and weather-induced pressures on agricultural food
prices.

� The members of the Monetary Board also noted that demand conditions
continued to indicate that the economy remains below full-employment or
full capacity. This is implied by the fact that credit demand remains
moderate despite its recent improvement, while the unemployment rate
remains well above its cyclical low of about 8 percent in the mid-1990s.

� The members of the Monetary Board were of the view that the main policy
concern for the near term will be the impact of continued supply-side
pressures—such as expectations of imported oil prices to remain high,
and potential impact of new tax measures—on wage- and price-setting
behavior.

## ? The Monetary Board likewise recognized that the possibility of exchange
market pressures arising from narrowing interest rate differentials and
other sources may also pose a threat to inflation and inflation
expectations. However, the prospect of a weak US dollar should provide
a countervailing influence on import prices.

## ? The Monetary Board pointed out that the BSP can guide the public’s
inflation expectations down without resorting to monetary tightening by
(1) disclosing its decelerating outlook for inflation; (2) pointing out the
muted evidence of second-round effects from supply shocks; and (3)
carefully explaining the basis for all policy decisions.

� In sum, the members of the Monetary Board agreed that present
monetary policy settings should be kept unchanged for the time being.
The necessity of monetary action remains low at present given the
prevailing outlook, but this may change depending on developments in
wages, cost-side variables, and any possible adverse movements in the
foreign exchange market.

� Nonetheless, the Monetary Board emphasized that should policy actions
indeed become necessary, such actions will be fairly restrained in order to
minimize the potential output consequences, and will be geared more
toward nudging inflation expectations in the right direction rather than
dampening demand-side impulses.

**III. Monetary Policy Decision**

� Upon assessment of the balance of risks to inflation and the evidence that
has become available since its previous meeting on monetary policy, the
Monetary Board approved unanimously the following measures:

1) Maintain the current monetary policy settings as follows:

(a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current uniform rates of 6.75
percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.0 percent for
the overnight RP (lending) rate;

(b) Maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and
SDAs; and

(c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

2) Continue to articulate support for the use of non-monetary measures
to address supply-side risks, particularly those relating to food supply,
by strengthening the BSP’s representation and coordination with
various government agencies.

The next meeting of the Monetary Board to discuss the monetary
policy setting is scheduled on 7 April 2005.
