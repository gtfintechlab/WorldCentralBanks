**HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY BOARD ON MONETARY**

**POLICY ISSUES HELD ON 8 SEPTEMBER 2011[1]**


**I.** **Monetary Policy Decision**

The Monetary Board (MB) decided to:

a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at 4.5 percent for the overnight RRP
(borrowing) rate and 6.5 percent for the overnight RP (lending) rate;

b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs, and special
deposit accounts (SDAs); and

c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.

**II.** **Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance**

  - The MB’s decision to maintain the policy rates is based on its assessment that
current monetary policy settings remain appropriate given a manageable
inflation environment and subdued economic outlook.  Latest baseline forecasts
continue to indicate that average annual inflation is likely to settle within the
3-5 percent target range for 2011-2013 while inflation expectations remain
firmly anchored given the moderating commodity prices and the recent string of
stable inflation rates. The growth of domestic output has moderated in the first
half of 2011 as external demand weakened and public spending was below
target.

  - The MB is of the view that the risks to the inflation outlook may be receding as
global inflationary pressures are expected to ease with the slowdown in the
recovery of advanced economies. Food prices have also remained tame with
favorable supply conditions in both domestic and international markets. The
abating price pressures give monetary authorities sufficient room to keep policy
rates on hold.

  - A pause in the policy stance allows for careful assessment of inflation risks amid
signs of sluggish global economic growth. The MB believes that the current

1 The discussions presented reflect the assessment made by the Monetary Board based on the information
available at the time of the policy meeting. A comprehensive set of economic information was provided by the
Technical Secretariat of the Advisory Committee (AC). The AC is composed of the Governor of the BSP as
Chairman and four members, namely: the Deputy Governor of the Monetary Stability Sector, the Deputy
Governor of the Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Sub-Sector,
and the Assistant Governor of the Treasury Department. The highlights of the discussions on the 8 September
2011 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular meeting held on 22 September 2011. The
next meeting of the Monetary Board on monetary policy issues is scheduled on 20 October 2011.

monetary policy stance remains in line with the need to safeguard price stability
and support sustained economic growth.

  - Nevertheless, the MB also noted that liquidity expansion and bank credit activity
continue to grow at a strong pace. Therefore, while emerging liquidity and
credit conditions could help promote economic activity, they should also
warrant close attention as they could stoke inflationary pressures going
forward.

**III.   Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook**

The MB considered the following developments in coming up with its policy
decision:

**A. Domestic price conditions**

  - Year-on-year headline inflation slowed down to 4.3 percent in August from
the July level of 4.6 percent, using the 2000-based Consumer Price Index (CPI)
series. Similarly, the new 2006-based CPI series showed a lower headline
inflation rate for August at 4.7 percent from 5.1 percent in July. Year-on-year
headline inflation decelerated in August driven mainly by lower inflation for
food, particularly sugar and vegetables. The drop in international oil prices,
which translated into reduced prices of domestic petroleum products, also
helped pull down inflation.

  - Using the 2000-based CPI series, core inflation, which excludes some food
and energy items to measure generalized price pressures, decreased to
3.4 percent in August 2011 compared with 3.7 percent in July 2011.

  - The MB, however, noted that inflation pressures are easing indicating
reduced risks of broad-based pressures. Inflation momentum has moderated
with both headline and core inflation slowing down on an annualized monthon-month deseasonalized basis. The year-to-date average at 4.3 percent
using the 2000 basket and 4.8 percent using the 2006 basket remain within
the Government's target range of 3-5 percent for 2011.

**B.  Inflation expectations**

  - Inflation expectations appear to be well contained and within the target band
for 2011-2013. Results of the BSP’s survey of private sector economists
showed lower and within-target inflation forecasts for 2011-2013 while
results of the Asia Pacific consensus forecast in August 2011 showed broadly
steady and within-target inflation forecast for 2011 and 2012. Meanwhile,
results of the Q3 2011 Business Expectations Survey (BES) indicated that
lower inflation is expected over the next 12 months.


-----

**C. Inflation outlook**

  - The latest baseline inflation projections are on a lower path relative to that
from the previous policy meeting, with average headline inflation rates for
2011-2013 projected to settle within the 3-5 percent inflation target range.
The downward adjustment in the forecast path could be attributed mainly to
the lower-than-projected inflation outturn for July and August 2011, slower
liquidity growth, lower domestic output expansion, and decline in global
growth. The slowdown in the forecasted liquidity growth reflects the impact
of the 2.0-percentage point increase in the reserve requirement and the 50basis point hike in the BSP’s policy rates since March.

  - The inflation outlook is also supported by the receding risks to inflation. Price
pressures are expected to ease in the near term as global inflationary
pressures are likely to be held back by a weaker global economic recovery.
Food prices have also remained subdued supported by favorable supply
conditions in both domestic and international markets. At the same time, the
sustained strengthening of the peso is likely to lead to lower prices of
imported commodities. However, monetary authorities continue to face
inflation risks from the volatility in oil prices. The upside risks to inflation also
include the impact of ample domestic liquidity, pending petitions for
electricity rate adjustments, and possible uptick in global rice prices.

**D.  Demand conditions**

  - GDP growth continued to decelerate in Q2 2011, driven by weaker external
demand and government underspending. Nevertheless, household
consumption and private construction continued to expand robustly,
indicating resilience and underlying strength in private demand.  However,
risks to domestic economic activity in the second half could be on the
downside if government spending remains unsupportive. Slower global
economic activity in the second half could also imply increased downside
risks for external demand. Taken together and considering strong global
headwinds to growth, this suggests that the balance of risks for output
conditions leans toward a slower pace of economic activity going forward.

**E.  Supply-side indicators**

Developments in Agriculture

  - Domestic agriculture supply conditions are more favorable as production
expanded robustly in Q2 2011. The recovery of the sector was driven mainly
by the strong growth of palay, corn and sugarcane. As a result, palay and corn
production in 2011 are expected to exceed their 2010 levels.


-----

  - Meanwhile, international prices of corn and wheat declined in July due to
improved supply conditions but the price of rice rose. In international rice
markets, the price of the benchmark Thai 100% B rice advanced further in
July due largely to expectations of an increase in the Thai government’s
purchase price of rice from local farmers.

Oil Price Developments

  - Oil prices increased in July on optimism that the US would be able to increase
its debt ceiling and eurozone leaders would succeed in convincing investors
that plans to contain the region’s debt crisis would be adequate. However, oil
prices dipped in August following Standard & Poor’s downgrade of the US
credit rating, which stoked concerns that the US economic slowdown would
worsen and cut fuel demand in the world’s largest energy-consuming nation.

Developments in the Utilities Sector

  - The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) has approved provisionally the
NPC-Small Power Utilities Group’s (NPC-SPUG) petition to recover through
the Universal Charge (UC) the shortfalls in the Missionary Electrification (ME)
subsidy for calendar years 2003 to 2009. The ERC directed all distribution
utilities and the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) to collect
UC-ME charge in the amount of P0.0709/kwh per month starting August
2011.

**F. Financial market developments**

Government Securities Market

  - During the 5 September auction, the interest rate for the 91-day, 182-day,
and 364-day T-bills declined by 54.1 basis points, 31.8 basis points, and
55.6 basis points, respectively, relative to previous auction levels. T-bill rates
dropped on the back of ample market liquidity, expectations of manageable
inflation, and anticipation that policy rates would be kept unchanged when
the Monetary Board meets on 8 September. Flight to safe assets, amid fears
of a new global recession, also supported the decline in T-bill rates. The
auction was oversubscribed, with total tenders reaching P42.8 billion or
around 4.8 times the total original offered amount of P9.0 billion.

  - On 31 August 2011, the Auction Committee awarded in full the P9.0 billion

re-issuance of 7-year T-bonds at 4.936 percent, which is 8.1 basis points
lower than the highest bid rate during the last auction for the same tenor.
The market was very liquid as indicated by the total tenders of P24.0 billion
against the P9.0 billion offering.


-----

- Although the secondary market yields and term spreads declined across all
tenors on 6 September 2011 relative to end-July 2011, the bigger decline in
the yields for shorter tenors led to a relatively steeper yield curve. Yields on
government securities in the secondary market were lower, driven by the
country’s sound economic fundamentals given the peso appreciation,
contained inflation, and recent Philippine credit rating upgrades, in addition
to the ample market liquidity. Shorter-dated instruments, however, declined
more significantly than longer-term instruments, reflecting the rush of
investors toward safe-haven, short-term assets in response to the heightened
level of uncertainty in financial markets. This was brought on by concerns
about the US and European fiscal health and growth prospects.

Stock Market

- The local bourse fell in August notwithstanding the surprising highs in early
August on expectations of healthy second-quarter corporate earnings, lower
fiscal deficit, and the easing of inflation in July. The Philippine Stock Exchange
index (PSEi) dropped on mounting evidence of a slowdown in global growth,
the impact of the US credit rating downgrade on global markets and the US
economy, ongoing eurozone debt troubles, and the pick-up in China’s
inflation.

Foreign Exchange

- In August, the peso strengthened amid heightened global risk aversion arising
from S&P’s downgrade of the US rating, the eurozone debt crisis, and
concerns over a subsequent global economic slowdown. The peso also
appreciated as most hedge funds took long positions on emerging Asian
currencies on optimism that the US debt stalemate has been resolved and
additional data showing strong economic growth in the region. However,
news on the National Government’s below-target revenue collection
tempered the peso’s further appreciation.

Global Bond and Credit Default Swap Spreads

- Debt spreads of most emerging market bonds widened to record highs in
August after S&P downgraded the US long-term credit rating to AA+. Spreads
further expanded following reports of Moody’s lowering of Japan’s sovereign
credit rating by one step to Aa3. Persistent worries over global economic
slowdown and euro zone’s fiscal crisis spurred flight from riskier emerging
market assets, increasing pressures for spreads to widen. Towards the end of
the month, however, spreads eased on positive speculation that the US Fed
would intervene to spur economic growth. As of end-August, the
EMBI+ Philippine spread and the Philippine 5-year sovereign CDS widened
against end-July levels.


-----

  - Nevertheless, it is important to note that the expansion in most of Asia’s CDS
spreads appeared to be muted compared with the sharp fallout in the Asian
equities markets. Such investors’ retreat from stocks towards less risky
assets, such as US Treasuries (which remained attractive as a safe-haven
instrument despite the recent downgrade), has driven the value of the global
bonds to record highs and has subsequently pushed bond yields to historic
lows. Against this trend, the widening in the EMBI spreads may be attributed
to the decline in US Treasury yields, apart from the rise in the risk premium
component from holding emerging market debt.

**G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions**

  - Domestic liquidity or M3 grew at a slower pace of 8.3 percent in July 2011
from 11.4 percent in June 2011. The steady expansion in net foreign assets
(NFA)—recorded at 17.5 percent in July—continued to fuel the expansion of
domestic liquidity. Net domestic assets (NDA), meanwhile, contracted further
by 6.3 percent in July due to the faster expansion in the net other items
account (which includes revaluation and capital and reserve accounts as well
as SDA placements of trust entities). By contrast, the growth in net domestic
credits continued to expand by 7.2 percent with credits extended to the
private sector expanding at a faster pace of 14.0 percent. This trend is in line
with the faster growth of bank lending to the productive sectors of the
economy. Meanwhile, credits extended to the public sector declined further
given the continued increase in NG deposits with the BSP and other banks
during the month.

  - Bank lending growth, net of banks' reverse repurchase (RRP) placements with
the BSP, accelerated in July to 19.1 percent from the previous month’s
expansion of 18.8 percent. The increase is the highest growth rate recorded
since April 2009. Commercial banks’ loans have been growing steadily at
double-digit growth rates since January 2011. The growth in loans for
production activities—which comprised more than four-fifths of commercial
banks' total loan portfolio— grew steadily at 20.5 percent in July. This was
driven largely by increased lending to electricity, gas and water (which grew
by 54.2 percent); real estate, renting and business services (23.3 percent),
and manufacturing (15.5 percent).

  - Corporate issuers also continue to tap the equity and bonds market. Capital
raising activities in the Philippine Stock Exchange reached P68 billion for the
period January-July 2011, P24 billion higher than last year’s level. Corporate
bond issuances for the same period also increased by almost P26 billion to
P142 billion.


-----

**H.  Fiscal developments**

  - The fiscal deficit in January-June 2011 was P17.2 billion, 91.2 percent lower

than the P196.7 billion deficit incurred during the same period last year. This
represents 11.3 percent of the P152.1 billion programmed deficit for Q1-Q2
2011. Revenue collections increased by 15.1 percent to P681.6 billion in
January-June 2011 compared to P592.1 billion in the same period last year
and accounted for 99.3 percent of the program amounting to P686.4 billion
for Q1-Q2 2011. Expenditures in January-June 2011 amounted to P698.9
billion, 11.4 percent lower than the disbursements in the same period in
2010, reaching 83.3 percent of the Q1-Q2 2011 program of P838.5 billion.

**I.  External developments**

  - Growth remains subdued in many advanced economies, while many
emerging economies are operating at close to full capacity. Global headline
inflation has continued to increase, mainly on account of higher inflation in
emerging economies where price pressures are clearly more pronounced due
to elevated commodity prices and strong domestic demand, while fiscal risks
have been complicating the task of rebalancing growth in most advanced
economies. In fact, the recent downgrade in US sovereign debt ratings
reflected increased global tail risks as a result of fiscal weaknesses and the
unsustainable debt levels in advanced economies. These developments
strengthen the need for a more well-defined medium-term fiscal policy
framework and the clear communication of fiscal policies in advanced
economies in order to limit the deterioration in global financing conditions.
