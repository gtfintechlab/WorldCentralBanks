**The Global Economy**

**Thailand’s trading partner economies continued to gain further traction in line with the**
**previous assessment.** **Advanced economies continued to expand mainly on the back of**
private consumption and improved economic fundamentals, especially the US economy
which was growing above potential. However, consumption in the euro area recovered
somewhat slower than expected. China and Asian economies continued to grow at a slower
pace as previously assessed, driven by private consumption and exports. Inflation in trading
**partner economies increased** in line with the previous assessment mainly on the back of rising
energy prices. Inflation in the US rose as the economy grew above potential, while inflation
in the Asian countries gradually increased as the economy approached potential. With regard
to monetary policy of trading partners, the Federal Reserve (Fed) was expected to raise the
policy rate two more times by the end of 2018, while the European Central Bank (ECB) and
the Bank of Japan (BOJ) were expected to maintain their monetary policy accommodation for
some time. Some central banks in the region such as Indonesia and the Philippines raised the
policy rate in order to safeguard external stability and contain inflation. **The Committee**
**assessed that risks to trading partners’ growth tilted more toward the downside due mainly**
to uncertainties pertaining to US trade protectionism measures and retaliatory measures by
US trading partners as the situation recently intensified. Although such risks had yet to impact
real sector activities including international trades, private investment, and inflation, the
Committee deemed it necessary to monitor further developments regarding US trade
protectionism including how businesses would adapt to the situation. Meanwhile, future
monetary policy actions of various central banks could lead to further tightening of global
financial conditions and thus must also be monitored given its implications for economic
growth as well as confidence among domestic and foreign investors.

**The Financial Markets**

**Over the recent period, concerns over US trade protectionism had limited impact on the**
**global financial markets but led to a sharp depreciation of Asian currencies, especially the**
**Chinese yuan and currencies of countries highly connected with China. In the early stage,**
rising concerns over trade protectionism prompted investors to be more cautious in investing
in risky assets as reflected in a rapid decline in global stock market indices at the end of June,
before rebounding thereafter as capital outflows from regional bond and equity markets
slowed down. On exchange rates, the US dollar appreciated against other currencies due to
monetary policy normalization by the Fed and possible inflation pickup in the US from higher
import tariffs as a result of US trade protectionism measures. This could result in a faster‐
than‐expected pace of rate hikes in the US. Meanwhile, the appreciation of the US dollar also


-----

led to the depreciation of Asian currencies. The baht depreciated against the US dollar and
**underwent volatile movements in line with other regional currencies due to concerns over**
trade protectionism and demand for US dollar by some Thai firms for overseas investment in
the recent period. **Short‐term Thai government bond yields rose** due to increased
government bond issuance as well as declining demand for short‐term government bonds by
foreign investors. Nevertheless, such increase in short‐term government bond yields was
limited because higher yields also caused Thai investors to start switching from their
investment in foreign investment funds (FIF) to short‐term Thai government bonds.
Meanwhile, long‐term Thai government bond yields fell due to increased concerns over US
trade protectionism and higher demand by foreign investors for some series of government
bonds due to adjustment in the proportion of investment in Thai government bonds following
changes in benchmark bonds included in the global bond index.

**The Committee viewed that the global financial markets remain highly uncertain in the**
**period ahead due to factors such as (1) directions of monetary policy in advanced economies**
and (2) trade protectionism that could further intensify and affect the global economy as well
as capital flows, which would then put pressure on asset prices and exchange rates
particularly in emerging markets with vulnerable economic fundamentals and high
interconnectedness with China and Europe. **The Committee thus viewed it necessary to**
**monitor such situations and their implications for exchange rates and bond yields, as well**
**as impacts on the economy.**

**Domestic Economic Conditions and Financial Stability**

**The Thai economy continued to gain further traction, driven by both external and domestic**
demand. Following a temporary slowdown in the first quarter of 2018, the **value of**
**merchandise exports later registered higher growth in terms of both quantities and prices as**
a result of improved external demand and rising crude oil prices, respectively. Meanwhile, the
impacts of US trade protectionism measures were so far limited to some products such as
washing machines and solar cells, which constituted a small share of total exports value.
Going forward, additional relocation of production base to Thailand, for some industries such
as hard disk drives, would continue to lend further support to merchandise exports. Private
**consumption continued to expand in almost all categories mainly on the back of spending by**
middle‐ to high‐income households as well as improving consumer confidence. Factors
underpinning the private consumption outlook also showed gradual improvements overall as
reflected by (1) improved and more broad‐based employment in manufacturing, services, and
agricultural sectors; (2) farm income which continued to see gradual improvements thanks to
higher agricultural output; and (3) the implementation of additional government stimulus
policies. **Private investment was projected to continue expanding in line with improving**
business sentiment, especially investment in machinery and equipment. This was reflected in
imports of capital goods by export‐ and energy‐related businesses. The outlook for private
investment was further supported by greater certainty regarding the prospects of public
investment projects with further progress on projects under the Eastern Economic Corridor
(EEC) and the Public‐Private Partnership schemes. Nevertheless, their progress must still be
monitored going forward. **Public expenditure remained a driver of growth. Government**
consumption growth was largely stable, while public investment was expected to grow at a
slower pace due to problems related to budget disbursement capabilities as well as potential


-----

delays in some state‐owned enterprise (SOE) investment projects. In addition, **exports of**
**services was projected to continue growing but at a slower pace than previously assessed**
mainly due to the Phuket tour boat sinking incident. The incident might affect tourist arrivals,
especially Chinese tourists, and could also lead to lower income for tourism‐related
businesses, as some businesses adapted to the situation by offering discounts to bolster sales.
In order to assess the impact from the incident in terms of magnitude and duration, it was
deemed necessary to monitor further developments and how affected businesses would
adapt to the situation.

**Headline inflation in June and July 2018 increased albeit at a slightly lower rate than**
previously assessed on account of a larger‐than‐expected decline in fresh food prices given
higher output, especially prices of vegetable, fruits, and meat. Meanwhile, energy prices
continued to rise in tandem with global oil prices. Core inflation edged up slightly higher than
previously assessed mainly on the back of increases in prices of prepared food and house rent,
while prices of other items remained largely stable. Looking ahead, headline inflation was
projected to slowly rise as demand pressure gradually builds up and as oil prices increase. The
annual average headline inflation was expected to be within target, although downside risks
remained as fresh food prices could fluctuate sharply depending on weather conditions and
agricultural output. Meanwhile, core inflation might also be more persistent than in the past
even though the economy was growing at full potential. This could be attributed to structural
factors that affected pricing power such as the expansion of e‐commerce, heightened price
competition, and upgrades to production efficiency which reduced costs of production. In this
light, the Committee saw the need to further study the impact of these structural changes on
prices, including how technological development affected input costs and productivity, due
to its implications for the inflation outlook. Nevertheless, **overall public’s inflation**
**expectations remained largely stable.**

**The Committee engaged in extensive discussion regarding Thailand’s growth outlook**
**especially on momentum of domestic demand which was subject to challenges arising from**
**structural changes that affected wage setting; low inflation; and elevated household debt.**
The Committee assessed that the pass‐through of benefits from economic growth to the labor
market became more evident as reflected in the more broad‐based increase in non‐
agricultural hiring, while agricultural employment remained high. Nevertheless, the average
wage had yet to clearly increase. The average wage growth in Thailand had remained low for
many years especially when compared with other regional countries. This could partly be
explained by structural factors in the Thai labor market such as (1) high degree of labor
mobility, which allowed labor shortages in one sector to be alleviated by labor from another
sector as well as by migrant workers, that resulted in limited upward pressure on wages; (2)
greater adoption of automation in place of labor in the production process; and (3) low
inflation which limited wage increases especially for low‐income workers. Meanwhile,
elevated household debt remained a drag on purchasing power. **As such, the Committee**
**deemed it necessary to closely monitor developments on these fronts given that they might**
**affect household purchasing power in the period ahead.**

**Commercial bank loans continued to expand in almost all loan purposes,** especially loans
extended to small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) with relatively large credit lines and
consumer loans. Loans extended to businesses with smaller credit lines increased in some
areas, while consumer loans expanded in all loan purposes, especially auto loans which


-----

continued to pick up as prior debt burden from the first‐car scheme gradually receded. With
regard to credit quality, the non‐performing loan (NPL) ratio was stable. However, the NPL
ratio of SMEs remained high. Meanwhile the NPL ratio of consumer loans was largely
unchanged, except for mortgage loans which increased. The Committee viewed that these
developments reflected continued improvements in economic growth. The Committee also
deemed it necessary to closely monitor growth in loans extended to small businesses and
households as well as the credit quality of SME loans with small credit lines and mortgage
loans.

**Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained risks that might pose**
**vulnerabilities to financial stability going forward.** Regarding leverage, the seasonally
adjusted household debt‐to‐GDP ratio remained unchanged in the first quarter of 2018, while
non‐financial corporate debt‐to‐GDP ratio continued to decline. In addition, it appeared that
businesses switched their funding from debt issuance more toward commercial bank loans.
Meanwhile, there remained the need to monitor the accumulation of new household
borrowing which might delay the deleveraging process, and also debt serviceability of SMEs
affected by structural changes. With regard to asset prices, volatility of the Stock Exchange of
Thailand (SET) index remained high but decreased somewhat as investor confidence
improved. In addition, further tightening of financial conditions in the period ahead could lead
to higher funding costs through bond issuance for businesses and could affect their ability to
rollover debt. For the real estate sector, the house price index continued to rise, although it
did not pick up significantly. Meanwhile, commercial banks competed in extending mortgage
loans with higher credit risks. This was reflected in a rising share of new mortgage loans with
the loan‐to‐value (LTV) ratio exceeding 90 percent as well as the increasing loan‐to‐income
(LTI) ratio. Moreover, the quality of mortgage loans still deteriorated, as indicated by the
higher NPL ratio. The overall situation regarding the oversupply of new condominiums
improved somewhat as the amount of time required for businesses to unload the stock of
condominiums declined partly due to developers’ deferred opening of new projects.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider additional indicators to monitor developers’
adjustment such as ownership transfers and oversupply in certain areas in order to assess the
situation in the property market. The Committee thus deemed it necessary to closely monitor
competition in the mortgage loan market as well as the oversupply of condominiums in
certain areas and the existing stock of old condominiums. **The** **search‐for‐yield behavior**
remained present in the prolonged low interest rate environment. This was evident in the
persistently high asset growth among saving cooperatives whereby some large saving
cooperatives became increasingly reliant on borrowing, in tandem with accelerated lending
growth. Meanwhile, the search for yield in other areas was not of concern. Mutual funds
continued to grow with increased investment in fixed‐income funds, whereas investment in
foreign investment funds (FIF) slowed down. Some Committee members also discussed the
need for macroprudential measures to address and prevent risks that could not self‐correct
through market mechanism such as growing assets of saving cooperatives, competition in the
mortgage loan market, and debt serviceability of SMEs and households.

**Monetary Policy Decision**

The Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to gain further traction, driven by
merchandise exports and tourism in tandem with global economic growth, and by stronger
momentum from domestic demand. The outlook for headline inflation was largely unchanged


-----

from the previous assessment with the annual average expected to be within target.
However, downside risks remained from sharp fluctuations in fresh food prices. Meanwhile,
core inflation was expected to edge up slightly higher as demand pressure would gradually
build up. Overall financial conditions were accommodative and conducive to economic
growth. Financial stability remained sound overall. The Committee viewed that in the context
where (1) the economy is growing at potential and (2) inflation became less responsive to
economic growth due partly to structural factors, with the annual average inflation expected
to be within target, it would be important to monitor the build‐up of vulnerabilities in the
financial system, which could be reflected in underpricing of risks and competition in the
mortgage loan market.

**In their policy deliberation, the Committee discussed key considerations underpinning**
**policy decision. Their conclusions were as follows.**

**(1) The Thai economy overall continued to gain further traction. Merchandise exports were**
expected to achieve higher growth than previously assessed partly due to the relocation of
production base to Thailand for some industries. Private consumption was projected to
continue expanding but overall purchasing power was still recovering at a gradual pace due
to elevated household debt. Private investment continued to expand with additional support
from greater certainty regarding the prospects of public investment projects, although their
progress must still be monitored going forward.

The Committee viewed that, going forward, potential impacts of both external and domestic
risks on Thailand’s economic growth and capital flow volatility continued to warrant close
monitoring. Such risks included (1) directions of monetary policy in advanced economies; (2)
US trade protectionism and retaliatory measures from its trading partners, which would affect
global trade and Thai exports; and (3) lower‐than‐expected tourism growth as a result of the
Phuket tour boat sinking incident. In this light, some Committee members viewed that current
growth momentum still warranted monitoring, and thus the current level of monetary policy
**accommodation would support a more robust growth in domestic demand.**

**(2) The outlook for headline inflation was largely unchanged from the previous assessment,**
but downside risks remained as fresh food prices could fluctuate sharply depending on
weather conditions and agricultural output. Core inflation was projected to edge up slightly
as demand‐pull inflationary pressure would gradually build up. The public’s inflation
expectations were largely unchanged. In addition, structural changes such as the expansion
of e‐commerce, heightened price competition, and upgrades to production efficiency which
reduced costs of production might result in more persistent inflation than in the past even
though the economy was growing at full potential. In this regard, the Committee viewed that
**current accommodative monetary policy allowed the headline inflation trajectory to be**
**consistent with the inflation target.**

**(3) Financial stability remained sound overall but there were some pockets of risk areas that**
had yet to show signs of improvements and might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability
going forward, especially as economic growth strengthened. Such risks included those
pertaining to (1) the property market where businesses continued to raise funds despite the
oversupply of condominiums in certain areas, while financial institutions engaged in
competition by extending mortgage loans with increased credit risks; (2) debt accumulation
among households in which the debt‐to‐income ratio had yet to indicate clear signs of


-----

deleveraging, while the prolonged low interest rate environment might encourage further
debt accumulation thus impeding the deleveraging process. Some Committee members
viewed that persistently high household debts and impaired debt serviceability of SMEs might
have an impact on economic growth over the long run; (3) the search‐for‐yield behavior under
the prolonged low interest rate environment which could lead to the underpricing of risks,
especially among saving cooperatives whose assets continued to grow at a high rate. In
addition, some large saving cooperatives had become increasingly reliant on borrowing in
tandem with accelerated lending growth. In the context of prolonged low interest rate and
**varying degrees in financial regulations, the Committee viewed that macroprudential**
**measures alone would not be sufficient in preventing potential risks in the financial system.**
**Thus, monetary policy must be conducted with caution as to not contribute to further build‐**
**up of financial vulnerabilities.**

Against this backdrop, the Committee viewed that the current monetary policy accommodation
played a part in supporting economic growth, especially in sustaining domestic demand, and
allowed the headline inflation trajectory to be consistent with the inflation target. **The**
**Committee thus voted 6 to 1 to** **keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.50 percent. One**
**member voted to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.75 percent with a view**
that the economic recovery was sufficiently robust and that the prolonged monetary
accommodation might induce households and businesses to underestimate potential changes
to financial conditions. The member thus voted to raise the policy rate at this meeting in order
to curb financial stability risks that could affect the sustainability of economic growth over the
longer term and to start building policy space.

**In addition the Committee discussed conditions and appropriate timing to begin**
**normalizing monetary policy in the future.** The Committee viewed that, should economic
expansion continue and inflation move more firmly within target, the need for currently extra
accommodative monetary policy would start to be reduced, and that the need for a policy
rate increase in order to build policy space in the future would be increasing. The Committee
would continue to closely monitor the outlook of economic growth and inflation, as well as
risks especially on the external front.
