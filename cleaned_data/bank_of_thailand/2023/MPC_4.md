**The Global Economy and Financial Markets**

**Trading partner economies continued to track the recovery path. The US economic outlook**
continued to improve from the services sector and strengthening employment as well as
private consumption. Meanwhile, the Chinese economy softened more than expected in the
second quarter, pointing to more sluggish recoveries in other Asian economies than
previously anticipated, especially as Chinese manufacturing inventories remained high. Asian
exports should nonetheless rebound in the fourth quarter this year, lifted by an expected
global electronic cycle recovery.

**Sentiments in the global financial markets were buoyed by slowing global inflation following**
lower energy prices and better US economic outlook. Investors expected the Federal Reserve
to slow the pace of monetary policy tightening, leading to increased risky asset prices and
capital flows into some regional countries.

**Domestic financial conditions became less accommodative** **but** **remained supportive of** **fund**
**mobilization by the private sector and the ongoing economic recovery. The private sector**
continued to raise funds through the credit markets despite increased financing costs
consistent with the policy rate. In the second quarter of 2023, total corporate funding grew
2.8% over the previous year, driven by a 12.8% expansion in corporate bonds, while business
loans contracted 1.1%. The contraction of business loans partly reflected a normalization of
lending activity after an uninterrupted credit expansion throughout the COVID-19 crisis aided
by extraordinary financial measures. **The baht fluctuated against the US dollar, initially**
depreciating due to weak Chinese economic outturns before appreciating in line with regional
currencies amid expectations of slower tightening in US monetary policy. Major risks looking
ahead included the US monetary policy stance, Chinese economic momentum, and domestic
political uncertainties.

**Domestic Economy**

**The Thai economy should continue to expand, driven mainly by tourism and private**
**consumption, while softening merchandise exports were expected to improve.** Several
factors would lend support to the recovery: (1) **the tourism sector should continue to benefit**
from a growing foreign tourist number, in line with the previous projections of 29 and 35.5
million for 2023 and 2024, respectively. The fewer-than-expected tourists from China to date
have been offset by arrivals from other jurisdictions. (2) private consumption should continue
to be robust, driven primarily by spending of medium- and high-income consumers.
Improving employment and labor income, notably in the services and self-employed sectors,
should continue to lend support, as in the second quarter of 2023 when real non-farm labor
income expanded 2.4% over the previous quarter. Merchandise exports were projected to

contract slightly this year, weighed by subdued Chinese demand, global electronic cycle, and
a severe El Niño episode. However, merchandise exports should gradually pick up in the
second half of this year, including those of air conditioners to the US and Europe given hotter
climate, agro-manufacturing products to ASEAN, and electronics due to rising global demand
for automotive semiconductors from ASEAN. **Public consumption and investment were**
projected to decline from the previous year because of the delayed budgeting process but
should rebound in 2024. Looking forward, risks to growth outlook include potential delays in
exports due to slower global economic recovery, domestic political uncertainties, and a more
severe El Niño episode.

**Headline inflation declined but should revert and stabilize within the target range.** The
recent fall in inflation could be attributed to a high base last year, cost-of-living subsidies, and
lower energy prices, including electricity charges in line with natural gas prices and domestic
retail oil prices. But as the influence of these temporary factors dissipate in the second half of
2023, headline inflation should rebound. Meanwhile, El Niño was likely to exert a meaningful
upward pressure on raw food prices – the expected Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) for the fourth
quarter of 2023 was revised up from 1.1 to 1.9, indicating a more severe El Niño episode
(albeit not as severe as in 2014 when ONI reached 2.6). Core inflation **edged lower but should**
**stabilize at a higher level than in the past. Falling food-in-core as well as services excluding**
housing rent inflation, together with lower cost pass-through by businesses, explained recent
moderation in core inflation. At the same time, underlying inflation indicators continued to
hover above historical averages, while persistently high global food prices shaped the
prospects for Thai food inflation. Upside risks to inflation remained from higher food costs
amid a more severe El Niño episode, which could accelerate cost pass-through in the context
of sustained economic expansion.

**Highlights of Committee Discussion**

- **The Committee deemed the economic and inflation outlook to be broadly similar to the**

**previous assessment.** Recent moderation in growth and inflation were expected to be
short-lived. The outlook for growth was one of a sustained economic recovery, with
downside risks from uncertain global demand and domestic political situation. Headline
inflation slowed in near term from energy prices, cost-of-living subsidies, and high base
last year. Inflation should, however, rebound in the second half of this year with upside
risks from higher food prices amid a more severe El Niño episode.

- **The Committee saw substantial uncertainties surrounding the outlook, particularly**

**pertaining to global economic recovery, domestic political developments, and severity**
**of El Niño episode. Uncertain demand particularly from China would directly weigh on**
Thailand and the region given the tight trade linkages – China and ASEAN accounted for
almost 40 percent of Thai goods exports. Domestic political developments could generate
different shocks. On the one hand, a delayed formation of government could affect
sentiments, with repercussion for private consumption and investment as well as tourism.
On the other hand, the new government could introduce public spending and policies that
expose growth and inflation to upside risks. For inflation, a particularly severe El Niño
episode could drive up raw food prices including the costs of livestock feed. In the context
of higher input costs and continuing economic expansion, a resurgence of cost passthrough by businesses remained a possibility.

- **The Committee assessed financial conditions to be less accommodative but still**

**supportive of fund mobilization by the private sector and the ongoing economic**
**recovery. The Committee remained concerned over the financial positions of vulnerable**
**households and businesses, and supported holistic and sustainable debt resolution. This**
would include further debt restructuring, as well as responsible lending measures to
address persistent debt problems. Targeted measures such as these would likely be more
effective and create less side effects than using the policy interest rate, a blunt instrument
with much stronger and far-reaching effects on the macroeconomy.

- **The Committee agreed that monetary policy should give due consideration to macro-**

**financial stability in the longer term. A low-for-long interest rate could contribute to a**
build-up of financial fragilities, for example in the form of elevated household debt and
more widespread search-for-yield behavior leading to underpricing of risks in borrowing
and investment activities. Over time, these developments would leave the business and
financial sectors more fragile and vulnerable to shocks, hindering sustainable growth.
Monetary policy should thus give due weight to longer-term macro-financial stability and
guard against the build-up of financial imbalances by internalizing the undesirable side
effects of a low-for-long interest rate environment.

- **The Committee expressed concerns over structural problems hampering potential**

**growth of the economy. The Thai labor income share trended downward from 60 percent**
to 50 percent during the last 20 years, with the majority of employment being in lowerproductivity agricultural and services sectors. Declining labor income share could weaken
private consumption and potential growth, with monetary policy implications. Addressing
these structural problems would require supply-side policies to enhance labor
productivity.

# • In the Committee’s view, a higher policy rate would help preserve the policy space in

**light of highly uncertain outlook. A higher interest rate would add buffer to monetary**
policy and the financial system, enhancing the capability to respond to negative shocks.
This buffer has been limited in the recent history, due to succession of adverse shocks
depleting the available policy space. The present context of sustained economic
expansion should provide an opportunity for building up policy space in readiness for
uncertainties looking forward.

- **The Committee noted that the current policy rate was approaching the level consistent**

**with longer-term macro-financial stability. The Committee expected the Thai economy**
to continue expanding toward its potential level. Headline inflation should stabilize within
the target range, but upside risks remained. Monetary policy should keep inflation
sustainably within the target range and foster longer-term macro-financial stability.

- **In deliberating further policy rate increases, the Committee would evaluate the stance**

**of monetary policy in relation to economic and inflation outlook, also taking into**
**account associated risk assessments and uncertainties. It would be important to look**
through transient forces contaminating incoming data and focus on the medium-term
economic outlook (outlook rather than recent data dependent). In doing so, monetary
policy would be playing its appropriate stabilizing role, and not unduly adding or
amplifying shocks to the economy.

**Monetary Policy Decision**

**The Committee voted unanimously to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from**
**2.00 to 2.25 percent.**

**The Committee judges the economy to expand toward the potential level driven mainly by**
tourism and private consumption, while merchandise exports contracted in the short term,
but should pick up looking ahead as the global economic activity gathers momentum.
**Inflation declined, but core inflation should stabilize at a higher level than in the past.**
Upside inflationary risks stem from uncertainty in forthcoming government economic policy
and more-severe-than-expected El Niño episode. Overall financial conditions became less
**accommodative but remain supportive of fund mobilization by the private sector and the**
ongoing economic recovery. **The overall financial system remains resilient.** Credit quality
might deteriorate for some fragile SMEs and households with impaired debt serviceability.
The Committee supports the continuation of debt restructuring measures as well as targeted
measures and sustainable debt resolution for vulnerable groups, particularly responsible
lending measures.

Under the prevailing monetary policy framework, the Committee seeks to maintain price
stability, support sustainable growth in line with potential, and preserve financial stability. In
the context of continuing economic expansion and narrowing slack, monetary policy should
keep inflation sustainably within the target range and foster longer-term macro-financial
stability by preempting the build-up of financial imbalances that could arise in a low-for-long
interest rate environment. A higher policy rate would also help preserve the policy space in
light of the highly uncertain outlook. The Committee therefore voted to raise the policy rate
**by 0.25 percentage point at this meeting. In deliberating further policy rate increases**
**looking ahead, the Committee will take into account economic and inflation outlook as well**
**as associated risk assessments.**
