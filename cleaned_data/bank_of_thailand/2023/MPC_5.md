**The Global Economy and Financial Markets**

**Trading partner economies were projected to expand by 2.7 and 2.5 percent in 2023 and**
**2024, respectively. The services sector should continue to be the main growth driver for the**
rest of 2023, limiting the benefits for Asian merchandise exports. Global growth was expected
to moderate somewhat in 2024, in part due to the impact from tighter monetary policy, as
well as the softening Chinese economy amid lingering problems in the property sector.
However, Asian merchandise exports should improve in line with an expected rebound in the
global manufacturing activity and electronic cycle next year.

**Financial market volatilities increased. Risk appetite in the global financial markets worsened**
as the US dollar soared and the capital flows into regional economies slowed. The risk-off
sentiments stemmed in part from growth concerns in China and the prospect of a tighter-forlonger US monetary policy stance.

**Domestic financial conditions tightened somewhat as private sector funding costs increased**
consistent with the policy rate. Slowing private credit growth partly reflected a normalization
of lending activity after an extraordinary expansion due to the pandemic policy response, and
looking ahead should improve in tandem with the economic recovery. Bond yields rose while
the baht depreciated against the US dollar, driven by the US monetary policy outlook, and as
market participants awaited clarity on the details and the funding sources for government
policies.


**Domestic Economy**


**The Thai economy overall continued to recover with growth projected to be 2.8 and 4.4**
**percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Growth in 2023 softened somewhat from a slower-**
than-expected recovery in merchandise exports and tourism, weighed by subdued growth in
China and the global electronic cycle. Growth should however pick up in 2024, supported by
several factors. First, private consumption should continue to expand on the back of the
services sector, underpinned by a steady labor market recovery notably for tourism-related
employment and with additional impetus from government economic policies. Second,
tourism should continue to recover as reflected in the growing number of foreign tourists and
sustained improvement in tourism demand indicators for Thailand. As a result, foreign tourist
arrivals were expected to reach 28.5 million for 2023 and 35 million for 2024. Third,
merchandise exports were projected to improve in line with the recovering global
manufacturing activity and an upturn in the global electronic cycle, supported by a continued
increase in the demand for automobiles and electrical appliances from key trading partners.

The overall economic outlook remained uncertain, with upside risks from greater-thanexpected stimulus from government policies and downside risks from weaker-than-expected
recovery in the global economy, especially China.

**Headline inflation was projected to remain within the target range, at 1.6 and 2.6 percent**
in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Core inflation was expected to be 1.4 percent in 2023 and 2.0
percent in 2024. Inflation would remain low for the rest of 2023 due to government livingcost subsidies, subdued raw food inflation, and a high base last year. Inflation should pick up
next year in line with stronger domestic demand, additional impetus from government
economic policies and higher minimum wages, as well as higher food prices due to El Niño.
Upside risks to inflation were (1) greater demand-side pressures related to government
economic policies and (2) a resurgence of cost passthrough by businesses from higher food
prices should the El Niño phenomenon intensify.


**Highlights of Committee Discussion**



- **The Committee deemed the overall economic recovery trajectory to be intact. Despite**

slower growth this year due to worse-than-expected merchandise exports and tourism,
growth in 2024 would be propelled by all key growth engines operating in fuller capacity.
Domestic demand would be supported by higher labor income, underpinned by a steady
tourism recovery and a turnaround in merchandise exports. The lower-than-expected
outturns of second-quarter GDP were a key factor for the downward growth revision for
2023, but according to the Committee’s assessment did not materially alter the economic
outlook since domestic demand continued to expand robustly. While external demand
had recovered more slowly than expected, a steady improvement was anticipated looking
ahead. The Committee recognized greater challenges in interpreting and drawing
implications from GDP releases, due to a post-COVID divergence between expenditureside and production-side GDP readings, notably in the growth-driving tourism-related
services. A consequence has been the growing influence of the change in stock and
statistical discrepancy on the recent expenditure-side GDP prints. The Committee would
place emphasis on consulting a wide array of economic indicators to form a
comprehensive and accurate assessment of the economic outlook.

- **The Committee agreed on the need to monitor the impact of government policies on**

**economic growth and inflation. Particularly in the context of the economy approaching**
its potential, such policies could add meaningful inflationary pressures. The Committee
discussed reasonable fiscal multiplier estimates associated with cash transfers, agreeing
that they would likely be lower than those for government spending and investment. The
exact magnitude of the fiscal multiplier however remained uncertain, depending on
factors such as policy design, program size, funding source, duration, and behavioral
response of the private sector. In view of these uncertainties, the Committee would
continue to monitor demand pressures on inflation, along with any shifts in the pricesetting behavior or inflation dynamics, which could have implications for the mediumterm inflation expectations. In the Committee’s view, fiscal spending geared toward
enhancing long-term growth potential, such as infrastructure investment and labor
upskilling, could help promote both higher growth and long-term sustainability of public
debt.

- **The Committee acknowledged greater financial market** **volatilities, which owed partly**

**to domestic factors. There were outflows from both the bond and equity markets, with**
rising bond yields and baht depreciation against the US dollar. The global factors were in
part responsible, particularly the market expectation of a tighter monetary policy stance
by the Federal Reserve for a more extended period. However, domestic factors were also
at work, with market participants awaiting further details on government policies and
assessing possible implications for macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability.
Although the impact of financial market volatilities on the Thai economy has been
contained to date, the Committee agreed to closely monitor the unfolding developments
and their potential macroeconomic effects.

- **The Committee assessed financial conditions to be somewhat tighter but still supportive**

**of private sector funding and the ongoing economic recovery. The deceleration in private**
credit growth partially reflected a normalization of lending activity, following the strong
expansion thanks to financial sector policy responses during the recent pandemic period.
Credit growth should pick up once economic activity gathers momentum, in the past
typically after two to three quarters following economic recovery. So far, there were no
indications that the recent decline in private credit was primarily a consequence of stricter
credit standards – for instance, credit utilization rate remained lower than its historical
average. Nevertheless, the Committee remained concerned over financial positions of
vulnerable households and businesses, and supported holistic and sustainable debt
resolution. Such targeted measures were expected to be more effective with fewer
unintended consequences than resorting to blanket non-discriminative policies.

- **The Committee agreed to lift the policy interest rate at this meeting, to a level consistent**

**with supporting long-term sustainable growth. This policy stance would help keep**
inflation within the target range and foster longer-term macro-financial stability by
preventing the buildup of risks that could otherwise emerge in a low-for-long interest rate
environment. The policy action would also rebuild policy space, a valuable insurance in
the face of an uncertain outlook.

- **In deliberating monetary policy looking ahead, the Committee would carefully assess**

**the evolving macroeconomic outlook as well as associated uncertainties. At the current**
juncture, the Committee was attentive to the upside risks to growth and inflation, in
particular as stemming from government economic policies. Supply-side shocks related to
the El Niño phenomenon could also put upward pressures on food prices and inflation
more than expected. The Committee would closely monitor these developments and
deliberate monetary policy based on the assessment of the growth and inflation outlook.

**Monetary Policy Decision**

**The Committee voted unanimously to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from**
**2.25 to 2.50 percent, effective immediately.**

**In the Committee’s judgment, the economy overall continued to recover. Growth slowed**
somewhat in 2023, but should pick up in 2024. Inflation was projected to increase next year
in line with the recovery, with upside risks. Overall financial conditions tightened somewhat

but remained supportive of fund mobilization by the private sector and the ongoing economic
recovery. The overall financial system remained resilient. Nevertheless, there was a need to
continue monitoring credit quality for some SMEs and households with impaired debt
serviceability, higher debt burden, and slower income recovery. The Committee supported
the targeted measures and sustainable debt resolution for vulnerable groups.

Under the prevailing monetary policy framework, the Committee seeks to maintain price
stability, support sustainable growth in line with potential, and preserve financial stability. In
pursuit of these objectives and having normalized policy gradually up to the current meeting,
the Committee deemed the current policy interest rate to be appropriate for supporting longterm sustainable growth. **In deliberating monetary policy going forward, the Committee**
**would take into account the growth and inflation outlook, including upside risks from**
**government economic policies.**
