**The Global Economy and Financial Markets**

**Thailand’s trading partner economies were projected to continue expanding. The US and EU**
economies were expected to slow down in 2023, in line with the previous assessment, given
elevated inflation and tighter financial conditions as a result of restrictive monetary policy.
However, economic fundamentals as reflected in the US and EU consumption and
employment remained sound. Growth in advanced economies was projected to bottom out
in 2023 and expand in 2024. Meanwhile, the Chinese economic outlook improved thanks to
the relaxation of domestic containment measures and government stimulus packages.
The more severe COVID-19 outbreak would affect economic activities in China in the short
run. As the outbreak subsided, domestic demand was expected to recover from the second
quarter of 2023. These would in turn benefit the Chinese and Asian economies going forward.

**Risk sentiments in the global financial markets improved as US inflation clearly declined and**
**due to the faster-than-expected China’s reopening. Investors expected the Fed to decelerate**
the pace of its tightening, which led to a depreciation of the US dollar and a decline in
government bond yields in most countries. Meanwhile, risky asset prices rose and capital
inflows into emerging market economies were observed, especially in Asian countries that
would benefit from China’s reopening. **Thailand’s financial conditions remained**
**accommodative. Short-term interest rates in the financial market and commercial bank**
interest rates increased in line with the policy rate. Whereas, long-term Thai government bond
yields decreased in tandem with US Treasury yields. However, the overall financial conditions
remained conducive for business financing, as reflected in the growth in bank lending and
corporate bond issuances. The baht appreciated against the US dollar owing to market
expectations of a dovish Fed tightening and China’s reopening, which would benefit the Thai
tourism sector. Looking ahead, the financial markets would still be subject to uncertainties
that warranted monitoring. These included the global economic and inflation outlook, the
monetary policy stance of major central banks, and the effects of China’s relaxation of
containment measures and stimulus packages.

**Domestic Economy**

**The Thai economy would continue to expand. The tourism sector and private consumption**
**would continue to gain traction thanks to the return of Chinese tourists. The economic**
expansion would be supported by, first, the faster recovery of the tourism sector with the
number of tourist arrivals for 2023 and 2024 being revised up by 3.5 million from the
projection in November 2022 to be at 25.5 million and 34 million, respectively. Second, private
consumption would gain further traction propelled by improvements in employment and
labor income in the services sector and among self-employed workers, which accounted a
significant share of total employment (approximately 18.4 million or 67% of total non-farm
workers in 2022). **Meanwhile,** **Thailand’s merchandise export growth was expected to**


-----

**moderate in 2023 before resuming in 2024. The expected slowdown of merchandise exports**
this year was in line with the outturns in the fourth quarter of 2022, which appeared to be
lower than expected due to the global slowdown. The exports slowdown was also partly due
to structural factors, such as the continuous decline in exports of hard disk drives owing to the
technological transformation to solid state drives. Nevertheless, merchandise exports would
expand next year thanks to the improving global economic outlook. In addition, downside risks
to the Thai economic growth decreased due mainly to the return of Chinese tourists, especially
if the outbreak situation and international travel restrictions subsided faster than expected.

**Headline inflation would continue to decline.** Supply-side inflationary pressures had
gradually dissipated along with a decline in global energy and commodity prices, as reflected
by the proportion of goods and services with continuous price increases that had fallen
throughout the fourth quarter of 2022. Core inflation was projected to remain at a high level
**for some time before gradually decreasing. Upward adjustments in prices of goods and**
services in core inflation basket did not become broad-based or accelerated. Meanwhile,
medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target range. However,
**there was a risk that core inflation would stay high for longer than expected due to, first, a**
potential increase in pass-through given elevated costs. There were also risks of higher costs
in the period ahead from the uncertain domestic energy price adjustments as well as rising
global energy and commodity prices in case of a rapid recovery of the global economy. Second,
tourism recovery could increase demand-side inflationary pressures and result in an increase
in prices of tourism-related goods and services, including food prices. The Committee would
therefore continue to closely monitor risks to inflation.

**Discussions by the Committee**

  - **The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would continue to recover. Tourism**

**sector would be a key economic driver this year, while growth momentum from**
**merchandise exports would moderate from the previous year.** Tourism recovery
would support economic activities in the services sector as well as contribute to a more
broad-based improvement in employment and income of services sectors and selfemployed workers, which accounted a significant share of total employment. Such
improvements would foster a stronger economic recovery given that higher
purchasing power of households would result in multiplier effects on private
consumption. Meanwhile, there were risks of rising demand-side inflationary
pressures. The Committee would thus monitor Chinese tourist arrivals, which could
return in a greater number and earlier than expected, as well as the risks of labor
shortages in the services sector which could temporarily put pressure on wages in
related businesses. Furthermore, some members were concerned that the economy’s
reliance on the tourism sector as the only key economic driver might have implications
for the sustainability of economic growth in the long term.

  - **The Committee expressed concerns over the effects of structural changes on**

**Thailand’s merchandise exports outlook.** Although merchandise exports were
expected to moderate in 2023, partly due to the global slowdown, most members
viewed that Thai exports going forward would benefit from both the recovery in
advanced economies and China’s reopening. Therefore, the deceleration in
merchandise exports that coincided with the economic cycle was not of major concern.
However, the Committee was more concerned on the shifting structures of both global


-----

and Thai economies which would affect Thailand’s merchandise exports. These
changes included, for example, (1) shifts in global supply chains due to deglobalization,
(2) the monetary and macroeconomic policies in some countries, such as China’s dual
circulation strategy which would affect Thai exports of petroleum and chemicalrelated products, and (3) a slow adjustment in Thailand’s manufacturing sector in
response to technological changes, such as the rising adoption of solid state drives,
which affected Thai exports of hard disk drives. These structural changes would have
implications not only for the monetary policy but also for macroeconomic policies
aimed at uplifting the long-term potential growth of the Thai economy.

- **The Committee assessed that inflationary risks had increased and warranted close**

**monitoring. Core inflation was expected to remain at a high level for some time as**
there remained risks of a potential increase in pass-through given elevated costs, while
some production costs remained high, such as domestic energy prices, which might
decline to a lesser degree than global prices due to the contribution gradually allocated
to the Oil Fuel Fund. Moreover, businesses could increase prices of goods and services
in the period ahead in response to rising households’ purchasing power in line with the
economic recovery. The committee deemed it necessary to closely monitor demandside inflationary pressures and businesses’ price adjustment behavior, as well as
inflationary psychology which might have changed from the past and could in turn
affect the medium-term inflation expectations.

- **Some members remained concerned over the financial positions of the vulnerable**

**groups, especially SMEs and low-income households. Although improvements in the**
tourism and services sectors would support the income recovery, those vulnerable
groups had high debt burden and had been facing the rising living costs. Meanwhile,
benefits from the tourism recovery might concentrate in some popular tourist
destinations and among workers in tourism-related businesses. Furthermore, labor
incomes in some sectors, such as the export-related manufacturing sector, might be
affected by a slowdown in merchandise exports this year. Therefore, the Committee
saw the need to monitor the income recovery and financial positions of the vulnerable
groups. Moreover, debt restructuring should be pressed ahead in order to ease debt
burden in a targeted manner, which would be more effective than using the monetary
policy which was considered a blunt tool.

- **The Committee judged that gradual and measured policy normalization was an**

**appropriate course for monetary policy while standing ready to adjust the size and**
**timing of policy normalization should the growth and inflation outlook shift from the**
**current assessment. Gradual increases in the policy rate caused financial conditions to**
tighten in a slow and orderly manner. This led bank lending and corporate bond
issuances to continue expanding, as well as helped ease impacts on debt burden of the
vulnerable groups to some extent. However, monetary policy would face greater
**challenges in the period ahead.** Monetary policy would face a tradeoff between
tackling inflation amid rising demand-side inflationary pressures on the back of the
improving economic outlook and supporting the economic recovery where some
businesses and households remained fragile. The committee would be ready to adjust
monetary policy to be consistent with the changing economic and inflation outlook.

**Monetary policy decision**

**The Committee voted unanimously to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from**
**1.25 to 1.50 percent.**

**The Committee viewed that the Thai economy would continue to recover.** Tourism and
private consumption would continue to gain traction thanks to the return of Chinese tourists.
Meanwhile, merchandise exports would slow down this year but were expected to improve
in 2024 in line with the global economic recovery. Headline inflation was expected to decline,
**whereas core inflation would remain high for some time with the risks that it would remain**
high for longer than expected owing to demand-side inflationary pressures and a potential
increase in pass-through. While the overall financial system remained resilient, some SMEs
and households remained fragile and sensitive to the rising living costs and debt burden. The
**Committee deemed that a gradual and measured policy normalization was consistent with**
**the economic recovery and inflation outlook and thus voted to raise the policy rate by 0.25**
**percentage point at this meeting.**

**The Committee deemed it important to have targeted measures and sustainable debt**
**solutions in place for vulnerable groups.** The Committee assessed that overall financial
system remained resilient. Commercial banks maintained high levels of capital and loan loss
provision. Debt serviceability of households and businesses had improved in line with the
economic recovery. However, the financial positions of some SMEs and households remained
fragile and sensitive to the rising living costs and debt burden. Financial institutions should
thus continue to press ahead with debt restructuring.

**The Committee viewed that overall financial conditions were less accommodative. Funding**
costs had risen in tandem with the policy rate increases as well as the expiration of reduction
in the Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF) contribution. However, bank lending
and bond issuances continued to increase. The baht against the US dollar had appreciated
owing to expectations of a dovish Fed tightening as well as China’s relaxation of international
travel restrictions which would benefit the Thai tourism sector. **The Committee would**
**continue to closely monitor developments in the financial market and volatilities in the**
**foreign exchange market.**

Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability,
supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability,
the Committee judged that Thai economic recovery remained on track. However, risks of rising
demand-side inflationary pressures must be monitored. The policy rate should be normalized
**to the level that would be consistent with sustainable growth in the long term in a gradual**
**and measured manner. The Committee would be ready to adjust the size and timing of**
**policy normalization should the growth and inflation outlook shift from the current**
**assessment.**
