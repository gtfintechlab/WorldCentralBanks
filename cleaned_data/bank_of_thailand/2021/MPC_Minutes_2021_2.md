**The Global Economy and Financial Markets**

**The global economy would continue to recover; however, uncertainties surrounding the**
**COVID-19 situation in many countries could become more severe and prolonged. The global**
economic recovery would be supported by the COVID-19 vaccination progress, additional large-scale
economic stimulus measures in the US, and improving exports in accordance with the global
economic recovery. Nevertheless, the prospects of the global economic recovery would remain
uncertain going forward due to virus mutations and the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines.

**Volatilities in the global financial markets increased. Long-term US Treasury yields rose**
**rapidly as market participants expected the Federal Reserve to withdraw monetary policy**
**accommodation sooner than previously assessed** due to (1) a rise in US inflation
expectations (2) the prospects of the US economic recovery supported by the economic
stimulus measures, and (3) an increasing supply of US government bonds. Consequently, the
US dollar appreciated. The prices of commodities and equities rose, while safe asset prices
fell. The long-term government bond yields of most countries, including Thailand, rose in
accordance with the long-term US Treasury yields. On exchange rates, the baht depreciated against
the US dollar, while the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) decreased from the previous
meeting.

**Looking ahead, volatility in the global financial markets would remain high. Asset prices**
could experience a sharp correction if further developments would not align with market
expectations, posing knock-on effects on the Thai financial markets. These developments
included (1) the US recovery prospects, (2) monetary policy and fiscal measures in advanced
economies, such as the US infrastructure stimulus package, and (3) a faster-than-expected
normalization of the US monetary policy. Thus, scenario analyses are needed to evaluate these
risks and impacts on the Thai economic recovery.

**Domestic Economy**

**The Thai economy continued to recover despite facing the new wave of the COVID-19 outbreak,**
**but uncertainties remained high. The Committee assessed that impacts of the recent**
outbreak were less severe than last year due to the less strict containment measures and quick
implementation of additional fiscal measures. However, the Committee assessed that the Thai
economy would expand by 3.0 and 4.7 percent in 2021 and 2022 respectively, lower than the
previous projection. **Negative factors affecting the economy were as follows. First, foreign**
tourist figures were revised downward due to Thailand’s slower-than-expected reopening plan
and the international travel restriction policy in source countries, particularly China. Second,
government spending in 2022 was significantly revised downward due to (1) a reduction in


-----

fiscal year 2022 expenditure budget in accordance with the lower revenue projection and (2)
the spending reallocation to economic relief from economic restoration under the Emergency
Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise Loans to Solve Problems, to Remedy and
Restore the Economy and Society as Affected by the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic, B.E.
2563(2020). Nonetheless, some positive factors supporting the economy included (1) merchandise
export recovery which was in line with the trading partners’ economic outlook and (2) the
additional fiscal stimulus measures in the first half of 2021 to alleviate impacts of the new
wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Meanwhile, the current account balance was projected to
register only a small surplus in 2021, declining significantly to 1.2 billion US dollars, due to (1)
reduction in the number of foreign tourists, (2) increasing import prices in line with global
crude oil prices, (3) increase in net gold imports given declining gold prices, and (4) higher
transportation costs in the services balance caused by shipping container shortage. However,
the current account surplus would increase to 25 billion US dollars in 2022 owing to tourism
recovery.

**Looking ahead, there were possibilities that the Thai economy would underperform the**
**baseline projection due to various factors.** First, Thailand’s border re-opening to foreign
tourists could be delayed because of, for example, insufficient vaccine supply in a timely
manner, public concerns over safety of the vaccines, and virus mutations. Second, the impact
of government stimulus could be lower than estimated if there is a delay in the approvals of
the remaining projects under the Emergency Decree, since the Decree would remain in effect
until the third quarter of 2021. Third, financial positions of businesses could deteriorate,
possibly triggering permanent shutdowns and higher unemployment. This could leave scarring
effects on businesses and labor recovery. Fourth, the default rates of businesses and
households could rise substantially after the phase-out of the credit relief measures.

**Headline inflation in 2021 was projected to be higher than the previous assessment and**
**would return to the target in the middle of 2021, remaining close to the lower bound of the**
**target range throughout the forecast period. The Committee assessed that headline inflation**
in 2021 would increase to 1.2 percent mainly on account of the increase in crude oil prices,
and would temporarily spike in the second quarter of 2021 due to the low base effect last
year. Core inflation was projected to remain largely unchanged at low levels. Medium-term
inflation expectations remained anchored within the target.

**Discussions by the Committee**

**The Committee discussed potential risks to the Thai economy, the appropriate measures that**
**should be implemented going forward, and the combination of policy tools that would be**
**suitable to the Thai context to achieve the monetary policy objectives. The details were as follows.**

- **The Committee assessed that the spike in long-term Thai government bond yields in**

**tandem with the US Treasury long-term yields thus far had limited impact on the Thai**
**economy. This was because most corporate bond issuers raised funds in the short maturity**
and could still do so as usual. Corporate credit spreads continued to decline. Although
yields on long-term Thai government bonds stabilized recently and were less correlated
with the US Treasury counterparts, the Committee would closely monitor financial market
developments and implications on the Thai economic recovery in the period ahead.


-----

- **The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would recover slowly in the short term**

**and become more uneven among sectors. Targeted and sufficient government measures**
**should be expedited to reduce economic scars,** especially those in the private sector
experiencing increasingly fragile financial positions, elevated household debt, and a
weakened labor market, all of which would hamper the economic recovery going forward.
**Fiscal measures should therefore be helpful in expediting the disbursements of relief and**
government support to keep the momentum of fiscal stimulus, thereby supporting job
creation and generating household incomes. **Financial and credit measures** should
encourage financial institutions to expedite debt restructuring for both retail borrowers
and businesses, as well as support the distribution of liquidity in a targeted manner to
reduce the debt burden of the affected groups, particularly through the new financial
rehabilitation measures consisting of soft loans and asset warehousing. The new measures
would (1) create incentives for financial institutions to provide liquidity to the businesses in
a targeted manner, in line with their needs and prospects and (2) temporarily reduce debt
payments of principal and interest for businesses that would take time to recover,
especially tourism-related services. **Under the worst case scenario, the government**
**should prepare additional packages of financial and fiscal measures to cushion against**
**uncertainties, especially if the number of inbound foreign tourists in 2021 were lower than**
expected.

- **The Committee emphasized the necessity of structural reforms to raise the long-term**

**potential of the Thai economy. Potential growth was forecasted to steadily decline, while**
the COVID-19 outbreak could exacerbate the existing structural challenges, namely aging
population and income inequality. The Committee therefore highlighted the necessity of
structural reforms to boost economic potential, particularly business model adjustments
together with labor upskilling and reskilling to suit the post-COVID environment. The
reforms would support a sustainable economic recovery and increase income that would
help speed up the process of business and household debt deleveraging.

- **The Committee discussed an appropriate combination of policy tools to support the**

**near-term economic recovery and the long-run sustainable economic expansion.** The
views of the Committee were as follows. First, monetary policy accommodation together
**with targeted fiscal and financial measures** would facilitate the economic recovery and
foster the return of headline inflation to target. **Second, macroprudential and**
**microprudential measures would be crucial in the context of low-for-long interest rates to**
sustain the economic recovery. **Third, the public sector should accelerate structural**
**policies to raise the country’s competitiveness and long-term economic potential.**

**Monetary Policy Decision**

**The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent to support**
**the economic recovery which remained highly uncertain.**

The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would continue to expand, albeit somewhat
slower than the previous assessment. Nonetheless, fragile financial positions of some
segments of the private sector, particularly SMEs and households, would hinder the economic
recovery going forward. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize the measures that assist the
target groups directly and consistent with their needs. At the present, the key challenge of the


-----

Thai economy was not the level of interest rates since commercial bank lending rates and
government bond yields still remained low. Instead, there was an issue of distributing the
ample liquidity within the banking system to those affected businesses and households.
Implementation of financial and credit measures in a targeted manner would then be suitable.
In addition, the Thai economic recovery in the period ahead would remain highly uncertain. The
**Committee therefore voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting to preserve the limited**
**policy space to act at the appropriate and most effective timing to maximize its effectiveness.**

**The Committee would closely monitor developments in foreign exchange markets and**
**capital flows,** as well as consider the necessity of implementing additional appropriate
measures to ensure that exchange rate movements would not hinder the economic recovery.
Although pressures on the baht would abate in tandem with the substantial reduction in the
current account surplus for 2021, the Committee would continue to expedite the new foreign
exchange ecosystem to restructure the Thai foreign exchange markets, which directly
addresses the root cause of the pressures on the baht. The Committee viewed that by
encouraging Thai institutional investors to increase their portfolio investments abroad,
it would facilitate capital outflows and improve the balance between capital inflows and outflows.

**The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy coordination**
**among government agencies would be critical in supporting the economic recovery going**
**forward. The Committee encouraged the expedition of the new financial rehabilitation**
measures to restore businesses affected by COVID-19. This would ensure the distribution of
liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner, reduce debt burden, and support the
economic transformation in the period ahead. Meanwhile, monetary policy must remain
accommodative. Financial institutions should expedite debt restructuring to have broader
impacts. Fiscal measures must continue to sustain the economy, especially expediting the
approvals and disbursements under the remaining restoration budget. Furthermore, the
government should help accelerate structural reforms to enable business model adjustments
and to upskill labor towards the post-COVID environment. These would support a sustainable
economic recovery and uplift the long-term economic potential.

Under the monetary policy framework with the objectives of maintaining price stability,
supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability,
**the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery.**
The Committee would monitor the situation of the COVID-19 outbreak, the efficacy and
distribution of the vaccines, the admission of foreign tourists, fragilities in the labor markets,
as well as the adequacy and continuity of the government measures, in deliberating monetary
policy going forward. The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate
monetary policy tools if necessary.

###### The Thai economy would expand lower than the previous forecast due to the new wave
 of the COVID-19 outbreak and the reopening plan that was less relaxed than expected.
 The recovery in the period ahead would remain highly uncertain, depending on (1) the continuity
 of fiscal support and (2) the recovery in tourist figures in line with COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and coverage.
