**The Global Economy and Financial Markets**

**The global economy continued to recover thanks particularly to the progress of COVID-19**
**vaccination in major** **advanced economies and better-than-expected exports in Asian**
**economies.** There were also continued support from monetary and fiscal policies. Looking
ahead, the global economy would continue to gain strength in tandem with the vaccination
progress and large-scale US economic stimulus. Nevertheless, the recovery would remain
uncertain owing to virus mutations and vaccine efficacy.

**The global financial market sentiment had been more risk-on. However, volatilities**
**increased after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in June 2021 where**
**investors priced in faster-than-expected US monetary policy tightening. Before the FOMC**
meeting, prices of risky assets, namely equities and commodities, rose in line with major
advanced economies thanks to the vaccination progress. Thai equity prices also rose due to
the progress of domestic vaccine procurement and distribution. Nevertheless, global equity
and gold prices decreased somewhat after the FOMC meeting. Investors assessed that the
Federal Reserve may need to tighten monetary policy earlier than expected to keep rising
inflation in line with the long-term target. Despite the fall in long-term US Treasury yields, the
Thai counterparts stabilized due to the potentially rising supply of domestic government
bonds following the Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise Additional
Loans to Solve Economic and Social Problems as Affected by the Coronavirus Disease
Pandemic, B.E. 2564 (2021). In addition, investors remained cautious about emerging market
assets, including Thailand, owing to outbreaks in several countries and the US monetary policy
outlook. On exchange rates, the baht depreciated against the US dollar more than regional
currencies. The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) depreciated from the previous meeting.

**Looking ahead, volatility in the global financial markets would remain high owing to the US**
**monetary policy outlook. Investor decisions would be primarily based on the US economic**
recovery, communications by the Federal Reserve, uneven economic recovery across
countries, and emerging markets’ vaccination progress. Meanwhile, the new wave of
**domestic outbreak would be the main contributor of volatilities in the Thai financial markets**
**in the period ahead.** However, the impacts of the US monetary policy outlook on domestic
long-term government bond and equity prices would be limited. This was due to low foreign
participation in the long-term Thai government bond market compared with other regional
countries, as well as the continuous underweighting of foreign investment in Thai equities
over recent periods.


-----

**Domestic Economy**

**The Thai economy would expand by 1.8 and 3.9 percent in 2021 and 2022 respectively, down**
**from the March projection. This was due to** **the more prolonged and severe third-wave**
**outbreak that** significantly affected foreign tourist figures and domestic demand. Businesses
and the labor markets would be more fragile and recover slowly. Nevertheless, the following
factors would provide additional economic support. First, public expenditure would be higher
thanks to the new Emergency Decree authorizing 500 billion baht borrowing which would
serve as the main support of household purchasing power and private consumption affected
by the third-wave outbreak. Second, positive vaccine developments from the previous
quarter, both increasing procurement and distribution, would contribute to a pickup in
economic activities. Third, merchandise exports were expected to post solid gain in line with
the global economic recovery, partly shoring up manufacturing production and employment.
Despite that, there would be some supply constraints such as factory outbreaks and global
shortages in containers and electronic parts, though these would alleviate by the first half of
2022. Headline inflation would temporarily increase in the second quarter of 2021 due to
the low level of crude oil prices in the same quarter last year. Core inflation would be subdued
owing to weak domestic demand. Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored
within the target range.

**Looking ahead, the Thai economy faced significant downside risks and uncertainties from**
**various factors that needed to be closely monitored. First, prolonged outbreak and virus**
mutations from existing and new variants would reduce vaccine efficacy. This could lead to a
public health crisis, affect domestic spending, and delay the reopening plan to admit foreign
tourists. Second, government spending on economic relief and restoration could be lower
than expected if projects under the Emergency Decree faced approval delays or low
disbursement rates. Third, the new outbreak could exacerbate financial positions of
businesses, especially the services sector, leading to widespread business closures and layoffs. Dismissed workers could be unemployed for extended periods and eventually give up
finding jobs. Further deterioration in business and household balance sheets would thus
impinge on economic activities and cause a rise in debt defaults. Fourth, the supply disruption
and increase in shipping costs would have greater impacts on Thailand’s manufacturing and
export sectors than expected.


**Discussions by the Committee**


**The Committee assessed the economic outlook and noted the possibility of the new**
**outbreak and virus mutations which would prolong and intensify the pandemic both in**
**Thailand and abroad. Despite improving vaccine procurement at the present juncture,**
**emphasis should also be placed on the efficacy of vaccines against virulent mutants**
**together with their adequate and timely distribution. At the same time, measures to**
**minimize adverse economic impacts in the short term and in the post-pandemic period**
**should be expedited. The details were as followed.**

  - **The Committee assessed that the Thai economy faced significant downside risks. A**

**prolonged outbreak could cause the economy to underperform the baseline. This**
**would squeeze business liquidity and slow down employment in the services sector.**


-----

**Furthermore, uneven economic recovery across different sectors would intensify.**
In the baseline scenario, positive developments in vaccine distribution would help
contain the outbreak by the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2021. This would
enable herd immunity attainment within the first half of 2022 and the Thai economy
would return to the pre-COVID level by the end of the same year. However, in the
scenario that the outbreak became more prolonged than the baseline, a new
outbreak could emerge due to a more easily transmissible and deadly mutant. In this
case, herd immunity would be delayed to the end of 2022 and the Thai economy
would return to the pre-COVID level at the beginning of 2023. Thus, the Committee
**viewed that the procurement and distribution of appropriate vaccines against new**
**virus mutations adequately and timely was the most important issue facing the Thai**
**economy. This would prevent a prolonged and severe outbreak. Meanwhile, fiscal**
stimulus measures should be expedited. Monetary policy must remain
accommodative. Adequate and targeted financial measures to assist businesses and
households affected by the pandemic should be pushed forward, especially the special
loan facility, asset warehousing, and debt restructuring. All parties should accelerate
**various measures to produce results and support the economy through this period,**
**especially during the next six months where uncertainties would remain high.**

- **The Committee viewed that the recurring outbreaks increased labor market fragility.**

**Recovery in labor markets would be W-shaped and slower than the past.** Despite
some improvements in the overall employment after the relaxation of containment
measures against the first- wave outbreak, recurring waves of infections would
increase fragility in the labor markets, particularly the services sector and among the
self- employed. Recent indicators reflected that that some employers adopted a
rotation system among workers and cut their working hours. The number of workers
who returned to their hometowns recorded a historic high. Most dismissed workers
in the services sector could not reallocate to the manufacturing sector with improving
prospects due to their skill mismatch. Moreover, the number of the long-term and
newly-graduated unemployed as well as persons outside the labor force continued to
rise. The Committee assessed that the government should address vulnerabilities in
**the labor markets in an adequate and continuous manner to reduce long- term**
**scarring effects after the COVID-19 outbreak** **subsided.**

- **The Committee assessed that the temporary increase in headline inflation in the**

**second quarter of 2021 was not a point of concern. The increase was due to the low**
level of crude oil prices in the same period last year and transitory supply constraints.
Meanwhile, reflation in the advanced economies would have limited spillovers to
domestic inflation as imported consumer products accounted for only 16 percent of
the Thai CPI basket. Additionally, producers decided to bear the rising costs of
production due to difficulties of price pass-through during an economic slowdown. In
the period ahead, headline inflation would edge down toward the lower bound of the
target range due to the following factors. First, global crude oil prices would rise at a
slower pace as oil producers were capable of expanding production capacity to meet
global demand. Second, raw food prices would decrease as the risks of drought


-----

subsided. Third, demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low due to a high level
of household debt and fragile labor markets.

  - **The Committee reiterated the need for structural reform policies to raise long-term**

**potential growth of the Thai economy. This would alleviate the impacts of the COVID-**
19 outbreak and the changing economic structure in the post-COVID environment due
to the following factors. First, the recovery among different sectors would be highly
uneven, especially the severely affected tourism sector. Second, income inequality
would intensify for the unemployed and the self-employed with income reduction.
Third, financial positions of businesses and households would become more fragile.
Consequently, without appropriate measures, long-term potential growth of the Thai
economy would decline. The Committee viewed that all related parties should jointly
**support structural transformation of the Thai economy by identifying key objectives**
**and establish policy guidelines for both the short and long term as well as push**
**forward their implementation. In particular, business model adjustments as well as**
the upskilling and reskilling of labor to suit the post-COVID environment should be
facilitated. These would support a sustainable economic recovery and bolster the
resilience of the Thai economy against future negative economic shocks.

**Monetary Policy Decision**

**The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent to support**
**the economic recovery which remained highly uncertain.**

The Committee assessed that the Thai economic recovery would be slower and more uneven
than the previous forecast due to the third-wave outbreak. Downside risks to the economic
outlook remained significant given the new wave. As a result, the balance sheets of some
businesses and households became more fragile. Additional measures should thus be more
targeted and in line with the need of borrowers, helping to distribute liquidity to the affected
businesses and households broadly. These measures included financial and credit measures,
credit guarantees, and expedited debt restructuring. Such measures would alleviate the
financial burden of businesses and households in a more targeted manner than a reduction
in the policy rate. The policy rate was already at a low level and cutting it might provide limited
support to the economic recovery. The Committee thus voted to maintain the policy rate at
**this meeting and would stand ready to use the limited policy space at the most effective**
**timing.**

**The Committee would continue to monitor developments in foreign exchange markets and**
**capital flows** to ensure that exchange rate movements would not hinder the economic
recovery going forward. Although pressures on the baht would abate in tandem with the
projected current account deficit in 2021, the Committee would continuously expedite the
new foreign exchange ecosystem to improve the structure of the Thai foreign exchange
markets over the medium term. The Committee viewed that by encouraging Thai institutional
investors to increase their portfolio investments abroad, it would facilitate capital outflows
and improve the balance between capital inflows and outflows.

**The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy**
**coordination among agencies would be critical in restoring the economy from the new**


-----

**outbreak.** Short-term measures to accelerate the procurement and distribution of
appropriate vaccines would prevent the outbreak from being prolonged and reduce economic
costs. Fiscal measures would play a crucial role in driving the economic recovery amid high
uncertainties. Thus, the government should accelerate the disbursement of relief and other
fiscal support measures to provide adequate and continuous economic stimulus as well as
address vulnerabilities in the labor markets. Meanwhile, monetary policy must remain
accommodative. The new financial rehabilitation measures to restore businesses affected by
COVID-19, together with other measures by specialized financial institutions, should
accelerate the distribution of liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner, reduce
debt burden, and support the economic recovery. In addition, financial institutions should
accelerate debt restructuring. The Bank of Thailand would closely monitor the progress and
assess the efficacy of financial and credit measures.

Under the monetary policy framework with the objectives of maintaining price stability,
supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability,
**the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery.**
In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook,
namely the distribution and efficacy of vaccines, the possibility of the outbreak situation in
Thailand and abroad becoming more severe owing to virus mutations, as well as the adequacy
of fiscal, financial, and credit measures. The Committee would stand ready to use additional
appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.
