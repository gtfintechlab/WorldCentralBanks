**The Global Economy and Financial Markets**

**The recovery of major advanced economies (AEs) and Asian economies became more**
**divergent. Economic activities in major AEs were expected to** continue to recover despite the
increasing number of cases owing to the Delta variant. This was partly due to high vaccination
rates which allowed for more relaxation of containment measures. Meanwhile, Asian
economies were hit harder from the Delta variant relative to AEs and thus needed to reimpose strict containment measures. As a result, private consumption slowed down despite a
sharp rebound prior to the spread of virus mutations. Merchandise exports were expected to
continue to recover despite increasing impacts from global supply disruption, such as
shortages of containers and semiconductors, which was expected to be severe and prolonged
until mid-2022.

**Volatilities in the global financial markets increased due to gradual normalization of**
**monetary policy in AEs. The Federal Reserve signaled** plans to start tapering bond purchases
and increases in federal funds rate as economic recovery and COVID-19 situation further
improved. This resulted in appreciation of the US dollar and a rise in US government bond
yields. Meanwhile, emerging market (EM) currencies and asset prices were volatile owing to
concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, monetary policy in AEs, regulatory scrutiny from the
Chinese government targeting specific industries in China, and default risks of the Evergrande
Group.[1] However, direct impacts of potential defaults on the Thai financial markets would be
limited as only a small portion of investments by Thai mutual funds had exposure to the
Evergrande Group’s bonds. On exchange rates, the baht exhibited more volatile movements
owing to monetary policy in AEs and uncertainties surrounding the Thai economic outlook.
The baht against the US dollar exhibited two-way movements in tandem with volatile global
financial markets. The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) slightly depreciated since the
previous meeting. Looking ahead, the global financial markets would remain highly volatile
given the gradual normalization of monetary policy in AEs and the recovery divergence
between AEs and EMs, as well as among EMs.

1 The Evergrande Group is the second largest real estate developer in China. In 2021, the company faced severe
liquidity problems with a high probability of default. This was due to (1) persistent and high debt accumulation
and (2) the Chinese government policy to promote financial stability in the property sector and to reduce risks
in the financial system. At present, the Evergrande Group’s debt was approximately 350 billion US dollars (2
percent of Chinese GDP).

**Domestic Economy**

**The Thai economy was projected to expand 0.7 and 3.9 percent in 2021 and 2022,**
**respectively, largely unchanged from the August projection. Although the economy in the**
third quarter of 2021 was affected by containment measures and a slowdown in exports,
significant progress on vaccination and earlier-than-expected relaxation of containment
measures would help restore private sector confidence and boost private consumption for the
rest of 2021. The economy would gradually recover in 2022 as improving confidence would
help support domestic spending. Foreign tourist figures were expected to recover slowly,
while merchandise exports would continue to be affected by global supply disruption. Higher
shipping costs mainly contributed to the temporary current account deficit of 15.3 billion US
dollars in 2021. More than half of this larger deficit compared with the June projection was
attributable to a sharp rise in freight costs. The current account balance was projected to turn
a slight surplus of 1 billion US dollars in 2022, as the shortages of containers and
semiconductors would begin to subside in the middle of 2022. Meanwhile, the labor market
would remain fragile, although labor income in the services sector and the self-employed
improved somewhat in line with economic activities.

**Headline inflation was projected to decline in 2021 relative to the previous projection and**
**stay close to the lower bound of the target range.** The downward revision was mainly
attributable to lower raw food prices and an extension of the government’s electricity bill
subsidy measure to help reduce costs of living. Crude oil prices were expected to rise
temporarily mainly due to the effects of Hurricane Ida in the US. In 2022, headline inflation
was projected to increase in tandem with higher raw food prices as the agricultural
oversupply problem was expected to be resolved following the resumption of exports. Core
inflation would remain subdued owing to weak domestic demand. Medium-term inflation
expectations remained anchored within the target range.

**The Thai economy would remain subject to significant uncertainties going forward.** These
uncertainties included (1) severity of domestic COVID-19 outbreak, virus mutation, relaxation
of the containment measures, as well as the country’s reopening plan, (2) recovery in private
sector confidence following the relaxation of the containment measures and the effects on
consumption and investment, (3) continuity of government stimulus to support the economic
recovery in the period ahead, and (4) global supply disruption and the increase in shipping costs
that could affect manufacturing and merchandise exports.

**Discussions by the Committee**

  - **The Committee assessed that the Thai economy had bottomed out in the third**

**quarter of 2021 and would continue to recover, but uncertainties surrounding the**
**economic outlook remained high. Pent-up demand was expected to support the**
economic recovery throughout the rest of 2021, following the progress on vaccination
and earlier-than-expected relaxation of containment measures. Consequently, the
projection remained close to the previous figures despite exports slowdown.
**However, the government plan to import and distribute vaccines, together with the**
**recovery in economic activities,** **needed to be monitored. The latter included (1) a**
recovery in private sector confidence and private consumption that could be delayed

in the case of recurring outbreaks, (2) the global supply disruption that would continue
to affect exports sector, and (3) foreign tourist arrivals that would gradually recover in
line with the re-opening of Thailand and other countries especially China. **The**
**Committee viewed that recovery across sectors would be increasingly uneven, and**
that could lead to a more fragile labor market. Unemployment and underemployment
was estimated to reach approximately 3.4 million persons by the end of 2021, mainly
from workers in the services sector and self-employed persons. This was reflected in
an increase in the number of employees in the social security system who applied for
unemployment benefits. In addition, more workers migrated back to their home
provinces. Thus, the government should address vulnerabilities in the labor market in
an adequate and continuous manner to reduce long-term economic scars after the
outbreak subsided.

- **The Committee viewed that the most important issue for the Thai economy at present**

**was the implementation of public health measures that would help facilitate economic**
**and income recovery. The measures should strike a balance between containing the**
**outbreak and facilitating economic activities, which would help boost confidence and**
the recovery of households and businesses. Going forward, the Committee expected that
higher vaccination rates would reduce the number of severe cases to be within the
capacity of the public health system. Strict containment measures would thus be less
needed, and the government could expedite measures to facilitate economic activities
back to normal.

- **The Committee viewed fiscal policy as the main driver to provide relief and to support**

economic recovery. Going forward, fiscal policy could focus on measures to restore
income as well as measures to rehabilitate and raise long-term potential growth of the
Thai economy. In addition, the Committee viewed that raising the public debt ceiling to
**70 percent of GDP would allow the government to continue expediting additional**
**policies to support economic recovery. The public debt-to-GDP ratio would eventually**
decline thanks to economic expansion and the government’s ability to collect more
revenues. Government spending should emphasize **on** **productive projects such as co-**
payment schemes with high fiscal multipliers. In addition, government spending should
be transparent and verifiable. In the period ahead, the government should prepare a
clear guideline to reduce public debt-to-GDP ratio to preserve fiscal discipline and build
up fiscal space to accommodate potential risks by, for instance, (1) generating additional
government revenues by expanding tax bases and (2) scaling up capital expenditure
relative to current expenditures, which would contribute to long-term economic growth.

- **The Committee assessed that monetary policy must contribute to accommodative**

**financial conditions. Despite ample liquidity in the banking system, there was an issue of**
distributing liquidity to the affected businesses and households. Nonetheless, the first
phase of special loan facility starting from April to September of 2021 had helped SMEs to
gain access to credit worth more than 100 billion baht, reaching the target of the first six
months. Financial and credit measures have made significant progress, especially the
special loan facility that was well-distributed in terms of borrowers and their credit risk
profiles. **However, some additional policies should be expedited to distribute liquidity**
**to those affected in a targeted and continuous manner. These included (1) the second**


-----

phase of the special loan facility of which conditions and credit guarantee criteria were
revised to help enhance credit access for borrowers with high credit risks, as well as
expanding credit lines for borrowers with low credit lines or those who had never been
issued credit, (2) the asset warehousing scheme, (3) other measures under specialized
financial institutions (SFIs) such as loans for affected SMEs and retail borrowers, and (4)
debt restructuring through financial institutions should be expedited to have broader
impacts and be consistent with borrowers’ long-term debt serviceability. For example,
a further relaxation in asset classification and provisioning criteria would reduce the costs
for financial institutions and allow them to assist borrowers more sustainably than
repayment extension. Furthermore, the reduction in the FIDF fee to 0.23 percent was
extended until the end of 2022, which would allow financial institutions to continuously
transfer the lower costs to aid businesses and households.

**Monetary Policy Decision**

**The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent to support the**
**economic recovery which remained highly uncertain.**

**The Committee assessed that the Thai economy in 2021 and 2022 would expand close to**
**the projection from the previous meeting, but uncertainties surrounding the economic**
**outlook remained high.** Nonetheless, the progress on vaccination and the earlier-thanexpected relaxation of the containment measures would help support the economy in the
period ahead. The most important issue for the Thai economy at present was the
implementation of public health measures that would help facilitate the economic and
income recovery. The Committee viewed that government measures should be expedited to
support the economic recovery. Despite some progress on financial measures, liquidity
distribution and debt restructuring should be expedited further for those who were affected.
**The Committee viewed that financial measures would be more effective than a further**
**reduction in the policy rate, which was already low, and thus voted to maintain the policy**
**rate.**

**The Committee assessed that the baht exhibited more volatile movements due to domestic**
**and external factors. The baht against the US dollar exhibited two-way movements,**
appreciating after the relaxation of containment measures but depreciated quickly as central
banks in AEs signaled gradual normalization. Investor concerns over the global economic
recovery and the default risks of the Evergrande Group, which could escalate into a systematic
risk, also contributed to volatile exchange rates. The Committee would thus closely monitor
developments in both global and domestic financial markets to maintain exchange rate
stability and ensure that exchange rate movements would not hinder business adjustments.
The Committee would also continuously expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem to
adjust the Thai foreign exchange markets structure to be more balanced and flexible.

**The Committee viewed that the government measures and policy coordination among**
**government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery.** Public health
measures should strike a balance between containing the outbreak and supporting the
recovery of economic activities and income. Fiscal measures should help facilitate the
economic recovery by emphasizing on generating income and preparing measures to raise
potential growth. Monetary policy must contribute to continued accommodative financial


-----

conditions overall. Financial and credit measures should be expedited to distribute liquidity
to affected groups in a targeted manner and help reduce debt burden. These measure
included the second phase of the special loan facility, the asset warehousing scheme, and
other measures by SFIs. In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring
to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers’ long-term debt serviceability.

Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability,
supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability,
**the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery. In**
addition, the Committee would monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook, namely
implementation and relaxation of the domestic containment measures as well as the
adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures. The Committee would stand ready to use
additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.
