**The Global Economy and Financial Markets**

**While the global economy would continue to recover, growth divergence between major**
**advanced economies and Asian economies would be more apparent. Major advanced**
economies would continue to recover thanks to the significant progress of COVID-19
vaccination. Meanwhile, economic activities in Asian economies were affected by the more
severe outbreak and virus mutations in several countries. In the period ahead, the global
economic recovery would remain highly uncertain as the outbreak could become more severe
due to virus mutations, particularly in countries with slow vaccination progress and limited
access to effective vaccines.

**Concerns in the global financial markets heightened due to the COVID-19 outbreak**
**situation, which became more severe in several countries, especially in emerging markets**
with low vaccination rates. This led to risk-off sentiments among investors and a decline in the
holdings of risky assets such as equities and an increase in the holdings of safe assets such as
government bonds. The Thai financial markets moved in line with other regional markets with
a decline in Thai stock market index and government bond yields. On exchange rates, the Thai baht
and the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) depreciated since the previous meeting.
The baht depreciated against the US dollar more than regional currencies due to an intensified
COVID-19 outbreak situation and the outlook of slow economic recovery in Thailand.

**Looking ahead, volatility in the global financial markets would remain high and could weigh**
**on the Thai financial markets. Significant risks included the COVID-19 outbreak situation,**
which remained highly uncertain and could intensify in many countries, and the US fiscal and
monetary policy outlook. In particular, should the US economy continue to recover and
inflation continue to rise, the Federal Reserve might tighten the monetary policy faster than
market expected.

**Domestic Economy and Financial Stability**

**The Thai economy would expand at a much slower rate due to stricter COVID- 19**
**containment measures, which would impinge on economic activities and domestic demand.**
The Committee assessed that the Thai economy was projected to expand by 0.7 and 3.7
percent in 2021 and 2022 respectively. This would be significantly lower than the June
projection owing to private consumption which was greatly affected this year and foreign
tourist figures which were expected to be significantly lower next year. The labor market


-----

would be more fragile, particularly the services sector and the self- employed, which
experienced income losses. Nevertheless, key growth drivers going forward were as follows.
First, public expenditure would be higher thanks to the new Emergency Decree authorizing
a 500 billion baht borrowing which would somewhat shore up household purchasing power
and mitigate impacts from the latest wave of the outbreak. Second, merchandise exports
were expected to register a strong growth on the back of external demand recovery of
trading partners, although some manufacturing and export sectors would experience
supply constraints. Headwinds included, for example, reduced working hours in the manufacturing
sector after the government imposed stricter containment measures as well as global
shortages of containers and raw materials, particularly electronic parts. **Headline inflation**
**would remain unchanged, while core inflation would still be subdued owing to weak domestic**
demand. Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target.

**There remain significant downside risks to the economic outlook. First, the outbreak**
situation in Thailand and other countries could become more severe. This was due particularly to
virus mutations which could reduce vaccine efficacy. Slow vaccination progress could also lead to
a more prolonged and severe public health crisis. Second, financial positions of businesses,
especially the services sector, that became more vulnerable could lead to widespread
business closures and lay-offs. Third, supply constraints, especially owing to factory outbreaks
and temporary shortages of raw materials, could become more severe and prolonged,
thus affecting the manufacturing and export sectors more than expected. Such constraints
were expected to alleviate in the first half of 2022.

**The financial system would be more vulnerable. The latest wave of the outbreak aggravated**
income and the already fragile financial positions of households and businesses, thereby
increasing the likelihood of debt at risk. Nevertheless, financial positions of financial
institutions remained robust and could accommodate deteriorating credit quality in the future.
Therefore, the impacts from the aforementioned risks on overall financial stability would
still be limited.


**Discussions by the Committee**


**The Committee discussed risks to the Thai economy due to the impacts of potentially more**
**severe and prolonged outbreak, measures that should be urgently implemented, as well as**
**monetary policy and financial measures. The details were as followed.**

  - **The Committee assessed that the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Thai economy**

**were larger than the previous assessment, and there remained significant downside**
**risks that the outbreak could become more severe and prolonged than expected.**
Vaccine distribution which would take some time could cause the numbers of new and
critical cases to increase continuously and exceed the health system capacity.
Containment measures that could become stricter and prolonged would further
dampen economic activities. Meanwhile, business and consumer confidence could fall
significantly in line with declining income. This would in turn affect the consumption
outlook. The prolonged outbreak resulted in a more uneven recovery across different
sectors, a more fragile labor market, and potential long- term scarring effects
especially on employment in the services sector and among self-employed workers
whose working hours began to decline. More workers also migrated back to their


-----

home provinces. In addition, the labor market was expected to recover slowly as
reflected by the rising number of the long-term unemployed and newly-graduated
unemployed as well as persons outside the labor force.

- **The Committee viewed that the most important issue for the Thai economy**

**at present was to accelerate containment of the outbreak and prevention of**
**the spread, especially the procurement and distribution of effective vaccines in**
**a timely manner.** This would help reduce the infections to the level compatible with
the health system capacity and allow for the relaxation of the containment measures. This
would contribute to a gradual pickup in economic activities. **Fiscal measures should**
help alleviate the adverse impacts and support the economy by more actively
addressing unemployment and vulnerabilities in the business sector in an adequate
and timely manner. The public debt-to-GDP ratio could rise and exceed 60 percent.
Nonetheless, this would not pose a significant risk to fiscal sustainability if the budget
were to be spent efficiently towards shoring up the economy that was facing high risks
in the short run and supporting economic restructuring to raise potential growth.
Subsequently, the public debt-to-GDP ratio could fall in the long run. Monetary policy
must contribute to continued accommodative financial conditions. The baht recently
depreciated and thus did not hinder the economic recovery. Government bond yields
and commercial bank lending rates remained low. However, ample liquidity was not
distributed to the affected businesses and households. Financial and credit measures
should thus be adjusted quickly to enhance effectiveness and to have broader
impacts. Although the special loan facility had helped facilitate access to credits for
SMEs and the two-month loan payment holiday helped ease debt burden somewhat,
the latest wave of the outbreak would likely be prolonged and have larger impacts on
the economy than expected. Thus, liquidity distribution should be expedited and
financial institutions should effectively help reduce debt burden for borrowers by, for
instance, applying debt restructuring methods that were consistent with long-term
borrowers’ debt serviceability. Furthermore, the Committee viewed that there should
be additional measures that were designed to incentivize less affected households and
businesses with high savings to increase spending and stimulate domestic demand
going forward.

- **The Committee extensively discussed the effectiveness of monetary policy**

**transmission in the current situation, the net benefits of the policy rate reduction to**
**the economy, as well as various policy options. The Committee agreed that financial**
**measures could help those who were affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in a more**
**targeted manner than the policy rate reduction.** The Committee viewed that, first,
the important issue at present would be the distribution of the ample liquidity in the
banking system to businesses and households with high credit risks. Second, the
slowdown in economic activities was a consequence of disease containment.
Meanwhile, overall financial conditions remained accommodative and helped
financial institutions to provide support for borrowers through various ongoing
financial measures. Third, financial measures, particularly the special soft loan facility
that helped alleviate liquidity constraints for the affected groups and debt
restructuring which helped address elevated debt problems, would be more effective


-----

and targeted than the reduction in the policy rate which was a blunt instrument.
Despite the broad-based impacts, the policy rate cut would only marginally reduce
debt burden for vulnerable groups. **Nonetheless, some members viewed that the**
**policy rate cut at this meeting would be a preemptive action against the potential**
**economic slowdown in the period ahead.** They assessed that the previously
implemented financial and fiscal measures might have some limitations and remain
inadequate. Meanwhile, monetary policy would take some time before the impacts
reached the economy. They thus voted to cut the policy rate at this meeting, although
the policy rate was deemed less targeted and effective than other financial and fiscal
measures, to mitigate heightening risks in the period ahead.

**Monetary Policy Decision**

**The Committee voted 4 to 2 to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent. Two members voted**
**to cut the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point. One MPC member was unable to attend the**
**meeting.**

**The Committee assessed that the Thai economy in 2021 would be affected by the COVID-**
**19 outbreak more than expected with significant downside risks. The most important issue**
for the Thai economy at present was to accelerate containment of the outbreak and
distribution of vaccines to restore confidence and support the recovery in economic activities
and income. Fiscal and financial measures must be expedited to assist affected groups in a
more targeted and timely manner in line with the situation. The Committee viewed that risks
to the economic outlook remained high. The support must be provided by accelerating the
distribution of liquidity and debt burden reduction for those who were affected. **Most**
**members viewed that financial measures would be more effective than a further reduction**
**in the policy rate which was already low and thus voted to maintain the policy rate.**
**Nevertheless, two members voted for a policy rate reduction as a supplement to other**
**measures in shoring up the economy and mitigate heightened risks in the period ahead.**

**The Committee would continue to monitor developments in foreign exchange markets and**
**capital flows. The baht exhibited more volatile movement and could depreciate more than**
regional currencies owing to domestic factors. The Committee would thus closely monitor
developments in both global and domestic financial markets to maintain exchange rate
stability and ensure that the exchange rate would not hinder business adjustments.
The Committee would also continuously expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem to
improve the structure of the Thai foreign exchange markets over the medium term.
The Committee viewed that by encouraging Thai institutional investors to increase their
portfolio investments abroad, it would facilitate capital outflows and improve the balance
between capital inflows and outflows.

**The Committee viewed that the government measures and policy coordination among**
**government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery.** Public health
measures should aim at accelerating the procurement and distribution of effective vaccines
to prevent the outbreak from being prolonged. Fiscal measures should help alleviate the
adverse impacts and support the economy by more actively addressing vulnerabilities in the
labor market and business sector in an adequate and timely manner. Monetary policy must


-----

contribute to continued accommodative financial conditions overall. Financial and credit
measures should be adjusted in a timely manner to enhance effectiveness, thereby expediting
the distribution of liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner and help reduce
debt burden. Such measures included the special loan facility, asset warehousing scheme,
and other measures by specialized financial institutions (SFIs). In addition, financial institutions
should accelerate debt restructuring to have broader impacts and be consistent with
borrowers’ long-term debt serviceability.

Under the monetary policy framework with the objectives of maintaining price stability,
supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability,
**the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery.**
In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook,
namely the distribution and efficacy of vaccines, the outbreak situation in Thailand and
abroad, as well as the adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures. The Committee
would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.
