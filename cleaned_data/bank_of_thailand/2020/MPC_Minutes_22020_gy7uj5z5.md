**The Financial Markets**

**Since the special meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, there were improvements in Thai**
**financial market conditions, especially the bond markets, due to the policy rate cut and the**
**announcement of measures to stabilize financial markets. These actions partly helped build up**
confidence and alleviate liquidity strain in the financial markets. Thai government bond yields
declined immediately after the policy rate cut. Some investors slowed their sell-off of Thai
government bonds after the Bank of Thailand and related agencies announced measures to
stabilize the Thai financial markets.[2] Furthermore, Thai government bond yields fell in tandem
with yields in global financial markets after the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central
Bank (ECB) announced additional measures. The baht weakened against the US dollar due to the
policy rate cut and the intensified situation of coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in Thailand.

**Domestic Economic Conditions and Financial Stability**

**The Committee viewed that the economic and inflation outlook remained consistent with the**
**assessment at the special meeting. The Thai economy would markedly contract in 2020 due**
**mainly to the COVID-19 outbreak and would affect a large number of related businesses and**
**employment. Tourist figures were expected to substantially decline from the previous forecast.**
Merchandise exports were expected to shrink in tandem with a significant slowdown in trading
partner economies and the impact of supply chain disruptions. As a result, domestic demand was
projected to contract in all components except for public expenditure which would grow at a
lower rate than expected owing to the delayed enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act.
**The Committee therefore projected that the Thai economy would contract by 5.3 percent in**

1 Mr. Suthiwart-Narueput attended the meeting through video conference to consider the economic outlook,
financial stability, and appropriate monetary policy formulation but did not vote.

2 The Bank of Thailand, the Ministry of Finance, and the Securities and Exchange Commission announced measures
to stabilize Thai financial markets on 22 March 2020 in order to prevent a deterioration in financial market liquidity.
The measures consisted of (1) providing liquidity for mutual funds affected by liquidity shortage through the Mutual
Fund Liquidity Facility (MFLF), (2) reducing rollover risks in the corporate bond market by establishing the Corporate
Bond Liquidity Stabilization Fund (BSF), and (3) the Bank of Thailand standing ready to purchase government bonds
and consider additional measures if necessary.

**2020 but would recover in 2021 and expand 3.0 percent,** provided that the virus spread in
Thailand could be contained in accordance with the Ministry of Public Health estimate, and that
the tourist figures would gradually recover. The annual average of headline inflation in 2020
**would be negative at -1.0 percent. In 2021, it would be at 0.3 percent, which would remain**
**below the inflation target. This would be owing to a rapid decline in crude oil prices, resulting in**
negative energy inflation. Moreover, core inflation was projected to be negative in line with a
large decline in demand-pull inflationary pressures, despite a slight rise in fresh food prices due
to the drought.

**The Committee assessed that the economic and inflation forecasts were subject to very high**
**uncertainties, with global and domestic economic and trade structures changing after the**
**COVID-19 spread subsided. External and domestic uncertainties** were as follows. First, the
COVID-19 spread could become either more severe and prolonged than expected, or otherwise
if vaccines and medicines could be discovered earlier than anticipated. Second, risks pertaining
to global financial stability could impact the Thai economy in the medium term. Third, geopolitical
risks could intensify, while trade protectionism and the outcomes of the trade deal between the
United Kingdom and the European Union remained unclear. Fourth, additional government
stimulus measures could be forthcoming, or the measures could have lower impacts than
expected. Finally, a more-severe-than-expected drought could affect agricultural output and
income, with the agricultural sector unable to absorb labor from other sectors.

**The Committee viewed that risks in the overall financial system increased due to the severe**
**economic downturn which affected household and business incomes, causing deterioration in**
**debt servicing capability and credit quality. In addition, liquidity in the financial system,**
**especially in the bond market, became tightened. The Committee would closely monitor various**
risks and vulnerabilities and encouraged the Bank of Thailand to prepare policy tools to be readily
employed to maintain financial system stability given various situations. The Committee also
supported close coordination between the Bank of Thailand and other related regulatory
agencies to stand ready to prevent systemic risks in a pre-emptive manner.

**Monetary Policy Decision**

The Committee viewed that the policy rate cut at the previous special meeting as well as the
implemented measures to promote stability in the Thai financial markets helped ease financial
conditions. Commercial bank lending rates gradually declined and stability of domestic financial
markets, especially the bond market, improved. Most members would wait to assess the
adjustments in the financial markets as well as additional reduction in interest rates by financial
institutions. Most members deemed it appropriate to preserve policy space to cushion against
high uncertainties in the future. Meanwhile, all members viewed that the government’s
announced relief measures and loan repayment measures to assist borrowers affected by

COVID-19[3] were more targeted in addressing the problems. The Committee thus voted 4 to 2 to
**maintain the policy rate at 0.75 percent. Two members voted to cut the policy rate by 0.25**
**percentage point from 0.75 to 0.50 percent as the extra accommodative monetary policy would,**
in their view, be commensurate with the significant economic contraction.

**The Committee viewed that the current challenges faced by the economy and financial system**
**were different from those during the financial crisis in 1997. At present, Thailand had an ample**
**level of international reserves. Moreover, financial institutions were sound with a high level of**
**capital funds. Liquidity in the financial system remained adequate at the macro level. The key**
**challenge was to urgently provide liquidity and credit supports to affected businesses and**
**households. In particular, measures that allowed for debt moratorium, reduced interest**
**payments, and extended debt repayment period would help alleviate the immediate impacts.**
**For the next step, debt restructuring must be urgently and constantly implemented in parallel**
**with distribution of liquidity, which was ample at the macro level, to businesses and**
**households in need.** Examples of such measures could include provision of soft loans for
businesses and households with the potential to repay their loans as well as credit guarantees so
that loans could be allocated to SMEs more efficiently. Such measures could help those affected
to get through this period.

**The Committee** **viewed that targeted measures designed to address liquidity strain of those**
**who were affected would be crucial. The Committee also viewed that, under the situation**
**where the adverse impacts could become intensified and widespread, the Bank of Thailand**
**had been working closely with financial institutions and other financial service providers in a**
**timely manner** to urgently determine minimum measures to reduce interest burdens and
provide additional liquidity to retail and corporate borrowers with the potential to repay their
loans. The Committee also viewed that loan repayment measures to assist borrowers affected
by COVID-19 and the government’s relief measures were timely and more targeted than the
policy rate cut in addressing the problems and effectively helped relieve the impacts of the
COVID-19 spread. Furthermore, the Committee **viewed that close coordination between**
**financial and fiscal policies was** **needed** **and** **encouraged collaboration among related public**
**and private organizations** **to speed up implementation of various financial and fiscal measures**
**to shore up and support** **economic recovery in the period ahead.**

**Looking ahead, the Committee would be data-dependent by closely monitoring the economic**
**growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with other associated risks, especially**
the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, in deliberating monetary policy going forward.

3 The Bank of Thailand announced the measures on 25 March 2020. These measures were results of coordination
between the Bank of Thailand and nine agencies including (1) the Thai Bankers’ Association, (2) the Association of
International Banks, (3) the Government Financial Institutions Association, (4) the Thailand Leasing Association,
(5) the Thai Hire-Purchase Association, (6) the Vehicle Title Loan Trade Association, (7) the Thai Motorcycle HirePurchase Association, (8) the Credit Card Club–Thai Bankers’ Association, and (9) the Personal Loan Club.

The Committee would stand ready to use additional policy tools in an appropriate and timely
manner. Such tools included the policy rate and other monetary measures that would help
enhance the policy rate transmission as well as loan extension by financial institutions to reach
the target groups.
