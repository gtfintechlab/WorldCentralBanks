**The Global Economy**

**Trading partner economies would expand at a slower pace. Advanced economies** **and China**
were expected to grow at a slower pace in line with manufacturing production and exports
owing to intensifying and expanding international trade tensions. The prolonged trade tensions
began to affect consumption and investment confidence. Asian economies (excluding Japan
and China) would grow moderately due to a fall in merchandise exports. Merchandise exports
would contract in line with the global economy and trade volume that were affected by trade
protectionism, the Japan–Korea dispute and a longer-than-expected down cycle of electronic
products. Overall **monetary policy of trading partners in both advanced and regional**
economies would be more accommodative to shore up the weakening economic outlook. The
Federal Reserve (Fed) cut its policy rate in July 2019, and one additional rate cut was expected
within this year. The European Central Bank (ECB), despite having kept its policy rate unchanged
so far, began signaling more accommodative monetary policy stance. The ECB could cut its
policy rate if economic growth weakened significantly and could also inject additional liquidity
into the financial system through the third Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations
(TLTRO III). Monetary policy stance of regional central banks such as the Bank of Korea, Bank
Indonesia, and the Reserve Bank of India became more accommodative. Moreover, the Reserve
Bank of Australia and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut their policy rates as well.

**The Committee assessed that trading partner economies and global trade volume would**
**expand at a slower pace due to (1) trade protectionism that could be prolonged and intensified,**
after the US announced a prospective 10% tariff on 300 billion US dollars’ worth of Chinese
imports and designated China as a currency manipulator, and (2) increased risks of a no-deal
Brexit. The Committee would thus closely monitor developments in advanced economies and
China that could affect domestic demand, together with geopolitical risks that could become
widespread. The Committee would consider potential impacts on the Thai economy through
various linkages, as well as consider monetary policy stance of various countries that could
affect capital flows and the Thai baht.

**The Financial Markets**

**More accommodative monetary policy stance of advanced economy and regional central**
**banks partially shored up sentiments in financial markets. In particular, the likelihood of the**
Fed and ECB policy rate cuts during the rest of this year increased. Nevertheless, concerns in
global financial markets grew due to intensifying and expanding trade tensions, especially after
the US announced additional tariffs on Chinese imports and designated China as a currency
manipulator. Together with the weakening global economic outlook, these factors increased


-----

volatility in most asset prices and lowered risky asset prices. Regarding domestic financial
markets, there were capital outflows from the short-term Thai government bond market
following the Bank of Thailand’s announcement of measures to enhance surveillance of shortterm capital flows in July. Meanwhile, there were persistent capital inflows into long-term Thai
government bond and equity markets due to (1) an increase in the weights of Thai assets in the
MSCI indices and (2) an upgrade in Thailand’s sovereign credit rating outlook by some credit
rating agencies. Long-term Thai government bond yields declined in line with long-term US
government bond yields as a result of more accommodative monetary policy stance.

On exchange rates, the measures to enhance surveillance of short-term capital flows limited in
part the channels through which speculation on baht appreciation could occur. The volatility of
the baht against the US dollar gradually subsided. The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER)
depreciated slightly. Nonetheless, after the US announced tariffs on Chinese imports and
designated China as a currency manipulator, investors sold off assets in Asia due to the region’s
high interconnectedness with China. Safe-haven asset prices rose, including the yen, gold, and
the baht. In addition, Thailand faced a significant current account surplus. At the same time,
gold trading activities by domestic investors put selling pressures on the US dollar. These factors
caused the baht to strengthen against the US dollar and the NEER to appreciate since the
previous meeting.

**The Committee viewed that financial markets would remain highly uncertain going forward**
**due to various factors, including (1) prolonged trade tensions which could intensify and**
broaden to other countries, (2) increased likelihood of a no-deal Brexit, and (3) monetary policy
stance of advanced economy central banks, especially the Fed and the ECB, which could lead to
more volatile asset prices and exchange rates. Furthermore, the Committee remained
concerned about baht appreciation against trading partner currencies, which could affect the
economy to a larger degree amid intensifying trade tensions. The Committee also noted that
Thai assets remained supported by sound external fundamentals and that Thailand had low
exposure to adverse impacts of trade protectionism compared with other countries. These
factors could continue to pressure the baht in the period ahead. The Committee would
therefore closely monitor developments of exchange rates and capital flows as well as assess
the need of additional appropriate measures.

**Domestic Economic Conditions and Financial Stability**

**The Thai economy would expand at a slower pace than previously estimated and below its**
**potential. The slowdown was due to merchandise exports contraction that started to affect**
domestic demand. Merchandise exports were expected to contract more than the previous
assessment due to the slowdown of trading partner economies and global trade volume owing
to intensifying and expanding trade tensions as well as a longer-than-expected down cycle of
electronic products. In addition, there was a sign that exports in the third quarter of this year
would contract more than previously assessed. Exports of services would grow at a lower rate
due to the global economic slowdown and the impact of baht appreciation on some tourist
nationalities. Private consumption was expected to decelerate more than previously assessed
on account of (1) declining non-farm income and employment, particularly overtime
employment in the export-related manufacturing sectors, and (2) declining farm income caused
by drought. Moreover, consumption would be restrained by elevated debt, while consumer


-----

confidence weakened. Nevertheless, government stimulus measures would support
consumption in the period ahead to some extent. Private investment would expand at a slower
pace, partly as a result of the continuing export contraction and moderating domestic demand
while investment confidence softened. However, the relocation of production base to Thailand
and public-private partnership projects for infrastructure investment would support
investment going forward. **Public expenditure would grow at a slower pace than previously**
assessed partly because of budget disbursement constraints as well as the expected delay in
the enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, B.E. 2563 (A.D. 2020).

**The Committee engaged in extensive discussion about the Thai economic outlook,**
**particularly domestic demand which was showing signs of a slowdown. Moderating private**
investment and employment in export-related manufacturing sectors would weigh on
consumption in the period ahead. The Committee thus saw the need to closely monitor
(1) developments in the labor market especially temporary contract employees, non-farm and
farm income, and household debt serviceability that could have implications for future
consumption, and (2) the relocation of production base to Thailand, together with policy
implementation by the new government, public expenditure, and the progress of major
infrastructure investment that would have knock-on effects on future private investment. The
Committee also noted that new government policies should be careful not to encourage
additional household leverage that could aggravate household debt, which constituted a
structural problem that had weighed on private consumption for some period.

The annual average of headline inflation was projected to be below the lower bound of the
inflation target. Although fresh food inflation would be slightly higher than the previous
projection in tandem with higher-than-expected fruit prices, the increase could not offset the
decline in energy and core inflation. Energy inflation would weaken in line with lower-thanexpected Dubai crude oil prices resulting from slower global economic growth. Core inflation
would decrease on the back of subdued demand-pull inflationary pressures. Short-term and
long-term inflation expectations remained close to the previous assessment. The Committee
viewed that structural changes contributed to a more persistent inflation than in the past. Such
changes included the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and technological
development which reduced costs of production.

**Financial system risks still posed vulnerabilities to financial stability. On leverage, household**
debt in the second quarter of this year continuously increased in line with credit expansion of
commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions. Expansion in consumer loans, especially
personal loans, for which lending standards became more lenient, warranted monitoring. The
Bank of Thailand had worked with commercial banks to standardize debt service ratio (DSR)
calculation in order to collate DSR data should additional measures intended to curb household
debt become necessary in the future. Moreover, the share of households sensitive to negative
income shocks had increased, which could weigh on household debt serviceability. Therefore,
the channels through which negative income shocks could affect such households during an
economic slowdown and drought conditions should be closely monitored. Meanwhile,
corporate debt grew at a slower pace, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in
manufacturing and trade sectors. The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of corporate debt was
largely stable due to credit portfolio quality management. Regarding the property sector, after


-----

the implementation of the revised loan-to-value (LTV) measure, adjustments of households and
commercial banks were in line with target. Speculation abated as reflected in (1) the slower
growth of new mortgage loans, especially for high-rise units in the second quarter of this year,
and (2) the decline in house prices consistent with real estate demand. Moreover, commercial
banks’ credit underwriting standards were tighter. The average LTV and repayment tenor
declined while the loan-to-income (LTI) ratio was stable. Nevertheless, **search-for-yield**
**behavior that led to underpricing of risks still persisted in the prolonged low interest rate**
environment. This was reflected in expanding investments in high-yield mutual funds such as
foreign investment funds (FIF), which posed concentration risks in some countries. The asset
size of saving cooperatives subsided in line with moderating deposits and equities of members.
Nevertheless, large corporates increased their fundraising in the prolonged low interest rate
environment through the bond and loan markets.

**The Committee viewed that the macroprudential measures previously implemented helped**
**curb vulnerabilities in the financial system to some extent. The Committee would continuously**
monitor (1) the impacts of the revised LTV measure and the ensuing property sector
developments, (2) adjustments of property developers and the oversupply situation, (3) the
asset size of and the interconnectedness among saving cooperatives, and (4) fundraising by
large corporates that might underprice risks. Moreover, the Committee viewed that household
debt was a critical and urgent structural risk that would require a multi-dimensional resolution.
Cooperation between various parties was needed to reduce leverage and to restructure existing
debt. In this light, greater emphasis should be placed on borrowers’ debt serviceability. The
Committee thus directed a study of additional appropriate measures to curb potentially
increased risks in the future.

**Monetary Policy Decision**

The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a lower rate than previously
assessed due to contraction in merchandise exports that started to affect domestic demand.
Headline inflation was projected to be below the lower bound of the inflation target. Overall
financial conditions remained accommodative. Financial stability had already been taken care
of to some extent, although there remained pockets of risks that warranted monitoring. Most
Committee members judged that a more accommodative monetary policy stance would
contribute to the continuation of economic growth and should support the rise of headline
inflation toward target. The Committee therefore voted 5 to 2 to cut the policy rate by 0.25
**percentage point from 1.75 to 1.50 percent. Two members voted to maintain the policy rate**
**at 1.75 percent.**

**The Committee discussed key considerations underpinning the policy decision. Their**
**conclusions were as follows.**

**1) The Thai economy was expected to expand at a slower pace than previously assessed** **and**
**below potential. This would be mainly due to merchandise exports that contracted more than**
previously expected in tandem with the slowdown of trading partner economies and global
trade volume as a result of intensifying and expanding trade tensions. Going forward, the
situation could be aggravated and become prolonged. This would affect global trade volume
and trading partners’ demand more than previously assessed. Moreover, the tourism sector


-----

would grow at a slower pace in line with the global economic outlook, with some tourist
nationalities affected by the baht appreciation. Furthermore, the impacts of merchandise
export slowdown on domestic demand started to be seen. Private consumption and investment
would decelerate due to (1) weakening household and business confidence, (2) contracting
non-farm income and employment in export-oriented manufacturing sectors, (3) declining farm
income which was partly affected by drought, and (4) restrained household purchasing power
due to elevated household debt. Meanwhile, public expenditure would decelerate more than
previously assessed as a result of budget disbursement constraints and the expected delay in
the enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, B.E. 2563 (A.D. 2020).

**The Committee viewed that the Thai economy would encounter heightened uncertainties**
**mainly from the external front that could affect the growth prospect going forward. These**
uncertainties included, in particular, (1) trade protectionism that could be prolonged and
expanded, (2) a worse-than-expected growth outlook for advanced economies and China that
could affect domestic demand, as well as the increased likelihood of no-deal Brexit and
heightened geopolitical risks, and (3) more accommodative monetary policy stance of advanced
economy and regional central banks. In addition, the Committee would continue to monitor
policy implementation by the new government as well as public expenditure, together with the
progress of major infrastructure investment and its knock-on effects on private investment,
which could affect growth in the period ahead.

**The Committee assessed that sustained exchange rate appreciation might result in greater**
**effects on exports amid the slowdown in trading partner economies and heightened**
**international competition.** Signs of impacts on profits, debt serviceability, and overtime
employment cuts began to be seen in some export-related sectors. If these impacts were
broadened to other sectors, the purchasing power of households related to export firms and
overall economic growth could be affected.

**2) The annual average of headline inflation was projected to be below the lower bound of the**
**inflation target due to (1) energy prices declining at a fast pace and (2) core inflation being**
lowest in nine years and projected to slow down in line with subdued demand-pull inflationary
pressures. The slower core inflation outlook was partly reflected in weaker earnings and
employment of low-income households. On the other hand, fresh food prices were expected
to rise. The Committee viewed that inflation projection would face uncertainties from oil price
fluctuations, weather and drought conditions, as well as policy uncertainty regarding the
minimum wage increase this year. Nevertheless, structural changes, such as impacts from the
expansion of e-commerce, heightened price competition, and productivity upgrades which
reduced production costs, could cause inflation to rise at a slower pace than in the past.

**3) Some financial system risks which might pose vulnerabilities to future financial stability**
**had been partly addressed by the implemented macroprudential measures.** For instance,
property sector risks abated after the implementation of the revised LTV measure. This was
reflected by reduced real estate speculation and tightened commercial banks’ underwriting
standards for mortgage loans. Moreover, banks would increase caution in extending loans
during the economic downturn. However, other financial stability risks had not improved and
**warranted continued monitoring. These included high and rising household leverage as a result**
of loan expansion by commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions. In particular, more


-----

relaxed personal loan underwriting standards could encourage households to increase
vulnerabilities. The Committee would also monitor worsening debt serviceability of SMEs, as
indicated by elevated NPL and the rising trend of special mention loans (SM) amid economic
slowdown. Another financial stability risk to be monitored was search-for-yield behavior in the
prolonged low interest rate environment, which could lead to underpricing of risks, especially
those related to the cooperatives system and leverage by large corporates.

**Given the softening economic outlook and prolonged low interest rates, the Committee**
**viewed that microprudential and macroprudential measures would need to play an**
**increasing role in addressing financial stability risks. Greater emphasis should be placed on**
additional policies to resolve the structural household debt problem. Such polices included
restructuring existing debt, standardizing DSR calculation, and establishing guidelines on
responsible lending practice for financial institutions. The Committee would also consider
approaches in addressing systemic risks posed by large corporates as well as direct a study of
additional appropriate measures to curb potentially increased risks in the future.

**The Committee engaged in extensive discussion regarding the necessity of the policy rate cut**
**to 1.50 percent at this meeting. Most Committee members viewed that more accommodative**
**monetary policy would foster the continuation of economic growth and the return of**
**headline inflation to target in the context of heightened uncertainties mainly from external**
**factors. This would give both public and private sectors time to adjust to the economic**
downturn. The adjustments included restructuring household debt and preserving business
competitiveness. Meanwhile, public expenditure might not provide sufficient momentum for
the economy due to budget disbursement constraints and the delay in the enactment of the
Annual Budget Expenditure Act, B.E. 2563 (A.D. 2020). Moreover, most Committee members
viewed that the policy rate cut at this meeting would reduce pressure on the Thai baht to some
extent. The cut could also reduce the need for large policy rate cuts in the future, were the Thai
economy to slow down more than expected due to the global economy. On the other hand,
**two Committee members viewed that such a policy rate cut given the already**
**accommodative monetary policy stance might not lend additional support to economic**
**growth, compared with potentially increased financial stability risks. The effects of the policy**
rate cut would be limited in offsetting negative impacts from external factors. Moreover,
interest rates were not seen to be significant constraints for current private investment, and
there was a need to build up policy space to cushion against possible risks in the future.

**In the discussion of monetary policy outlook the Committee would monitor the developments**
of the outlook for growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks,
especially the impacts of trade protectionism, as inputs for the formulation of appropriate
monetary policy in the period ahead. Furthermore, the Committee saw the need for policy
**coordination between related public and private organizations to support growth recovery**
**and economic restructuring** given structural problems facing the Thai economy that could
affect competitiveness and growth outlook going forward. The problems should be firmly
addressed by all related parties.
