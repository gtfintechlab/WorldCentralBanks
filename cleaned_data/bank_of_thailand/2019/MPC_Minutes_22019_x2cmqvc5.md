**The Global Economy**

**Trading partner economies would expand at a slower pace. Advanced and Asian economies**
were affected by economic and political uncertainties, particularly global trade slowdown,
together with country-specific factors such as the temporary impact of US government
shutdown, extended political issues in Europe, and uncertainties of trade protectionist
measures between the US and China. These uncertainties subsequently impinged on
economic activities, especially production and merchandise exports. However, favorable
labor market conditions would bolster private consumption and drive the economy going
forward. **The Chinese economy** would expand at a slower pace despite some supports by
government measures and accommodative monetary policy. The overall **monetary policy**
**stance of trading partners would be more accommodative. The Federal Reserve (Fed) was**
expected to delay its further rate hike due to growing concerns over the economic outlook
and downward pressure of inflation. The European Central Bank (ECB) would hold its policy
rate at least through the end of 2019, which was longer than market expectations. The ECB
also announced a plan for additional liquidity injection into the financial system through
targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). The Bank of Japan (BOJ) was expected
to maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. Monetary policy stance of other
regional central banks were expected to be more accommodative, with policy rates mostly
kept unchanged throughout this year.

**The Committee assessed that there was a probability of trading partner economies’ growth**
**being lower than the baseline owing to the risks of trade negotiations between the US and**
China as well as a no-deal Brexit. **The Committee saw a need to closely monitor**
**developments of the aforementioned risks and evaluate their effects on the trading partner**
**economic outlook, particularly the rise in inventory among advanced economies during the**
fourth quarter of 2018, which would impact production and private consumption going
forward.

**The Financial Markets**

**Overall sentiments in global financial markets improved** **in the near term despite some**
**increased concerns about the global economic slowdown.** This was due to a more
accommodative monetary policy stance of the Fed and the ECB, improvement in trade
negotiations between the US and China, and a declined risk of a no-deal Brexit early in the
quarter. Foreign investors thus continuously increased holdings of risky assets. Net capital
inflows into equity markets of emerging market economies (EMs) increased, while net capital
outflows from EM bond markets slightly decreased, resulting in higher prices of risky assets

in the region. Meanwhile, Thai asset prices recently experienced additional pressures from
**political uncertainties.** The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index declined slightly, while
regional indices increased. Thai government bond yields rose slightly due to a reduction in
foreign bond holdings. On exchange rates the Thai baht depreciated slightly against the US
dollar since the previous meeting in line with regional currencies. The nominal effective
exchange rate (NEER) index also depreciated.

**The Committee viewed that global financial markets would remain highly uncertain due**
primarily to (1) monetary policy direction of advanced economies, (2) progress on trade
negotiations between the US and China, and (3) Brexit and political situation in the euro area
that could intensify and affect the global economy as well as cross-border capital flows, which
in turn could exert pressures on asset prices and regional exchange rates. Moreover, Thai
asset prices might face additional pressures from domestic uncertainties following the
announcement of election results and the formation of the new government. The Committee
would thus continue to closely monitor developments in the global financial markets and
exchange rates, as well as their impacts on the Thai economy.

**Domestic Economic Conditions**

**The Thai economy as a whole was expected to continue expanding around its potential on**
the back of domestic demand despite external demand slowdown. Private consumption was
expected to continue expanding across all product categories on the back of increasingly
broad-based improvements in both farm and non-farm income with additional supports from
government measures. Nevertheless, private consumption was restrained by elevated
household debt. **Private investment** was projected to continue expanding thanks to the
relocation of production base in some industries to Thailand, public-private partnership (PPP)
infrastructure investment projects, and favorable business sentiment. Meanwhile,
**merchandise exports would expand at a slower pace due to (1) the effect of trade**
protectionist measures between the US and China on global trade volume and trading partner
economies and (2) a down cycle of electronic products. However, merchandise exports would
later improve during the second half of 2019 due partly to (1) redirected orders from China
as well as relocation of production base in some industries to Thailand, and (2) exports of Thai
electronic parts benefitting from infrastructure investment pertaining to 5G technology in
foreign countries. **Exports of services** would continually expand due to recovery in tourist
figures with regained sentiments and the extension of the visa on arrival fee waiver until the
end of April 2019. Meanwhile, tourism expenditure would expand at a lower rate than
previously assessed due to a slowdown in trading partner economies. **Public expenditure,**
both consumption and investment, were expected to grow but at a slower pace than
previously assessed due to (1) delayed progress on some state-owned enterprise
infrastructure investment projects, (2) changes in the investment structure of some
public-private partnership projects to allow for greater investment by the private sector, and
(3) higher-than-expected expenditures for replenishment of the treasury account balance in
the budget structure for fiscal year 2020, resulting in a smaller composition of capital and
current expenditures.

**The Committee expected the Thai economy to expand around its potential in 2019 and 2020**
despite growing at a rate somewhat slower than expected due to external demand slowdown,

while domestic demand would continue to gain traction. The Thai economy was projected to
grow at 3.8 percent in 2019, which was lower than previous assessment at 4.0 percent, and
at 3.9 percent in 2020. There were possibilities that the Thai economy would expand at a
**rate below the baseline projection due to (1) lower-than-expected trading partner economic**
growth due to uncertainties such as trade protectionist measures between the US and China
that could be intensified and (2) lower-than-expected private investment due to political
uncertainties. Nevertheless, there were possibilities that the Thai economy would expand at
a higher rate than baseline projection owing to (1) the Chinese economy slowing down only
marginally due to economic stimulus measures and (2) higher-than-expected domestic
demand from public investment in infrastructure, PPP projects, earlier-than-expected
acceleration of private investment after political uncertainties eased up, as well as additional
government measures in supporting private expenditure.

**The Committee engaged in an extensive discussion regarding the economic outlook and**
viewed that future economic activity would still expand around its potential. The momentum
would come from domestic demand, especially private consumption that was driven by the
continuation of favorable labor market conditions across almost all sectors. Private
investment started to show some signs of clarity expected to be in the second half of this
year. This would also continue to support growth momentum, particularly investment under
Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) and PPP projects in addition to the relocation of production
base from other countries to Thailand that had been partly proceeded.

**The Committee saw a need to closely monitor (1) domestic demand momentum, both**
**private consumption and investment, (2) policy direction under the new government which**
could affect the continuation of public and private investment projects, imports of capital
goods, the current account adjustment in the period ahead, as well as risks to financial
stability and risks to medium-term fiscal position, **and (3) drought condition which could**
intensify and affect economic activities going forward.

**Headline inflation increased from the previous meeting due to higher energy prices.**
Additionally, fresh food prices rose as the excess supply of pork and eggs alleviated.
Meanwhile, **core inflation was lower than expected due to the prices of food-in-core**
category, housing rent, public transportation services, and vehicles. The Committee assessed
that the annual average headline inflation was broadly in line with previous projection due
to (1) continued upward pressure on energy prices due to the OPEC’s cut in oil production to
compensate for the decrease in demand in tandem with the global economic slowdown, and
(2) fresh food prices that would likely increase due to drought that could intensify.
The Committee thus kept the headline inflation projection unchanged at 1.0 percent in 2019
and expected headline inflation for 2020 to rise to 1.1 percent. Core inflation would increase
**gradually in line with domestic demand and was revised to 0.8 percent for 2019, down from**
the previous assessment of 0.9 percent, while the forecast for 2020 was expected to average
at 0.9 percent. There is a **probability of headline and core inflation being lower than the**
**baseline in line with risks to the economic projection.**

**Monetary Policy Decision**

The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand around its potential on the
back of continued support from domestic demand, despite a slowdown in external demand.

Headline inflation was expected to be around the lower bound of the inflation target, while
core inflation would be lower than previously assessed. Overall financial conditions remained
accommodative and conducive to economic growth. Nevertheless, global economic and
domestic uncertainties increased. The Committee therefore unanimously voted to keep the
**policy rate unchanged at this meeting in order to assess the clarity of impacts from such**
**uncertainties.** The Committee also viewed that, going forward, there remained a need to
address financial stability risks through a combination of policy tools, including appropriate
changes in the policy rate, as well as the use of macroprudential and microprudential
measures.

**In their policy deliberation, the Committee discussed key considerations underpinning the**
**policy decision. Their conclusions were as follows.**

**1) The Thai economy would continue to expand at the level around its potential in line with**
**the previous assessment. This expansion would be driven by strong momentum from**
domestic demand, both private consumption and investment, which would be supported by
government measures, the relocation of production base to Thailand, and the prospect of PPP
projects. Tourism also continued to gain traction. Meanwhile, merchandise exports growth
would weaken due to the global economic slowdown, the plateauing electronics cycle, and
the impact of trade protectionist measures between the US and China.

**The Committee viewed that the economy would experience increased uncertainties from**
**domestic and external factors that could affect economic growth in the period ahead. These**
uncertainties included in particular (1) trade protectionist measures between the US and
China that could intensify and subsequently affect trading partner economies and Thailand’s
merchandise exports, (2) global growth, particularly in China and Europe, that could slow
down and could impinge on domestic demand, and (3) limited progress on significant
infrastructure investment projects that could have knock-on effects on private investment,
especially during the transition period of policy formation by the new government.

**2) There were pockets of risks in the financial system that could pose vulnerabilities to**
**financial stability in the future.** First, household leverage increased, driven particularly by
auto-leasing and personal loans. Meanwhile, credit quality of mortgage and auto-leasing
loans continued to deteriorate due in part to more relaxed credit underwriting standards in
the previous period. Second, search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate
environment could lead to underpricing of risks. For example, the assets of saving
cooperatives continued to grow. Large saving cooperatives also played a greater role in the
cooperatives system by extending more loans to other saving cooperatives. Meanwhile, large
corporates increased their fundraising in the prolonged low interest rate environment,
representing a larger share of the bond market and commercial bank loans. Third, risks in the
real estate sector remained, including oversupply of property in some areas, foreign demand
for Thai properties, as well as competition in the mortgage loan market, despite commercial
banks exercising greater caution in ensuring that new loans extended to borrowers would
correspond to their financial positions. Meanwhile, real estate developers continued to
increase their funding through commercial bank loans and bonds.

**In the period ahead, the Committee viewed that an appropriate level of the policy rate**
**would still be necessary to preserve financial stability. Macroprudential and microprudential**
measures could only address risks in connection with loans and financial institutions under
the Bank of Thailand’s supervision. These measures would also be effective only for new
loans. Moreover, most Committee members deemed it necessary to monitor the impacts of
the implemented macroprudential measures, and to study additional appropriate
macroprudential measures to more effectively prevent systemic risks. Most Committee
members also viewed that both rising household leverage and large corporates that might
underprice risks warranted monitoring.

**3) Headline inflation would be largely unchanged compared with the previous assessment.**
This would be attributable to higher energy and fresh food prices offsetting the lower-thanexpected core inflation. The Committee therefore would monitor factors that could affect
crude oil prices in the period ahead, including oil price expectations inferred from the financial
markets and the oil production outlook, especially regarding the OPEC. Moreover, the
Committee would monitor factors, particularly an intensified drought, that could increase
fresh food prices. The Committee viewed that current accommodative monetary policy had
**allowed headline inflation trajectory to be consistent with the inflation target.**
Nevertheless, structural changes such as the impacts from the expansion of e-commerce,
heightened price competition, and productivity upgrades which reduced production costs all
could cause inflation to rise at a slower pace than in the past despite the continued expansion
of the Thai economy.

In addition, **the Committee discussed monetary policy outlook and judged that, for the**
current meeting, the Committee would need to wait and assess the clarity of various factors
due to heightened global economic and domestic uncertainties. Therefore, current
accommodative policy would remain appropriate. Going forward, a policy rate increase would
be gradual and follow a data-dependent approach, with a careful assessment of the outlook
for growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, in deliberating
appropriate monetary policy in the period ahead.
