**The Global Economy and Financial Markets**

**Trading partner economies were projected to expand by 2.7 percent in both 2024 and 2025.**
The services sector remained the primary growth driver, with signs of improvement in the
global manufacturing sector and demand for goods. The US and EU economies continued to
expand on the back of the services sector. Meanwhile, the Chinese economy started to
improve in the first quarter of 2024, driven by manufacturing production and merchandise
exports. Nonetheless, China’s domestic demand remained subdued, partly due to problems
in the property sector. At the same time, manufacturing overcapacity in China, coupled with
weak domestic demand, has led to an influx of goods into global markets. Furthermore, the
recovery of the global electronic cycle remained concentrated in high-tech products, leaving
production and merchandise exports in certain Asian countries yet to fully benefit.

**Global financial markets were buoyed by improving risk sentiments, driven by the continued**
expansion in the global economy, a decline in global inflation, and an improving situation in
the Middle East. Market participants expected the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by
the latter half of the year, resulting in the depreciation of the US dollar, along with a pickup
in risky asset prices and capital flows into regional economies.


**Domestic Demand**


**The Thai economy was projected to expand by 2.6 and 3.0 percent in 2024 and 2025,**
**respectively, supported by several factors: (1) an expansion in the tourism sector, both in the**
number of foreign tourists and spending per head, with the expected number of tourist
arrivals at 35.5 million and 39.5 million in 2024 and 2025, respectively; (2) a continued growth
in private consumption, especially in the services sector, albeit at a more moderate pace than
the previous year. Looking ahead, private consumption should continue to expand on the
back of improving employment and household income, as well as positive readings of the
consumer confidence in the high-income group; and (3) an acceleration of government
disbursement in the second quarter after the passage of the 2024 budget. Meanwhile,
merchandize exports and manufacturing activity were expected to expand at a subdued level
due to structural impediments and deteriorating competitiveness. **Although the Thai**
**economy was expected to expand in the latter half of the year, some uncertainties**
**remained, including the recovery in** manufacturing and merchandise exports, as well as the
impacts of fiscal stimulus.

**Headline inflation was projected at** **0.6 and 1.3 percent for 2024 and 2025, respectively.**
**Meanwhile, core inflation was forecasted at 0.5 and 0.9 percent for 2024 and 2025,**
**respectively. Inflation turned positive, in line with expectations, partly from the low-base**

effect of energy prices. Nonetheless, inflation was expected to be below the target range in
the third quarter before gradually increasing towards the target range from the fourth quarter
this year. Headline inflation was expected to increase as the effects from the diesel price
subsidy and the excess supply of certain raw food items started to phase out. Key risks to
monitor include geopolitical tensions that could increase global energy prices and potential
changes in government subsidies, which could impact domestic energy prices.

**Domestic financial conditions were mostly unchanged from the previous meeting. The baht**
depreciated against the US dollar, primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve’s monetary
policy outlook and domestic developments. Meanwhile, Thai government bond yields
increased somewhat following adjustments in market expectations regarding Thailand’s
monetary policy. Private sector funding costs via commercial banks and bond markets, on the
other hand, remained largely unchanged. Overall loans outstanding of businesses expanded
mainly from activities of large businesses. However, there is a need to monitor financial
condition and debt serviceability of certain groups of SMEs. Conversely, loans outstanding of
households expanded at a slower pace, driven by hire purchase and credit card loans, as credit
quality deteriorated.

**Highlights of Committee Discussion**

  - **The Committee assessed risks to the Thai economy to become less tilted to the**

**downside, as reflected in higher-than-expected outturns of private consumption and**
investment in the first quarter, an acceleration in government disbursement during
the second quarter, and a continued recovery in the tourism sector. However, the
**Committee expressed concerns over the K-shaped economic recovery, particularly**
the subdued improvements in exports and manufacturing, with increasing pressures
arising from: (1) structural headwinds and deteriorating competitiveness that have
limited the benefits of the global economic recovery on the Thai economy; and (2)
external factors such as oversupply of goods resulting from Chinese manufacturing
overcapacity, along with additional risks to other merchandize goods including those
in the automotive sector due to a slow recovery in global demand, and risks to solar
cells manufacturers resulting from trade measures between the US and China.
Furthermore, the Committee expressed concerns over the divergence in the recovery
of household incomes, as some low-income households face higher debt burdens
while income recovers only slowly. The Committee will therefore monitor this
development when assessing the economy going forward.

  - **The Committee assessed headline inflation to gradually increase towards the target**

**range. The low inflation readings since the middle of 2023 were partly due to the**
government subsidy program, which is scheduled to be gradually phased out in 2024
following the increased ceiling of diesel prices. Some Committee members believed
there remained inflationary risk due to geopolitical tension and the minimum wage
hike. However, the Committee deemed the current inflation target of 1 to 3 percent
robust in anchoring medium-term inflation expectation, which have remained at
around 2 percent in recent years, contributing in part to the reduction of inflation
from its peak of around 8 percent in August 2022 back to the target range within 7
months.

- **The Committee recognized the need to sustainably address the elevated household**

**debt by supporting the Bank of Thailand and relevant authorities to collectively**
**tackle the issues. The high level of household debt will hinder long-term economic**
growth and leave households with fewer buffers against future risks. The Committee
agreed that the ongoing debt deleveraging should continue, alongside the Bank of
Thailand’s measures aiming to align bank lending practices with borrowers’ debt
repayment capacity and to facilitate debt restructuring for debtors with repayment
difficulties. Programs in place include a restructuring initiative accessible to debtors
experiencing initial difficulties, prior to classification as non-performing loans (NPLs),
as well as those already classified as NPLs. Furthermore, a program is established to
resolve persistent debt by converting high-interest revolving personal loans into
lower-interest installment loans with terms and conditions enabling debtors to repay
within 5 years.

- **The Committee acknowledged that some groups of SMEs have faced difficulties**

**accessing credit and coping with high borrowing costs. However, the root cause of**
such issues stemmed from borrowers’ credit risks and lenders’ limitations in assessing
the risks of smaller firms, all of which cannot be addressed solely through monetary
policy. Therefore, the Committee has advocated for targeted measures, such as credit
guarantee schemes, as a more appropriate approach to reducing credit risks for
financial institutions and facilitating greater loan approvals for SMEs. Moreover, the
Committee agreed that the Bank of Thailand should collaborate with other relevant
authorities to enhance the efficacy of credit guarantees.

- **The Committee maintained a cautious stance on macro-financial stability. In terms**

of external stability, the depreciation of the baht against the US dollar was partly
influenced by external factors such as monetary policy in major economies. However,
the Committee noted that the baht’s depreciation relative to other regional currencies
and capital outflows observed since the beginning of the year also reflected high
uncertainties surrounding domestic factors, including the risks to households and
firms as well as fiscal stability.

- **Most Committee members deemed that the current policy interest rate is consistent**

**with the improving growth and inflation outlook, while fostering long-term macro-**
**financial stability. Their rationales are as follows: (1) the current level of the policy**
interest rate is supportive of ongoing debt deleveraging; (2) targeted measures would
be more effective in addressing the high level of household debt and SMEs’ credit
access relative to monetary policy; and (3) the current level of the policy interest rate
is robust against economic uncertainties and baht’s volatility. Nevertheless, the
Committee stands ready to adjust the policy interest rate should there be significant
changes to economic and inflation developments. Meanwhile, one member voted to
**cut the policy interest rate to (1) align with the lower potential economic growth as**
structural headwinds have become more apparent; and (2) help alleviate the burden
on debtors somewhat, particularly SMEs and low-income households.

**Monetary Policy Decision**

**The Committee voted 6 to 1 to maintain the policy rate at 2.50 percent. One MPC member**
**voted to cut the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point.**

**In the Committee’s judgment, the Thai economy should continue to expand, driven mainly**
by domestic demand and tourism, as well as the acceleration of government disbursement in
the second quarter. Nonetheless, export growth remained subdued due to heightened
competitive pressures impacting certain merchandise goods. **Inflation was projected to**
**gradually increase towards the target range from the fourth quarter of 2024 onwards. Overall**
**financial conditions remained stable and supportive of the overall growth recovery.**
However, careful monitoring was warranted for specific segments, notably SMEs and
low-income households, as their income recovery lagged amid tighter financial conditions.
**The overall financial system remained resilient. Nevertheless, the Committee expressed**
concerns over the high level of household debt and viewed that credit growth should be
consistent with ongoing debt deleveraging to foster long-term financial stability while
recognizing the difficulties of SMEs in accessing credit. The Committee therefore supported
the use of targeted measures to effectively resolve these issues, which would help the
economy to grow at potential and safeguard macro-financial stability in the long term.

The prevailing monetary policy framework seeks to maintain price stability, support
sustainable growth, and preserve financial stability. Most Committee members deemed that
**the current policy rate remained consistent with the improving growth and inflation**
**outlook, while fostering macro-financial stability in the longer term. However, it remained**
**essential to monitor economic developments, especially the recovery of exports and**
**government measures. The Committee would take into account growth and inflation outlook**
in deliberating monetary policy going forward.
