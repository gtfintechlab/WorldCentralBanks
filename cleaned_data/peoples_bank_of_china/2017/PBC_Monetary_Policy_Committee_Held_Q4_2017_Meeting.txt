The Monetary Policy Committee of the People’s Bank of China (PBC) recently held its fourth quarterly meeting of 2017 in Beijing. Participants analyzed the economic and financial landscapes at home and abroad and concluded that Chinese economy is stable and improving, though complex as usual. The global economy is gradually recovering, with continued recovery in major developed countries and certain challenges in some emerging economies. Potential risks remain in the international financial market. It was emphasized at the meeting that, the PBC should, following Xi Jinping’s Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era on economic work, earnestly implement the decisions of the 19th CPC National Congress, the Central Economic Work Conference, the National Financial Work Conference and the principles outlines in the Government Work Report. The PBC shall closely monitor the latest development of the economy and financial sector both home and abroad as well as the changes in international capital flows, remain committed to the underlying principle of making progress while ensuring stability and adjust to the new normal of economic development. The PBC will implement the prudent and neutral monetary policy, control total money supply, and use multiple monetary policy instruments to maintain reasonable growth of money, lending and social financing to keep adequate and stable liquidity, improve the efficiency of financial operations and its capacity to serve the real economy, and constrain the overall leverage ratio at an acceptable level. The PBC will work to improve the financing and credit structure so as to raise the proportion of direct financing to meet the requirements of deepening supply-side structural reform. The institutional reform in the financial sector will be deepened; the adjustment framework based on the two pillars of monetary and macro-prudential policies will be improved; the market-based interest rate reform and exchange rate regime reform will be deepened; and risk management will be strengthened to hold the bottom line of no systemic financial risks.
