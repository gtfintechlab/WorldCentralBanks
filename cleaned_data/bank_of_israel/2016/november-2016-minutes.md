**Report to the public on the Bank of Israel’s discussions prior to deciding on the**

**interest rate for November 2016**

**The discussions took place on October 26 and 27, 2016**

**General**

In the process of making the monthly interest rate decision by the Monetary
Committee, discussions are held at two levels––the first in a broad forum, and the
second in a narrower one.

In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are
presented, including the real and financial-monetary developments in Israel’s
economy, and developments in the global economy. Participants in this discussion
include the members of the Monetary Committee, senior representatives from the
various departments of the Bank, and economists from the economic departments
(Research and Market Operations), who prepare and present the material for
discussion. The data, estimates and assessments in this document are those that were
available at the time of the interest rate decision.

In the narrow forum, which consists of the Monetary Committee and the Director of
the Market Operations Department, the Directors of the Research Department and the
Market Operations Department present their recommendations regarding the interest
rate. An open discussion follows, which ends with a vote on the level of the interest
rate. According to Section 18(c) of the Bank of Israel Law, 5770–2010, the decision
on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary
Committee who participate in the voting. If the vote is tied, the Chairperson (the
Governor) has an additional vote.

A. THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY

**1. Developments on the real side**

**Indicators of the state of the economy**
The small amount of data on real economic activity published this month (due to the
holiday period) point to a continuation of the positive picture of economic activity. In
the third estimate of National Accounts data for the second quarter, the GDP growth
rate was revised upward again, mainly as a result of the upward revision of export
data. In the past three years, goods exports have grown more slowly than world trade,
while services exports have grown more rapidly. According to the Companies Survey,
it may be assessed that in the third quarter as well, continued growth in activity is
expected, and in various industries companies report hiring constraints. The
Purchasing Managers Index declined in September after increasing sharply in August,
but it remains above 50 points, the level that distinguishes between expansion and
contraction of activity. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by Bank Hapoalim
also declined in September, but its level remains high. The index compiled by the
Central Bureau of Statistics was unchanged in September.

**The labor market**
The picture conveyed by the labor market remains very positive. The number of
employee posts increased by 0.5 percent in July, and has increased by 2.8 percent in
the past 12 months. Real wages increased by 0.1 percent (seasonally adjusted) in
May–July compared with the preceding three months, and nominal wages increased
by a similar rate. Health tax receipts for July–September were 6.3 percent higher (in
nominal terms) than in the corresponding period in the year before, reflecting the
continued increase in employment and wages.

**Budget data**
The cumulative domestic deficit (excluding net credit) in government activity was
NIS 2.9 billion in January–September 2016, compared with a deficit of approximately
NIS 1.3 billion in the corresponding period of 2015, and it is about NIS 7.7 billion
smaller than the deficit in the seasonal path consistent with achieving the deficit target
for 2016. The deviation reflects revenues that were NIS 5.7 billion higher than the
path, and expenditures that were about NIS 2 billion lower than the path. Tax
revenues in September were about NIS 25.3 billion, which is about NIS 1.5 billion
higher than the seasonal path consistent with the estimate of tax revenue in the
original budget. (In September, the Ministry of Finance raised the forecast of tax
revenue.) In September, gross domestic VAT collection increased by about 3.5
percent in real terms compared with September of 2015 (and it increased by about 10
percent net of the effect of legislative changes). A significant portion of the increase
in tax revenue in September may be attributed to the timing of the holidays this year.


-----

**2. Developments on the nominal side**

**Inflation**
The Consumer Price Index for September declined by 0.1 percent, similar to the
forecasters’ predictions. There was a decline of 1.9 percent in the fruit and vegetables
component. The inflation rate as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12
months was -0.4 percent, while the change was -0.7 percent over the 12 months
ending in August, and there has been a marked upward trend in the annual inflation
rate since April. Excluding the direct effect of energy prices and administrative price
reductions, the CPI increased by 0.2 percent over the past 12 months. Over the past 12
months, prices of tradable goods in the CPI declined by 2.2 percent, and the prices of
nontradable items increased by 0.5 percent.

**Expectations and forecasts of inflation and the interest rate**
There was no significant change in inflation expectations. One-year inflation
expectations derived from the capital market were 0.5 percent, compared with 0.4
percent just prior to the previous interest rate decision. Expectations for inflation over
the coming 12 months derived from banks’ internal interest rates remained at 0.2
percent, and private forecasters’ projections for the next 12 CPI readings are for an
increase of 0.7 percent, on average (similar to the previous month). Third-year
forward expectations remained stable at 1.0 percent, and 3–5 year expectations
declined slightly, from 1.3 percent to 1.2 percent. Longer-term expectations (5–10
years) remained unchanged, in the center of the target range, at about 2.0 percent.
Similar to the previous month, according to the _makam curve, the Bank of Israel_
interest rate is not expected to change in the next year, but professional forecasters’
estimations and the Telbor curve indicate some probability of an increase in the
interest rate in about a year.

**Monetary aggregates**
In the 12 months ending in September, the M1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the
public and demand deposits) increased by 16.9 percent, and the M2 aggregate (M1
plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 9.2 percent.

**The credit market**
In September, the business sector (excluding banks, insurance companies and foreign
companies) issued a record NIS 10.9 billion in bonds, after issuances of just NIS 2.5
billion in August. The prominent issuing industries were trade and services (NIS 6.2
billion), and real estate and construction (NIS 4.1 billion). The average monthly
issuance in the past year increased as a result of September’s total, to about NIS 3.6
billion. Funds specializing in corporate bonds in Israel and funds specializing in
equities in Israel continued to attract net new investment in September and the
beginning of October. Since March, funds specializing in corporate bonds in Israel
recorded net new investment of about NIS 3.3 billion, and those specializing in
equities in Israel had net new investment of about NIS 1.7 billion. Corporate bond
spreads (excluding banks and insurance companies) declined slightly in September, to


-----

2.9 percentage points on average. In September, the total volume of new mortgages
taken out was NIS 4.9 billion, and in the past year, monthly mortgage volume has
stabilized at an average of about NIS 5.2 billion. The average interest rate on
mortgages continued to increase in September on all tracks. On the fixed-rate CPIindexed track, rates increased by 0.25 percentage points, and on the variable-rate CPIindexed track, rates increased by 0.23 percentage points. Rates on the fixed-rate
unindexed track increased by 0.17 percentage points, and on the variable-rate
unindexed track rates increased by 0.15 percentage points.

**The housing market**
The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.1
percent in September, following an increase of 0.4 percent in August. Home prices
increased by 0.4 percent in July–August, and figures for the preceding months were
again revised upward. Over the 12 months ending in August, home prices increased
by 6.8 percent, compared with 6.6 percent in the 12 months ending in July. Activity in
the market remains robust, with about 8,400 transactions carried out in August,
compared with the average over the past 12 months of about 8,150 transactions per
month. New home sales increased slightly in August, to about 2,320 (seasonally
adjusted), and the stock of new homes available for sale resumed its increase,
reaching a record of about 28,900 homes in August.

**3. The foreign exchange and capital markets**

**The foreign exchange market**
From the monetary policy discussion on September 25, 2016, through October 26,
2016, the shekel weakened by 2.2 percent against the dollar, and by 0.5 percent in
terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the preceding 12 months, the
shekel appreciated by 3.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate.

**The capital markets**
From the monetary policy discussion on September 25, 2016, through October 26,
2016, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by about 2.3 percent. Government bond yields
increased by up to 14 basis points along the unindexed curve, with a steepening of the
curve, and increased by up to 23 basis points along the CPI-indexed curve, with a
flattening of the curve. The makam curve traded at a yield ranging around the Bank of
Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS
spread, declined slightly, to about 67 basis points.

**4. Global economic developments**
The global economy continues to grow by a slow rate, and according to the IMF
forecast published this month, the expected rate of growth remains 3.1 percent for
2016 and 3.4 percent for 2017, similar to the growth rate in 2015. The expected
growth rate of world trade continues to decline, with the forecast rate for 2016 revised
from 2.7 percent to 2.3 percent, and the forecast for 2017 revised from 3.9 percent to
3.8 percent. Central banks continue to conduct very accommodative monetary policy,


-----

and inflation in most advanced economies remains relatively low, although it is in a
gradual upward trend, against the background of energy and commodity price
increases. In the US, core inflation is ranging around 2 percent, and the expected
growth rate in the third quarter according to the GDPNow index was revised
downward, to 2.0 percent—a growth rate that will not be sufficient to compensate for
the low growth of the previous two quarters. Personal consumption expenditure
continues to drive the economy, while nonresidential investment continued to contract
in the first half of the year. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 156,000 in September, and
even though there was a slight increase of 0.1 percentage points in the unemployment
rate (5.0 percent)—against the background of an increase in the participation rate—
assessments are that the labor market is nearing full employment. According to
market assessments, there is a relatively high probability that the federal funds rate
will be increased by 0.25 percentage points this year, but the pace of increases
thereafter is expected to be slow. Data that became available in Europe continue to
indicate a moderate growth rate, and the IMF revised the expected growth rate for
2016 slightly downward, to 1.7 percent. The political uncertainty in the eurozone
remains high. Inflation in the eurozone remains low, but the annual inflation rate
increased by 0.2 percentage points in September, to 0.4 percent, and inflation in the
four leading economies is no longer negative. In the UK, the government said it will
invoke Article 50, which will begin the process of withdrawal from the EU, toward
the end of the first quarter of 2017, and due to the announcement, there was marked
depreciation of the pound sterling. Real data still do not indicate a significant effect of
the Brexit decision, though based on most assessments a marked slowdown in activity
in 2017 is expected. Deflationary pressures in Japan continued to increase, despite the
accommodative policy measures adopted by the central bank. Third quarter data
published to date continue to reflect a relatively low level of activity, in line with the
low growth potential. In most emerging economies, there was some improvement in
assessments regarding economic activity. Economic data published this month in
China indicated stability in the pace of activity, and reduced concerns of a “hard
landing”. Third quarter growth was 6.7 percent, year-on-year. The Producer Price
Index (PPI) in China increased in September from -0.8 percent to 0.1 percent, after 5
years in which it was negative. Its continued stabilization will contribute to a
reduction in global deflationary pressures. The price of a barrel of Brent Sea crude oil
increased to $50 during the month. The index of commodities excluding energy
declined slightly.

B. THE NARROW-FORUM DISCUSSION––THE INTEREST RATE DECISION
FOR NOVEMBER 2016

The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on
the appropriate rate of interest for the economy. After the discussion on the interest
rate for November 2016, it was decided to keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.1
percent. The decision was unanimous.

The discussion focused on several main issues: (1) inflation; (2) real economic
activity; (3) the global environment and the exchange rate, and (4) the housing
market.


-----

**Main points of discussion**

In their discussion on inflation, the Committee members referred to the fact that the
CPI declined in September by the rate that was expected and that is in line with the
seasonal path consistent with the inflation target. They added that annual inflation has
recently been in an upward trend due to the dissipation of the effect of the declines in
energy prices and price reductions initiated by the government, although it remains
low, and below the target range. The Committee noted that, looking forward, there
are a number of forces that will be able support an increase in inflation: continued
growth in private consumption, which is supported by the strength of the labor
market; stability in commodity prices; and a continued increase in labor cost per
output unit. In contrast, Committee members remarked that the effect of these
processes is not immediate, particularly on annual inflation, and there are also factors
acting to moderate inflation, such as changes meant to increase competition in certain
industries, and the low global inflation environment. These are expected to slow the
return of inflation to its target range. Inflation expectations and forecasts present a
mixed picture: while one-year expectations remain below the lower bound of the
inflation target, medium-range forward expectations remained within the inflation
target range.

The discussion of domestic real activity dealt with the revised National Accounts data
for the second quarter, with the Companies Survey for the third quarter, and with the
labor market. Due to the holidays, a relatively small amount of new data on the
current month were presented to the Committee. The second quarter was
characterized by high growth rates, and in contrast to previous quarters, there was also
high growth in the export component. The Committee members agreed that it
remains unclear whether this is a change in trend in the growth of exports. They said
that in recent years, Israel’s services exports have been growing rapidly relative to the
world, while goods exports were weak relative to the world. The Committee
members’ noted that the Companies Survey indicates continued growth in the third
quarter, mainly in industries producing for the domestic market. Firms in some sectors
report (in the Companies Survey) a lack of workers.  The Committee expressed the
opinion that the picture in the labor market remains positive, both in terms of
employment and in terms of the development of wages, and the increase in income
derived from the labor market supports the growth of private consumption.

In the discussion on the global environment, it was noted that monetary policy in most
of the main central banks around the world remained very accommodative in view of
the moderate growth trends, and particularly in view of the low inflation environment
in most advanced economies. It was also noted that the Fed is expected to increase
the federal funds rate by the end of the year, but the pace of increases thereafter is
expected to be slow. The Committee members commented that the state of the
economy in Europe is especially bad, against the background of the political
uncertainty and a number of events that are expected to weigh down on growth,
particularly the Brexit. In addition, the Committee discussed the potential


-----

implications of continued moderation in the growth of world trade due to increasing
forces pushing for a retreat from world trade liberalization policies, and also discussed
the potential consequences of future political events in the world. The Committee
members noted the fact that in the past month, the shekel depreciated slightly, and
discussed the effect of the exchange rate on the development of exports.

In the discussion on the housing market, the Committee members related to the fact
that home prices are continuing to increase at a pace similar to that of recent years.
The stock of unsold homes continues to increase, and alongside that, there is a
relatively low level of new home sales, but these moderating factors are still not
reflected in home prices. The Committee members said that the interest rates on
mortgages are continuing to increase, and that the causes of this include an increase in
the risk indices of borrowers and an increase in the capital requirements imposed on
banks, among others.

*******

In conclusion, the Committee agreed that the current interest rate level is in line with
the low inflation environment and with domestic activity—taking into account the
global situation, both in terms of economic activity and in terms of monetary
developments in major economies—and that it supports the return of inflation to its
target range. The Committee members were of the opinion that in view of the risks to
attaining the inflation target in Israel, and in view of the time it will take until the
inflation rate returns to within the target range, it may be assessed that monetary
policy in Israel will remain accommodative for a considerable time.

Following the discussion, the four members of the Monetary Committee voted on the
Bank of Israel interest rate for November 2016. All members supported keeping the
interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent.


-----

**The main considerations behind the decision**

The decision to keep the interest rate for November 2016 unchanged at 0.1 percent is
consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the
inflation rate to within the price stability target range of 1–3 percent a year, and to
support growth while maintaining financial stability. The Monetary Committee
continues to assess that in view of the inflation environment, and of developments in
the global economy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major
central banks, monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time.

Following are the main considerations underlying the decision:

  - The CPI for September declined by 0.1 percent, a rate in accordance with
expectations and that is in line with the seasonal path consistent with achieving the
inflation target. Inflation as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12
months remains negative, but the effects of the decline in energy components and
of initiated price reductions are contracting. Short-term inflation expectations
remained stable this month, below the lower bound of the inflation target range.
Medium-term and long-term expectations remain anchored within the target
range.

  - The picture of real economic activity remains positive, with second quarter
growth driven by growth in all uses. Companies Survey data point to the
assessment that growth in activity is expected to have continued in the third
quarter as well. The picture conveyed by labor market data remains positive, with
growth in employment and in wages; the Companies Survey indicates that in
various industries, companies are reporting hiring constraints.

  - The global economy continues to grow at a slow pace. The IMF kept its global
growth forecast unchanged, though the forecast for world trade growth was
revised downward and is likely to be affected by political developments in some
advanced economies. Central banks continue to conduct very accommodative
monetary policy. The probability of a 0.25 percentage point increase in the US
federal funds rate by the end of the year is relatively high, though the pace of the
expected interest rate increases afterward is expected to be slow.

  - From the monetary policy discussion on September 25, 2016, through October
26, 2016, the shekel weakened by 2.2 percent against the dollar, and depreciated
by 0.5 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The shekel has
appreciated by 3.4 percent over the past 12 months in terms of the nominal
effective exchange rate. The level of the effective exchange rate continues to
weigh on the growth of exports and of the tradable sector.

  - Home prices continue to rise, and previous months’ indices were revised
upward. Alongside this, the increase in the stock of unsold new homes continues.
Monthly mortgage volume is stabilizing, with a continued increase in mortgage
interest rates.


-----

The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks to achieving the inflation
target remain high. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the
Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools
available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives
of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the
stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch
on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market.

The decision was reached and published on October 27, 2016.
