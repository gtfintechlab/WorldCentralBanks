# Report on the Bank of Israel’s discussions prior to deciding
 on the interest rate

## The discussions took place on January 1 and 2, 2023.

 General

The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two
discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.

In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are
presented, including the real and financial-monetary developments in Israel’s economy
and developments in the global economy. Participants in this discussion include the
members of the Monetary Committee, senior representatives from the various
departments of the Bank, and economists from the economic departments (Research
and Markets), who prepare and present the material for discussion.

In the narrow forum—which consists of the Monetary Committee and a representative
of the Markets Department—the Research and the Markets Departments present their
views of the main considerations that should guide the setting of the monetary policy.
An open discussion on monetary policy follows, which ends with a vote on the level of
the interest rate. According to Section 18(c) of the Bank of Israel Law, 5770–2010, the
decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary
Committee who participate in the voting.

A summary view of the economic situation available at the time of the Committee’s
discussion is presented in the notice regarding the interest rate decision, which was
published on January 2, and in the data file that accompanied the notice.

## THE NARROW-FORUM DISCUSSION

The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the
appropriate rate of interest. After the discussion, it was decided to increase the interest
rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 3.75 percent. Five Monetary Committee members
supported increasing the interest rate by 0.5 percentage points and one member
supported an increase of 0.75 percentage points.

The discussion focused on the inflation environment in Israel and worldwide, the
economic activity level and the labor market that are at a high environment, with a
decline in the most recent data. The Committee also discussed the expected continued
moderation in global economic activity and the impact of this moderation on the
economy.

## Main points of discussion
The Committee discussed the inflation rate in Israel being above the upper bound of the
target range. The inflation rate over the preceding 12 months increased to 5.3 percent.
An analysis of CPI components indicates that the price increases were recorded in a
wide range of CPI components, and that a notable portion of them is driven by domestic
demand factors. The Monetary Committee members noted that despite the increase in
the inflation environment in recent months, some moderation can be seen in the most
recent data, particularly in the tradable components. The Committee discussed inflation
in Israel remaining low relative to most economies worldwide, though net of energy
and food, the inflation rate is slightly closer to the OECD median. The inflation
expectations and forecasts for the coming year from all the sources are within the target
range, and expectations derived from the capital market for the second year and onward
are also within the target range. The Committee assessed that these trends, the monetary
tightening processes in Israel and worldwide, and the moderation of demand are acting
to moderate the inflation rate. However, the Monetary Committee members noted that
there is uncertainty regarding the extent of fiscal expansion and the development of
wages, which in turn will impact on the pace of convergence to the inflation target.

The Committee discussed the data on economic activity, which indicate a continued
robust rate of activity, with a slight decline in the most recent data. As such, the
Committee discussed the tight labor market, which weakened a bit in the most recent
data, but remains in a high environment that reflects a full employment environment.
Likewise, the number of job vacancies and their rate declined in November but are still
at historically high levels. The level of GDP continues to be above the trend line of
before the COVID-19 crisis, and additional economic indicators, including goods
exports (excluding ships and aircraft, and diamonds), services exports, and components
of goods imports, continue to be at an environment higher than their level of before the

crisis. The Committee discussed the Research Department’s updated macroeconomic
forecast. The expected level of activity remains robust and is around the economy’s
potential growth. According to the forecast, GDP is expected to grow by 2.8 percent in
2023 and by 3.5 percent in 2024. The Bank of Israel interest rate is expected to be 4
percent, on average, in the fourth quarter of 2023. Committee members also studied the
various risks to the realization of the forecast and their possible impact on economic
activity and the monetary policy adopted.

The Committee discussed housing market developments. Home prices increased in the
past 12 months by 20.3 percent, a markedly high rate compared to the pace of recent
years. Alongside that, the Committee members noted that several other indicators could
point to expected moderation in the market: the number of home purchase transactions
continues to decline and new mortgage volume in November is approaching the preCOVID-19-crisis average level.

The Monetary Committee discussed the domestic capital market, in which equity
indices declined, and yields on long-term government bonds increased notably. Since
the beginning of the monetary tightening, there has been some slowing in business
credit, alongside an increase in interest rates on the credit. According to the Business
Tendency Survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics, there has been an
increase in the difficulty of financing reported by small and medium companies, but the
difficulty in attaining credit remains low.

The Committee members also discussed developments in the exchange rate, its impact
on inflation, and the pace of inflation’s return to the target. Since the previous policy
decision, the shekel weakened by 1.6 percent against the dollar and by 5.8 percent
against the euro, and by 3.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate.

The Monetary Committee discussed global activity, which continues to moderate, and
the continued trend of monetary tightening being adopted by central banks, including
the Fed and the ECB. The continuing war in Ukraine, the energy crisis in Europe, the
monetary tightening, and the slowdown in China, are expected to lead to moderation in
the pace of economic activity worldwide. Accordingly, investment houses revised their
2023 and 2024 global growth forecasts downward. Purchasing managers indices for
advanced and developing economies indicate a slowdown in the pace of economic
activity. The inflation environment worldwide remains high. However, in some
countries, particularly the US, moderation is seen. In contrast, core inflation remains
stable. In most countries, inflation indices are at a markedly higher level than central
bank targets, and therefore the monetary tightening worldwide continues, but major
central banks are slowing the pace of interest rate increases.

**At the end of the discussion, five of the six Committee members supported an**
**interest rate increase of 0.5 percentage points, to 3.75 percent. One Committee**
**member supported an increase of 0.75 percentage points, in view of the increase**
**in inflation and the prolonged depreciation in recent months. The Committee**
**members noted that the Israeli economy is recording strong economic activity,**
**accompanied by a tight labor market and an increase in the inflation environment.**
**The Committee has therefore decided to continue the process of increasing the**
**interest rate. The pace of raising the interest rate will be determined in accordance**
**with activity data and the development of inflation, in order to continue**
**supporting the attainment of the policy goals.**
