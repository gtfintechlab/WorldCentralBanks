# Report on the Bank of Israel’s discussions prior to deciding on the interest rate

## The discussions took place on October 22 and 23, 2023.

 General

The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two
discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.

In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are
presented, including the real and financial-monetary developments in Israel’s economy
and developments in the global economy. Participants in this discussion include the
members of the Monetary Committee, senior representatives from the various
departments of the Bank, and economists from the economic departments (Research
and Markets), who prepare and present the material for discussion.

In the narrow forum—which consists of the Monetary Committee and a representative
of the Markets Department—the Research and the Markets Departments present their
views of the main considerations that should guide the setting of the monetary policy.
An open discussion on monetary policy follows, which ends with a vote on the level of
the interest rate. According to Section 18(c) of the Bank of Israel Law, 5770–2010, the
decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary
Committee who participate in the voting.

A summary view of the economic situation available at the time of the Committee’s
discussion is presented in the notice regarding the interest rate decision, which was
published on October 23, and in the data file that accompanied the notice.

## THE NARROW-FORUM DISCUSSION

The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the
appropriate rate of interest. After the discussion, it was decided to keep the interest rate
at 4.75 percent. All members of the Monetary Committee supported the decision.

The discussion focused on the economic ramifications on real economic activity,
inflation, and financial markets of the “Swords of Iron” War, which erupted on October
7.

## Main points of discussion
The Committee discussed the economy’s state just before the war broke out. The Israeli
economy had a low debt to GDP ratio, high foreign exchange reserves, and a Current
Account surplus. Economic activity was at a high level, despite moderation in the
growth rate in the preceding months, and the labor market was tight, at a full
employment environment, with a very low unemployment rate. The Monetary
Committee members noted that these opening conditions improve the economy’s
ability to deal with the effects of the war. Israel’s economy is robust, stable, rests on
strong foundations, and has known in the past to recover from difficult periods.

The Committee dealt with the expected ramifications of the war on economic activity,
both on supply and on demand. The impact channels in the coming period include lack
of workers due to a broad call-up of the reserves and due to the closure of the education
system, an adverse impact on physical capital and the ability to work in certain areas, a
negative impact on various industries such as construction, agriculture, trade, tourism
and entertainment services, an adverse impact on labor productivity, and the effect of
the significant uncertainty and an increase in the risk premium on investments in the
economy. The most recent data on credit card purchases indicate a decline in
consumption since the war began, except for the food industry. Until now, a marked
portion of the economic activity is continuing, but of course, there is still a lot of
uncertainty regarding the continuation of the war and its ramifications. The magnitude
of the war’s impact will increase the more that a larger part of the economy will be
impacted for a longer time.

The Committee discussed the inflation environment and the war’s impacts on it. The
year over year inflation rate in September was 3.8 percent, above the target. The year
over year inflation rate of nontradables in the CPI, which include mainly housing
services and the services industries, declined, but remained high at 4.6 percent. The
growth rate of the tradable components in the CPI is volatile and was 2.6 percent. The
Committee members noted that in the months preceding the war, inflation had been on
a moderating trend, and according to forecasters’ projections, it had been expected to
converge to the target range in the first quarter of 2024.

The Committee members noted that the shekel’s depreciation, which accelerated since
the war broke out, was a main risk to the convergence of inflation to the target even in
the months before the eruption of the war. In addition to depreciation, supply-side
constraints due to the war can impact on prices. In contrast, an adverse impact on
demand can moderate the inflation rate in various industries. The expectations and
forecasts of the inflation rate one year ahead remained relatively stable and are within
the target range, around its upper bound. Expectations derived from the capital market
for the second year and onward are also stable and are within the target range. The
Committee members assessed that the policy tools implemented by the Committee are
consistent with the commitment to return inflation to the target.

The Committee discussed the impacts on the financial markets. In the capital market,
since the outbreak of the war, equity indices declined sharply, and the shekel
depreciated notably. Long-term government bond yields and corporate bond spreads
have increased. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel weakened by 6.3
percent against the dollar, by 4 percent against the euro, and by 4.8 percent in terms of
the nominal effective exchange rate. To stabilize the markets, in view of the war, on
October 9 the Bank of Israel announced a program to sell $30 billion of foreign
exchange, out of foreign exchange reserves of around $200 billion (approximately 40
percent of GDP). This is in order to moderate the fluctuations in the value of the shekel
and to supply the liquidity required for the continued orderly activity of financial
markets. In addition, the Bank announced the implementation of up to $15 billion in
Swap transactions in the foreign exchange market, as needed, and government-bond
and corporate-bond Repo programs, the goal of which is to supply shekel liquidity to
institutional entities and to mutual funds. The Committee members agreed that in view
of the war, the policy at this stage has to focus on stabilizing the financial markets and
reducing uncertainty.

The Committee also noted that the framework formulated by the Bank of Israel’s
Banking Supervision Department for deferring loan payments, which was adopted by
the banks and expanded to the credit card companies, will provide relief for households
and will reduce their financial uncertainty in the coming months.

The Committee discussed developments in the housing market before the war, and the
impacts of the war on the construction industry. Home prices declined in recent months
alongside moderation in the volume of transactions, and the pace of increase in home
prices over the past 12 months moderated to 0.8 percent. The increase in the owner
occupied housing services component of the CPI is moderating and was 5.5 percent in
the past year. Activity in the construction industry was negatively impacted by the war
due to a lack of workers and the closing of construction sites by local authorities.

The Committee discussed global conditions as well. The inflation environment
moderated in a notable portion of countries, but the inflation rate is still above central
bank targets. As such, the monetary policy in most countries remains restrictive and
market expectations reflect a high interest rate environment for a longer period of time
than previously assessed.

The Committee discussed the updated macroeconomic forecast formulated by the
Research Department in the midst of the war. The forecast is based on a scenario of a
war in which the lion’s share occurs on the Southern front during the fourth quarter of
2023. Clearly, a longer duration or developments of the war to additional arenas will
change the estimates significantly. In accordance with the above, the assessment of the
Research Department is that the adverse impact of the war will reduce GDP growth
between 0.5 and 1.0 percentage points in each of 2023 and 2024. Accordingly, and in
view of the upward revision of activity data through the third quarter of 2023, GDP is
expected to grow by 2.3 percent in 2023 and by 2.8 percent in 2024. The year over year
inflation rate is expected to be 2.9 percent in the third quarter of 2024 and 2.5 percent
at the end of 2024. According to the forecast, the interest rate in the third quarter of
2024 is expected to be 4.0 percent or 4.25 percent. The Department assessed that the
costs of the war will lead to growth in the government deficit to about 2.3 percent of
GDP in 2023 and about 3.5 percent of GDP in 2024. These will lead to the debt to GDP
ratio at the end of 2024 being about 65 percent.

**After the discussion, all the Monetary Committee members were of the view that**
**the interest rate should be kept unchanged at 4.75 percent.**

**In view of the war, the Monetary Committee’s policy is focusing on stabilizing the**
**markets and reducing uncertainty, and it has activated a program to sell foreign**
**exchange and to provide liquidity in the swap and repo markets. The interest rate**
**path, and the use of additional monetary policy tools, will be determined in**
**accordance with this purpose and with developments in the war, as well as with**
**data on economic activity and the inflation dynamics, in order to continue**
**supporting the markets’ stability and achieving the policy objectives and the needs**
**of the economy.**
