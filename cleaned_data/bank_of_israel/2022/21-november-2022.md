# Report on the Bank of Israel’s discussions prior to deciding
 on the interest rate

## The discussions took place on November 20 and 21, 2022.

 General

The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two
discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.

In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are
presented, including the real and financial-monetary developments in Israel’s economy
and developments in the global economy. Participants in this discussion include the
members of the Monetary Committee, senior representatives from the various
departments of the Bank, and economists from the economic departments (Research
and Markets), who prepare and present the material for discussion.

In the narrow forum—which consists of the Monetary Committee and a representative
of the Markets Department—the Research and the Markets Departments present their
views of the main considerations that should guide the setting of the monetary policy.
An open discussion on monetary policy follows, which ends with a vote on the level of
the interest rate. According to Section 18(c) of the Bank of Israel Law, 5770–2010, the
decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary
Committee who participate in the voting.

A summary view of the economic situation available at the time of the Committee’s
discussion is presented in the [notice regarding the interest rate decision, which was](https://www.boi.org.il/en/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Pages/21-11-2022.aspx)

## THE NARROW-FORUM DISCUSSION

The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the
appropriate rate of interest. After the discussion, it was decided to increase the interest
rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 3.25 percent. The decision was unanimous.

The discussion focused on the inflation environment in Israel and worldwide, the
economic activity level and the labor market that are at a high environment, with a
decline in the most recent data. The Committee also discussed the expected continued
moderation in global economic activity and the impact of this moderation on the
economy.

## Main points of discussion
The Committee discussed the inflation rate in Israel being above the upper bound of the
target range. The inflation rate over the preceding 12 months increased to 5.1 percent.
An analysis of CPI components at a high resolution indicates that the price increases
trickled down to many CPI components, and that a notable portion of them derives from
domestic demand factors. The Monetary Committee members noted that despite the
increase in the inflation environment in recent months, it remains low relative to most
economies worldwide, and it is around the bottom decile of OECD countries. The
inflation expectations and forecasts for the coming year derived from the capital market
are within the target range and from other sources are around the upper bound of the
target, and expectations derived from the capital market for the second year and onward
are within the target range. The Committee assessed that the monetary tightening
processes in Israel and worldwide and the moderation in the level of demand alongside
easings in supply chains and a decline in commodity prices are acting to moderate the
inflation rate.

The Committee discussed the data on economic activity, which indicate a continued
robust growth rate of activity, with a slight decline in the most recent data. The level of
GDP continues to be higher than the trend line from before the COVID-19 crisis for the
fourth consecutive quarter. Committee members noted the third-quarter growth that was
positive, but lower than the level of the previous quarter, mainly because of a decline
in private consumption of durable goods. In addition, the Committee discussed the labor
market, which weakened slightly in the most recent data, but remains at a high
environment reflecting a full employment environment. According on the Business
Tendency Survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics, there is some decline
in businesses’ expectations for expanding their number of employees, with a marked
decline in the high-tech manufacturing and hotels industries. In parallel, the magnitude
of the constraint of recruiting new workers in recent months declined in most industries.
Additional indicators of economic activity, including goods exports (excluding ships

and aircraft, and diamonds), services exports, and the various components of imports,
continued to be at an environment higher than their precrisis level.

The Committee members also discussed developments in the exchange rate, its impact
on inflation, and the inflation rate’s return to the target. Since the previous monetary
policy decision, the shekel strengthened by 3 percent against the dollar and by 0.7
percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. In contrast, the shekel
weakened against the euro by 2.8 percent.

The Committee discussed housing market developments. Home prices increased in the
past 12 months by 19.8 percent, a markedly high rate compared to the pace of recent
years. Alongside that, the Committee members noted that other indicators of housing
prices point to moderation of the market: the number of home purchase transactions
continues to decline and new mortgage volume in October decreased considerably and
was NIS 6.1 billion (NIS 8.2 billion seasonally adjusted).

The Monetary Committee discussed the domestic capital market, in which equity
indices rose, and the yield on long-term government bonds and corporate bond spreads
remained essentially unchanged, with a decline in the balance of tradable debt. In the
balance of business credit from banks there was a slight decline with continued increase
in interest rates.

The Monetary Committee discussed global activity, which continues to moderate, and
the continued trend of monetary tightening being adopted by central banks, including
the Fed and the ECB. The combination of the energy crisis in Europe and the war in
Ukraine, the monetary tightening, and the slowdown in China, is expected to lead to
moderation in the rate of economic activity worldwide. Accordingly, investment houses
revised their 2023 global growth forecasts downward. Purchasing managers indices for
advanced and developing economies indicate a slowdown in the pace of economic
activity. The inflation environment worldwide remains high. However, in some
countries, particularly the US, moderation is seen. In most countries, inflation indices
are at a level markedly higher than central bank targets, and therefore the monetary
contraction worldwide continues. However, some central banks are slowing, or
signaling a more moderate pace ahead. In line with that, major equity indices worldwide
increased, and government bond yields remained essentially unchanged after trading
with high volatility throughout the recent period.

**At then end of the discussion, all six Committee members supported an interest**
**rate increase of 0.5 percentage points, to 3.25 percent. The Committee members**
**noted that the Israeli economy is recording strong economic activity, accompanied**
**by a tight labor market and an increase in the inflation environment. The**
**Committee has therefore decided to continue the process of increasing the interest**
