# Report on the Bank of Israel’s discussions prior to deciding
 on the interest rate

## The discussions took place on April 10 and 11, 2022.

 General

The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two
discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.

In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are
presented, including the real and financial-monetary developments in Israel’s economy,
and developments in the global economy. Participants in this discussion include the
members of the Monetary Committee, senior representatives from the various
departments of the Bank, and economists from the economic departments (Research
and Markets), who prepare and present the material for discussion.

In the narrow forum—which consists of the Monetary Committee and a representative
of the Markets Department—the Research and the Markets Departments present their
views of the main considerations that should guide the setting of the monetary policy.
An open discussion on monetary policy follows, which ends with a vote on the level of
the interest rate. According to Section 18(c) of the Bank of Israel Law, 5770–2010, the
decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary
Committee who participate in the voting.

A summary view of the economic situation available at the time of the Committee’s
discussion is presented in the [notice regarding the interest rate decision, which was](https://www.boi.org.il/en/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Pages/11-04-22.aspx?force_isolation=true)

## THE NARROW-FORUM DISCUSSION

The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the
appropriate rate of interest. After the discussion, it was decided to increase the interest
rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 0.35 percent.

The discussion focused on the development of inflation in Israel, which crossed the
upper bound of the target range, the strong economic growth data and the closing of the
output gap, the good labor market data, and the increase in home prices. In addition, the
Committee discussed developments in the global economy, particularly the effects of
the war in eastern Europe on oil and other commodity prices and the transmission to
domestic inflation, as well as the rapid growth in advanced economies alongside high
inflation and the beginning of a contractionary monetary policy process that followed
it. The Committee also discussed the uncertainty that characterizes the current period
against the background of the cyclicality of the waves of COVID-19 morbidity, the
escalation in eastern Europe, the security situation in Israel, and the political
uncertainty.

## Main points of discussion

The Committee discussed the acceleration of inflation in Israel, and its standing above
the upper bound of the target range. Inflation over the preceding 12 months increased
to 3.5 percent. Based on forecasters’ projections, inflation is expected to continue
increasing in the coming months, and to return to within the target range in the
beginning of 2023. The Committee discussed the main forces pressuring inflation in
Israel upward. It appears that in addition to supply side factors such as the increase in
oil and other commodity prices, imported inflation, and supply-chain disruptions, the
increase in domestic demand is also accelerating inflation. Proof of this can be seen in
the disbursement of the increase in inflation across most CPI components—tradable
and non-tradable components as well. In addition, the Committee members noted that
despite in the increase in inflation in recent months, it remains markedly low, so that it
is at the bottom of the distribution of OECD countries. The Committee members
assessed that at the current time, the risks of inflation are mostly contingent on global
developments, and in particular, in eastern Europe.

The Committee discussed the good data on activity and the labor market. They noted
that the Israeli economy continues with ongoing economic activity at a high level
alongside the coronavirus pandemic and against the background of the cyclicality of
the morbidity waves. The activity is made possible, among other things, in light of the
adaptation of most industries to activity alongside the pandemic. In terms of the labor
market, the Committee members noted that in March, the adjusted employment rate
increased and the broad unemployment rate declined. Despite this, the Committee
members emphasized that the average wage in the economy has not increased at a pace
that is in line with the strong demand for employees. However, they added that certain

industries can be identified in which there is a rapid pace of wage increases, including
the information and communication industries.

The Committee noted that the pace of increase in home prices continued to accelerate.
Home prices increased in the past 12 months by 13 percent, a markedly high rate
compared to the pace of recent years. In addition, mortgage volume remains high.
However, the Committee noted that the rent component in the CPI is increasing at a
more moderate pace.

The Monetary Committee discussed the rapid growth in advanced economies
worldwide, alongside the global risks that are liable to impact on developments in
Israel’s economy. The Committee members claimed that the sharp increase in energy
and commodity prices due to the escalation in eastern Europe is a risk factor for
inflation in Israel. However, it was noted that an adverse impact on domestic demand
is not expected as the scope of trade with Ukraine and Russia is not significant.
However, there could be an indirect negative impact if Europe’s economy, as well as
world trade, is notably adversely impacted. The Committee members discussed the
slowdown in economic activity in China due to the policy for dealing with COVID-19,
which intensifies the disruptions in global production chains, increases inflation
pressures, and leads to some slowdown in the pace of economic activity worldwide. In
terms of domestic risks, the Committee discussed the possible cyclicality of COVID19 morbidity waves, the security situation in Israel, and the political uncertainty.

The Committee members held an extensive discussion on the beginning of the process
of contractionary monetary policy worldwide against the background of the high
inflation environment. The Committee members noted that in the US, the federal funds
target rate was increased by 25 basis points alongside signals regarding the expected
reduction of the balance sheet and a notable upward revision of interest rate forecasts.
The ECB accelerated the pace of contraction of its purchase program and assessments
are that it will also begin to increase the interest rate this year. In addition, in several
other countries where inflation is above the central bank target, there were interest rate
increases.

All six members of the Monetary Committee were of the opinion that the interest rate
should be increased by 0.25 percentage points, to 0.35 percent. The Committee
members’ assessment was that the Israeli economy is recording strong growth,
accompanied by a tight labor market and an increase in the inflation environment. The
Committee has therefore decided that conditions allow for the start of a gradual process
of increasing the interest rate. The pace of raising the interest rate will be determined in
accordance with activity data and the development of inflation, in order to continue
supporting the attainment of the policy goals.
