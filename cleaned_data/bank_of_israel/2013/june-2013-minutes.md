**Report to the public on the Bank of Israel’s discussions prior to setting the**
**interest rate for June 2013**

**The discussions took place on May 26 and 27, 2013**

**General**

In the process of making the monthly interest rate decision by the Monetary
Committee, discussions are held at two levels - the first in a broad forum, and the
second in a narrower one.

In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are
presented, including real, monetary and financial developments in Israel’s economy,
and developments in the global economy. Participants in this discussion include the
three members of the Monetary Committee from the Bank - the Governor, the Deputy
Governor and the Senior Advisor to the Governor - and the three members of the
Monetary Committee from the public. Other participants in the discussion are the
Directors of the Research and Market Operations Departments, and economists from
various departments who prepare and present the material for discussion. The data,
estimates and assessments in this report are those that were available at the time of the
discussions.

In the narrow forum, which consists of the Monetary Committee and the Directors of
the Research and Market Operations Departments, the two Departmental Directors
present their recommendations regarding the interest rate. An open discussion
follows, which ends with a vote on the level of the interest rate. According to the
Bank of Israel Law, 5770-2010, (section 18(c)), the decision on the interest rate is
reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary Committee who participate
in the voting. If the vote is tied, the chairperson (the Governor) has an additional vote.

A. THE BROAD-FORUM DISCUSSION—THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY

**1. Developments on the real side**

_Monthly indices of the economic situation_

Updated indicators of economic activity which have become available so far indicate
continued moderate growth in the first quarter, and a mixed trend in April. Based on
National Accounts data, the GDP growth rate in the first quarter of 2013 was similar
to the average growth rate over the previous 4 quarters, about 2.8 percent in annual
terms. Growth in goods and services exports and in private consumption expenditure
contributed to GDP growth. Investment in the principal industries declined by 19.3
percent, continuing declines of 11.6 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively, in the
previous two quarters. Exports of goods and services increased by 5.6 percent—after
declines of 10 percent and 5 percent, respectively, in the previous two quarters—
bringing the figure back to the level it was at in the first quarter of 2011. National
Accounts data, the Climate Indices that are derived from the Central Bureau of
Statistics Business Tendency Survey, and the Bank of Israel’s Composite State of the
Economy Index indicate a slightly higher rate of growth in April compared with the
months in the first quarter. The government’s budget plan, should it be approved by
the Knesset, is expected to reduce the deficit from 4.65 percent of GDP in 2013 to 3
percent of GDP in 2014. This decline is expected to moderate the growth rate of
demand, while regaining budgetary control.

_The labor market_

Labor Force Survey data for the first quarter of the year indicate a continued decline
in the unemployment rate with a slight increase in the employment rate. The
unemployment rate declined in the first quarter to 6.5 percent (a decline of 0.3
percentage points), and the employment rate increased to 59.5 percent (an increase of
0.1 percentage points). The number of employed persons increased by 0.7 percent in
the first quarter compared to the last quarter of 2012. It appears that in the past year
the employment rate has stabilized at a high level, after increasing rapidly in the
previous two years. The stability in employment in the past two months is also
reflected in the number of employee posts, which remained unchanged in the private
sector in February, while the number of posts in the government sector increased by
0.3 percent. Nominal wages declined by 0.1 percent, and real wages declined by 0.4
percent, in January–February compared with the fourth quarter of 2012, based on
seasonally adjusted data. Health tax receipts by the National Insurance Institute,
which provide an indication of nominal wage payments, were 4.4 percent higher in
March–April than in the corresponding period of the previous year, but they reflect a
slowdown in the growth of wages compared with the preceding 2-month period, when
there was an average year-over-year increase of 5.7 percent.

_Budget data_

In April, the government continued to operate without an approved budget
framework, and in accordance with the law allowing it to spend 1/12 of last year’s
overall budget each month (including debt repayments) until approval of a budget
framework. On May 5, 2013, the government approved increasing expenditure in
2013 by about NIS 6.5 billion beyond the expenditure derived from the fiscal rule,
and to increase the deficit ceiling to 4.65 percent of GDP. Aggregate tax collection
since the beginning of the year is about NIS 2.5 billion lower than the seasonal path
that is in line with revenue projections. The domestic deficit totaled NIS 2.5 billion in
April – about NIS 0.7 billion lower than the seasonal path that is in line with the new
deficit target. The aggregate deficit since the beginning of the year totaled NIS 5.7
billion, and was about NIS 0.4 billion lower than the seasonal path that is consistent
with the deficit ceiling of 4.65 percent of GDP.

**2. Developments on the nominal side**

_Inflation_

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March increased by 0.2 percent, and for April it
increased by 0.4 percent—both months in line with forecasts. Over the past 12
months, the CPI increased by 0.8 percent, below the lower bound of the inflation
target range. The main factors contributing toward a decline in the CPI in the past
year were the appreciation of the shekel, declines in energy and cellular
communications prices, and expansion of the Free Education Law to children from the
age of three. In contrast, the main contributions to an increase in the CPI over the past
year were prices of food and housing, and increased taxation and electricity prices.

_Expectations and forecasts of inflation and of the Bank of Israel interest rate_

Inflation expectations from various sources were around 1.7 percent at the time (two
weeks ago) of the unscheduled Monetary Committee decision to reduce the interest
rate and implement a plan to purchase foreign currency in order offset the effect of
gas production. After the Committee’s decision and the April CPI were published,
inflation expectations from the various sources increased slightly, and are now
slightly below the midpoint of the target range. Inflation expectations for terms of 2
years and longer (monthly averages) range from 2.3 percent to 2.5 percent. The
expected increases in VAT and in electricity prices are expected to lead to higher
prices in coming months, though the recent declines in prices of commodities and
energy are expected to act to lower prices. Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest
rate one year from now derived from various sources range between 1.3 percent and
1.45 percent.

_The monetary aggregates_

In the twelve months ending in April, the M1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the
public and demand deposits) increased by 8.9 percent, and the M2 aggregate (M1 plus
unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 6.7 percent.

_The credit market_

The shekel’s appreciation was the main factor in the 0.9 percent decline of business
sector debt in March, to NIS 778 billion. Bond issuance by the nonfinancial private
sector in March–April averaged NIS 1.7 billion per month, compared with NIS 3.3
billion, on average, in the first two months of the year. Total outstanding credit to
households increased in March by 1 percent compared with February, to NIS 389
billion. The balance of credit for housing continued to increase, to NIS 274 billion in
March, an increase of 0.8 percent compared with February.

The total volume of new mortgages granted was NIS 3.8 billion in March and NIS 4
billion in April, similar to levels in recent months of about NIS 4 billion per month.
Interest rates on new fixed rate, CPI-indexed mortgages declined in April, while the
interest rate on variable rate mortgages remained stable. It appears that the Banking
Supervision Department’s directives had an effect on purchasers of homes for
investment. The rate of mortgages granted to investment home purchasers with high
LTV ratios (60–90 percent) declined from about 37 percent in November 2012 to
around 9.5 percent in March 2013. Likewise, the size of the average mortgage taken
out for purchasing an investment home declined during the same period by 20
percent, compared with stability in the average size of mortgages overall.

_The housing market_

The housing component of the CPI (based on housing rents) increased by 0.9 percent
in April, continuing an increase of 0.8 percent in March. In the twelve months ending
in April, this component increased by 3 percent, compared with an increase of 2.9
percent in the twelve months ending in March. Home prices, which are published in
the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI,
increased in February–March by 0.5 percent, continuing an increase of 1.4 percent in
January–February. The rate of increase in home prices continues to rise. In the twelve
months ending in March, home prices increased by 10.5 percent, compared with an
increase of 10.1 percent in the twelve months to February.

There were 39,330 building starts in the 12 months ending in February, and this is
expected to continue to support a high level of stock of homes. At the same time, this
is still lower than the rate in 2011.

**3. The foreign exchange and stock markets**

_The foreign exchange market_

From the monetary policy discussion on March 24, 2013, through the unscheduled
discussion on May 12, 2013, the shekel appreciated by about 2.9 percent against the
dollar and by 2.2 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange
rate, the shekel appreciated by about 2.8 percent during the period. Since that date, the
shekel has weakened by about 3.9 percent against the dollar, by 3.5 percent against
the euro, and by 3.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Since
May 12, most currencies weakened against the dollar, though most of them by less
than the shekel.

_The capital market_

From March 24, 2013, through May 24, 2013, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by 2
percent. Yields on government bonds declined sharply, and the yield differential
between 10-year Israeli government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury
securities contracted by about 60 basis points, to 150 basis points. Makam yields
declined along the entire curve, with declines of up to 20 basis points since the
announcement of the interest rate reduction. One-year yields declined to 1.32 percent
during the period. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS
spread declined during the period from 121 basis points to 100 basis points, but
increased again this month to 116 basis points. The Tel-Bond 60 Index increased
markedly by about 3.2 percent over the period. Spreads in the corporate bond market
narrowed, primarily for debt issued by companies with lower ratings.

**4. Global economic developments**

The global economy continued to present a mixed macroeconomic picture in the past
two months. Macro data published recently in the US were mostly positive and
indicated a moderate improvement. In the eurozone, data indicated deepening
recession, while in China, the data pointed toward a more significant than expected
slowdown. In April, the IMF revised its 2013 growth forecast downward for most
major economies. Projections were lowered by 0.2 percentage points for the global
economy, to 3.3 percent, for the US economy, to 1.9 percent, and for the eurozone, to
-0.3 percent. The growth forecast for China was reduced by 0.1 percentage points, to
8 percent. According to the IMF, the main risk remains the situation in Europe, with
improvement there expected to be slow, as it continues to suffer from restraining
budgetary policy and from a low supply of bank credit. The medium term risks
include recession in Europe, fiscal crisis in Japan, and slower than expected growth in
developing economies. Against the background of the economic picture, many central
banks continued accommodative monetary policy—quantitative easing plans continue

in the US, the ECB reduced its interest rate to a record low of 0.5 percent as the
bank’s president noted that he does not rule out a further interest rate reduction, and
the Bank of Japan announced at the beginning of April that it would double the rate of
its planned bond purchases (a step which reinforced the weakness of the yen and
apparently led other central banks to reduce the interest rate and intervene in foreign
exchange markets). Inflation in major economies declined.

B. THE NARROW-FORUM DISCUSSION––THE INTEREST RATE DECISION
FOR JUNE 2013

**Main points of discussion**

The six members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on
the appropriate rate of interest for the economy. After the discussion on the interest
rate for June 2013, five of the Committee members voted to lower the interest rate by
0.25 percentage points to 1.25 percent, while one Committee member voted to leave
the interest rate unchanged.

The discussion focused on the following main issues: (1) the foreign exchange market
and the interest rate gaps between Israel and other countries; (2) global markets; (3)
the inflation environment; (4) the level of activity in the economy and the fiscal
situation; and (5) the housing market.

The Committee members discussed the interest rate gaps between the Bank of Israel
interest rate and the rates of other central banks around the world. The effect of this
factor in the appreciation of the shekel was discussed, and members noted the interest
rate reductions by various central banks around the world, including the ECB, and the
quantitative easing programs in major economies. The Committee agreed that its
unscheduled decision to reduce the interest rate and put in place a foreign currency
purchasing program contributed to halting the appreciation trend of the shekel and
even to its depreciation, effects which were also supported by the strengthening of the
dollar on world markets. Most of the Committee members believed that in light of the
basic pressures that exist for appreciation (such as natural gas production, the
widening of interest rate gaps and the state of the economy), it is desirable to lower
the interest rate in order to continue offsetting these forces. In this regard, the
Committee discussed market expectations and the data inherent in financial markets.

Further to this, the Committee discussed the situation of the world’s major economies:
the recession in Europe and slowdown in the rate of growth in China, in contrast to
the improvement in US economic data. A discussion was held on how the
developments in the major economies, which are characterized by diverse trends, will
affect Israel in general and Israeli exports in particular.

The Committee discussed the inflation environment: Actual inflation for the past 12
months is below the lower bound of the inflation target (0.8 percent), while inflation

expectations for the next year from various sources are slightly below the midpoint of
the target.

Committee members agreed that an analysis of macroeconomic data and survey
results shows continued moderate growth. The GDP growth rate during the first
quarter of 2013 is similar to the 2012 average, and it is possible that the actual rate is
higher than reported, since the decline that was registered in domestic defense
consumption may lead to an upward revision in the data in the next update, or be
reflected in an increase later in the year. Increases in exports and private consumption
during the first quarter, and survey results (Climate Indices and the Composite Index)
for April indicating a slightly higher rate of growth than in the months of the first
quarter, were noted. The Committee members also discussed developments in fiscal
policy and their effects. If the budget program (deficit targets of 4.65 percent for 2013
and 3 percent for 2014) is adopted, it is expected to moderate the rate of expansion of
demand while reinstating budget control.

The Committee members agree that home prices have continued to increase at a high
rate in the past few months, and that no signs of moderation in housing market
activity can be identified based on up-to-date data. While the increase in home prices
in February (the last available data) was lower than in previous months (0.5 percent
compared to more than 1 percent in the four preceding months), the Committee
estimates that since the monthly data are volatile, it cannot be concluded that there is
moderation based on this. The tax measures discussed by the government were
mentioned (such as the cancellation of the betterment tax exemption for investors, and
imposing taxes on those upgrading their housing), and the Committee’s assessment
was that when these measures are implemented, a moderation of demand in the
housing market can be expected. With that, Committee members emphasized that
measures are needed on the supply side which can lead to an increased rate of
building of apartments and thus to moderation of their prices.

The main argument of the Committee member who supported leaving the interest rate
unchanged is that the current interest rate level is consistent with the current
conditions of economic growth and inflation, in a way that balances the effect of a
change in the interest rate on the forces acting for the shekel’s appreciation in the
foreign exchange market and its ramifications on the forces acting to raise prices in
the housing market.

Following the discussion, the six members of the Monetary Committee voted on the
Bank of Israel interest rate for June 2013. Five of the Committee members supported
lowering the interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, while one Committee
member voted to leave the interest rate unchanged.

In its announcement, the Bank highlighted the following main considerations
underlying the decision to lower the interest rate for June by 0.25 percentage points to
1.25 percent:

- Following on the measures announced by the Monetary Committee two weeks
ago, the Committee decided to reduce the interest rate and thus narrow the gaps
between the Bank of Israel’s interest rate and the rates in major economies
worldwide, in order to weaken the forces for appreciation of the shekel.

- During the past two months, the accommodative monetary policy of major central
banks has continued, and has even accelerated in the past month. The ECB
reduced its interest rate to a record low of 0.5 percent and its president stated that
he does not rule out further interest rate reductions. Quantitative easing plans
continue in the US, and the Bank of Japan announced at the beginning of April
that it would double the rate of its bond purchase plan. The expansionary policy of
central banks in major advanced economies is expected to continue, according to
their announcements, later into the year as well.

- The inflation environment reflected by increases in actual prices, and by inflation
expectations, is moderate. In the past 12 months the CPI increased by 0.8 percent,
below the lower bound of the inflation target range. Inflation expectations for the
coming year, based on various sources, are slightly below the midpoint of the
inflation target.

- Updated indicators of economic activity which have become available so far
indicate continued moderate growth in the first quarter, and a mixed trend in
April. Climate Indices derived from the Business Tendency Survey of the Central
Bureau of Statistics, and the Composite State of the Economy Index, indicate a
slightly higher rate of growth in April compared with the months of the first
quarter. In contrast, the government’s budget plan sets the deficit target for 2013
at 4.65 percent of GDP, and will reduce it in 2014 to 3 percent of GDP. This
decline is expected to moderate the rate of expansion of demand.

- Macroeconomic data that were published for major economies worldwide were
mixed. The moderate recovery in the US economy and the slowdown in Europe
continue. In April, the IMF revised downward its 2013 growth forecast for most
major economies.

- The rate of home price increases continues to rise, and in the 12 months ending in
March home prices increased by 10.5 percent. Implementation of the taxation
measures in the housing sector, which were approved by the government, is
expected to moderate demand in the housing market.

The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global
economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing high level
of uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to
achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and
growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will

keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing
market.
