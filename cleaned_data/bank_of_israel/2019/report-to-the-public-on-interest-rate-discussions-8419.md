# Report on the Bank of Israel’s discussions prior to deciding
 on the interest rate

## The discussions took place on April 7 and 8, 2019.

 General

The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two
discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.

In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are
presented, including the real and financial-monetary developments in Israel’s economy,
and developments in the global economy. Participants in this discussion include the
members of the Monetary Committee, senior representatives from the various
departments of the Bank, and economists from the economic departments (Research
and Market Operations), who prepare and present the material for discussion.

In the narrow forum—which consists of the Monetary Committee and the Director of
the Research Department—the Research and the Market Operations Departments
present their views of the main considerations that should guide the setting of the
monetary policy. An open discussion on monetary policy follows, which ends with a
vote on the level of the interest rate. According to Section 18(c) of the Bank of Israel
Law, 5770–2010, the decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the
members of the Monetary Committee who participate in the voting.

A summary view of the economic situation available at the time of the Committee’s
discussion is presented in the [notice regarding the interest rate decision, which was](https://www.boi.org.il/en/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Pages/08-10-18.aspx)

## THE NARROW-FORUM DISCUSSION

The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the
appropriate rate of interest. After the discussion, it was decided to keep the interest rate
unchanged at 0.25 percent. Four committee members supported the decision to leave
the interest rate unchanged, while one member supported increasing it to 0.5 percent.

The discussion focused primarily on real economic activity and uncertainty regarding
real activity in the near future, apparent trends in the level of world trade, the
appreciation of the shekel since the beginning of the year, and the expected path of
monetary policy.

## Main points of discussion

The Committee's assessment was that the economy is continuing to grow at a pace
similar to the potential rate, and that the relative slowdown in second and third quarter
data in 2018 was transitory. This assessment is supported mainly by the tight labor
market—a high employment rate and a low unemployment rate together with a high
job vacancy rate (demand for workers), which are reflected in continued wage
increases, primarily in the business sector. Private consumption recovered, evidence of
the high level of demand in the economy. For now, the concern of unusual fluctuations
in the financial market that would negatively affect real activity has subsided. The
Committee members noted that this assessment is also supported by Composite State
of the Economy Index data for the first quarter of 2019, foreign trade data, and the
Consumer Confidence Index. However, they noted that a number of indicators point to
the possibility that the labor market strength has reached its peak. There is an apparent
slight easing in the labor shortage constraint as reported by employers in a number of
industries, and the job vacancy rate remains high but is declining moderately. The
Committee members noted that first and second quarter data are expected to be "noisy"
in view of increased vehicle imports in the first quarter, which will apparently have a
beneficial effect on investment, private consumption, and GDP data, while the effect is
expected to be offset in the second quarter, and this should be noted when analyzing
developments and setting policy. Regarding the housing market, the Committee
members noted that the number of transactions continued to increase, particularly
among first-time home buyers, alongside the prolonged decline in investment in
residential construction.

The Committee members discussed the moderation of global economic activity, the
downward revision of global growth forecasts, and the change in expectations regarding
the path of global interest rates and monetary policy. In the US, current expectations
are that the interest rate path will be lower than previous expectations, and in Europe,
the expected start of interest rate increases has been delayed. The Committee members
stated that the decline in world trade is expected to continue affecting activity in Israel.

The Committee discussed other risk factors that are affecting the global economy,
including the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and a possible trade agreement between
the US and China. The Committee believed that some of the risks may also be to the
upside. It is possible to expect, for instance, that if the US and China do reach a trade
agreement, optimism will return to the global markets, which will support the continued
increase of activity in the domestic market.

The Committee members discussed the fiscal situation, the measures that the future
government may take to deal with the expected deficit, and their possible effects on
economic activity and on the inflation path. They believed that it is still too early to
assess what effect fiscal policy may have on real activity or on the inflation path,
because in any case, fiscal uncertainty is expected to remain for some time, at least until
the formation of the new government.

Regarding the inflation environment, the Committee members noted that there was no
major change since the previous interest rate decision. The annual inflation rate remains
above the lower bound, and the members' assessment was that in the coming months
inflation will hover near it. The Committee members stated that the trend of widening
gaps between inflation in the prices of nontradables (an estimate for the domestic
component of inflation) and of tradables continued—while the former is approximately
2.5 percent, the latter became even more negative. They noted that since the previous
interest rate decision, 1-year expectations and forecasts from the various sources
increased slightly, and continue to range around the lower bound of the target range,
while medium-term expectations are slightly below its midpoint. In the Committee
members' assessment, the full employment environment is expected to strengthen the
pass-through from wages to inflation. The Committee also discussed the continued
strengthening of the shekel since the previous interest rate decision. Since the
beginning of the year, the shekel has strengthened by about 4.5 percent in terms of the
nominal effective exchange rate. In the Committee's assessment, if the appreciation
continues, it is liable to make the inflation rate’s return toward the midpoint of the target
more difficult, and if necessary, the Bank of Israel will consider using the tool of
intervention in the foreign exchange market.

As stated, four of the Committee members believed that the interest rate should be left
at its current level. The fifth Committee member believed that the current interest rate
is not in line with the state of the economy, and that it is proper to raise it to 0.5 percent,
since inflation has been within the target range for some time. In contrast, the other
Committee members believed that even though there has been some increase in the
inflation environment, the interest rate should be left at its current level for the time
being, in view of the uncertainty regarding the forecasts of global real economic activity
and monetary policy, and regarding the future path of inflation in Israel. Their
assessment was that narrowing the extent of monetary accommodation should be done
