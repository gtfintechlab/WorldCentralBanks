# Report on the Bank of Israel’s discussions prior to deciding on the
 interest rate

**The discussions took place on May 30 and 31, 2021.**

# General

The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two
discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.

In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are
presented, including the real and financial-monetary developments in Israel’s economy,
and developments in the global economy. Participants in this discussion include the
members of the Monetary Committee, senior representatives from the various
departments of the Bank, and economists from the economic departments (Research
and Markets), who prepare and present the material for discussion.

In the narrow forum—which consists of the Monetary Committee and a representative
of the Markets Department—the Research and the Markets Departments present their
views of the main considerations that should guide the setting of the monetary policy.
An open discussion on monetary policy follows, which ends with a vote on the level of
the interest rate. According to Section 18(c) of the Bank of Israel Law, 5770–2010, the
decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary
Committee who participate in the voting.

A summary view of the economic situation available at the time of the Committee’s
discussion is presented in the [notice regarding the interest rate decision, which was](https://www.boi.org.il/en/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Pages/31-05-21.aspx)

# THE NARROW-FORUM DISCUSSION

The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the
appropriate rate of interest. After the discussion, it was decided to keep the interest rate
unchanged at 0.1 percent. Five Committee members supported the proposal to keep the
interest rate unchanged, and one Committee member supported the proposal to reduce
it to 0 percent.

The discussion focused on the possible factors in the increase of the inflation
environment and the extent to which they are expected to persist over time, foreign
exchange market developments, and the monetary policy required with regard to these
aspects; as well as the improved state of the labor market and the decline in the
unemployment rate against the background of the economy returning to routine; the
risks remaining despite the rapid recovery of economic activity; global activity,
particularly the increase of inflation worldwide, and against this background the
monetary policy in the various economies, and the housing market.

# Main points of discussion

The Committee discussed the increase in the inflation environment reflected in the year
over year inflation rate being near the lower bound of the target range, as well as the
increase seen in inflation expectations. There is a more marked increase in inflation
worldwide than in Israel (particularly in the US, where core inflation reached 3.1
percent) and there is a vigorous discussion as to what extent the price increase is
transitory, or if it is a basis for more entrenched inflation. Committee members analyzed
the possible reasons for the increase in the inflation environment in Israel. Supply
problems, including delays in the supply chain of raw materials, difficulties in filling
positions, and the increase in overall inflation being based mainly in an increase in
prices of tradable goods, support the assessment that the increase in prices is transitory.
In contrast, inflation expectations for all terms derived from the capital markets—short
term as well as medium and long term—are showing an increase, and are already
around the midpoint of the target, which could reflect market expectations that the
increase in the inflation environment will remain for a considerable time. The
Committee was of the opinion that it is still difficult to determine how transitory the
increase in the inflation environment is, and that the development of inflation going
forward should be followed, but it assessed that a breakout of inflation is not plausible.

Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 0.4 percent against
the dollar, and weakened by 0.5 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate and by
1 percent against the euro. The security deterioration increased the volatility moderately
and for only a short time. The purchase plan for 2021 announced by the Monetary
Committee supports the continued exit from the crisis and the return of inflation to the
target range. It was noted that it will be possible to expand the program as necessary
and in accordance with the development of economic conditions.

The Committee discussed the improvement of the labor market—against the
background of the economic recovery, the expected termination of some of the
assistance programs, the decline in the broad unemployment rate and the increase in the
adjusted employment rate since emerging from the third lockdown—though the rates
are still markedly low compared with the levels just before the coronavirus crisis.
Alongside that, some of the data indicate difficulties in the labor market’s recovery
process: the number of job vacancies continues to increase sharply, together with an
increase in employers’ difficulty in recruiting workers in some industries—with a
record number of manufacturing companies reporting constraints in hiring
nonprofessional workers.

The Committee members agreed that despite the contraction of GDP in the first quarter
of 2021, an examination of the composition of uses conveys a positive picture of the
state of the economy and that the contraction is primarily a result of transitory factors.
Therefore, the Committee assessed that the economy’s recovery is expected to continue.
In addition, the Committee assessed that the adverse impact on activity as a result of
the deterioration in the security situation during May apparently had only a limited
negative impact. The available indicators of economic activity point to a continued
trend of improvement. The level of credit card expenditure returned to, and even
crossed, the trend line that had been expected before the crisis; a notable increase in
consumption also continued in industries that were markedly negatively impacted by
the limitations; indices of mobility to stores increased until just before the conflict to
the highest level since the beginning of the pandemic; the Central Bureau of Statistics
Consumer Confidence index increased sharply until just before the confrontation,
mainly as a result of a sharp improvement in expectations of the economic situation in
the coming year; based on the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey
for April, the overall net balance of the business sector continued its upward trend; and
in addition, based on the latest real time survey of the Central Bureau of Statistics, it
can be seen that the negative impact on companies’ revenue in March was the lowest
since the outbreak of the crisis. Together with that, the Committee discussed the risks
remaining despite the rapid recovery of economic activity—and in this regard the risk
of a renewed outbreak of the coronavirus, the security risks, the political uncertainty,
and the financial risks.

The increased pace of vaccination worldwide is helping the global economic recovery,
and the growth forecasts of investment houses were revised upward for most major
economies, but in parallel there was a worsening of morbidity in several emerging
markets. The integrated global Purchasing Managers Index increased in April to its
highest level in the past decade, and the expansion in activity was reflected in both the
services and manufacturing components. Main equity indices were mixed during the
period but remain at record levels. The Committee was of the view that the pricing of
some financial assets may not incorporate the range of risks. The monetary policy at
major central banks continues to be very accommodative despite the increase in
inflation, while in contrast, in emerging markets interest rates continue to be raised,
against the background of higher inflation.

The Committee discussed the rising prices in the housing market, against the
background of removing the limitations on investors and the ending of new
government-initiated construction plans. The Committee expressed concern about the
ramifications that may be created on the revenue distribution and the inequality in the
economy if the trend of accelerated increases in home prices is renewed. Home prices
increased in the past 12 months by 4.5 percent, a relatively high rate, against the
background of the moderation in the pace of construction—both building starts and
building completions. In addition, there was an increase in the prices of construction
inputs, the share of investors in total home purchase transactions increased, and
mortgage volumes continued to be high. With that, the rate of increase of rents remained
at a moderate level.

Most Committee members assessed the current level of monetary accommodation,
through its various tools, to be sufficient for now, particularly in view of the additional
tools being implemented. The Committee will formulate its policy so that it will
continue to provide macroeconomic support in the process of exiting the economic
crisis, and to ensure that the credit market continues to function.

Five of the Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be left
unchanged at 0.1 percent. These five Committee members thought that the low level of
the interest rate supports a recovery of economic activity and a gradual return of
inflation to the target range, particularly in view of the Bank of Israel using additional
tools in the credit market and in the foreign exchange market. One Committee member
voted in favor of reducing the interest rate to 0 percent. He believed that in order to
support the recovery, an interest rate lower than 0.1 percent is more appropriate due to
the intensity of the crisis and the unusually intense impact on the employment level in
the economy.

The Committee noted that the process of returning to normal life in Israel supports
continued rapid growth in the coming year. However, there are still challenges to
economic activity—in view of the health risks in Israel and abroad and the adverse
impact on the economy, and particularly on the labor market. The Committee will
therefore continue to conduct very accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged
time, using a range of tools as necessary, including the interest rate tool, in order to
continue to support the attainment of the policy targets and the recovery of the economy
from the crisis, and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets.
