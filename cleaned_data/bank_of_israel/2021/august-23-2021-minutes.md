# Report on the Bank of Israel’s discussions prior to deciding on the
 interest rate

**The discussions took place on August 22 and 23, 2021.**

# General

The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two
discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.

In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are
presented, including the real and financial-monetary developments in Israel’s economy,
and developments in the global economy. Participants in this discussion include the
members of the Monetary Committee, senior representatives from the various
departments of the Bank, and economists from the economic departments (Research
and Markets), who prepare and present the material for discussion.

In the narrow forum—which consists of the Monetary Committee and a representative
of the Markets Department—the Research and the Markets Departments present their
views of the main considerations that should guide the setting of the monetary policy.
An open discussion on monetary policy follows, which ends with a vote on the level of
the interest rate. According to Section 18(c) of the Bank of Israel Law, 5770–2010, the
decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary
Committee who participate in the voting.

A summary view of the economic situation available at the time of the Committee’s
discussion is presented in the [notice regarding the interest rate decision, which was](https://www.boi.org.il/en/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Pages/23-8-21.aspx)

# THE NARROW-FORUM DISCUSSION

The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the
appropriate rate of interest. After the discussion, it was decided to keep the interest rate
unchanged at 0.1 percent. The decision was reached unanimously.

The discussion focused on the increase in morbidity and the risks that derive from it,
the state of real activity, the inflation environment, the continued upward trend of
housing prices, the exchange rate, and trends in the global economy.

# Main points of discussion

The Committee discussed the increase in the number of serious cases of illness and the
continued spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus, alongside the third-vaccination
campaign. The Committee noted the considerable uncertainty regarding the continued
spread and discussed the possible ramifications on activity should infection continue to
spread and the government will be required to tighten the existing limitations.
Alongside the ramifications of COVID-19 and the uncertainty looking forward, the
Committee noted the positive economic data published since the previous interest rate
decision. The Committee discussed the positive labor market data and National
Accounts data, which indicated strong growth in the second quarter and included an
upward revision of first quarter growth data. Activity returned to its long term trend in
most industries, but is below trend in the vulnerable proximity industries, particularly
incoming tourism, hospitality, and culture. In addition, the share of job vacancies out
of total employee posts remains high.

A Central Bureau of Statistics update to historical GDP data indicates that nominal GDP
in 2020 is about one percent higher compared to previous publications, and that the precrisis historical growth rates, from which potential GDP is derived, were higher than
previous assessments. The Committee discussed the possible ramifications of the
growth trend and its effects in coming years.

The Committee discussed the increase in the inflation environment to the middle of the
target range and the extent to which inflation is expected to persist. Compared to data
at the previous interest rate decision, inflation of nontradable items continues to rise,
led by components impacted by the opening of the economy, while the rate of increase
in prices of tradable goods was stable. The increase in prices encompasses a greater
number of CPI components. The Committee discussed 1-year inflation expectations,
which are within the target range—expectations derived from the capital market and
from inflation contracts are at the middle of the target range, while forecasters’
projections are slightly lower. Medium-term and long-term expectations remained

anchored in the middle of the target range. The Monetary Committee is following these
developments closely, and its assessment is that there are no signs of an outbreak of
inflation.

The global economic recovery continues, though there is growing concern that the Delta
variant will lead to an increase in morbidity and a return of the limitations, and thus
lead to a slowdown in activity and increased difficulties in the global production chain.
The IMF’s global growth forecast for 2021 remained unchanged at 6 percent. However,
according to the IMF, a scenario of a significant spread of morbidity in the world would
remove 0.8 percent from global growth this year and 0.8 percent in 2022. Monetary
policy in major economies remains very accommodative—major central banks kept
their interest rates unchanged and did not change purchase programs. However, the US
Federal Reserve emphasized the progress in attaining the goals of the accommodative
monetary policy, and announced that it will consider its continuation in its coming
meetings. Additionally, in several developing economies, in which inflationary
pressures are seen, there were interest rate increases.

Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 0.6 against the
dollar, by 1.5 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate, and by 2.2 percent against
the euro. It was noted that the intervention this year is not limited to $30 billion, and at
the end of the program the Bank will intervene in the foreign exchange market at its
discretion, taking into account the state of the economy.

Home prices increased in the past 12 months by 7.6 percent, a rapid pace compared to
that of previous years, against the background of moderation in the number of building
starts and building completions in the past year. The increase in housing prices in recent
years has also been accompanied by an increase in prices of construction inputs. Total
transactions in May remained high. In the past year, investors sold homes at a similar
scope to their purchases, after recent years when investors were net sellers of homes.
Together with these, the pace of rental price increases remained relatively moderate.

The Committee members assessed that the current extent of monetary accommodation,
via a range of policy tools, is appropriate for now. The Committee will formulate its
policy so that it will continue to provide macroeconomic support for the process of
exiting the economic crisis, and will ensure that the credit market continues to function.

All six members of the Monetary Committee were of the opinion that the interest rate
should be kept unchanged at 0.1 percent. They were of the view that that the low level
of the interest rate supports the continued recovery of economic activity. One member
was of the opinion that the strong National Accounts data and the increase in the
inflation environment could have made it possible to begin gradually reducing the


-----

extent of monetary policy accommodation, however in view of the renewed increase in
morbidity it is best to be very cautious and at this time to retain the current policy.

The Committee noted that the Israeli economy’s process of recovery from the crisis
continues. However, there are still challenges to economic activity, in view of the
increased health risks in Israel and abroad. Therefore, the Committee will continue to
conduct very accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time, using a range of
tools as necessary, including the interest rate tool. This is in order to continue supporting
the attainment of the policy targets, the economy’s recovery from the crisis, and
ensuring the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets.
