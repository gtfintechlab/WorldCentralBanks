# Report on the Bank of Israel’s discussions prior to deciding on the
 interest rate

 The discussions took place on October 7 and 8, 2018.

**General**

The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two
discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.

In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are
presented, including the real and financial-monetary developments in Israel’s
economy, and developments in the global economy. Participants in this discussion
include the members of the Monetary Committee, senior representatives from the
various departments of the Bank, and economists from the economic departments
(Research and Market Operations), who prepare and present the material for
discussion.

In the narrow forum—which consists of the Monetary Committee and the Director of
the Research Department—the Research and the Market Operations Departments
present their views of the main considerations that should guide the setting of the
monetary policy. An open discussion on monetary policy follows, which ends with a
vote on the level of the interest rate. According to Section 18(c) of the Bank of Israel
Law, 5770–2010, the decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the
members of the Monetary Committee who participate in the voting. If the vote is tied,
the Chairperson (the Governor) has an additional vote.

A summary view of the economic situation available at the time of the Committee’s
discussion is presented in the [notice regarding the interest rate decision, which was](https://www.boi.org.il/en/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Pages/08-10-18.aspx)

**THE NARROW-FORUM DISCUSSION**

The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on
the appropriate rate of interest for the economy. After the discussion, it was decided to
keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent. Four Committee members supported
the proposal to keep the interest rate unchanged, and two Committee members
supported increasing the interest rate to 0.25 percent.

The discussion focused on several main issues: (1) real economic activity; (2) the
inflation environment, (3) the global environment and the exchange rate, and (4) the
housing market.

**Main points of discussion**

In their discussion on economic activity, the Committee said that initial indicators of
third quarter activity point to continued expansion, and the members assessed that the
slowing in the second quarter derived from transitory factors, particularly the
volatility in vehicle imports. They noted that the Composite State of the Economy
Index and the Purchasing Managers Index point to continued expansion, and that the
findings of the Business Tendency Survey and preliminary findings from the
Companies Survey strengthen the assessment that the economy continues to grow at a
pace close to its potential rate. An analysis of Current Account data indicates that the
decline in the surplus was mainly a result of growth in goods imports, which supports
the assessment that there is excess demand in the economy, which is being directed
toward imports. As for the composition of growth, the Committee members said that
the most recent data on goods and services exports indicate some weakness; they also
tried to assess if in the third quarter the composition of growth returned to being
balanced, but noted that at this stage it is still difficult to assess this. The Committee
referred as well to the labor market and noted that the data show that it remains
tight—the employment and participation rates are high, the unemployment rate is low,
and wages continue to rise at a solid pace.

The Committee assessed that since the previous interest rate decision, there was no
major change in the inflation environment. Its members said that in the past three
months, the annual inflation rate has been within the target range and that except for
the communication component, all the CPI components made a positive contribution.
They noted that although the CPI readings for July and August were lower than
expected, they assessed that it was more plausible to assume that it was a transitory
deviation from the inflation trend than a downturn in the trend. It was noted that in the
coming months the annual inflation rate may decline temporarily to below the lower
bound of the target, but that 1-year expectations from the various sources remain in
the same environment in which they were at the previous interest rate decision, and
forward expectations for medium and long terms remain entrenched within the target
range. The Committee assessed that the forces supporting an increase in inflation
remain in place. These include, among other things, the rising wages in the economy,
the vigorous private consumption, inflation abroad and the expansionary fiscal policy.
It was noted that in the past year inflation rose to near the lower bound of the target,

but it was a temporary rise, after which inflation again declined. However, the
Committee members assessed that the forces mentioned above will support the
continued rise, and therefore the probability of a prolonged decline of inflation is
relatively low. One member noted that these forces have already been acting for a
long time while inflation in Israel continues to rise at a moderate pace. The
Committee members agreed that the main risk to the continued entrenchment derives
from the possibility of renewed appreciation of the shekel.

The Committee agreed that the global economy continues to present a positive trend,
led by the US economy. With that, the members assessed that the risks have grown:
the growth rate of world trade is moderating against the background of the developing
trade war and apparently also against the background of a change in the structure of
China’s economy. In addition, there is volatility in emerging economies’ financial
markets against the background of the rise in US yields and the trade war. The
Committee noted that the OECD slightly lowered its global growth forecast, as a
result of the lowered forecast for the eurozone and other markets. It also noted that oil
prices resumed rising, against the background of supply side effects. The Committee
members assessed that monetary policy in Europe and Japan is expected to remain
accommodative. In contrast, in the US the monetary contraction is expected to
continue against the background of activity data and the convergence of inflation to its
target.

In terms of the shekel, the Committee members said that the nominal effective
exchange rate has remained relatively stable for more than a year, but at an
appreciated level from a historical perspective. The Committee members assessed that
the forces for appreciation weakened against the background of the widening interest
rate spreads between Israel and the world and the contraction of the Current Account
surplus.

The Committee members discussed housing market developments, and data received
regarding home prices. They noted, among other things, the low level of investment in
residential construction (despite the increase in building starts in the second quarter).
In addition, the rise in new mortgage volume was discussed, which has continued
despite the interest rate on mortgages remaining stable in recent months.

As noted, four of six Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate
should be kept at its current level. They explained that although annual inflation in the
past three months has been within the target range, it is still too early to determine that
the inflation environment is sufficiently entrenched, and therefore the monetary
interest rate should be kept unchanged. They noted the uncertainty regarding the
development of inflation in the coming months, primarily against the background of
the assessment that during that period the annual inflation rate is expected to decline
temporarily to below the lower bound of the target, which could impact on
expectations. They assessed that over the coming months conditions for raising the
interest rate may come into place, but that the path of increasing the interest rate will
be moderate, so as not to disrupt the entrenchment of the inflation rate within the

target. Two Committee members were of the view that the interest rate should be
raised to 0.25 percent. They said that the Committee is in agreement that the low
inflation rate in Israel does not reflect weakness in demand. In addition, they noted
that after inflation’s upward trend for some time, the low level of the monetary
interest rate is not appropriate for the economy’s parameters. They noted that leaving
the interest rate at a low level for a considerable time has negative effects over the
long term, and that in the decision on the level of the interest rate, the Committee
should give greater weight to those effects. The two members claimed that raising the
monetary interest rate by 0.15 percentage points will keep the monetary policy
accommodative and in their assessment is consistent with the Committee’s forward
guidance.

In general, the Committee members differed in their assessments regarding the date
when it will be possible to begin raising the interest rate, but agreed that when the
interest rate begins to rise, the increases will be gradual and cautious. The Committee
emphasized that the beginning of the increase is contingent on the economic
indicators that will become available and to the extent that they will support the
assessment that the inflation environment has become entrenched within the target
range. As such, the Committee assesses that in any one of the coming interest rate
decisions it will be possible to raise the interest rate in accordance with the data and
the manner in which the Committee members analyze them.
