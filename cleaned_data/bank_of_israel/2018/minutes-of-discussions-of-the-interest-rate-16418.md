# Report on the Bank of Israel’s discussions prior to deciding
 on the interest rate

## The discussions took place on April 15 and 16, 2018.

 General

The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two
discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.

In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are
presented, including the real and financial-monetary developments in Israel’s
economy, and developments in the global economy. Participants in this discussion
include the members of the Monetary Committee, senior representatives from the
various departments of the Bank, and economists from the economic departments
(Research and Market Operations), who prepare and present the material for
discussion.

In the narrow forum—which consists of the Monetary Committee and the Director of
the Research Department—the Research and the Market Operations Departments
present their views of the main considerations that should guide the setting of the
monetary policy. An open discussion on monetary policy follows, which ends with a
vote on the level of the interest rate. According to Section 18(c) of the Bank of Israel
Law, 5770–2010, the decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the
members of the Monetary Committee who participate in the voting. If the vote is tied,
the Chairperson (the Governor) has an additional vote.

A summary view of the economic situation available at the time of the Committee’s
discussion is presented in the [notice regarding the interest rate decision, which was](http://www.boi.org.il/en/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Documents/April%2016%202018%20interest%20rate%20decision.docx)

The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on
the appropriate rate of interest for the economy. After the discussion, it was decided to
keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent. Five Committee members supported
the proposal to keep the interest rate unchanged, and one Committee member
supported increasing the interest rate to 0.25 percent.

The discussion focused on several main issues: (1) real economic activity; (2)
inflation, (3) the global environment and the exchange rate, (4) the housing market.

## Main points of discussion

In their discussion on economic activity, the Committee members discussed National
Accounts data for the fourth quarter of 2017, which indicated solid growth of 4.1
percent in annual terms. Several activity indicators, such as the Composite State of the
Economy Index and the Companies Survey, show the economy continuing to grow at
an adequate pace that is in line with the potential growth rate. The Committee
members said that the composition of growth in the past year seems more balanced,
but there is variance in exports, with services exports growing more rapidly than
goods exports. The Committee referred as well to labor market data that continue to
indicate a tight labor market, reflected in record high employment and participation
rates, a low in unemployment, and a rapid increase in wages in the past three years,
though the rate of increase moderated in recent months.

The Committee noted that the inflation environment remains markedly low, adding
that it is on a trend of some growth in recent months: core inflation indices are slightly
above actual inflation, and expectations derived from the capital market have been on
an upward trend in recent months. The Committee members said that on a seasonally
adjusted basis, the recent CPI readings were relatively high, but they noted that certain
factors continue to delay the return of inflation at this time, including the
government’s activities to reduce the cost of living and to enhance competition, and
online purchases of consumer goods having expanded markedly in the past decade.
They assessed that these factors do not reflect weakness in demand. In contrast, the
prolonged increase in wages due to the tight labor market, which in the past year was
also translated into an increase in unit labor cost, is expected to support the return of
the inflation rate to within the target range.

The Committee members noted that global economic growth continued to improve,
and international entities revised their growth forecasts for major economies upward.
However, the risks to continued growth increased: monthly global sentiment indices
have shown a decline in recent months, concerns of a “trade war” increased (even
though the steps taken so far have had limited effect), geopolitical tension increased,
and US financial conditions tightened. It was also noted that US legislators are
increasing the pressure to impose regulation on Internet companies that use users’

Reserve increased the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in its most recent decision,
and is expected to increase the rate twice more in 2018. The ECB kept the
accommodative monetary policy in place.

The Committee members discussed that there was no real change in the nominal
effective exchange rate since the previous interest rate decision. Most Committee
members were of the opinion that the shekel is still over-appreciated. A discussion
was held regarding the forces acting to weaken the shekel, including the continued
rise in the US interest rate, and the contraction of the Current Account surplus.

The Committee noted that housing market data continue to show that the increase in
home prices has halted, against the background of the increase in supply in recent
years, and in the past 5 months prices declined. The Committee members said that
investment in residential construction declined in the past three quarters, and the pace
of building starts and completions declined in the last months of 2017. However, the
number of building permits increased. The Committee members were of the opinion
that this increase may reflect a renewed increase in building starts, which will support
continued decline in prices.

As noted, five Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be
kept at its current level. These members claimed that the inflation environment
continues to be markedly low and the interest rate should be kept at its low level to
support its return to within the target range. They added that the interest rate
increasing before inflation is entrenched within the target range is liable to delay the
entrenchment of the inflation environment and ultimately to slow the path of interest
rate increase. The Committee members also noted that although the low interest rate
creates financial risks, these are not only the outcome of the interest rate set by the
Bank of Israel, and are not high to the extent that requires an increase of the interest
rate: mortgage volume has been moderating in the past two years, the increase in
home prices was halted and there was even a decline in home prices in the past five
months, the growth in consumer credit has moderated, and at the same time the
increase in labor income continues and the level of savings, even after declining, is
high in international comparison. One of the Committee members was of the opinion
that the interest rate should be increased to 0.25 percent, claiming that the low
inflation rate does not indicate a problem with demand. This Committee member
claimed that the weight assigned to the over-appreciated exchange rate should be
reduced, as it is expected that exports will become less sensitive to the exchange rate
as the economy switches from goods exports to services exports, and because world
trade is expanding. It is therefore proper to place greater emphasis on other
considerations, including the manner in which the continued low interest rate impacts
on asset prices and on savings.
