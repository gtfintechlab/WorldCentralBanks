**BANK OF ISRAEL**
Office of the Spokesperson and Economic Information

6 July 2009

**Report to the public of the Bank of Israel’s discussions prior to setting the**
**interest rate for July 2009**

**The discussions took place on 21 and 22 June 2009**

**General**

Before the Governor makes the monthly interest rate decision, discussions are held at
two levels––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.
In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are
presented, including real, monetary and financial developments in Israel’s economy,
and developments in the global economy. Participants in this discussion include the
Governor, the Deputy Governor, the directors of the Research and Market Operations
Departments of the Bank and economists from various departments who prepare and
present the material for discussion. The data, estimates and assessments in these
minutes are those that were available at the time of the discussions.
In the narrow forum, the directors of the Research and Market Operations
Departments and two other participating members of management present their
recommendations regarding the interest rate and, following a discussion, the Governor
makes his decision.

A. THE BROAD-FORUM DISCUSSION—THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY

**1. Developments on the real side**

_General assessment_
In the month since the previous interest rate discussions, the assessments that the
reduction in economic activity was moderating firmed, but the level of activity is
expected to decline in the coming months. The Bank of Israel expects renewed
economic growth in the Israeli economy around the end of the year.

_The National Accounts_
According to the preliminary estimates of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) (of
16 June), Israel's GDP contracted at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the first quarter of
2009, compared with the previous quarter; its previous estimate, of 17 May, was of a
3.6 percent reduction.. The revised assessment resulted from a 37 percent fall in
exports, a 3.4 percent decline in private consumption, and a 20.4 percent reduction in

nonresidential investment. Imports also slumped, by 41.3 percent (all rates in this
section are annual rates, compared with the previous quarter).

_The composite state-of-the-economy index_
The composite state-of-the-economy index for May declined by 0.5 percent,
following the declines (month-on-month) of 0.7 percent in April and 1.3 percent in
March. These falls reflect the contraction of economic activity in the last few months,
albeit at a declining rate.
The index of manufacturing production (seasonally adjusted) fell in April by 0.5
percent, further to its 2.3 percent drop in March. The index of trade and services
revenue fell by about 3 percent in April, after rising by 3.2 percent in March (monthon-month changes, seasonally adjusted).

_The labor market_
The nominal wage per employee post in the business sector increased by 1.1 percent
in March compared with its February level. The average nominal wage fell by 3.2
percent, annual rate, in the three months January–March compared with the average in
the previous three months (seasonally adjusted).
The number of employee posts (seasonally adjusted) fell slightly, by 0.2 percent,
in March. National Insurance Institute data indicate that the level of employment
declined by 3.3 percent in the three months January–March compared with the level
in the previous three months.
The unemployment rate jumped to 7.6 percent in the first quarter of 2009,
compared with a level of 6.5 percent in the last quarter of 2008. Part of the rise was
due to the marked increase in the labor force: if the participation rate had remained
unchanged from the rate in the previous quarter, unemployment in the first quarter of
2009 would have been 7.1 percent, i.e., half a percentage point less than its actual
level. In April the unemployment rate reached 7.8 percent (according to trend data),
compared with 7.7 percent in March.

_The Companies Survey_
Initial partial data derived from the June reports of companies participating in the
Bank of Israel's Companies Survey indicate that the decline in activity moderated in
the second quarter of 2009. This follows two quarters of steep drops.

_Foreign trade_
Goods exports (excluding diamonds) decreased by 0.4 percent in May from their
April level (all changes in this section are in dollar terms, seasonally adjusted). In the
three months March–May they fell by of 31 percent, annual rate, compared with the
level in the previous three months.
Goods imports (excluding ships, aircraft and diamonds) declined by 5.3 percent
from April to May, In the three months March–May they fell by 37.7 percent, annual
rate, compared with the level in the previous three months. The reduction was mainly
due to a decline in demand.

**2. Budget data**


-----

The budget deficit in January–May, excluding credit, totaled NIS 10.5 billion,
compared with a surplus of NIS 6 billion in January–May 2008. The large deficit
reflects the steep drop in tax revenues resulting from the economic slowdown. After
adjusting for the effects of changes in tax rates and non-recurring revenues, tax
revenues dropped by about 15 percent in real terms in January–May compared with
their level in January–May 2008,
The budget proposal for 2009 and 2010 submitted by the government to the
Knesset raises the deficit ceiling from 1 percent of GDP to 6 percent in 2009, and 5.5
percent in 2010. The decision to increase the deficit was prompted by the economic
recession and the slump in tax revenues. According to an analysis performed by the
Bank of Israel Research Department, the deficits in 2009 and 2010 are not expected to
exceed the maximum stated in the law, and it is reasonable to assume that they may
even be lower than the ceiling.

**3. Developments on the nominal side**

_Inflation_
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.4 percent in May, in line with the average
of the forecasters' expectations. Since the beginning of 2009 the CPI has risen by 1.2
percent, and in the last twelve months by 2.8 percent, slightly below the upper limit of
the target range.
One significant contributory factor to the rise in the index was the housing index,
which rose by 0.5 percent in May, following its rises of 1.6 percent and 0.5 percent in
March and April respectively. In the last twelve months the house price index rose by
16 percent.

_Expectations and forecasts of inflation and of the Bank of Israel interest rate_
Average one-year-forward **inflation expectations derived from the capital market**
("break-even inflation") from 1 June to 18 June were 1.9 percent, the same as the
average in May.
The rise in average inflation expectations in May and June (1.9 percent) from
their level in April (0.85 percent) was due mainly to one-off price rises expected to
result from changes in tax rates and prices under government supervision (including
the price of water). Inflation (measured over the previous twelve months) in the
coming months is expected to be within the target range but close to its upper limit,
and to decline thereafter.
On average the Israeli forecasters expect inflation in the next twelve months to
be about 2.3 percent, compared with expectations of 1.9 percent at the time of the
previous discussions. They expect, on average, a cumulative increase of 1 percent in
the CPI in June and July 2009.
With regard to the **interest rate, the Israeli forecasters expect on average that**
the Bank of Israel rate will remain unchanged for July, and that twelve months hence
it will be about 2 percent.


-----

An analysis of the slope of the _makam yield curve shows that capital market_
traders expect the interest rate to be increased in the second half of the year, and to be
at a level of about 2.5 percent a year hence.

_The makam and bond markets_
The yield on 5-year CPI-indexed government bonds increased from 1 June to 18 June
to an average of about 2.1 percent, compared with an average of about 1.7 percent in
May. In the same period the yield on unindexed 5-year government bonds increased
to an average of about 4.5 percent, from 4 percent in May. The yield on one-year
_makam increased to an average of about 1.4 percent, from about 1.2 percent in May._

_The interest rate differential and the yield gap between Israel and abroad_
Prior to the current interest rate decision, the Bank of Israel interest rate was 0.25–0.5
percentage points higher than the US federal funds rate, and 0.5 percentage points
lower than the ECB rate.
The gap between the unindexed 10-year shekel government bond yield and the
10-year US government bond yield narrowed from 204 basis points on 25 May to 179
basis points on 17 June.

_The expected real interest rate_
The Bank of Israel interest rate _minus twelve-months-forward inflation expectations_
derived from the capital markets remained unchanged in June from its May level, and
reached an average of a negative 1.4 percent.

_The monetary aggregates_
In the twelve months to June 2009 the M1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the
public and demand deposits) grew by 58.7 percent, and the M2 aggregate (M1 plus
unindexed deposits of up to one year) by 19.6 percent. The rapid increase in M1 was
partly due to the public's switching from fixed-term deposits to current accounts in
light of the low level of interest on the fixed-term deposits.

_The econometric models[1]_
Various scenarios were examined using the Bank of Israel’s econometric models,
under the assumptions that GDP will contract by 1.5 percent in 2009, that the low
interest rates around the world will start to increase in 2010, that prices of imported
inputs will increase from the second quarter of 2009, that world trade will contract by
11 percent in 2009, and that it will remain unchanged in 2010.
In the basic quarterly DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) model,
which places great weight on expectations and which uses the Bank of Israel reaction
function based on the smoothing of the interest rate path, in the scenario in which the
exchange rate in the second half of 2009 is between NIS 4.00 and NIS 4.02 to the
dollar––the Bank of Israel interest rate increases gradually to a level of about 0.7

1 The Bank of Israel uses econometric models to test various scenarios. Due to their nature, including the fact that
their results naturally depend on certain assumptions about relevant variables, the scenarios should be viewed as
one input among several in the discussions on the interest rate. In the abnormal conditions prevailing in the
financial markets since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, and bearing in mind that the models do not direct
reflect such events, the weight that can be attached to the forecasts derived from the models is reduced.

percent in the next four quarters. Inflation is expected to be 2.4 percent in 2090, and 1
percent in 2010.

**4. The foreign currency market and the share market**

_The foreign-currency market_
During the month between the previous and the current interest rate discussions, the
shekel strengthened by about 1 percent against the dollar, from NIS 4.00 to the dollar
(on 26 May) to NIS 3.96 (on 19 June). In the same period the shekel strengthened by
about 0.7 percent against the euro, from NIS 5.55 to NIS 5.51 to the euro.
The nominal effective exchange rate of the shekel, calculated as the average
shekel exchange rate against 24 currencies (representing 33 countries) weighted
according to the volume of Israel's trade with those countries, showed a shekel
appreciation of about 0.8 percent in the period from 26 May to 19 June.[2]

_The share market_
The Tel Aviv 25 share price index fell by 3.1 percent between 26 May and 18 June,
while the Dow Jones index rose by about 1 percent.

**5. Israel’s financial risk, the sovereign risk premium**

Israel’s risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, increased in the
month to the current discussions from 1.4 percent to about 1.7 percent. The risk
premium of most emerging market countries also increased in this period, explained
in part by the widening budget deficits around the world.

**6. Global economic developments (see Appendix for further details)**

The IMF raised its forecast of global growth in 2010 from 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent.
It left its forecast of global GDP in 2009 unchanged, at minus 1.3 percent.
Data on global growth indicate that economic activity continues to decline,
albeit with stronger signs that the global recession is approaching a turning point. To
date, however, there are no signs that economic growth has resumed in North America
and Europe. The level of demand is still very low, as is world trade, and there is
uncertainty regarding the strength and timing of the recovery. The expansionary
monetary policy together with expansionary fiscal policies adopted in many countries
continue to support the recovery of the global economy.
In the US the investment houses expect, on average, that the Fed interest rate
will remain at is present level of 0 percent to 0.25 percent in the next few months. The
ECB interest rate is also expected to remain at its current level of 1 percent in the
coming months. As the interest rate in some countries is close to zero, central banks
are adopting additional policy tools in implementing an expansionary policy.

2 The weight of the dollar in the effective exchange rate is about 24 percent, and that of the euro, about 35 percent.

B. THE NARROW-FORUM DISCUSSION––THE INTEREST RATE DECISION
FOR JULY 2009

In the narrow-forum discussion, four members of management make
recommendations to the Governor regarding the appropriate rate of interest for the
economy. In the discussion of the interest rate for July, all four recommended that the
Governor leave the interest rate unchanged at its current level. Leaving the interest
rate unchanged, together with the additional steps the Bank is taking––buying foreign
currency and buying government bonds in the secondary market––strengthens the
ability of the economy to deal with the effects of the global crisis.
The participants in the discussion stated that a decision not to change the interest
rate this month would be consistent with the achievement of the inflation target.
Prices are expected to rise in the coming months, due to increases in VAT and in
government-supervised prices. Despite that, inflation in the next twelve months
(measured over the previous twelve months) is expected to be within the target range
(based on the average of Israeli forecasters predictions). In a few months inflation is
expected to decline to the middle of the target range. Twelve-month forward inflation
expectations (derived from the capital markets) are close to the mid-point of the
range.
The participants in the discussion noted that in light of the fact that economic
activity is expected to remain subdued in the coming quarters, with increased
unemployment, and given that expected inflation is consistent with the target range, it
is advisable to continue to maintain the low interest rate also in the next few months.
This policy supports growth, and expectations are of a return to growth in Israel's
economy towards the end of 2009 or early 2010.
At the end of the discussion, the Governor decided to leave the interest rate
unchanged for June, at 0.5 percent, in order to continue to encourage economic
activity, while inflation is expected to remain within the target range.
The Bank noted in its announcement of the interest rate decision for July that the
current economic situation provides support for keeping the interest rate at its low
level in the next few months.

� Inflation is within the inflation target range and is expected to be within that
range over the next twelve months, hence it is not necessary to change the
interest rate to achieve the target.

� Real activity is expected to contract further in the next few months, with further
increases in the unemployment rate. That said, there are stronger indications of
moderation of the reduction in GDP. Israel's economy is expected to return to
growth around the end of the year.

� Many central banks are keeping interest rates low, and are implementing
expansionary policies.


-----

The Bank of Israel will continue to act to achieve the price stability target, and will
closely monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments, with the intention of
encouraging employment and growth and supporting financial stability.

The decision was made and published on 22 June 2009.

**Appendix: Major Global Economic Developments**

**US**
Most of the economic data published in June (up to the date of this interest rate
decision) were better than expected. The level of activity, however, remains low.
According to the latest Federal Reserve's Summary of Commentary on Current
Economic Conditions (the "Beige Book"), the sharp decline in the US economy
moderated in the spring, and in some areas there were improved expectations
regarding the future, although no significant upturn in activity is expected before the
end of the year.
Consumer confidence is improving. The University of Michigan's Consumer
Confidence Index has risen constantly from its lowest point of 56.3 points, reached in
February, to its level of 69 points in June.
Regarding consumer spending, the assessment is that it did not increase from the
first quarter to the second.
The housing market is stabilizing, but hanging over any real recovery is the still
high rate of foreclosures and the increase in the interest rate.
In the labor market there was a slowdown in the rate of dismissals; the number
of employees declined in May, but more slowly than in previous months. The rate of
unemployment increased in May to 9.4 percent, with the NAIRU (non-accelerating
rate of interest) estimated at 4.7 percent.
There are several factors that could hamper a recovery, including 1) the fact that
the financial system has not yet returned to its normal functioning; 2) the fact that all
the large economic blocs are in recession; and 3) the concern over the huge budget
deficit and its effects in the future.
The increases in oil and commodity prices resulting from stronger demand is
likely to create inflationary pressures. At the same time, the output gap is expected to
moderate those pressures, and it is assessed that the latter will be the dominant effect.


-----

The absence of inflationary pressures should enable the Fed to revert gradually
to a neutral policy. Analysts do not expect increases in the interest rate before the
middle of 2010, and assess that the Fed will wait until the labor market recovers
before it starts to increase the interest rate. The capital market is apparently more
optimistic with regard to the economy, and factors in an increase in interest as early as
towards the end of this year.

**Europe**
Business surveys in the euro area indicate an upward trend. GDP in the second quarter
of 2009 is expected to contract by 2.3 percent (annual rate, compared with the
previous quarter), further to its reductions of 9.6 percent in the first quarter, and 7
percent in the last quarter of 2008.
The IMF expects GDP in the euro area to decline by 4.2 percent in 2009, and to
show slow growth in 2010. The IMF sees three risks that could impact on the forecast:
1) The problems in the financial system have not been solved yet, and the authorities
should do more to clean up the banking sector. 2) Consumer and business confidence
is shaky, and if it does not become firmer, demand will stay low. 3) Structural
rigidities, particularly in the labor market, are likely to lead to a long standstill.
The level of employment in the euro area fell by less than did GDP in the last
year. This was reflected in a decline in labor productivity, and had a negative effect on
profitability in the business sector. It is reasonable to expect that the sharp fall in
business sector profitability will lead to dismissals, so that bad news in the labor
market still lies ahead.
Inflation in the euro area is expected to remain low for the rest of 2009, so that
no change in policy is envisaged till the end of the year.

**Japan**
Japan's economy is expected to record positive growth in the second quarter of 2009,
after two quarters with double-digit falls––15.2 percent in 2009:Q1 and 14.4 percent
in 2008:Q4. The bank of Japan upped its forecast of the economic situation in light of
the improvement in exports and output, and announced that the decline had halted.
This contrasted with its announcement a month earlier of continued economic
deterioration. The output gap in Japan is a very large one, and is not expected to
narrow in the coming quarters, giving rise to concern over deflation.

**The emerging markets**
The emerging market countries are also showing signs of recovery from the crisis.
The increase in oil and commodity prices improved the position of the oil- and
commodity-producing countries, and the decline in investors' risk aversion led to a
recovery of investment in emerging market economies. These trends strengthened,
particularly after the meeting of the G20 in London, when it was decided to transfer
$1.1 trillion to the IMF. That decision helped to ease the concern over systemic risk,
and gave hope of greater aid to the developing economies. Some of the emerging
markets, and in particular Brazil, China, India and Russia, are showing signs of
recovery driven by domestic factors.
