# Report on the Bank of Israel’s discussions prior to deciding on the
 interest rate

## The discussions took place on April 5 and 6, 2020.

 General

The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two discussions––the first in
a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.

In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including
the real and financial-monetary developments in Israel’s economy, and developments in the global
economy. Participants in this discussion include the members of the Monetary Committee, senior
representatives from the various departments of the Bank, and economists from the economic
departments (Research and Markets), who prepare and present the material for discussion.

In the narrow forum—which consists of the Monetary Committee and a representative of the Markets
Department—the Research and the Markets Departments present their views of the main
considerations that should guide the setting of the monetary policy. An open discussion on monetary
policy follows, which ends with a vote on the level of the interest rate. According to Section 18(c) of
the Bank of Israel Law, 5770–2010, the decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of
the members of the Monetary Committee who participate in the voting.

## THE NARROW-FORUM DISCUSSION

The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the appropriate
rate of interest.

After the discussion, it was decided to lower the interest rate to 0.1 percent. Five Committee members
supported the proposal to lower the interest rate to 0.1 percent, and one Committee member supported
the proposal to reduce it to 0 percent. In addition, the Committee decided unanimously on two
additional steps:

- To put a new monetary policy instrument into operation: the provision of monetary loans to the

banks for a term of three years, with a fixed interest rate of 0.1 percent. The loans are contingent
upon extending credit to small and micro businesses.

- The expansion of the program through which repo transactions are made vis-a-vis financial

entities, so that the agreements can include corporate bonds as collateral.

The discussion focused primarily on the short- and long-term ramifications of the corona pandemic
on the Israeli economy, and on the policy required in order to minimize the economic damage to
businesses and households and support the recovery of the economy as quickly as possible.

## Main points of discussion

While the Monetary Committee’s discussions prior to deciding on the interest rate were the first such
scheduled discussions following the worsening of the corona crisis, they took place following a series
of discussions that the Committee held regarding the necessary monetary policy, during which a
[number of policy decisions were made that were implemented and announced during March.](https://www.boi.org.il/en/Pages/CoronaMarkets.aspx)

The Monetary Committee’s discussions focused on the significant worsening of the corona crisis
during March. As part of this crisis, the government is making on-going decisions on the appropriate
actions with the aim of mitigating public infection from the spread of the disease. These decisions
have broad implications for Israel’s economy. Many other countries are going through a similar
process, which differs based on each country’s characteristics, and the contraction of their activity
has implications for the Israeli economy. With the exception of current data from the financial markets
and some forecasts, the data available to the Committee were up to date as of January and February
2020, and therefore did not reflect the broad economic ramifications of the outbreak of the corona
pandemic. The Committee discussed the real economic situation as shown in the qualitative
information from the business surveys conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics and the Bank of
Israel, and in the quantitative assessment of the effects of health restrictions on reducing activity in
various areas.

As of the date of the discussion, the corona virus had infected about one million people around the
world, including close to 10,000 Israelis. The Committee discussed the sharp decline in the level of
economic activity in Israel in March due to the crisis, and the expectation of continued contraction of
activity, at least in the second quarter of the year. The Committee discussed the anomalous
uncertainty regarding the health and economic scenarios expected in Israel and around the world, and
the uncertainty regarding expected fiscal policy if the crisis is prolonged. The Committee members
discussed the Research Department’s assessment that private consumption is 27 percent lower than
its pre-crisis level due to the public health instructions that are in place as of the date of the discussion.
The Committee was presented with an analysis of the effect of the crisis by industry, which showed
that the total negative impact to GDP, given Ministry of Health guidelines, is about 37 percent. These
estimations show that in the first quarter, the economy contracted by about 5 percent relative to the


-----

previous quarter (in quarterly terms). The Committee discussed the findings of the Bank of Israel’s
Companies Survey, which indicate a sharp decline in the net balance of the business sector, and the
industry net balances from the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, which also
show a significant decline in all industries.

The Committee members discussed the assessments of international organizations and investment
houses, which expect a contraction of global GDP in 2020 and a sharp decline in world trade. The
Committee discussed the sentiment indices, which indicate contraction in economic activity in the
advanced economies, and the data in China, which show a gradual return of economic activity thanks
to the slowdown in the spread of the virus, which has allowed the authorities to reduce the restrictions
on the populace. The Committee discussed the fact that the spread of the crisis has led to a sharp
policy reaction by central banks and governments. Most of the central banks have lowered interest
rates sharply and taken a variety of accommodative steps to supply liquidity to the markets.
Governments have declared wide-scale programs to expand public expenditure, compensate victims
of the crisis, and extend credit to the business sector. The slowdown in economic activity has led to
a sharp decline in commodity prices, and the price of oil dropped by dozens of percent, also against
the background of the lack of agreement between the major oil-producing countries regarding a cut
in output.

The Committee members discussed the Research Department’s staff forecast, which holds that,
assuming that there is no further worsening of the restrictions in Israel, and that most of the restrictions
blocking economic activity will be gradually removed until the end of June, the economy is expected
to contract by 5.3 percent. The unemployment rate in the second half of the year (following the
removal of the restrictions) among the primary working ages will by about 8 percent under this
scenario. The Committee members emphasized that notwithstanding the assessment in this scenario
that rapid growth is expected in 2021, the unemployment rate is expected to return to the low levels
that were prevalent prior to the crisis only toward the end of 2021.  A more pessimistic scenario
might take place, according to which a delay in the removal of the restrictions would lead to a sharper
contraction of GDP in 2020—8.8 percent—and an unemployment rate that is 2 percentage points
higher on average.

The Committee discussed the shake-up of the capital markets in Israel and abroad during March. The
stock indices in the major markets dropped by around 30 percent, and most of them offset part of that
decline thereafter. Yields in the government and corporate bond markets were very volatile, and there
was a sharp increase in the risk indices. In Israel, the Tel Aviv 35 index declined by about 25 percent,
and the sharp increase in government bond yields and in corporate bond spreads was halted after the
announcement of the Bank of Israel’s measures in the bond market and the halt in the trend of
withdrawals from the mutual funds, which had reached NIS 8 billion per day at its peak.

The Committee members also discussed the anomalous volatility in the exchange rate during March,
against the background of the liquidity distress in the foreign exchange market in view of the sharp
declines in global equity markets. From the previous interest rate decision through March 17, the
shekel weakened by 11 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate, but after the Bank of Israel
instituted dollar/shekel swap transactions, the volatility declined and the weakening of the shekel
moderated to 3.4 percent since the previous interest rate decision. The Committee members were of
the opinion that the depreciation is expected to help exports, particularly manufacturing exports, and
to offset the downward forces on inflation.

The inflation environment has declined in recent months. This decline began even before the outbreak
of the corona crisis, and when the crisis began, there was a further sharp decline in one-year inflation
expectations. The expectations derived from the capital market, and expectations from the other


-----

sources decline, partly as a result of the sharp decline in global oil prices. However, longer-term
expectations did not change significantly. The Committee members discussed the expectation that
the negative impact to the production chain of many products may lead to an increase in prices from
the supply side, and that the effect of the decline in demand is apparently more significant and will
lead to a decline in inflation in the coming months. However, in the short term, there is expected to
be some difficulty in measuring inflation, which is reflected in particular in the 27 percent of CPI
components where activity was near zero in March.

The data and assessments available to the Committee showed, as stated, that the economy entered a
serious crisis in view of the spread of the corona virus, with the crisis reflected in difficulties in the
capital market and significant economic distress among businesses and households. The Committee
members were of the opinion that monetary policy must focus on supporting the proper activity of
the capital market, particularly the functioning of the government and corporate bond markets, and
the need to ease the economic distress of businesses and households. In view of the uncertainty in
decision-making due to the dependence on actual infection data from the virus, a discussion was held
regarding the appropriate policy under various assumptions about the duration of the crisis. In this
context, it was noted that the two scenarios included in the Research Department’s staff forecast were
compiled on the basis of the information available at the time the discussion was held, and that other
scenarios may develop later on as a function of the exit strategy and of actual developments.
Therefore, the Committee was of the opinion that its decisions must also take into account the
possibility that a more pessimistic scenario than the Research Department’s basic scenario may play
out, and the support for demand in the economy that will be necessary when the health restrictions
are removed.

The Committee members emphasized that in view of the serious crisis, it is important that monetary
policy lead to an easement of credit terms in the form of lowering the interest rate along the entire
curve. While the Bank of Israel’s measures in the bond market are lowering the medium- and longterm interest rates, many households and businesses are also exposed to the short-term interest rate,
particularly those who borrow at variable rates. Therefore, five of the Committee’s members were
of the opinion that the interest rate should be lowered to 0.1 percent. One Committee member voted
for lowering the interest rate to 0 percent. He was of the opinion that the intensity of the crisis and
the exceptionally intense negative impact to employment require an interest rate lower than 0.1
percent, the level that was prevalent for a long period when employment in the economy was full.

The Committee members agreed that action must be taken to increase the pass-through from the low
interest rate set by the Committee to the interest rates that the banks charge on loans to a variety of
borrowers in the economy. Therefore, the Committee decided unanimously to put a new instrument
into action, through which the Bank of Israel will extend monetary loans to the banks, totaling NIS 5
billion, for a term of three years, with a fixed interest rate of 0.1 percent. The loans are contingent
upon extending credit to small and micro businesses. This tool is intended to ensure that the low level
of the interest rate will also be reflected in the price of loans extended to these businesses. The
Committee also decided unanimously to expand the program under which repo transactions are
conducted vis-à-vis financial entities, such that the transactions will also be able to include corporate
bonds as collateral (in addition to transactions with government bonds as collateral pursuant to the
program announced on March 16). The Committee members were of the opinion that this step will
strengthen the program’s support of liquidity and of the orderly functioning of the Israeli bond
markets.

The Committee members emphasized that they will expand the use of existing tools, including the
interest rate tool, and will be able to operate additional tools, to the extent that the crisis lengthens


-----

and it is necessary in order to achieve the monetary policy goals and to moderate the negative
economic impact resulting from the crisis.
