#### Agenda Item 1: Setting M2 target range at 2.5%-6.5% for year 2018.

 I. Background Information

 The Department of Economic Research provided the following information:

 1. Considerations for M2 target setting

 The annual target range of the monetary aggregate M2 is mainly determined

 by taking into consideration two factors: demand for money, and future

 uncertainties.

 2. Preliminary estimation of demand for money for 2018

 Based on the coefficient estimates of the money demand function, and the

 CBC’s own forecasts for the 2018 GDP growth rate (2.35%) and CPI growth rate

 (1.12%), the preliminary result of the annual growth rate of demand for M2 is

 around 3.11%.

**3. Proposition to set the 2018 M2 target at a range of 2.5% to 6.5%**

#### The CBC’s preliminary result of the annual growth rate of demand for M2 is

 around 3.11%. Taking into account past model forecasting errors, it is estimated

 that annual M2 growth rate will be close to 4.0% for 2018. There also exist other

 factors likely to affect M2 growth, including lingering uncertainties about

 international political, economic, and financial conditions. Moreover, it is

 important for proactive measures, such as counter cyclical policy, to be employed

 should external developments dampen the momentum for Taiwan’s economic

 recovery. Therefore, it is proposed that the 2018 M2 growth target range be set at

 2.5%-6.5%, same as 2017.

3


-----

#### Uncertainties with potential effects on next year’s M2 growth and economic

 outlook include the following.

 (1) High uncertainties as to the political, economic, and financial conditions

 around the world. For example, major economies’ monetary policy decisions

 could spur greater capital flows, inevitably having some effects on Taiwan’s

 M2 growth.

 (2) Rising international trade protectionism could disrupt the world trade order,

 dampening Taiwan’s exports.

 (3) The impact of US tax reforms and expanded infrastructure spending and

 China’s slower growth add to the uncertainties over the global economy,

 which could weaken Taiwan’s growth momentum.

 4. In view of considerable uncertainties over the economic and financial

 conditions at home and abroad next year, the Bank will, as usual, review and

 assess the M2 growth target and the estimation model in mid-year.

 II. Discussion and Decision on the 2018 M2 Growth Target Range

 1. All directors were in favor of keeping the M2 growth target range unchanged.

 Their views are summarized as below.

 One director noted that a seminar participated by academics and experts was

 held in the Bank in early December 2017 to give an extended discussion on the

 setting of the 2018 M2 growth target range. The M2 growth simulation results for

 2018 were broadly similar to those for 2017, supporting the view to maintain next

 year’s M2 growth target range at 2.5%-6.5%, subject to a mid-year review if

 warranted by international economic and financial developments.

4


-----

#### Another director pointed out that the 2.5%-6.5% M2 growth target range has

 been in place for nine years from 2009 to 2017, during which the target was

 achieved for all years but year 2009 by a small margin. In addition, the annual M2

 growth rate averaged at a slightly lower level of 3.76% for the first eleven months

 of 2017. Nevertheless, since M2 growth targets and forecasts are two separate

 things and next year’s target range can also be adjusted if warranted by

 international economic and financial developments, it seemed appropriate to keep

 the target range unchanged.

 2. Decision on the 2018 M2 growth target range

 The directors reached a unanimous decision to set the 2018 M2 growth

 target range at 2.5% to 6.5%.

 Voting for the proposition:

 Fai-nan Perng, Yu-jer Sheu, Jong-Chin Shen, Chin-long Yang, Tzung-ta Yen,

 Ming-yih Liang, Sheng-cheng Hu, Tsung-hsien Lin, Chen-chia Lee, Chung-dar

 Lei, Chao-yih Chen, Jin-lung Lin, Mei-lie Chu, Chao-hsi Huang, Bih-jane Liu

 Voting against the proposition: None.

#### Agenda Item 2: Economic and Financial Conditions and Monetary Policy

 Decision

 I. Review of Economic and Financial Conditions

 The Department of Economic Research presented the following review:

 1. International Economic and Financial Conditions

 Developments since the September Board Meeting pointed to synchronized

 global growth with moderate expansion in advanced economies and sustained

 recovery in emerging market economies. The global economy is expected to

 pick up steadily next year, but world trade growth might be dragged down

 slightly by the gradual monetary policy normalization in advanced economies,

 softer demand from China, and a higher base of the previous year.

 For the year of 2018, with the exception of the US economy continuing to

 strengthen, most major economies are projected to experience slightly slower

 growth. As a stronger euro could dampen exports and Japan might feel the

 strains from China’s economic slowdown, both the euro area and Japan will

 grow slower than this year. For other Asian economies, most of them will not

 expand as fast as this year owing to a higher base effect. In addition,

 international forecasting institutions projected inflation to be below 2% for the

 US, the euro area, and Japan, indicating a mild inflation outlook.

 In the international financial markets, major Asian currencies except the

 Japanese yen broadly appreciated against the US dollar owing to capital inflows

 into this region. Meanwhile, the global stock markets recorded an extended rally

 on the back of a mild expansion in the global economy.

6


-----

#### Key risks facing the global economy stem from four areas: (1) gradual

 normalization of monetary policy by major economies, which could induce

 capital outflows from other economies and cause currency devaluation; (2)

 impacts stemming from the US economic and trade policies, such as the US tax

 reform and its influence on cross-border capital flows; (3) rising trade

 protectionism and its repercussions on global trade activity; (4) geopolitical

 risks, including tensions on the Korean Peninsula and the Middle East, and

 possibly louder cries for autonomy/independence in some European countries,

 which could roil the commodity and financial markets, compounding the

 uncertainties over the global economic recovery.

 2. Domestic Economic and Financial Conditions

 (1) Economic situation

 During the period since the Board last convened, Taiwan enjoyed robust

 export growth. The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) and the

 Non-Manufacturing Index (NMI) both showed expansion. As employment

 improved further, consumer confidence rebounded and private consumption

 increased steadily. The economic recovery continued, albeit with moderate

 strength, as suggested by the government’s business climate monitor barely

 flashing “green” (representing stable growth) in October and moderate growth in

 private investment mainly owing to slower capital equipment outlay of the

 semiconductors industry. Projections by major forecasting institutions at home

 and abroad saw Taiwan’s economy to expand by 2.50%-2.61% this year and

 2.27%-2.41% next year, while the Bank’s own forecast is 2.61% this year and

 2.35% next year.

 In terms of external demand, bolstered by the steady expansion in the

7


-----

#### global economy and a lower base effect, Taiwan’s exports rose by 13.1% during

 the January-November period this year; exports in NT dollar terms grew at a

 slower pace of 6.9%, reflecting NT dollar appreciation. By product, electronic

 parts and components made up the most contribution to export growth, thanks to

 robust global demand for semiconductors. By market, exports to all major

 destination economies registered positive growth, with those to China showing

 the largest increase. In assessing the outlook, a stable global economic recovery

 and sustained strength in electronics will shore up Taiwan’s exports but the

 momentum could be dampened by unabated global economic uncertainties and a

 higher base year of 2017. Taiwan’s exports are expected to post moderate

 growth in 2018.

 With respect to domestic demand, with corporate profit gains likely to

 bolster business hiring and bonus sharing, as well as the announced plan to

 increase minimum wage and public sector pay, private consumption is expected

 to continue growing next year at a pace similar to this year.

 As for private investment, the semiconductor and panel industries are

 expected to continue investing in machinery and equipment, and the government

 has allocated more budget for technology development to facilitate projects on

 industry innovation as well as “forward looking” infrastructure development.

 Combined with the effect of a lower base for comparison this year, private

 investment is projected to record higher, albeit moderate, growth next year.

 Labor market conditions continued to improve. In the months since

 January, the average unemployment rate dropped year on year, and the average

 wage posted a mild increase.

 (2) Financial conditions

8


-----

#### The domestic market (nominal) interest rates have remained steady. The

 Bank has managed market liquidity through open market operations and kept

 banks’ excess reserves at an adequately accommodative level. The overnight

 call loan rate has also been steady. Taiwan’s real interest rate remained in

 positive territory and relatively higher than many major economies. Assessed

 against economic conditions, some of those economies enjoy higher GDP

 growth than Taiwan while recording relatively lower, and negative, real interest

 rates when compared with Taiwan.

 In regard to monetary growth, the M2 annual growth rate climbed to 4.07%

 in November, mainly because of faster growth in bank loans and investments

 and continued net foreign capital inflows. For the first eleven months of this

 year, the average annual M2 growth rate was 3.76%, within the Bank’s target

 range. In terms of bank credit, the annual growth rate of bank loans and

 investments rose from 4.15% to 4.79% year on year for the January-November

 period, mainly attributable to a steady economic recovery and greater demand

 for funds. The average annual growth rate of M2 and that of bank loans and

 investments were both higher than the sum of the 2017 projected GDP and CPI

 annual growth rates (3.22%), indicating that market liquidity conditions have

 been sufficient in meeting the need of economic activity.

 In recent months, both short- and long-term market interest rates have held

 steady, and the domestic stock prices have stayed elevated, whereas the NT

 dollar has strengthened against the US dollar. Overall, the financial condition

 index has pointed to slightly tighter financial conditions.

 Looking ahead, as a result of lingering global economic uncertainties and

 monetary policy divergence among major economies, cross-border capital

9


-----

#### movements will play a major part in M2 growth changes. Meanwhile, demand

 for funds buttressed by the mild economic recovery is expected to support

 continued growth in bank loans and investments.

 (3) Price trends

 Geopolitical risks in the Middle East and the extended oil output-cut

 agreement among OPEC members and non-OPEC oil producers have combined

 to push up international oil prices since September. In mid-December, Brent

 crude oil price hit a new high in two and a half years. However, international

 forecasts pointed to a mild increase in oil prices next year. Global grain prices

 swung lower on positive supply factors thanks to favorable weather conditions.

 Within the year, despite an upturn in international oil prices, imported

 inflationary pressures were mitigated by a stronger NT dollar. As a result,

 combined with stable basic cost of living and a higher comparison base of

 vegetables and fruit prices, consumer prices saw a smaller increase. The annual

 CPI growth rates averaged 0.57% for the first eleven months of the year, and the

 annual core CPI growth rate (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy prices)

 averaged 0.99% for the same period. In sum, current inflation remains stable.

 Soft domestic demand has led the output gap, a key factor of inflationary

 pressures, to be negative, indicating muted inflationary pressures. Reflecting this

 observation, the forecasts made by major institutions at home and abroad suggest

 a mild inflation outlook for Taiwan for this year and the next. The medians of

 domestic institutions’ forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are 0.62% and 0.96%,

 respectively, while those of international institutions’ forecasts are 0.60% for

 2017 and 1.30% for 2018. According to the Bank’s own forecasts, the CPI

 annual growth rate is projected to be 0.61% this year and 1.12% next year,

10


-----

#### and core CPI is expected to rise 1.02% this year and 1.12% next year. The

 inflation outlook remains stable.

 As for key determinants of price trends next year, sources of upside

 pressures include: the absence of major crop damage amid relatively stable

 weather conditions this year could result in more marked rises in vegetables and

 fruit prices next year; the cascading effect of the cigarette tax hike could

 continue into October 2018; the hikes in minimum wage and public sector

 employee pay next year may herald a private sector wage increase; international

 oil prices are expected to rise moderately. Downside pressures might arise from

 a still negative output gap and further reductions in telecommunication rates.

 3. Considerations for Monetary Policy

 (1) Global economic uncertainties still lie ahead, while the domestic recovery is

 on track but the output gap remains negative

 Since the Board last convened in September, the global economy continued

 with steady growth, with a stable outlook for 2018. However, monetary policy

 divergence among major central banks, the effects of the US economic and trade

 policies, mounting trade protectionism, and geopolitical risks might cast a longer

 shadow on the world’s international and financial prospects. In addition to

 persistent uncertainties, a higher base effect of exports could also inhibit

 external demand growth, while private investment is expected to increase

 mildly. In sum, the domestic economy is projected to recover at a moderate pace

 next year.

 (2) Current inflationary pressures and expected inflation are both mild

 During the period of January to November, domestic inflation has been

11


-----

#### stable. In view of moderate oil price rises expected for next year, soft domestic

 demand, and a still negative output gap, the inflation outlook is mild.

 (3) Financial conditions were slighter tighter

 In recent months, steady interest rates and domestic stock rally were

 accompanied by the NT dollar appreciation. Consequently, the financial

 condition index has pointed to slightly tighter financial conditions.

 (4) Taiwan’s real interest rate stands at an appropriate level compared to those of

 major economies

 Taiwan continued to exhibit positive real interest rates. Assessed against

 economic growth, many economies enjoying higher GDP growth than Taiwan

 recorded relatively lower, and negative, real interest rates, a reflection of a more

 loose monetary policy stance compared to Taiwan.

 II. Proposition and Decision about Monetary Policy

 1. Policy Proposition: To keep the discount rate, the rate on

 accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations

 without collateral unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%,

 respectively.

 2. All board members approved of keeping policy rates unchanged. The

 discussions are summarized as follows.

 In respect of the international economic situation, one board director

 expressed concerns about how risks to the global economic and trade outlook

12


-----

#### could affect Taiwan’s economic growth. There remain many international

 uncertainties next year, particularly lower world trade volume than this year,

 which could dampen domestic economic activity. Another board director

 suggested close attention be paid to changes in the interest rate gap between

 Taiwan and the US since the Federal Reserve already initiated the balance sheet

 normalization program and is expected to hike its policy rate further in 2018.

 With regard to domestic economic conditions, several board directors saw

 Taiwan’s economy as growing steadily but noted the recovery momentum was

 just moderate. One board director pointed out that private consumption

 recorded stable growth in the past few quarters and private investment is

 expected to grow faster next year, but their shares of GDP were both at their

 lows in recent years. These indicated that there is much room for both

 consumption and investment to increase further. Another board director noted

 that government efforts in boosting investment and the announced public sector

 wage increase would only generate some growth momentum for Taiwan’s small

 economy. One other board director added that Taiwan and the global

 economy will likely grow at a still moderate pace in the next three years,

 according to international forecasting institutions.

 During the discussion of domestic price trends, one board director stated

 that Taiwan’s basic cost of living, which includes water, electricity, health,

 communication, transportation, and education expenses and accounts for a

 weight of 16.62% in the consumer price index, has been steady this year with

 zero percentage point contribution to the annual CPI growth rate. This was

 conducive to stable inflation and has helped Taiwan sustain higher per capita

 GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP). Another board director observed that

 while previous hikes in electricity rates had pushed up prices, decreases in

13


-----

#### electricity rates have not brought about price declines.

 Several board directors and supervisors gave opinion on international

 raw material price trends and their possible effects on domestic inflation

 prospects. One board supervisor noted that as crude oil (including shale oil)

 inventory swung lower recently, futures investors largely trimmed their bets on a

 further decline in oil prices. Given large speculative positions in oil futures,

 improving global economic fundamentals, and heightened geopolitical risks in

 the Middle East, the current forecast based on international institutions’

 projections of next year’s oil prices seemed rather conservative. In addition,

 base metal prices and prices of other energy commodities such as coal and

 liquefied natural gas all climbed significantly, which could drive up domestic

 prices. Nevertheless, there are other factors at play when it comes to domestic

 price movements; for instance, recent grain price falls exerted a price-stabilizing

 effect. Overall, the annual CPI growth rate will still face upside pressures from

 import price uptrends. One board director also pointed out that crude oil

 futures prices could affect spot oil prices.

 Another board director noted the importance of monitoring the

 development of shale oil and the effect on oil prices; if the prospects of shale oil

 remain bright, increased shale output will likely contain sharp crude prices rises.

 One board supervisor saw future raw material price gains as having a lag

 effect on domestic prices, which are expected to increase in the second half of

 next year, while the effect will likely be felt by the advanced economies first.

 One board director pointed out that while weather-induced disruptions to

 domestic CPI were largely absent this year, future price movements will still

 face uncertainties associated with weather conditions.

14


-----

#### In their discussions regarding interest rate decision, many board directors

 expressed the view that monetary policy deliberation shall incorporate key

 factors such as domestic inflationary pressures, economic growth, and real

 interest rates. Against a backdrop of multiple uncertainties over the international

 economy, moderate growth momentum for the domestic economy, a still

 negative output gap, and a higher real interest rate compared to many major

 economies, it would be the appropriate decision to keep the policy rates

 unchanged. In particular, one board director judged that Taiwan’s output gap

 remains to be addressed, current inflation is mild with the inflation rate below

 2%, and the unemployment rate is likely to decrease further; this assessment

 underpinned the view that a rate hike would be premature. Moreover, a rate hold

 is also warranted by the concern that increasing the policy rate would add to

 mortgage burden on homeowners with a negative impact on consumer spending

 and, in turn, weigh on the gradual recovery of the domestic economy.

 Citing high correlation between interest rate policy implementation and M2

 growth target achievement, one board director expressed approval of the

 proposition, seeing a rate hold as conducive to attaining next year’s 2.5%-6.5%

 M2 growth target range, already agreed upon unanimously in this meeting.

 Another board director also favored the rate hold proposition, adding that

 effective monetary policy hinges on sending a clear signal to the market about

 the direction of policy, i.e., a rate increase/decrease indicates more rate

 increases/decreases in the coming quarters unless otherwise warranted. However,

 the overall domestic economic and price situations at present do not suffice for

 this approach; it is thus more appropriate to maintain the interest rates at their

 current levels.

15


-----

#### Several board directors and supervisors expressed their opinions about a

 rate cut. One board director agreed that maintaining current rates is the

 sensible path given that domestic economic and price trends remained largely

 unchanged; however, since Taiwan’s real interest rate was higher than those of

 most major economies, there seemed to be room for a rate cut. Another board

 director also noted that, while current situations validated the decision to keep

 the policy rate steady, in the future, a rate cut warranted by economic and

 financial conditions at home and abroad can provide an economic boost. One

 board supervisor suggested that in the context of continuously higher real

 interest rates in Taiwan than in other major economies, some of which had

 announced rate cuts, as well as subdued momentum for domestic growth, it

 might be possible to explore the option of a rate cut. Another board supervisor

 stated that considering future inflationary pressures stemming from recent raw

 material price rises, the timing was not ripe for a rate cut and it would be more

 appropriate to keep rates unchanged for now.

 With regard to the developments that the US, the UK, and South Korea all

 hiked their policy rates in the recent month, several board directors and

 supervisors expressed their view that Taiwan needed not follow suit as our

 economic, financial, and price conditions were not exactly the same as these

 countries. One board director pointed out that the US was already close to full

 employment, whereas Taiwan’s output gap remained negative. Taiwan also

 experienced muted inflationary pressures and a mild inflation outlook and

 witnessed NT dollar appreciation and the ensuing tightening of financial

 conditions. This board director cautioned that a policy rate hike could result in

 further currency appreciation, and exchange rate movements tend to have

 important effects on Taiwan’s economy. Furthermore, some countries enjoyed

16


-----

#### faster economic growth but registered lower, even negative, real interest rates,

 whereas Taiwan’s real interest rate was relatively higher and in the positive

 territory. On balance, it would be appropriate to keep the policy rates unchanged.

 Another board director shared a similar view in favor of a rate hold, stating

 that a negative output gap, mild inflation, and higher real interest rates than

 many neighboring countries warrant no change instead of acting prematurely by

 raising rates on the heels of the Fed’s hike.

 One board supervisor also pointed out that, comparing to South Korea,

 Taiwan exhibited less rapid growth, lower inflationary pressures, and a higher

 real interest rate, weakening the rationale for a rate hike. Another board

 director, also in support of a rate hold, observed that as Taiwan is likely to

 move ahead in next few years with moderate growth momentum and steady

 price trends, near-term market attempts to speculate the possibility of a rate hike

 simply based on the interest rate decisions of other central banks (such as rate

 hikes by the US Fed and the Bank of Korea) would be rather conjectural.

 One board director also noted that the European Central Bank and the

 Bank of Japan were in a “wait-and-see” mode instead of following the footsteps

 of the Fed to raise rates. Meanwhile, a domestic wage increase slated for next

 year and potential rises in international oil prices would affect future inflation

 and consequently the real interest rate. Given the highly uncertain prospects, it

 would be a well-advised decision to hold steady on policy rates; interest rate

 adjustments in line with international trends may be put on the table next year,

 depending on the economic and financial developments at home and abroad.

 Based on the assessment of domestic and international economic and

 financial conditions and prospects, the board directors all expressed approval of

17


-----

#### keeping policy rates unchanged.

 3. Monetary Policy Decision: The board directors reached a unanimous vote to

 keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the

 rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and

 3.625%, respectively.

 Voting for the proposition:

 Fai-nan Perng, Yu-jer Sheu, Jong-Chin Shen, Chin-long Yang, Tzung-ta Yen,

 Ming-yih Liang, Sheng-cheng Hu, Tsung-hsien Lin, Chen-chia Lee, Chung-dar

 Lei, Chao-yih Chen, Jin-lung Lin, Mei-lie Chu, Chao-hsi Huang, Bih-jane Liu

 Voting against the proposition: None.

 III. The Press Release

 The board directors and supervisors approved unanimously to issue the

 following press release in the post-meeting press conference, together with the

 Supplementary Materials for the Post-Monetary Policy Meeting Press

 Conference prepared by the Bank.

 The Bank will also announce the tentative schedule of Monetary Policy

 Meetings next year. The Meetings will take place on March 22, June 21,

 September 27, and December 20 in 2018, followed by a news conference.

#### Date: December 21, 2017

 Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan)

 PRESS RELEASE

 Monetary Policy Decision of the Board Meeting

 I. Global economic and financial conditions

 Since the Board met in late September this year, the global economy has

 experienced synchronized growth and will move into next year with a similar

 outlook. Among major economies, the US economy is expected to post mild

 expansion, while the euro area and Japan might show some signs of

 moderation. Growth in China and the ASEAN economies could grow at a

 slightly slower pace.

 Recently, central banks in advanced economies such as the US and the UK

 have been on the path toward gradual normalization of monetary policy,

 whereas Japan and most emerging market economies have continued with an

 accommodative monetary policy stance. The divergent path of monetary

 policy in major economies, the developments and impact of the US economic

 and trade policies, rising trade protectionism, and geopolitical risks will all

 add to the uncertainties surrounding the global economic and financial

 outlook.

 II. Domestic economic and financial conditions

 1. Exports and industrial production both recently recorded continuous

 expansion, while private consumption rose mildly. Nevertheless, growth

 momentum for private investment remained subdued. The CBC forecasts the

19


-----

#### domestic economy to advance by 2.41% in the fourth quarter 2017 and 2.61%

 for the entire year. Labor market conditions were stable with employment

 continuing to increase and the unemployment rate declining further.

 For the year of 2018, on the back of an anticipated steady recovery in the

 world economy, momentum for exports and private investment is likely to

 sustain. In addition, private consumption is expected to remain stable, and

 government spending may register continued growth. As a result, the CBC

 projects Taiwan's economy to advance 2.35% for 2018.

 2. In recent months, a continued upturn in international oil prices has pushed up

 domestic import prices. However, NT dollar appreciation has helped ease the

 pressure on imported inflation. Meanwhile, the stable rates on basic cost of

 living as well as a higher comparison base of vegetables and fruit

 priceswageThe CBC forecasts CPI and core inflation (excluding vegetables,

 fruit, and energy items) for 2017 to average 0.61% and 1.02% year on year,

 respectively, suggesting that current inflation is rather stable.

 Looking ahead to 2018, private sector might raise wages in step with the hikes

 in minimum wage and public sector employee pay, which could provide a

 thrust to prices. However, in the context of mild increases in international oil

 prices, moderate domestic demand, and the output gap remaining negative,

 the CBC projects CPI and core CPI to both rise at a pace of 1.12% year on

 year in 2018, reflecting a mild inflation outlook (see Table 1 in Appendix 1).

 3. Against a backdrop of stable inflation and economic recovery, the CBC has

 continued to manage market liquidity and help maintain banks' excess

 reserves at an appropriate level. For the first eleven months of the year, bank

 credit registered steady growth with bank loans and investments expanding by

20


-----

#### 4.79% year on year, while the monetary aggregate M2 posted an average

 annual growth rate of 3.76%. This suggests there is ample market liquidity to

 support economic activity.

 In recent months, both short- and long-term market interest rates have held

 steady, and the domestic stock prices have stayed elevated, whereas the NT

 dollar has strengthened against the US dollar. Overall, the financial condition

 index has pointed to slightly tighter financial conditions.

 III.Monetary policy decisions

 In sum, uncertainties still cast a shadow over next year's global economic

 outlook. The domestic economic growth is likely to pick up moderately, while

 the output gap remains negative. Both current inflationary pressures and

 future inflation expectations are anchored. The financial conditions have

 experienced some strains, while Taiwan's real interest rate stands at an

 appropriate level among major economies (see Table 2 and Figure 1 in

 Appendix 1). In light of the above developments, the Board judged that

 maintaining the policy rates and the M2 target range unchanged will help to

 foster a stable financial environment and achieve sustained economic growth.

 The Board reached the following decisions unanimously at the Meeting today:

 1. The discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on

 accommodations without collateral are kept unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%,

 and 3.625%, respectively.

 2. Taking into account the economic growth and price trends, the Board decided

 to set the 2018 M2 growth target range at 2.5% to 6.5% (see Appendix 2), the

 same as this year.

21


-----

#### The CBC will continue to closely monitor the latest developments in both

 actual and expected inflation, output gap, and other international and domestic

 economic and financial conditions. We will undertake appropriate monetary

 policy actions accordingly in an attempt to fulfill the central bank's statutory

 mandate.

 IV. In principle, the NT dollar exchange rate is determined by market forces. If

 irregular factors (such as massive inflows or outflows of short-term capital)

 lead to excess volatility and disorderly movements in the NT dollar exchange

 rate with adverse implications for economic and financial stability, the CBC

 will, in line with its mandate, step in to maintain an orderly market so as to

 ensure economic and financial stability.

 Considerations for the year 2018 M2 growth target range

 1. In 2018, the domestic economy is expected to recover moderately along with
 subdued inflationary pressures. In addition, several areas of concern, including volatile cross-border capital movements amid amplified
 uncertainties over global financial conditions, the developments and impact of the U.S. economic and trade policies, and slower growth in the Chinese economy, could affect Taiwan's economic recovery. Based on the
 assessment, the M2 growth target range for 2018 is set at 2.5% to 6.5%, unchanged from this year. The CBC will sufficiently meet the funding needs of the private sector in order to foster economic growth.

 2. Given the highly uncertain outlook for international and domestic economic
 and financial developments in 2018, the CBC will, as usual, review and assess the M2 growth target in mid-year and adjust the target range if necessary.
