#### Topics: Economic and Financial Conditions and Monetary Policy

 I. International and Domestic Economic and Financial Conditions

 Review by Department of Economic Research

 1. International Economic and Financial Conditions

 Developments since the previous Board meeting in June 2017 showed that

 the global recovery continued at a solid pace. International forecasting institutions

 slightly revised up global economic projections for 2017 and 2018 and expected

 next year’s performance to outpace this year’s. World trade volume growth also

 gained momentum from a recovering global economy, with steady growth to

 continue next year. Economic activity in most major economies picked up this

 year. As for next year, most of them are expected to grow at a slightly slower or

 similar pace, except for the U.S. where the economy is projected to strengthen

 further. Recent data pointed to mild inflation in major economies. Global

 inflation outlook is stable for both 2017 and 2018 according to international

 forecasting institutions.

 In the international financial markets, major currencies broadly appreciated

 against the US dollar and the dollar index dipped to a two-year low in early

 September. The euro and the Japanese yen rose against the US dollar, and most

 Asian currencies also strengthened. Meanwhile, the global stock markets

 recorded an extended rally on the back of the global economic pickup and loose

 monetary conditions.

 Key risks facing the global economy are threefold: (1) uncertainties over

 major economies’ policies, including the U.S. economic and fiscal policies,

 Brexit negotiations, and monetary tightening by the world’s main central banks

3


-----

#### (as the Fed began to reduce its securities holdings and would likely raise policy

 rates further, and the ECB is also expected to review its asset purchase

 program); (2) developments associated with trade protectionism; (3) impacts

 arising from geopolitical conflicts and climate change, including escalating

 tensions on the Korean Peninsula, a string of terrorist attacks in Europe, and

 disaster-related damage resulting from extreme weather.

 2. Domestic Economic and Financial Conditions

 (1) Economic situation

 During the period since the Board last convened, Taiwan enjoyed robust

 export growth amidst a global economic pickup. The Manufacturing Purchasing

 Managers’ Index (PMI) and the Non-Manufacturing Index (NMI) both showed

 expansion. Nevertheless, limited wage increases and a higher base-year amount

 of machinery/equipment investment resulted in moderate growth in private

 consumption and investment, leading to a mild economic recovery. Projections

 by major forecasting institutions at home and abroad put Taiwan’s GDP growth

 rate at 2.08%-2.18% this year and 2.15%-2.27% next year, while the Bank’s

 own forecast is 2.15% this year and 2.20% next year. The government’s plan to

 raise wages for the public sector might prompt the private sector to increase

 wages too. With this potential positive effect on private consumption, next

 year’s GDP growth projection is likely to be revised up.

 In terms of external demand, bolstered by a stronger global economy and a

 lower base effect, Taiwan’s exports grew by 12.5% during the first eight months

 of this year. The biggest contribution came from increased exports of electronic

 parts and components thanks to solid global demand for semiconductors.

 Exports to all major destination economies, especially South Korea, China, and

4


-----

#### ASEAN, registered positive growth. The outlook for Taiwan’s exports is

 expected to be supported by a steady global recovery, strong semiconductor

 demand, and introduction of new hand-held mobile devices. However, this

 momentum could be slowed by uncertainties over the global economic outlook

 and a dissipating lower base effect. For 2017 and 2018, Taiwan’s exports are

 expected to post moderate growth.

 In regard to domestic demand, corporate profit gains translated into

 improvements in the labor market and cash dividends to stockholders reached a

 five-year high. Both were considered conducive to private consumption, though

 wage growth was moderate. In this view, private consumption will likely record

 modest growth this year and grow slightly further next year.

 As for private investment, business sentiment was generally positive,

 commercial real estate saw an increase in demand, and the government was

 dedicated to carrying out the Forward-Looking Infrastructure Development

 Program. Despite these supportive forces, capital equipment imports dropped

 sharply in recent months as investment in semiconductor machinery and

 equipment was compared against a higher base. On balance, the Bank forecast

 Taiwan’s private investment to grow modestly in 2017 while next year’s growth

 rate would be slightly lower than this year.

 Labor market conditions continued to improve as the number of employed

 persons further increased, the unemployment rate fell year on year, and the

 average wage posted a mild increase.

 (2) Financial conditions

 In the months after June, market liquidity has remained ample, the annual

5


-----

#### growth rate of M2 has stayed within this year’s target range (2.5%-6.5%), and

 bank credit has expanded at a slightly slower pace. The NT dollar appreciated

 against the US dollar as compared to the same period last year, resulting in

 slightly tighter financial conditions. Nevertheless, a buoyant stock market and

 steady market interest rates have helped to keep the overall financial conditions

 accommodative.

 As mentioned, the domestic market interest rates have remained steady. The

 Bank has managed market liquidity through open market operations and kept

 banks’ excess reserves at an adequately accommodative level. The overnight call

 loan rate has also been steady. As a result of mild inflation, Taiwan’s real interest

 rate has returned to positive territory, whereas many major economies continued

 to register negative real interest rates. Assessed against economic conditions,

 some of those economies enjoy higher GDP growth than Taiwan while recording

 a relatively lower (negative) real interest rate when compared with Taiwan.

 The M2 annual growth rate climbed to 3.75% in August, mainly owing to

 firms’ inward remittances of goods sale proceeds to meet the needs of paying

 cash dividends. For the first eight months of the year, the M2 annual growth rate

 averaged 3.71%, lower than the same period last year because of a reduced

 amount of net foreign capital inflows. In terms of bank credit, the annual growth

 rate of bank loans and investments decreased slightly to 4.70% in August,

 mainly attributable to slower growth in bank claims on the government sector as

 stable gains from tax revenue weakened the need for financing. Bank loans and

 investment grew at an average pace of 4.68% year on year for the first eight

 months of the year. During the period of January to August 2017, the average

 annual growth rate of M2 (3.71%) and that of bank loans and investments

 (4.68%) were both higher than the sum of the 2017 projected GDP and CPI

6


-----

#### annual growth rates (2.95%). This indicates market liquidity conditions are

 sufficient in meeting the need of economic activity.

 Looking ahead, cross-border capital movements will likely become a major

 influence behind Taiwan’s M2 growth as the global outlook is still shrouded by

 uncertainties and the U.S. Fed will move ahead with balance sheet reduction and

 rate hikes. Meanwhile, demand for funds driven by the economic recovery is

 expected to support continued growth in bank loans and investments.

 (3) Price Trends

 The international oil prices have trended upwards since June, spurred by

 Saudi Arabia’s policy to cut its oil exports and a higher oil demand after the

 hard-hit U.S. refineries restored operations following Hurricane Harvey. Global

 grain prices dropped and stayed steadily low afterwards as supply exceeded

 demand amid favorable weather conditions in grain producer countries.

 Reflecting these trends, rebounding food prices have sent the domestic

 consumer price index to rise modestly year on year from June. The annual CPI

 growth rates averaged 0.72% between January and August, mainly because a

 slump in vegetable prices largely offset the price rises in fuel and food away

 from home. The average core CPI annual growth rate (excluding fruit,

 vegetables, and energy prices) for the same period was 0.97%. In sum, current

 inflation remains mild.

 Soft domestic demand has led the output gap, a key factor of inflationary

 pressures, to be negative. Therefore, inflationary pressures were contained. In

 this view, the forecasts made by major institutions at home and abroad suggest a

 mild inflation outlook for Taiwan in 2017. The medians of domestic institutions’

7


-----

#### forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are 1.00% and 1.12%, respectively, while those of

 international institutions’ forecasts are 0.90% for 2017 and 1.30% for 2018.

 According to the Bank’s own forecasts, the CPI annual growth rate is projected to

 be 0.80% this year and 1.12% next year, and core CPI is expected to rise 1.04%

 this year and 1.13% next year. The inflation outlook remains stable.

 As for future determinants of price trends, sources of upside pressures

 include: higher cigarette prices after the recent cigarette tax hike, anticipated

 mild rises in global oil prices, and the minimum wage increase as well as a 3%

 wage hike for public sector employees from January 2018. Downside pressures

 might come from a still negative output gap as aggregate demand could be

 slightly weaker than needed amid a lukewarm economic recovery, and further

 reductions in telecommunication rates.

 3. Considerations for Monetary Policy

 (1) Global recovery is steadily on track, but uncertainties remain.

 Since entering the second half of the year, both advanced and emerging

 market economies have experienced a steady recovery and are projected to

 perform better next year than this year. However, the U.S. Fed will soon begin

 with balance sheet normalization while the European Central Bank is about to

 review its asset purchase program. In addition, the U.S. economic and trade

 policies, trade protectionism, and geopolitical conflicts are also among the

 factors clouding the global economic and financial prospects.

 (2) From the second half of 2017 to 2018, Taiwan’s economic growth is likely to

 advance with mild momentum and to remain lower than potential.

 Lingering uncertainties over the global economy could dampen external

8


-----

#### demand. Meanwhile, domestic demand was tepid as retail sales continued to

 contract in recent months, and private investment was somewhat reserved as

 reflected in declining capital equipment imports. The economy is expected to

 advance with moderate momentum in the second half of 2017 and in 2018.

 (3) Current inflationary pressures and expected inflation are both mild.

 During the period of January to August, domestic inflation has been mild.

 As moderate oil price rises next year might lead to subdued global inflation

 expectations and soft domestic demand could also cause the output gap to

 remain negative, the inflation outlook is stable.

 (4) Taiwan’s real interest rate has reached above zero while many major

 economies still register negative real interest rates.

 As a result of mild domestic inflation, Taiwan’s real interest rate has

 returned to positive territory whereas those of many major economies remain

 negative. Compared with Taiwan, some of these economies exhibit higher

 economic growth rates but lower, and negative, real interest rates.

 II. Proposition and Decision about Monetary Policy

 1. Policy Proposition: To keep the discount rate, the rate on

 accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without

 collateral unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.

 2. All Board members approved of keeping policy rates unchanged.

 The discussions are summarized as follows.

 In respect of the international economic situation, several Board Directors

9


-----

#### and Supervisors expressed concern over how global outlook risk factors might

 affect Taiwan’s economic growth. One Board Director pointed out multiple

 uncertainties looming over the domestic economy, including trade protectionism,

 Sino-U.S. trade tensions, NAFTA renegotiations, Brexit talks, diverse timeframe

 and pace to exit quantitative easing policies by major central banks, and frequent

 cross-border capital movements. One Board Supervisor mentioned that trade

 protectionism, especially trade friction between the U.S. and China, could exert a

 powerful influence on Taiwan’s economy. Another Board Director further

 explained that considering a high proportion of Taiwanese investment in many of

 China’s IT giants among the primary exporters to the U.S., heightened trade

 protectionism could trigger trade conflicts between the U.S. and China, with

 possible indirect negative impact on Taiwan’s economy.

 With regard to domestic economic conditions, several Board Directors and

 Supervisors shared the view that external demand expansion contributed to a

 mild domestic recovery, but domestic demand remained subdued; they also

 expressed concerns over persistently sluggish momentum for investment growth.

 One Board Director pointed out that major foreign and local institutions forecast

 in September that Taiwan’s GDP growth rate next year would register between

 2.0% and 2.5%, indicating a mild pace of expansion; therefore, it is important to

 continue monitoring the trend of growth while exploring ways to stimulate

 private consumption and investment. Another Board Director mentioned that

 although continued increases in export orders and export growth in recent

 months have given a thrust to the economy, investment indicators associated

 with sustained growth in the longer term showed that Taiwan’s investment

 growth has stayed at a low level for some time. This could afflict longer-term

 economic growth because faltering investment could hinder acceleration in labor

10


-----

#### productivity growth.

 One Board Director noted that investment growth would remain stalled if

 five investment challenges posed by shortages of water, electricity, labor, land,

 and talent are not effectively addressed. One Board Supervisor stated that among

 the five challenging issues, electricity shortage is a key concern that could

 thwart investment. Another Board Director gave the opinion that monetary

 policy alone cannot overcome the issue of stagnant investment; it is vital that

 monetary policy be accompanied by other measures, such as those alleviating

 shortages of electricity and water.

 Several Board Directors and Supervisors expressed their views on how the

 public sector wage increase, effective next year, would affect the economic

 growth. One Board Director pointed out that this measure would help drive

 private sector pay hikes and, in turn, prop up private consumption. One Board

 Director stated that based on the government’s survey results, around 20% of

 private corporations increase regular earnings every year regardless of economic

 growth; therefore, it remains to be seen whether public sector wage increase will

 bring forth a broader pay raise across the private sector. One Board Director also

 noted that the positive effect of the public sector wage increase on private

 consumption could be offset by a contraction effect as civil servants might

 tighten their purse strings on concern over reduced income post retirement

 following the pension reform.

 One Board Supervisor further noted that the public sector pay raise would

 have a less aggregate effect on driving consumption growth because it would be

 partially financed by curtailing government current spending; moreover, if a

 larger part of the increase in consumption goes into outbound travel or import

11


-----

#### purchases, this would mean less contribution to domestic economic growth. One

 Board Director expressed a similar view, saying that (outbound) travel

 expenditures have made up an increasingly larger share of GDP in recent years,

 and private consumption growth, if partially offset by growth in imports, would

 hardly benefit economic growth. Currently available forecasts by major

 institutions including the Bank have not yet taken into account the effect of next

 year’s public sector wage hike, which is expected to boost the 2018 GDP growth

 a little further.

 On a related note, one Board Director pointed out that there remain many

 uncertainties about future economic growth; public sector wage hike and stable

 electricity supply are both pivotal to domestic demand strength and production

 activity. In addition, cross-strait economic and trade developments and the

 effectiveness of arch government projects including Forward-Looking

 Infrastructure Development Program and Digital Nation and Innovative

 Economic Development Plan also play a key role in determining domestic

 growth momentum. Close attention is warranted.

 The Board Directors also shared their opinions about the output gap. One

 Board Director noted that, according to the estimated potential output growth

 rate based on GDP forecasts by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting

 and Statistics as well as the Bank, the negative output gap has widened. Another

 Board Director mentioned that while anticipating Taiwan’s economy to grow

 faster next year than this year amid a bright global outlook and a gradual

 domestic recovery, the Bank also projects the negative output gap to widen; this

 calls for further in-depth study.

 In discussions about domestic financial conditions, one Board Director

12


-----

#### stated that the Bank has maintained banks’ excess reserves at an appropriate

 level, and the overnight call loan rate and the money market rate have been

 stable. For the first eight months of the year, the average annual growth rate of

 M2 stayed within this year’s target range. From June onwards, the annual

 growth rate of total outstanding loans and investments of monetary financial

 institutions has declined slightly but was still higher than the same period of the

 previous year. Another Board Director noted that since the beginning of the year

 both the stock market and the housing market have witnessed stronger trading,

 compared to the previous year; combined with steady market interest rates, bank

 lending is expected to register stable growth.

 The Board Directors also discussed the Fed’s decision to initiate balance

 sheet normalization in October and how this might affect the NT dollar

 exchange rate. Balance sheet unwinding will have a similar effect as raising the

 fed funds rate and could send the 10-year U.S. Treasury term premium higher.

 In this view, further US dollar strength would be on the horizon, as evident in

 the fact that the US dollar appreciated soon after the Fed’s announcement of the

 asset reduction plan. If the US dollar does strengthen, this might help ease

 upward pressures on the currency value of the NT dollar.

 In the assessment of major factors on which monetary policy deliberation is

 based, including domestic inflationary pressures, economic growth, financial

 conditions, and the real interest rate, several Board Directors expressed the view

 that against a backdrop of mild inflationary pressures and inflation outlook,

 lingering uncertainties over economic and financial trends, a widening negative

 output gap, and a higher real interest rate compared to many major economies,

 keeping the policy rates unchanged is the appropriate decision. One Board

 Director pointed out particularly that while the government is promoting

13


-----

#### investment in Taiwan and tackling youth unemployment, a rate hike might

 constrain private consumption, offsetting the benefit of the upcoming public

 sector wage increase. In order to help move the moderate economic growth

 towards further expansion, it is appropriate to maintain the current policy rate

 level.

 Another Board Director expressed a similar view that, in the context of a

 gradual recovery next year and insufficient momentum for private consumption

 and investment, it is even more important to maintain a stable financial

 environment while the government is pressing ahead with expansionary fiscal

 stimulation. A neutral policy stance where the policy rates remain at the same

 level would also conform to public expectations.

 One Board Director showed support for maintaining the current policy rate

 level, saying that caution is warranted as central banks of Taiwan’s major

 trading partners, as well as main export competitors including South Korea, also

 held rates unchanged at the juncture where another Fed rate hike is expected

 near the end of the year.

 Based on the assessment of domestic and international economic and

 financial conditions and prospects, the Board Directors all expressed approval of

 keeping policy rates unchanged.

 3. Monetary Policy Decision: Board members reached a unanimous vote to

 keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the

 rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and

 3.625%, respectively.

 Voting for the proposition:

 Supplementary Materials for the Post-Monetary Policy Meeting Press

 PRESS RELEASE

 Monetary Policy Decision of the Board Meeting

 I. Global economic and financial conditions

 Since the Board met in late June this year, advanced economies and emerging

 market economies have both been recovering at a steady pace. International

 institutions have revised up global GDP growth forecasts for 2017 and expect

 the global economy to perform better next year than this year.

 However, the US Fed is about to initiate the balance sheet normalization

 program, while the ECB may also review its asset purchase scheme. In

 addition, the US economic and trade policies, the rise in trade protectionism,

 and geopolitical tension will all add to the risk to the global economic and

 financial outlook.

 II. Domestic economic and financial conditions

 1. Since mid-2017, solid global economic growth has driven up exports. With

 regard to domestic demand, private consumption recorded limited growth,

 while declining capital equipment imports reflected the fact that firms were

 cautious about investment. The CBC forecasts that, in the second half of the

 year, Taiwan's economy will expand at an annual rate of 1.93%, slower than

 the first half year's 2.39%. For the year as a whole, the economic growth

 projection is 2.15%.

16


-----

#### Export growth is likely to benefit from a firming global economy next year.

 Meanwhile, the government rolled out the Forward-Looking Infrastructure

 Development Program to help bolster domestic demand with infrastructure

 spending. As a result, the CBC forecasts the domestic economy to advance by

 2.20% for 2018. Recently-announced pay rise for public sector employees

 next year may also encourage private enterprises to follow suit, contributing

 to higher private consumption. This may help the domestic economy to

 register stronger growth than projected.

 Labor market conditions improved further and employment increased

 continuously, with the services sector accounting for a larger increase than

 others. For the first seven months of the year, the unemployment rate

 averaged 3.76%, decreasing by 0.15 percentage points compared to the same

 period last year.

 2. From June onwards, on account of the rebound in domestic food prices, the

 CPI annual growth rate displayed a mild uptrend and reached 0.96% in

 August. For the first eight months of the year, the CPI annual growth rate

 averaged 0.72%. Core inflation (excluding vegetables, fruit, and energy items)

 recorded an average annual growth rate of 0.97%, indicating mild price rises.

 The CBC forecasts CPI and core inflation for 2017 to rise 0.80% and 1.04%

 year on year, respectively.

 Looking ahead to 2018, in the context of stabilizing international oil prices,

 subdued global inflation expectations, moderate domestic demand, and the

 output gap remaining negative, the CBC projects the annual growth rates of

 CPI and core CPI for 2018 to be 1.12% and 1.13%, respectively, reflecting a

 stable inflation outlook.

17


-----

#### 3. The CBC has continued to conduct open market operations to manage market

 liquidity. In the months from June to August, banks' excess reserves remained

 well sufficient. For the first eight months of the year, M2 and bank loans and

 investments posted average annual growth rates of 3.71% and 4.68%,

 respectively. This suggests that domestic financial conditions have been

 adequately accommodative and there is ample market liquidity to support

 expansions in corporate and household spending.

 Since the Board last convened, the NT dollar has strengthened slightly against

 the US dollar, the interbank overnight call loan rates have held steady, and

 government bond yields have trended down. While many countries registered

 negative real interest rates, Taiwan has seen its real interest rate return to

 positive territory (see Appendices 1 and 2).

 III. Interest rate decision

 In sum, uncertainties over the global economic outlook still weigh on external

 demand; domestic demand is mild, and economic growth, though projected to

 pick up at a moderate pace in the second half of this year and next year,

 would still run below potential. Meanwhile, the real interest rate has risen

 above zero, and both current inflation and inflation expectations stay

 anchored. Against this backdrop, the Board judged that a policy rate hold is

 conducive to financial stability and economic recovery.

 The Board reached the following decision unanimously at the Meeting today:

 The discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on

 accommodations without collateral are kept unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%,

 and 3.625%, respectively.

18


-----

#### The CBC will continue to closely monitor the latest developments in both

 actual and expected inflation, output gap, and other international and domestic

 economic and financial conditions. We will undertake appropriate monetary

 policy actions accordingly in an attempt to fulfill the central bank’s statutory

 mandate.

 IV. In principle, the NT dollar exchange rate is determined by market forces. If

 irregular factors (such as massive inflows or outflows of short-term capital)

 lead to excess volatility and disorderly movements in the NT dollar exchange

 rate with adverse implications for economic and financial stability, the CBC

 will, in line with its mandate, step in to maintain an orderly market so as to

 ensure economic and financial stability.
