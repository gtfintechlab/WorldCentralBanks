#### I. Staff Review of Economic and Financial Conditions

 Review by Department of Economic Research

 1. International Economic and Financial Conditions

 As manufacturing activity and trade gathered pace, the global economy is

 expected to rebound in 2017 after dipping to a low in the previous year and will

 perform slightly better in the second half of the year than the first half. Most

 economies post brighter prospects, with solid growth in the US, Japan, and the

 euro area, as well as Asian economies largely registering higher growth than

 2016. However, China could experience a modest slowdown. The economic

 recovery may bring forth mild inflation in advanced economies this year, while

 high inflation in emerging market economies is likely to ease owing to currency

 appreciation and policy actions in some countries.

 International stock markets were up and the VIX index held flat, whereas the

 global Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index rose higher. Meanwhile, the

 Fed’s plan to begin trimming its balance sheet in the second half year may lead to

 financial strains around the world, a destabilizing force to global financial

 markets. Rising trade protectionism could dampen the global trade recovery.

 Together with the path of Brexit negotiations increasingly unclear and

 geopolitical risk mounting, the global economic outlook still faces many

 uncertainties.

 2. Domestic Economic and Financial Conditions

 (1) Economic situation

 Labor market conditions have continued to improve since the March Board

 Meeting; thanks to the domestic economic pickup, the number of employed

3


-----

#### persons increased, the unemployment rate dropped further, and average monthly

 wages increased moderately. Despite the steady pace of economic expansion,

 growth in exports and capital equipment imports both slowed, while retail sales

 also posted limited growth. The overall monitoring indicator flashed a

 “yellow-blue” (“transitional” between “stable” and “sluggish”) signal.

 Considering these and a higher base effect in the second half of the year, the pace

 of the economic recovery may moderate slightly. Major forecasting institutions at

 home and abroad project Taiwan’s economy to advance between 2.04% and

 2.20%. The Bank forecasts this year’s GDP growth rate to be 2.13%, higher than

 last year’s 1.48%.

 In terms of external demand, a steadily recovering international economy

 further shored up demand for semiconductors and Taiwan’s exports of electronic

 parts and components increased. Combined with a lower base effect, the annual

 export growth rate was 12.5% for the first five months of the year, with positive

 growth registered in exports to all major destination economies. The outlook for

 the second half of the year points to steady growth in semiconductor demand

 supported by upward revision in forecasts for global economic and trade growth.

 Meanwhile, active business investment in the emerging applications related to the

 Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud services, among others, are also likely to fuel

 export growth. However, a slowing Chinese economy, lingering world trade

 protectionism and a higher base effect may combine to restrict export momentum

 in the second half of the year. For the year as a whole, though, exports are

 expected to register steady growth.

 In terms of domestic demand, consumer spending is expected to gain

 strength as production activity expanded steadily, corporate demand for labor

 increased, and cash dividends to stockholders reached a five-year high. However,

 because of limited real wage growth and low consumer confidence, the second

4


-----

#### half of the year will see lower growth momentum for private spending than the

 first half.

 Private investment is expected to be spurred by continued investment in

 machinery equipment and R&D among semiconductor manufacturers and the

 affiliated participants along the supply chain, as well as by firmer demand for

 commercial real estate. On the other hand, scores of leading indicators and

 coincident indicators continued on a downtrend, capital equipment import growth

 slowed in recent months, and investment in machinery equipment in the second

 half of the year faces a higher base effect. These factors combine to point to a

 more cautious outlook for private investment for the next half of the year.

 (2) Financial conditions

 Domestic market interest rates have kept steady, while the real interest rate

 was negative, similar to many other economies. Assessed against economic

 conditions, some of those economies enjoy higher GDP growth with a lower real

 interest rate when compared with Taiwan. This suggests the level of our real

 interest rate is appropriate and not too low.

 In May, the M2 annual growth rate climbed to 4.07% as net foreign capital

 inflows rose. For the first five months of the year, the M2 annual growth rate

 averaged 3.72%, staying within the target range (2.5% - 6.5%) and higher than the

 sum of the 2017 projected GDP and CPI annual growth rates. Bank loans and

 investments exhibited slower annual growth at a pace of 5.06% in May, mainly

 because banks pared down investment positions as they turned in the income tax

 revenue collected over to the government treasury. For the first five months of the

 year, the average annual growth rate of bank loans and investments was 4.65%.

 On balance, market liquidity conditions are judged as sufficient in meeting the

 need of economic activity.

5


-----

#### Since the beginning of the year, market liquidity has been ample, the

 overnight call loan rate has stayed steady, and the 10-year government bond yield

 has moved within a narrow range. Meanwhile, foreign capital showed a net

 inflow, the NT dollar appreciated, and Taiwan’s stock markets rallied. Steady

 interest rates and foreign buying of domestic stock shares have contributed to the

 easy conditions in money market and stock markets, which partially offset the

 tightening effect of a stronger currency. The overall Financial Conditions Index

 (FCI) indicated tighter conditions in June compared to the end of the previous

 year.

 Looking ahead, the domestic economic pickup would help to support

 demand for funds; however, as the Federal Reserve may carry on with rate hikes

 and uncertainties may still threaten to affect the domestic economy, international

 capital flows will be a key factor behind M2 growth trends in the coming months.

 Meanwhile, bank loans and investments are likely to grow steadily as the

 domestic recovery and mild growth in fixed investment drive a stable demand for

 funds.

 (3) Price Trends

 In 2017 so far, as the NT dollar appreciation helped mitigate imported

 inflationary pressures and food prices stayed low, consumer prices have risen

 mildly. For the first five months of the year, the average CPI annual growth rate

 was 0.60%, mainly because a slump in vegetable prices mostly offset the

 increases in fuel and fruit prices. The average core CPI annual growth rate

 (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy prices) for the same period was 0.97%.

 The OPEC announced an extended production freeze at the end of May

 instead of further output cuts as expected by the market, while the US continued

 to increase production and crude stockpiles remained high. Consequently, oil

6


-----

#### prices moved downwards. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA)

 projects that by the end of 2018 crude oil supply will slightly exceed its demand,

 putting a lid on oil prices.

 The forecasts made by major institutions at home and abroad suggest a mild

 inflation outlook for Taiwan in 2017. The median of domestic institutions’

 forecasts is 1.20%, and the median of international institutions’ forecasts is

 1.30%. The Bank forecasts this year’s CPI annual growth rate to be 1.07% and

 core CPI 1.11%. Compared to March projections, the inflation outlook remains

 stable.

 In part, mild domestic inflation also reflects a negative output gap. As

 demand softened, a widening negative output gap helped to contain inflationary

 pressures. The key factors behind domestic price trends include the following.

 Upward pressures on prices may come from (1) price increases for services such

 as buses and restaurants owing to higher labor costs under the five-day workweek

 system, (2) higher cigarette prices as a result of the June 12 hike of the cigarette

 tax by NT$20 per pack, and (3) an expected upsurge in vegetable prices owing to

 torrential rain in June. Meanwhile, the negative output gap and insufficient

 aggregate demand might create downward pressures on prices.

 3. Considerations for Monetary Policy

 (1) Global economy is set for a steady recovery, but uncertainties remain.

 As manufacturing activity and trade gradually picked up, global economic

 growth is expected to rebound from the low level of last year. Looking ahead,

 prospects are brighter for most economies. Nevertheless, the global economy is

 still clouded by uncertainties. In contrast to monetary easing in the euro area and

 Japan, the US Fed is gradually moving towards policy normalization, which

7


-----

#### might amplify financial market turbulence around the world. Global economic

 and trade policy uncertainties, progress of Brexit negotiations, and geopolitical

 risks could also hinder the global recovery.

 (2) Taiwan’s growth momentum might slightly soften in the next half of the year;

 current inflationary pressures and expected inflation are both mild.

 Slower growth in exports and capital equipment imports in recent months, as

 well as limited growth in retail sales, may put a drag on economic growth. For the

 first five months of this year, the price increase was mild. In terms of the inflation

 outlook for the second half of the year, the recent cigarette tax hike may exert

 upward pressures on prices. However, global inflation expectations are moderate,

 international oil prices stay low; domestically, demand growth is still slow and the

 output gap continues to be negative. On balance, the inflation outlook for this year

 remains stable.

 (3) Taiwan’s real interest rate in relation to economic growth stands at an

 appropriate level compared to major economies.

 Among a selected group of economies, many register negative real interest

 rates. Compared to Taiwan, some of them have higher economic growth but

 lower real interest rates. This may indicate that Taiwan’s real interest rate stands

 broadly appropriate compared with the economies in the group.

#### II. Proposition and Decision about Monetary Policy

 1. Policy Proposition: To keep the discount rate, the rate on

 accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without

 collateral unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.

 2. All Board members approved of keeping policy rates unchanged. The

 discussions are summarized as follows.

 Regarding the international economic situation, one Board Director

 expressed the view that though a global economic pickup is expected for this

 year, the longer-term growth trend is still weak. With the support of robust

 financial markets in recent years and a cyclical recovery in global manufacturing

 activity and trade since the second half of 2016, growth momentum for global

 economy will strengthen and world trade volume is expected to register faster

 growth too. With regard to advanced economies, the US expansionary fiscal

 stimulus is likely to drive up global economic growth, while the outlook for

 Europe and Japan seems brighter on the back of growth in global manufacturing

 sectors and world trade. With respect to emerging market economies, growth in

 this group is likely to gain stronger momentum as a rebound of commodity prices

 from early 2016’s low has brought forth a gradual upturn in commodity exporters

 while commodity importers including China have seen signs of improvement.

 The same Board Director also pointed out that although international

 forecasting institutions made similar projections for a global economic pickup,

 some of them recently revised down the forecasts for global GDP and trade

 growth for the coming years. The main rationales of the downward revision

 included (1) both supply-side and demand-side factors resulting in the low global

 growth trend have not receded, and (2) long-term structural factors will require

 more time to resolve. The global economy also faces several risks, including: (a)

9


-----

#### Decreases in trade and cross-border investment as a result of trade protectionism

 could cause global economic growth to falter; (b) a steeper-than-expected path of

 rate hikes in major economies could bring forth a sharper tightening of global

 financial conditions, carrying adverse implications for economies with

 vulnerabilities, and (c) re-emergence of financial deregulation in the world and

 financial tensions in some emerging market economies could hamper global

 financial stability.

 With regard to domestic economic conditions, one Board Director

 expressed views on the strength of the domestic recovery. In the second half of

 2016, as a buoyant semiconductor market and a stabilizing global economy

 helped drive a surge in export growth, and increases in capital outlay by

 semiconductor firms resulted in robust growth in private investment, Taiwan’s

 economy expanded faster by 2.46% from the former half year’s 0.46%. For this

 year as a whole, the domestic economy is likely to grow faster than last year at a

 pace of 2.05%, according to the DGBAS’ forecast. Although the economy has

 gradually regained strength from the trough in 2015, Taiwan could still face a

 long-term trend of lower growth encumbered by still weak momentum for a

 global recovery. Recently, some international forecasting institutions gave

 slightly downward revision to Taiwan’s GDP growth projections for the period

 between 2017 and 2020.

 In terms of domestic financial conditions, one Board Director discussed

 Taiwan’s M2 and credit growth. This Director stated that the M2 annual growth

 rate averaged 3.72% for the first five months of the year, lower than the median

 value (4.5%) of the 2017 M2 growth target range (2.5% - 6.5%). The main

 reason was that insurance companies bought more foreign

 currency-denominated bonds with the funds shifted into insurance policies from

10


-----

#### bank deposits. However, the 3.72% M2 growth was still higher than the sum of

 the projected GDP and CPI annual growth rates, which indicate sufficient

 liquidity to support economic activity. Despite some moderation in bank loans

 and investments in recent months, the annual growth rate remained on an

 upward path, suggesting no anomaly regarding M2 and credit growth.

 Board Directors expressed their opinions on the impact of exchange rate

 and stock price movements on financial conditions. One Board Director noted

 that both the NT dollar exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar and the NTD

 NEER (nominal effective exchange rate) index showed that the NT dollar has

 appreciated more than the Japanese yen, the Korean won, the renminbi, the

 Singapore dollar, and the euro. As of June, the overall financial conditions have

 tightened because of NTD appreciation since the beginning of the year. Another

 Board Director pointed out that, although rising stock prices helped to mitigate a

 tightening in financial conditions, the wealth effect of stock rallies mainly

 benefited foreign investors, who collectively hold about 40% of the shares listed

 on Taiwan’s stock markets. In particular, a large proportion of IT stocks, one of

 the most actively traded groups, are held by foreign investors, depriving local

 investors of the opportunity to fully enjoy the rewards of a stock rally while

 foreign investors garner most of the cash dividends. In this view, the influence

 of foreign investors’ activity in stock markets should also be considered when

 analyzing financial conditions.

 In addition, one Board Director noted there seem to be an increasingly

 significant correlation between the actions of foreign investors and movements

 in Taiwan’s foreign exchange and stock markets. This Director pointed out that

 co-movements between stock prices and exchange rates could create risks.

 Whether a high correlation of the two types of markets implies a rising risk is

11


-----

#### something worth exploring. There is also the question of whether foreign capital

 inflows are actually attracted by the stock market boom or meant for other

 purposes. Another Board Director concurred that frequent inflows and outflows

 of foreign capital will certainly pose a higher risk.

 Several Board Directors discussed the US Fed’s rate hike, and the

 movements and spread of the US and Taiwan’s bond yields. One Board Director

 shared the observation that the US bond yields declined in spite of the Fed’s

 continued policy rate hikes, showing the Fed’s rate decisions are not the only

 force behind bond yields. Another Board Director noted that investors still find

 the US treasuries attractive because Japan’s 10-year bond yield was close to zero

 and the yields on German and French short-term (under 5 years) bonds slipped

 into negative territory, but the US treasuries, with a large market and among the

 most liquid assets, still exhibited positive yields across all maturities. Many

 Board Directors shared similar views. One Board Director said that although the

 risk was elevated with the US being the source, investors have generally

 considered US Treasuries to bear the lowest risk and thus increased their

 holdings. As a result, the US bond yields did not rise in response to the US rate

 hikes but dropped instead. Such trends would therefore narrow the spread

 between Taiwan’s and US longer-term bills. It is important to heed how this

 would affect international capital movements.

 In sum, the Board Directors expressed their views in favor of the monetary

 policy proposition. Several Directors noted that, in the second half of the year,

 the strength in Taiwan’s economic recovery may be dampened by limited

 growth in exports and slower upturns in private consumption and private

 investment. Meanwhile, the economic growth is forecast to run below potential.

 Considering a sustained increase in exports, it would be reasonable to keep the

12


-----

#### policy rates at their current levels.

 Several Board Directors also pointed out that monetary policy decisions

 should take into account both current inflationary pressures and the future

 inflation outlook. At present, domestic prices were relatively moderate and

 inflation expectations were mild, while a negative output gap remained with real

 output below potential output. The circumstances do not necessarily warrant

 monetary tightening.

 One Board Director stated that Taiwan’s real interest rate, though negative,

 was still higher than those of the US, Singapore, South Korea, and Hong Kong,

 while Taiwan’s 2017 GDP growth projections by forecasting institutions were

 broadly lower than these economies. A comparison regarding Taiwan’s real

 interest rate and GDP growth rate suggest that Taiwan did not post a relatively

 low real interest rate, while our monetary policy stance was not particularly

 loose and even tighter than some economies. This indicated there was no urgent

 need for a rate hike.

 With respect to monetary policy outlook, one Board Director further

 expressed the approval of maintaining current policy rate levels. Meanwhile, the

 Fed carried on with rate hikes, there remained international economic

 uncertainties, and some central banks made prudent decisions to hold rates

 unchanged, including Taiwan’s major trading partners such as China, Japan, and

 the euro area, and a primary export rival South Korea. Against this backdrop, the

 Bank should carefully examine future developments and take appropriate

 actions in response as warranted.

 Based on the assessment of domestic and international economic and

 financial conditions and prospects, the Board Directors expressed approval of

13


-----

#### keeping policy rates unchanged.

 3. Monetary Policy Decision: Board members reached a unanimous vote to

 keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the

 rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and

 3.625%, respectively.

 Voting for the proposition:

 PRESS RELEASE

 Monetary Policy Decision of the Board Meeting

 I. Global economic and financial conditions

 Since the beginning of the year, world trade has gradually picked up and the

 international economic recovery has gained a more solid footing. The

 near-term outlook points to moderate US economic expansion, a sustained

 eurozone recovery, and modest acceleration in Japan. Growth in emerging

 market economies is likely to gather pace, while the Chinese economy might

 experience a mild slowdown.

 In the context of the economic uptick and subdued inflation, central banks in

 the euro area and Japan both maintained monetary easing policies. The US

 Fed, however, continued on the path toward gradual normalization, which

 could heighten financial market volatility. The global economic outlook also

 faces other causes for concern, including uncertainties associated with

 international economic and trade policies, the progress of Brexit negotiations,

 and geopolitical risks.

 II. Domestic economic and financial conditions

 1. As the domestic economic upswing bolstered labor market conditions,

 employment increased and the unemployment rate dropped further. With

 weaker momentum in exports and capital equipment imports during recent

 months, combined with limited growth in retail sales, Taiwan's economy is

 expected to moderate slightly in the second quarter. The Directorate-General

 of Budget, Accounting, and Statistics (DGBAS) forecasts that, in the second

15


-----

#### half of the year, the economy will advance at 1.76%, slower than the first

 half year's 2.37% owing to a higher base effect. For the year as a whole, the

 economic growth projection is 2.05%.

 2. Since early 2017, NT dollar appreciation has helped ease the pressure on

 imported inflation and domestic food prices have exhibited a downtrend. The

 CPI annual growth rate averaged 0.60% for the first five months of the year.

 Core inflation (excluding vegetables, fruit, and energy items) grew at an

 average pace of 0.97%, indicating mild inflationary pressures at present.

 Factors including the newly-increased cigarette tax are expected to drive the

 CPI higher in the second half of 2017 than the first half. Nevertheless,

 considering subdued global inflation expectations, falling oil prices, and soft

 domestic demand, the CBC forecasts CPI and core CPI inflation for 2017 to

 rise 1.07% and 1.11% year on year, respectively, reflecting a stable inflation

 outlook.

 3. Against the backdrop of the domestic economic recovery and stable

 inflation, the CBC has continued to conduct open market operations to

 manage market liquidity and maintain banks' excess reserves at a sufficiently

 accommodative level. Bank credit expanded steadily, with its year-on-year

 growth averaging 4.65% for the first five months of the year. Growth of the

 monetary aggregate M2 stayed within the target range. The M2 annual

 growth rate for the first five months of the year was 3.72%. All these reflect

 ample market liquidity in support of economic activity.

 In the year to date, liquidity in the banking system has been abundant,

 overnight call loan rates have remained steady, and the 10-year government

 bond yield has moved within a narrow range. Meanwhile, net foreign capital

 inflows have led to NT dollar appreciation and a domestic stock market

16


-----

#### rally.

 III. Interest rate decision

 Current domestic inflationary pressures and inflation expectations are both

 mild. Meanwhile, domestic real interest rate relative to GDP growth is still

 at an appropriate level among major economies (see Appendices 1 and 2).

 However, uncertainties remain in the global economy, and growth

 momentum in the domestic economy may slightly weaken in the second half

 of the year. Taking into account the above factors and the expansionary

 fiscal policies implemented by the government, the Board judged that a

 policy rate hold and an accommodative monetary policy stance are

 conducive to price and financial stability and help to foster economic

 growth.

 The Board reached the following decision unanimously at the Meeting

 today:

 The discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the

 rate on accommodations without collateral are kept unchanged at

 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.

 The CBC will continue to closely monitor both inflation developments as

 well as international and domestic economic and financial conditions. We

 will undertake appropriate monetary policy actions in line with the central

 bank’s statutory mandate.

 IV. In recent years, international capital flows have become the dominant factor

 behind exchange rate movements. In the first half of this year, substantial

 foreign capital inflows have brought about an upsurge in foreign currency

 supply, resulting in NT dollar appreciation against the US dollar.

17


-----

#### In principle, the NT dollar exchange rate is determined by market forces. If

 irregular factors (such as massive inflows or outflows of short-term capital)

 lead to excess volatility and disorderly movements in the NT dollar

 exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial stability,

 the CBC will, in line with its mandate, step in to maintain an orderly market

 so as to ensure economic and financial stability.
