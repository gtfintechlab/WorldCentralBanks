##### Agenda Item: Economic and Financial Conditions and Monetary Policy

 Decision

 I. Review of Economic and Financial Conditions

The Department of Economic Research presented the following review:

**1.** **International Economic and Financial Conditions**

Since the March 2018 Board meeting, growth in both advanced and emerging market

economies showed steady expansion. Global growth this year will likely advance at a similar

pace as the previous year, according to international forecasting institutions. While the US

economy is projected to gather steam, the euro area, Japan, China, and other Asian economies

will likely register slower growth than the previous year. With global trade liberalization

facing possible hurdles, world trade volume might post narrower expansion. Global inflation

is expected to trend up slightly this year amid continued economic growth and price increases

in international oil and other raw materials.

In terms of monetary policy in major economies, the US Federal Reserve just announced

a fresh rate hike but said that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative. The

ECB decided to end its asset purchases by the end of this year but its current low interest rate

policy would carry forward till at least next summer. Meanwhile, the BoJ and the PBoC both

kept their policy rates unchanged. These developments indicated that major economies

maintained an easy monetary policy stance.

In the international financial markets, expectations of faster Fed rate hikes and escalating

US-China trade disputes have encouraged capital flows into US dollar assets in recent

months. Consequently, emerging market economies such as Argentina, Turkey, and Brazil

have seen stock market crashes, capital outflows, and heavy currency devaluation. Volatility

in global financial markets has heightened.

While on track for steady expansion this year, global economic growth still faces four

major risks: (1) further actions towards monetary policy normalization in major economies,

which could in turn impact those emerging market economies with higher debt levels, adding

to global financial vulnerabilities; (2) escalation in trade frictions among major economies,

2


-----

with adverse implications for international economic and trade activity and destabilizing

forces over the global economy and financial markets; (3) mounting global debt levels that

could crimp government capabilities to finance stimulus programs; (4) geopolitical risks

that could impair investor confidence and climate change that might cause economic loss and

more displacement and migration. These risks could compound the uncertainties surrounding

the global economic and financial outlook.

**2.** **Domestic Economic and Financial Conditions**

(1) Economic situation

Developments in the year to date pointed to mild expansion of the domestic economy,

with robust exports, rising consumption, and continued stable outlook (“green light”) in recent

months as reflected by the government’s monitoring indicators. However, leading indicators

were trending down, a sign for possible weakening in growth momentum in the second half of

2018. In particular, export growth might be dampened by a higher base effect, whereas

domestic demand will remain the driving force for economic growth. The Bank revised up

**its** **forecast** **for** **the** **2018** **domestic** **economic** **growth** **rate** **to** **2.68%,** citing

better-than-expected first quarter growth and the upward revision to the Bank’s forecasts for

this year’s export and private investment growth.

For the first five months of the year, exports firmed up by 11.2% on the back of global

economic expansion and international raw material price rises. By product, electronics parts

and components and base metal were the main contributors to export growth. By market,

exports to major destination economies registered positive growth. Looking to the second half

of the year, a higher base effect will weigh on export performance despite steady global

economic growth and increased demand for emerging technology applications. For the year as

a whole, Taiwan’s exports are expected to register mild growth.

Consumer confidence dipped in recent months and the willingness to spend could be

dented after the public sector pension reforms take effect in July. However, improving labor

market conditions, including increased employment, lower unemployment rates, and mild

wage growth, coupled with record high cash dividends from exchange- or OTC-listed

companies, will likely buttress private consumption in the second half of the year; steady

growth is projected for the year as whole.

3


-----

Private investment growth is likely to rebound in the second half of 2018. This is based

on the expectation of increased semi-conductor capital outlay, higher investment in

construction works owing to stronger demand for residential housing, and a lower base of the

previous year. Growth in private investment in 2018 is projected to exceed the previous year.

(2) Financial conditions

Taiwan’s nominal market interest rates remained stable. Against a backdrop of foreign

capital outflows as a result of net foreign selling in the stock market and the flow of tax

revenue into the national treasury, the Bank has continued to manage market liquidity through

open market operations since April. As a result, the interbank overnight call loan rate merely

edged up and banks’ excess reserves were on average kept at a level similar to that of the

previous year. Taiwan’s real interest rate, though still in negative territory, is relatively

moderate compared to a host of major economies.

In terms of monetary growth, the M2 annual growth rate averaged 3.62% for the first

five months of the year, within the Bank’s target range. In regard to bank credit, bank lending

to the private sector grew steadily amid continued economic expansion at home. Bank loans

and investments posted an average annual growth rate of 4.93% in the January-May period,

which indicated ample supply of credit. In recent months, markets rates held steady, domestic

stock market swung high, and the NT dollar real effective exchange rate went lower. Overall

financial conditions were still easy.

Looking ahead, rapid cross-border capital flows induced by continued US monetary

policy normalization and trade conflicts among major economies will play a key role in

dictating Taiwan’s monetary growth trend. Meanwhile, bank loans and investments will likely

increase steadily as funding needs stay bolstered by sustained economic growth.

(3) Price Trends

Since April, international oil prices trended up to hit the highest level in more than three

years but then slipped back to swing within a narrow range as Saudi Arabia and Russia

mulled over increasing oil production and the US oil supply rose further. International

institutions revised up their oil price projections, which would exceed those of last year.

International grain futures prices in recent months fell lower after ticking up, largely tracking

the changes in expected crop yields.

4


-----

In terms of domestic prices, vegetable and cigarette prices hiked, and import prices were

pushed up by higher-than-expected global oil price rises. However, year-on-year NT dollar

appreciation vis-à-vis the USD helped ease imported inflationary pressures. For the first five

months of the year, Taiwan’s consumer price index (CPI) posted an average annual growth

rate of 1.66%, while the core CPI (excluding vegetables, fruit, and energy) grew 1.40%.

Inflation remained mild.

Inflation outlook for the second half of the year indicates slower CPI annual growth,

reflecting cuts in mobile communication charges and the waning of the deferred effect from

last year’s cigarette tax hike. As a key indicator of future inflation, the still negative output

gap this year, albeit narrower on the back of steady domestic demand growth, suggests

inflationary pressures will be moderate. The median of domestic institutions’ CPI forecasts is

1.40% and that of international institutions’ forecasts is 1.50%. Taking into account of

international oil price increases, the Bank revises up its forecast of CPI inflation to 1.40%,

with a lower forecast of about 1.00% if the cigarette tax hike effect is excluded. The core CPI

**forecast is revised down to 1.16% owing to reductions in telecommunication rates. The**

inflation outlook remains mild.

As for the primary factors behind this year’s price trends, sources of upside pressures

include (1) elevated international oil prices owing to geopolitical risks in the Middle East, (2)

a lingering deferred effect from the cigarette tax hike through to the end of this year, albeit

gradually waning in the latter half of the year, (3) higher inflation expectations, stoked by

rises in oil, electricity, and fuel prices as well as price hikes for some daily necessities, and (4)

faster wage growth since the beginning of this year. Sources of downside pressures include a

continued downtrend of telecommunication rates and a still negative output gap.

**3.** **Considerations for Monetary Policy**

(1) Domestic inflation remains steady; inflation outlook for 2018 is mild

The annual CPI growth rate averaged 1.66% for the first five months of the year and is

forecast by the Bank to ease to 1.21% for the latter half of the year as the deferred effect from

the cigarette tax hike gradually fades away. Overall, the inflation outlook is mild, with the

2018 annual growth rate projected to be 1.40% for CPI and 1.16% for core CPI.

5


-----

(2) Slight moderation in domestic growth in the next half year owing to lingering uncertainties

over global economic outlook; a narrower but still negative output gap for 2018, with gentle

growth momentum.

Despite the ongoing steady global economic expansion, future risks, including

heightening financial vulnerabilities, continued debt buildup, escalating trade friction, and

geopolitical conflicts, could intensify uncertainties over the world’s economic and financial

outlook, with possible impact on domestic economic growth momentum. In view of these

factors, as well as a higher base effect, the Bank projected the economy to expand slower at

2.30% for the second half of 2018, with a mild 2.68% pace for the year as a whole.

(3) Major economies including the US, the euro area, Japan, and China have maintained an

accommodative monetary policy stance.

(4) Taiwan’s nominal and real interest rates stands at appropriate, moderate levels compared to

those of major economies.

##### II. Proposition and Decision about Monetary Policy

**1.** **Policy Proposition: To keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with**

**collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375%,**

**1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.**

2. All board members approved of keeping policy rates unchanged. The discussions are

summarized as follows.

In respect of international economic conditions, several board directors expressed concern

about the effect that global trade friction might exert on Taiwan’s economic prospects. One

board director pointed out that the developments in the looming trade battle that the US engaged

with China and Europe posed uncertainty to domestic economic growth. Another board director

added that, before the US-China tariff measures take effect on July 6, the stock markets had

already felt the shocks. Furthermore, though the partnership the US and Europe have forged

over the years has been a stabilizing force for the global economic and trade systems, allowing

6


-----

world trade to expand faster than the global economy, that partnership has taken a turn, with the

two sides laying blame and retaliation on each other since the beginning of the year. This will

have implications for the global economic and trade stability and development, as well as for

the domestic economy.

With regard to domestic economic conditions, several board directors shared views on the

current situation and future prospects. One board director noted that Taiwan’s economic

recovery was still moderate. Another board director pointed out that, though having performed

well in the first half of the year, economic growth in the second half year will trend down from

quarter to quarter. This board director called for a close watch on the impact of public sector

pension reforms on domestic demand, as some industries including food services and hotels

already felt the impact since the enactment of the reforms.

In terms of domestic price trends, one board director stated that inflation was still

considered to be mild at present, despite a rising annual CPI growth rate for the first five

months of the year. Inflation expectations for the entire year will also be subdued as the

annual CPI growth rate is expected to decline in the fourth quarter.

During the discussion about the interest rate decision, several board directors noted that

macroeconomic conditions have stayed largely the same since the Board last convened. They

recognized that actual and expected inflation rates were mild, the output gap remained

negative, and uncertainties over economic prospects lingered both at home and abroad;

meanwhile, domestic economic growth showed moderate strength and Taiwan’s real interest

rate was at an appropriate level. In this consideration, the board directors were in favor of a

rate hold.

This view was shared by several other board directors, who also expressed their opinions

on the future calibration of monetary policy. One board director showed approval for a rate

hold, mainly based on the projection of slower domestic growth, stable inflation, and

persisting international uncertainties in the second half of 2018. This member further pointed

out the divergent signals from financial indicators: (1) Taiwan’s annual M2 growth rate has

basically been higher than the sum of the real GDP growth rate and the annual CPI growth

rate, meaning it has typically exceeded the nominal GDP growth rate, which was not the case

for the Jan.-May period this year; (2) compared to the time when the Board last convened, the

7


-----

Financial Conditions Index (compiled by the Bank) in June indicated less comfortably loose

conditions. Taking observations (1) and (2) together, it showed a less accommodative

liquidity level. (3) The Fed’s rate hikes have led to a widening spread between US and

Taiwan’s 10-year government bond yields since September 2017; the ensuing capital

outflows and an increase in foreign currency deposits suggested an adjustment in funding

behavior among the general public. (4) With Taiwan’s real interest rate deeper into the

negative territory, coupled with the aforementioned change in funding behavior, future

interest rate considerations will be even more complicated and require further deliberations.

Another board director also favored a rate hold, citing mild, manageable inflation and a

still unsettled economic outlook at home, as well as the impact from trade friction overseas.

Based on previous monetary policy-making of the Bank’s Board, a rate change has often been

followed by multiple adjustments in a row, a pattern that future rate hike discussions should

take into account. Yet, current considerations seemed to support a wait-and-see approach for

the time being. A rate hike might be in order if inflation becomes unanchored or other

unfavorable situations, such as an excessively wide yield spread, come to light.

A number of board directors said they agreed that maintaining the current policy rate

levels would be appropriate but pointed out that future rate decisions should also be weighed

against the influence of exchange rate movements on future domestic prices. One board

director based the consent on the lack of urgency in a rate change as inflationary pressures

would likely be muted in the second half of the year; however, future price trends will face

amplified influences from exchange rate movements as the effect of NTD appreciation to

contain imported inflation is expected to recede. Moreover, foreign research shows that after

the global financial crisis oil price changes have a significant influence on inflation

expectations, i.e., inflation expectations have become more susceptible to oil price changes. In

the case of Taiwan, import prices of raw materials and commodities could affect inflation and

inflation expectations more easily in the future. This indeed calls for attention and such

factors should be taken into account in future rate change deliberations.

Another board director contended that, despite oil price rises and recent NTD

devaluation, the NT dollar maintained a year-on-year appreciation trend since the beginning

of 2018, conducive to easing imported inflationary pressures. To date, imported inflation has

not presented a cause for concern in Taiwan. This board director showed support for a rate

8


-----

hold, mainly on account of a still negative output gap and mild and stable inflation. Future

policy rate adjustments will depend importantly on changes in the output gap and prices. For

example, if effective demand increases, domestic output and economy post strong growth, or

larger wage hikes occur, which in turn boost production costs and lead prices to turn upwards,

then a rate rise can be put under consideration.

Another board director also approved of keeping rates unchanged and suggested that

responses should be considered for the case when the domestic inflation rate exceeds 2%.

Accordingly, a forward guidance approach, similar to the US Fed’s, may be adopted to signal

how policy rates would be adjusted in response to future inflation rate changes. In terms of

ways to adjust policy rates, some forward guidance approaches might be more transparent and

better than others.

Furthermore, several board directors stated the importance to recognize the possibility of

a rate change once the developments warrant such a move. One board director pointed out

that, unlike the March Board Meeting, the Fed’s fresh 0.25% rate hike brought up a new

factor to be considered in this Meeting; however, this board director still expressed support

for a rate hold, mainly because other major central banks including the ECB, the BoJ, and the

PBoC all kept their policy rates unchanged. If the large aircraft carriers have chosen to stay

steady, a smaller boat like Taiwan’s economy would be better off to wait and see.

Nevertheless, it should be worth noting that, while this year’s inflation is expected to register

under 1.5%, the average CPI annual growth rate for the first five months of the year already

climbed over 1.5%, which was rarely seen for the same period as shown in figures of the past

decade and more. In this view, it would be crucial to closely monitor inflation trends,

particularly an uptrend which would then warrant contemplating a rate change. Meanwhile, as

the Fed might announce more rate hikes in the future, given Taiwan’s susceptibility to foreign

capital flows, monetary policymakers need to be prepared and watchful in the second half of

the year for appropriate adjustments as needed.

One other board director also gave approval for keeping rates steady and pointed out that,

9


-----

besides being prepared for possible future policy rate changes, the Board could also attempt

some ways to communicate this to the public and prepare them for such possibilities. This

would align market expectations better with the implementation of monetary policy should

such scenarios materialize. Another board director added that the world is about to enter a rate

hike cycle as the Fed has begun rate rises and the ECB and the BoJ are expected to hike rates

gradually; in this light, domestic borrowers are advised to pay attention to interest

rate-associated risks in case of a rate increase by the Bank.

Based on the assessment of domestic and international economic and financial

conditions and prospects, the board directors all expressed approval for keeping policy rates

unchanged.

**3. Monetary Policy Decision: The board directors reached a unanimous vote to keep the**

**discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on**

**accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%,**

**respectively.**

**Voting for the proposition:**

Chin-long Yang, Yu-jer Sheu, Jong-chin Shen, Tzung-ta Yen, Nan-kuang Chen, Ming-yih

Liang, Sheng-cheng Hu, Tsung-hsien Lin (voting by proxy), Chen-chia Lee, Chung-dar Lei,

Jin-lung Lin, Mei-lie Chu, Chao-hsi Huang, Bih-jane Liu, Shiu-sheng Chen

**Voting against the proposition: None.**

 PRESS RELEASE

 Monetary Policy Decision of the Board Meeting

I. Global economic and financial conditions

Since the Board met in late March this year, the global economy has experienced a robust

expansion. Among major economies, growth in the US economy has accelerated, whereas

the euro area, Japan and China have shown signs of slight moderation. An uptrend in

commodity prices including oil prices has led global inflation to rise. Meanwhile, markets

expected a faster pace of the US Fed's rate hikes, and trade conflicts between the US and

China raised concern. These developments have induced capital outflows and declines in

stock prices and currency values in some emerging market economies, heightening the

volatility in global financial markets.

The Fed announced another rate increase last week, yet its policy stance remains

accommodative. The ECB decided to phase out its asset purchase program by the end of

the year and maintain policy rates at present levels at least until the summer of 2019.

Moreover, central banks in Japan and China both kept their policy rates unchanged. This

indicates that major economies still held an accommodative monetary policy stance.

Looking ahead, the continuation of the path toward monetary policy normalization by

major central banks may have a further impact on debt-laden emerging market economies

and could raise global financial fragilities. This, combined with escalating trade frictions

among major economies, will all increase the uncertainties over the global economic and

financial outlook.

II. Domestic economic and financial conditions

1. For the year to date, exports have posted solid growth and private consumption has picked

up. The domestic economy advanced at a steady pace. As for the second half of the year, it

is expected that export growth momentum may soften because of a higher base effect,

whereas domestic demand will continue to serve as the primary driver of economic growth.

11


-----

With regard to private consumption, the upcoming enforcement of the public sector

pension reform may slightly affect consumers' willingness to spend. Nevertheless,

bolstered by a gradual improvement in labor market conditions, such as increased

employment, declining unemployment rate, and mild wage growth, private consumption is

likely to grow steadily. In addition, private investment growth may rebound on account of

an anticipated rise in capital expenditure by domestic manufacturers and a lower base

effect. As a result, the CBC forecasts Taiwan's economy to advance by 2.30% for the

second half of the year.

For the year as a whole, the CBC has revised up the economic growth projection to 2.68%,

reflecting a better-than-expected performance in the domestic economy in the first quarter

and the CBC's upward revisions in export and private investment growth.

2. The increase in international oil prices was larger than expected, pushing up domestic

import prices. Furthermore, rising vegetable prices and the hike in cigarette prices also

contributed to a greater increase in CPI inflation in recent months. For the first five months

of the year, the average CPI annual growth rate was 1.66%, while core inflation (excluding

vegetables, fruit, and energy items) averaged 1.40%, suggesting that current inflationary

pressures remain mild.

In terms of the inflation outlook in the second half of 2018, the annual growth rate of CPI

is expected to moderate to 1.21% as telecommunication rates were pared down and the

deferred effect from last year's cigarette tax hike fades away. The CBC, taking into account

of international oil price increases, has revised up its forecast of CPI inflation to 1.40% and

revised its core CPI forecast downwards to 1.16% in view of reductions in

telecommunication rates (see Table 1 in Appendix for major institution projections).

3. The CBC has managed market liquidity through open market operations in response to

domestic economic conditions. Banks' reserves have remained at an appropriate level. In

recent months, an uptick in short-term market rates was accompanied by small declines in

the 10-year government bond yield, and the NT dollar weakened against the US dollar,

pointing to continued easy financial conditions.

For the first five months of the year, bank credit registered steady growth, expanding by

4.93% year on year, while the monetary aggregate M2 posted an average annual growth

12


-----

rate of 3.62%, within this year's target range.

III. Interest rate decision

In sum, the inflation outlook for the year of 2018 is mild, along with gentle rises in

domestic prices. As uncertainties over the global economy linger on the horizon, domestic

economic growth is expected to slow slightly in the latter half of the year. For the year as a

whole, the output gap is likely to close further but remain negative, with moderate

momentum for economic expansion. It is also noted that the world’s major economies have

continued with an accommodative monetary policy stance. Meanwhile, Taiwan's nominal

and real interest rates register around the middle range among a host of economies (see

Figure 1 and Table 2 in Appendix). Based on the above assessments, the Board judged that

a policy rate hold and a continued accommodative monetary policy stance will help ensure

price stability and foster steady economic and financial development.

The Board reached the following decision unanimously at the Meeting today:

The discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on

accommodations without collateral are kept unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%,

respectively.

The CBC will continue monitoring the latest domestic economic and financial conditions

and stay vigilant on the developments in monetary policy in other economies and global

trade protectionism and their implications for Taiwan's economic prospects and financial

market stability. We will timely undertake appropriate monetary policy actions as

warranted in order to fulfill the central bank's statutory mandate.

IV. Against a backdrop of amplified volatility in global financial markets recently, the NT

dollar exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar has experienced greater fluctuations, albeit to a

less extent compared to other major currencies.

In principle, the NT dollar exchange rate is determined by market forces. If irregular

factors (such as massive inflows or outflows of short-term capital) lead to excess volatility

and disorderly movements in the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for

economic and financial stability, the CBC will, in line with its mandate, step in to maintain

an orderly market so as to ensure economic and financial stability.
