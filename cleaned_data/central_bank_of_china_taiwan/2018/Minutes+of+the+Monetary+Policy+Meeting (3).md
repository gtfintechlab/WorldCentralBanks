#### Agenda Item: Economic and Financial Conditions and Monetary Policy

 Decision

 I. Review of Economic and Financial Conditions

The Department of Economic Research presented the following review:

**1.** **International Economic and Financial Conditions**

Since the December 2017 Board Meeting, growth in the advanced and emerging market

economies has continued to pick up; a steady global expansion is anticipated for this year,

even outpacing last year according to the projections of international forecasting institutions.

Although growth in global trade volume could slightly weaken year on year owing to China’s

slowdown and growing world trade protectionism, it is projected to advance faster than global

output, indicating that world trade is still thriving.

Global inflation is expected to rise steadily amid continued global economic growth and

rising raw material prices. Inflation in advanced economies is rising gradually, whereas South

Korea and ASEAN countries could see slower price growth because of a higher comparison

base the previous year.

In the international financial markets, equity price volatility intensified at the beginning

of the year but abated after mid-February, while VIX (the widely-followed measure of

expected volatility) also dropped then and moved within a narrower range. The euro and

Asian currencies broadly strengthened against the US dollar as positive economic prospects

lured capital flows into the euro area and Asia.

While the global economy looks set for further expansion, three major risks could still

hamper this growth scenario: (1) steeper path of monetary policy normalization by major

central banks (Fed, ECB, and BoJ); (2) economic and trade fallout from elevated

protectionism; (3) aggravated financial market turbulence that weigh on global economic

growth and market confidence, compounding the uncertainties surrounding the global

economic outlook.

**2.** **Domestic Economic and Financial Conditions**

(1) Economic situation

Recent developments showed that the domestic economy is largely expanding at a

moderate pace; leading indicators continued to rise, and both manufacturing and

non-manufacturing firms maintained a positive business outlook. Labor market conditions

have been stable, with a steady downtrend in the unemployment rate and a mild increase in

the average wage. Overall, economic growth this year is expected to be driven by domestic

demand, as contribution from net external demand will be crimped by a higher comparison

base from last year’s export performance. The Bank forecasts Taiwan’s economy will grow

**2.58% this year.**

For the first two months of the year, exports increased by 7.3%, thanks to a steady global

economic expansion and a rise in international raw material prices. By product, base metal

and articles thereof, electronic parts and components, and machinery were the main

contributors to export growth. By market, exports to most of major destination economies

registered positive growth. In general, although the demand for new technology applications,

as well as continued global economic upturn, is likely to bolster exports of the related

categories, Taiwan’s exports are expected to register mild growth this year due to a higher

base effect.

With corporate profits growing, employers might be more willing to increase hiring and

hand out bonus pay. Strong consumer confidence will also stimulate spending. Therefore,

private consumption is expected to gain more momentum and take the lead in bolstering this

year’s economic growth.

Private investment also exhibits brighter prospects. Firms are building up production

capacity with greater investment in machinery and equipment as the global economy

strengthens. Construction investment will benefit from an improving property sector and the

government’s infrastructure spending, as well as a lower base effect. This year’s growth in

private investment is anticipated to turn higher than the year before.

(2) Financial conditions

The nominal market interest rates in Taiwan remained stable. The Bank managed market

3

liquidity and helped keep bank reserves at an adequate level, and the overnight call loan rate

of the banking sector was also steady. Taiwan’s real interest rate, though slipping into

negative territory, is relatively moderate compared to a host of major economies.

In terms of monetary growth, the M2 annual growth rate averaged 3.60% for the first two

months of the year, within the Bank’s target range. In regard to bank credit in the year so far,

bank lending to the private sector grew steadily, but the pace was slower than the previous

year as some companies issued corporate debt to repay bank loans, locking in lower funding

cost for a longer term. The average annual growth rate of bank loans and investments was

4.45% for the first two months of the year, higher than the sum of the 2018 projected GDP

and CPI annual growth rates (3.85%), which indicates sufficient supply in the credit market.

In recent months, narrow fluctuations in the domestic stock market, steady market

interest rates, and a year-on-year decline in the real effective exchange rate index of the NT

dollar represented easier financial conditions, as reflected in the uptrend of the Bank’s

financial condition index. Meanwhile, housing transaction volume has gained a better footing,

in tandem with price corrections.

Looking ahead, Taiwan’s monetary growth this year might be affected by frequent

cross-border capital flows on concerns that global financial stability and economic growth

could be impaired by monetary policy normalization of major central banks, the US economic

and trade policies, and the concomitant spread of protectionism from the US to the rest of the

world. As for bank loans and investments, steady growth is expected, as continued domestic

economic growth could reinforce demand for funding.

(3) Price Trends

International oil prices touched a three-year high in late January and later fluctuated at a

lower, narrow range in line with the changes in US crude oil inventories. For the year as a

whole, oil prices are going to move higher than last year according to forecasts by several

international institutions. In terms of grains, unfavorable weather in key growing areas led to

worries about lower crop yields, pushing up international grain futures prices in the year to

date.

In addition to international oil and grain prices, domestic consumer prices were also

affected by the lingering effect of last year’s cigarette tax hike and recent rises in vegetable

4


-----

prices. For the first two months of the year, Taiwan’s consumer price index (CPI) posted an

average annual growth rate of 1.54%, while the core CPI (excluding vegetables, fruit, and

energy) grew 1.61%. Current inflation is mild.

Generally speaking, the overall CPI changes tend to be more gradual than steep, whereas

prices of individual commodity items could sometimes surge or slump. Moreover, what each

household purchase and how often they make these purchases vary from one to the next. As a

result, there is often a gap between price changes as gauged by the CPI and as perceived by

the public. Among the items people buy more frequently, the prices of 17 consumer

commodities, closely monitored by the Cabinet’s task force on price stabilization, have

trended up recently and recorded an annual growth rate of 3.22% in February. The increase

was mainly driven by steeper price rises in milk, eggs, pork, and poultry, and consumers tend

to feel pinched when these items become more expensive.

Despite the public perception, there was not an across-the-board increase but a mixed

trend for different items. It is often the case that consumers are sensitive to price rises in what

they buy more frequently (such as food products) and relatively unconcerned when those

occasionally-purchased items (such as computers/communication/consumer electronics)

exhibit price changes. For the first two months of this year, more frequently-purchased items

(bought at least once every quarter) registered a higher CPI annual growth rate (3.87%) than

the overall CPI annual growth rate (1.54%), which explains a stronger public concern for

price rises.

Meanwhile, although prices of some household paper products hiked to factor in

international pulp price movements, and electricity rates are to be raised from April onwards

to reflect higher costs of fuel imports for power generation, these factors only made a modest

influence on the overall price trend. Nevertheless, close attention is warranted should inflation

expectations become biased upwards.

Moderate domestic demand has led the output gap, a key indicator of future inflation, to

be negative, suggesting subdued inflationary pressures as reflected by the forecasts from

major foreign and domestic institutions. The median of domestic institutions’ CPI forecasts is

1.18% and that of international institutions’ forecasts is 1.30%. According to the Bank’s

**forecasts, the CPI annual growth rate is projected to be 1.27% this year and core CPI is**

5


-----

**expected to rise 1.26%. The inflation outlook remains mild.**

As for key factors behind this year’s price trends, upside pressures might come from the

following: (1) private sector pay increases spurred by rises in minimum wage and public

sector wage a while earlier; (2) the effect of the cigarette tax hike carrying forward to the

year-end; (3) an upsurge in food prices including vegetables and fruit owing to a lower

comparison base the previous year; (4) higher inflation expectations as a result of the

anticipation of global oil prices rises, a scheduled hike in electricity rates, and the recent price

increases of some daily necessities. Sources of downside pressures include a continued

downtrend of tele-communication rates and the persistence of a negative output gap.

**3.** **Considerations for Monetary Policy**

(1) Current inflationary pressures and expected inflation are both mild

The annual CPI growth rate averaged 1.54% for the first two months of the year.

International prices of crude oil and other raw materials are expected to move higher, and

domestic prices might also be lifted by wage increases. On the other hand, the output gap

remains negative, and demand-pull inflationary pressures are gentle. Overall, the inflation

outlook is moderate, with the 2018 annual CPI growth rate projected to be 1.27% by the

Bank.

(2) Taiwan’s real interest rate stands at an appropriate level compared to those of major

economies

(3) Uncertainties facing the global economic outlook might thwart domestic growth momentum

Although the global economy is expected to pick up further, there remain uncertainties

surrounding the outlook as well as financial stability, including monetary policy

normalization by major central banks, intensifying international trade tension and

protectionism, and greater volatility in financial asset prices.

(4) Domestic growth momentum could weaken slightly; actual output is below potential

Exports might grow a little more slowly because of a higher base effect, whereas

domestic demand will be the key driving force of economic growth given a rebound in private

investment and steady private consumption growth. According to the Bank’s forecast, this

year’s economic growth rate will be a moderate 2.58%, slightly lower than last year’s 2.86%.

#### II. Proposition and Decision about Monetary Policy

**1.** **Policy Proposition: To keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with**

**collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375%,**

**1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.**

2. All board members approved of keeping policy rates unchanged. The discussions are

summarized as follows.

In respect of the international economic situation, several board directors expressed

concerns that uncertainties over the global economic and trade outlook could affect Taiwan’s

economic growth. One board director pointed out that, according to several recent studies on

global risks published by major international institutions, the biggest source of global risks

come from a potential trade war. If the US trade protectionism triggers retaliatory actions by the

countries affected, then it would very likely spark a trade war. In this case, Taiwan’s economy

could suffer direct impacts, while supply chain disruptions and a global economic downturn

stemming from a trade war could also indirectly affect the domestic economy.

Another board director cited the forecasts by international institutions and pointed out that

while Europe, the US, and the world will register faster growth this year than last year, Asian

economies, including Japan and China, will slightly decelerate. In the meantime, the global

economic outlook remains clouded by many uncertainties. Future developments in protectionist

measures and the effects of tax reforms in the US, geopolitical risks, and the fact that China has

been investing significantly more to expand semiconductor production capacity could all

undermine domestic economic growth.

With regard to domestic economic conditions, a number of board directors noted that

moderate momentum and uncertainties exist for the domestic economy. One board director

pointed out that domestic forecasting institutions have just revised up this year’s growth

projections for Taiwan, but the projected growth still trails last year’s performance. Another

board director mentioned that domestic demand, Taiwan’s growth engine this year, has been

picking up, but it is also important to monitor the progress and potential influence of pension

reforms.

-----

In terms of domestic financial conditions, multiple board directors expressed their views

regarding the housing market and home mortgage regulations imposed by the Bank. One

board director noted that, since high-value housing projects tend to serve as a benchmark for

pricing homes for sale, the Bank needs to continue monitoring high-value housing

transactions in 2018 and 2019. Another board director observed that banks might in some

cases loosen risk control over high-value home mortgages on account of the special

qualifications of borrowers for such loans. Also, it is important to ensure housing justice.

Therefore, this director considered it to be the right move to keep related regulations in place.

One other board director expressed a similar view that restrictions on high-value housing

loans are still necessary, mainly because such regulations have contributed partly to the

positive development where more new property projects have begun to offer other housing

types rather than focusing on luxury homes.

In discussing about domestic price trends, several board directors and supervisors gave

their opinions regarding current inflation, inflation outlook, and inflation expectations. One

board director explained that it was the seasonal factor that pushed the February CPI to a

13-month high, as this year’s Lunar New Year holidays fell in February; however, the average

CPI annual growth rate for the first two months of the year and the median of 2018 CPI

forecasts by major institutions were both moderate. One board supervisor added that the CPI

spike in February was also attributable to the deferred impact of last year’s cigarette tax hike,

and the same price measure would be significantly lower by excluding the seasonal factor and

the tax effect. Another board director stated that current inflation was mild; in the coming

months, oil prices and electricity rates might turn higher but the increase will be within a

manageable range.

One board director noted that a recent rush for household paper products warranted

attention as this might be an indication of public expectations of price rises. Another board

director pointed out that, based on a newly-released survey by a domestic institution, inflation

expectations did increase but not to a great extent, which suggested inflation expectations

remained well-anchored. In addition, surveys on inflation expectations in several other

countries show that consumers seem inclined to interpret higher prices in their recent

purchases as price rises on a full scale; as a result, inflation expectation could easily exceed

the projected or actual level by more than one percentage point.

While discussing the interest rate decision, many board directors said that they have

taken stock of domestic inflation outlook, economic growth, and the real interest rate and

noted that current and expected inflation were both mild, the output gap was still negative,

and uncertainties continued to weigh on economic prospects at home and abroad. Accordingly,

they shared the view that it would be appropriate to keep policy rates unchanged. In particular,

one board director pointed out that, while the real interest rate turned negative as opposed to

the positive value when the board convened last time, this measure was just one of the

elements for the Bank’s monetary policy deliberation. The primary objectives of the Bank’s

operations have long been price and financial stability while fostering economic growth

within the scope of these objectives. Since the increase in current inflation was small and

acceptable, a policy rate hold would be in order.

One other board director also agreed, citing that the domestic output gap was still

negative, and, despite price rises, the average CPI annual growth rate for the first two months

of the year was below 2%. However, the Bank should pay close attention to price changes and

give careful consideration about policy rate adjustment should inflation rise above 2% in the

coming months.

One board director contended that, aside from inflation and the unemployment rate,

exchange rate movements also play a key role in monetary policy-making. First, the inflation

rate remained below 2%. Second, while the unemployment rate has dropped to a recent low,

the common phenomenon of low wages suggested that slack remained in the labor market.

Third, many companies are sensitive to exchange rate movements as Taiwan is an

export-oriented economy. With the NT dollar already strengthening against the US dollar, a

policy rate hike could cause the NT dollar to appreciate further and disturb corporate

investment strategies, which would contradict the government’s efforts in promoting domestic

investment. Based on the consideration that policy rate decisions should not induce excess

volatility in the foreign exchange market and a surge in capital inflows, a policy rate hold

would be warranted.

Another board director also expressed support for a rate hold. At present, the government

is reinforcing its efforts to promote investment in Taiwan, with an aim to industry

restructuring through greater investment in external and internal demand-oriented sectors.

Against this backdrop, stable monetary policy will provide some predictability for firms and

9


-----

investors in their investment decisions and thus galvanize domestic investment, which

justifies keeping the policy rates unchanged for the time being.

One board director stated that maintaining the current policy rate levels would be

appropriate, and that policy rate adjustments generally serve two purposes. In addition to the

announcement effect, policy rates are often fine-tuned instead of sharply changed, and there

tends to be a transmission lag. Therefore, policy rate changes, once initiated, could come in

several small increments so as to achieve the intended effect. In this view, present domestic

and international economic situations warrant a rate hold, with future adjustments dependent

on the overall economic and financial developments.

Furthermore, several board directors also approved of keeping rates steady, taking into

account the trajectory of monetary policies in major economies. One board director noted that

neighboring Asian economies, rivals and partners alike, have held off policy rate adjustments

in recent months, and Taiwan, facing a similar background, had little reason to break ranks

and hike rates. Another board director pointed out that the recent US rate hike will be

followed by further gradual increases, and the euro area and Japan will also raise rates albeit

at a slower pace; given the current economic and financial conditions, it will serve Taiwan

well to stay put. Nevertheless, the zero interest rate policy of major advanced economies since

the 2008 global financial crisis could have unhealthy influences on the economy in general.

Interest rates, in the long term, should allow market forces to play out, and policymakers shall

be prepared that interest rate changes would eventually set in for the market mechanism to

function.

Based on the assessment of domestic and international economic and financial

conditions and prospects, the board directors all expressed approval of keeping policy rates

unchanged.

**3. Monetary Policy Decision: The board directors reached a unanimous vote to keep the**

**discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on**

**accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%,**

**respectively.**

release in the post-meeting press conference, together with the Supplementary Materials for

the Post-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank.

Date: March 22, 2018

#### Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan)

 PRESS RELEASE

 Monetary Policy Decision of the Board Meeting

I. Global economic and financial conditions

Since the Board met in late December last year, advanced and emerging market economies

have posted solid expansion, which may lead global economic growth to strengthen further

in 2018. Among major economies, growth in the US economy is expected to accelerate,

the euro area continues to exhibit robust growth, while Japan and China are likely to

expand at a slower pace. Amid the continued global economic pickup, raw material prices

may register an uptrend, and therefore inflation in major economies is expected to move up

gradually.

Looking ahead, the progress of monetary policy normalization implemented by central

banks in major economies, US economic and trade policies, which could cause trade

protectionism to spread on a global scale, and heightened volatility of financial asset prices

may have an impact on global financial stability and economic outlook.

II. Domestic economic and financial conditions

1. For the year to date, exports have risen moderately, while capital equipment imports have

recorded a smaller decrease. Consumer confidence has been robust, and the domestic

economy has continued to grow. Labor market conditions were stable, with employment

steadily increasing and the unemployment rate declining further.

Growth momentum in exports may slightly weaken this year owing to the base effect.

Nevertheless, the Forward-Looking Infrastructure Development Program rolled out by the

government may shore up private investment, while mild wage increases are likely to boost

private consumption, which will combine to bolster domestic demand as a major driving

force for economic growth. The CBC forecasts Taiwan's economy to advance at an annual

rate of 2.58%, slightly slower than the 2.86% of the year before.

12


-----

2. For the first two months of the year, the average annual CPI growth rate was 1.54%,

mainly driven by higher vegetable and cigarette prices. Core inflation (excluding

vegetables, fruit, and energy items) recorded an average annual growth rate of 1.61%,

indicating a moderate price uptrend.

As imported raw material prices such as crude oil are expected to rise this year and the

hikes in minimum wage and public sector employee pay may spur wage increases for

workers in the private sector, domestic prices are likely to go up. However, with the output

gap remaining negative, demand-pull inflationary pressures are subdued, and the inflation

outlook is stable. The CBC projects CPI and core CPI to grow at a pace of 1.27% and

1.26% year on year in 2018 (see Appendix 1).

3. Against a backdrop of continued economic growth and stable inflation, the CBC has

continued to manage market liquidity through open market operations and bank reserves

have stood at an appropriate level. For the first two months of the year, bank loans and

investments and the monetary aggregate M2 posted average annual growth rates of 4.45%

and 3.60%, respectively, deemed sufficient to support economic activity.

In recent months, market liquidity has remained ample and market interest rates have held

steady. The NT dollar has strengthened against the US dollar, but the real effective

exchange rate (REER) index of the NT dollar trended down as major currencies

appreciated more markedly against the US dollar. Overall, the financial condition index

has generally reflected easy financial conditions.

III. Monetary policy decisions

In sum, both current inflationary pressures and future inflation expectations are mild, and

Taiwan's real interest rate stands at an appropriate level among major economies (see

Appendix 2). In addition, global economic outlook still faces uncertainties, while the

domestic growth momentum could soften modestly from the previous year and the actual

output remains below potential. Based on the above assessment, the Board judged that a

policy rate hold will help safeguard price and financial stability and foster economic

growth.

The Board reached the following decision unanimously at the Meeting today:

The discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on

13


-----

accommodations without collateral are kept unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%,

respectively.

The CBC will continue to watch the latest developments in domestic economic and

financial conditions including actual and expected inflation and the output gap. We will

closely monitor the progress of policy normalization by major central banks, monetary

policy changes in emerging market economies, and risks likely induced by heightened

financial market turmoil around the world. The CBC will timely undertake appropriate

monetary policy actions as warranted by these developments in order to fulfill the central

bank's statutory mandate.

IV. The CBC has adopted consistent exchange rate policy aimed at dynamic stability. In

principle, the NT dollar exchange rate is determined by market forces. If irregular factors

(such as massive inflows or outflows of short-term capital) lead to excess volatility and

disorderly movements in the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for

economic and financial stability, the CBC will step in to maintain an orderly market.
