##### Agenda Item: Economic and Financial Conditions and Monetary Policy

 Decision

 I. Review of economic and financial conditions

The Department of Economic Research presented the following review.

**1.** **International Economic and Financial Conditions**

Since the Board last convened in March 2019, the forecast for this year’s global

economic growth had been revised down by major international institutions to a level lower

than the previous year’s, based on concerns about escalating US-China trade friction,

increased financial fragilities in debt-ridden economies, the Brexit stalemate, and geopolitical

tensions. Global trade volume was also widely forecast to grow slower this year as global

trade conflicts were feared to continue and the world economy could falter along.

Major economies were forecast to grow at a slower pace this year than last year, with

recent developments from May onwards pointing to heightened US-China trade friction and

weaker global economic and trade growth. In terms of inflation, international institutions

projected that, for the world as a whole and for most of the economies individually, this year’s

inflation would trend lower than last year, given the expected global slowdown and a slight

year-on-year decline in international oil prices.

The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan

(BoJ) had kept policy rates unchanged and adopted a more dovish stance. Since April, central

banks in several Asia-Pacific economies had announced rate cuts to bolster economic growth.

In regard to developments in international financial markets since May, global stock

rallies had been thwarted by renewed trade woes between the US and China. With capital

flowing out of emerging market economies, their currencies, including the renminbi, had

weakened alongside a stronger US dollar. Meanwhile, a confluence of factors, including a

bleak global economic outlook and subdued inflation, increased dovishness by major central

banks, and stronger sentiment for risk aversion, had sent more funds into bond markets,

leading the yields on major 10-year government bonds to a near-term low.

The following uncertainties could tilt global economic risks further to the downside.

(1) With trade tensions intensifying between the US and China, the outcome of trade

2


-----

talks ahead would impact global economic prospects.

(2) A pending “no-deal” Brexit and Italy’s declining fiscal health could add to European

political and economic uncertainties and hamper financial stability of the region.

(3) Non-financial sector debt is building up in the US and China while global financial

fragility is increasing, a threat to international financial and economic conditions.

(4) Heightened geopolitical risks could also cloud the global economic outlook.

**2.** **Domestic Economic and Financial Conditions**

(1) Economic situation

Growth momentum had been moderate so far this year. The domestic business climate

monitor had signaled a yellow-blue light for four months in a row. While leading indicators

had risen, coincident indicators had continued to fall. These combined to obscure the

near-term outlook, warranting close monitoring.

For the economy as a whole, growth was projected to gather pace quarter by quarter,

supported by government stimulus measures to shore up domestic demand, as well as a lower

base from the previous year. The Bank forecast Taiwan’s economy to grow 2.36% in the

second half of the year, higher than the 1.73% of the first half of the year. The economy was

forecast to expand 2.06% for the entire year, with domestic demand the main driver of

growth. However, future developments in US-China trade talks would be a crucial factor in

this outlook.

In terms of GDP by expenditure components, exports contracted during the first five

months of the year owing to US-China trade friction and a slowing global economy. External

demand would remain weak in the second half of the year, but orders arising from new

business opportunities and transferred from areas subject to higher US or Chinese tariffs

might shore up export growth. The Bank expected exports to register mild growth in real

terms for the year of 2019.

As to domestic demand, investment in machinery equipment and construction works had

continued to increase. The government had carried on with the signature Forward-looking

Infrastructure Development Program and efforts in encouraging Taiwanese businessmen to

invest back in Taiwan. In this view, the Bank expected this year’s real private investment to

3


-----

grow steadily. With respect to private consumption, slower economic growth, thinner

corporate profits, weaker wage growth momentum, and falling consumer confidence led the

Bank to project this year’s real growth in private consumption would be slower than the

previous year.

Meanwhile, labor market conditions remained stable. For the first four months of 2019,

the average unemployment rate rose slightly year on year and regular earnings grew at a

somewhat slower rate. By contrast, the number of employed persons continued to increase.

(2) Financial conditions

Since the month of May, net foreign capital outflows and tax revenue inflows into the

national treasury had caused market funding conditions to slightly tighten and short-term

interest rates to edge up. As the Bank conducted open market operations to manage liquidity

as warranted, the average bank excess reserves had stayed above NT$40 billion in recent

months. Compared to major economies and adjusted for inflation, Taiwan’s real interest rate

had been around the middle of the range. Taiwan’s 10-year government bond yield ticked

lower, mainly in step with a decline in the 10-year US treasury yield. The NT dollar had

depreciated against the US dollar amid international dollar strength. Overall, domestic

financial conditions remained on the accommodative side.

In regard to monetary and credit conditions, the monetary aggregate M2 grew at an

average rate of 3.25% year on year during the Jan.-May period, within the Bank’s target range

for this year. For the same period, growth in bank lending slowed down on the economic

downturn. However, bank loans and investments averaged an annual growth rate of 5.14%,

slightly higher than the 4.93% of the same period last year. This suggested that market

liquidity was sufficient to support real economic activity.

For the year to date, the housing market had witnessed a higher transaction volume and a

price uptrend. The annual growth rate of mortgages for home purchases climbed steadily, and

that of loans for building construction recently advanced to the highest in recent years.

Meanwhile, mortgage asset quality remained stable.

Looking ahead, in spite of downside risks to the global economy, government efforts in

promoting returning Taiwanese investment and infrastructure spending (of the

Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program) should be able to facilitate mild

4


-----

growth in bank loans and investments.

(3) Price trends

International oil prices moved downwards in late May as US crude inventory and output

had both increased and global demand had been depressed by US-China trade conflicts. For

the year of 2019, international oil prices would likely average slightly lower than 2018.

Global grains prices rebounded recently on severe planting delays in the US caused by poor

weather conditions.

In regard to domestic prices, inflation had run low in the beginning of the year before

trending up month by month after March on the back of international oil price rises and

weather-induced vegetable price hikes at home. The annual growth rate of CPI rose to 0.94%

in May, while that of core CPI (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items) was 0.62%. For

the first five months of the year, the annual growth rates of CPI and core CPI averaged 0.51%

and 0.49%, respectively, both considered to be mild.

In the second half of the year, inflation would likely rise higher than the first half year, as

vegetables and fruit supply could be affected by typhoons, prodding up food prices in general.

In terms of the output gap, a key factor among inflationary pressures, the negative gap could

widen marginally owing to domestic economic moderation. For the year as a whole, the Bank

projected the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to be 0.87% and 0.76% respectively,

citing a slight year-on-year decline in international oil prices amid a gloomier global

economic outlook, alongside with mild domestic demand. The medians of domestic and

international institutions’ 2019 inflation forecasts, at 0.83% and 0.88% respectively, also

pointed to a mild inflation outlook.

Looking ahead, key determinants of future domestic price trends include upside

pressures from the following. (1) Recent torrential rain and the upcoming typhoon season

could impact food prices, particularly fruit and vegetables. (2) The minimum wage hike,

effective Jan. 1 this year, could drive earnings higher and push up prices for away-from-home

food and other related services. On the other hand, downside price pressures could stem from

a projected downtrend in international oil prices compared to last year, reductions in network

access charges, possible further price cuts in mobile communication rates, and a still negative

output gap.

5


-----

**3.** **Considerations for Monetary Policy**

(1) The domestic inflation outlook is stable, as prices have risen moderately and the output gap

could slip slightly deeper into negative territory. The CPI and core CPI rose by 0.51% and

0.49% on average between January and May and were projected by the Bank to rise 0.87%

and 0.76% for the year as a whole.

(2) Although risks to the global economy seem to be tilting to the down side, Taiwan’s economy

is expected to improve in the second half of the year on the back of solid domestic demand

and a lower base effect, at a pace of 2.36% according to the Bank (higher than the 1.73%

projection for the first half year). For the year as a whole, the Bank forecasts that mild

growth momentum could support the economy to expand by 2.06%. However, the

economic growth projections remain, to a great extent, contingent on the progress of

US-China trade negotiations.

##### II. Proposition and Decision about Monetary Policy

**1.** **Policy Proposition: To keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with**

**collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375%,**

**1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.**

2. Board members reached a unanimous vote for policy rates to stay unchanged. The

discussions are summarized as follows.

3. (1) Discussion on domestic and international economic and financial conditions

In respect of economic situations at home and abroad, several board directors deliberated

about the impact of the US-China trade conflict on Taiwan’s economy. One board director

noted that recent forecast downgrades by major institutions had not been sharp, with most

forecasts remaining around 2% and just a few others slipping below 2%. Nevertheless, those

forecasts seemed yet to fully incorporate the potential impact on Taiwan’s economy from the

imposed and announced tariffs of the US and China. It would also be worth contemplating what

benefits or harms could ensue for Taiwan if trade friction between those two economies

escalates or evolves to a point that challenges China’s economic regime.

One board director noted that the US-China trade spat has significantly weighed on

Taiwanese businesses, which began to shift high-end production back to Taiwan and lower-end

production to South Eastern Asia. To facilitate the returning of Taiwanese capital under such

6


-----

elevated uncertainty seen in the year, the government had been removing investment hurdles

and rolling out incentive measures to drive investment and employment.

One board director shared the view that US-China trade friction has hit the corporate sector

hard and fast. Nevertheless, the government’s swift policy responses have turned a threat into an

opportunity, bringing a huge influx of Taiwanese capital. With more and more products of

Taiwanese firms to be manufactured locally instead of overseas, the domestic supply chain

would also benefit from this opportunity to flourish and expand.

One board director pointed out that returning Taiwanese capital had been growing,

prompted in part by concerns about the US-China trade battle and the introduction of OECD’s

Common Reporting Standard (CRS). However, relevant regulations require that the majority of

repatriating capital should be invested in the real sector of the economy. In addition, some of the

returning investment had been supplemented with domestic bank lending. It might be worth

noting how this would affect loanable funds in the domestic financial market.

In respect of domestic prices, one board director stated that recent inundation and a warm

winter earlier had only affected a small chunk of fruit supply, instead of sweeping crop damage.

As to pest concerns caused by fall armyworms, it was expected that no significant harm would

result therefrom to roil the domestic agricultural product prices.

In regard to domestic financial conditions, several board directors gave their opinions on

the domestic housing market. One board director noted that last year’s number of home

ownership transfers was nearly 100 thousand less than that of year 2013. Moreover, with

vacancy units mounting in the recent year and lukewarm transactions of pre-sale homes, the

pressure to reduce housing vacancies had been building up. While the housing market saw a

recovery with higher prices and more transactions, this should be a rebound back to normal

instead of hyper-inflating in value and volume of property sales. Meanwhile, home mortgages

had continued to increase, with owner-occupied property the majority of collaterals.

Commercial real estate and industrial land had also seen an upsurge this year, mainly

attributable to the influx of returning Taiwanese capital.

Another board director commented that recent data showed construction lending and

home-purchasing loans had reached new highs in seven or eight years; prices of

newly-constructed or existing homes had not jumped, but they had been inching up for multiple

quarters in a row. Furthermore, recently financial institutions began another price war, vying for

7


-----

mortgage borrowers. The board director called for close monitoring of new developments in the

real estate market and in banks’ loan product concentration, so as to respond accordingly and

appropriately before expectations for home price appreciation take hold.

(2) Discussion on interest rate decision

All board directors approved of keeping policy rates at the current levels, based mainly

on the assessment of (1) high uncertainty in the international economic and trade outlook, (2)

moderate growth momentum for the domestic economy, and (3) a stable domestic inflation

outlook. One board director gave the reason for approval that the US-China trade conflict had

created remarkable uncertainty for the domestic economy; given stable inflation conditions

and prospects, a rate hold and an accommodative stance would be appropriate, along with

continued funding assistance for small- and medium enterprises that would ensure steady

sources of funds. Another board director noted that currently many uncertainties shrouded the

international economic landscape, domestic economic activity was somewhat sluggish, and

major economies had kept policy rates unchanged; against this backdrop, a “wait and see”

approach seemed in order, warranting a rate hold decision by the Bank.

One board director expressed support for a rate hold because, in addition to a wider

output gap and subdued inflation at home, major economies’ monetary policy also offered

little ground for the Bank to adjust the stance before major central banks, including the Fed,

made any rate changes. Furthermore, in Taiwan, a small open economy allowing free capital

movements, monetary policy moves would carry implications for the NT dollar exchange rate

vis-à-vis those of our main trading partners. Therefore, monetary policymakers shall keep

close watch on the action at the central banks and currency trends of the US and Taiwan’s

major trading partners.

One board director noted that since the last Board Meeting in March, Taiwan had

enjoyed relative stable economic growth and inflation, alongside with increasing uncertainties

at home and abroad; combined, the circumstances warranted keeping the policy rates on hold.

Moreover, low market rates would restrict the stimulus effect of a policy rate cut. Therefore, it

would be the best decision to leave the rates unchanged.

Another board director also supported a rate hold for the time being, citing a combination

of factors: domestic and overseas economic and financial uncertainties, weak impetus for

domestic economic growth, a still widening negative output gap, mild inflation, and a stable

8


-----

inflation outlook, which justified no rate hike. As for a rate cut, considering that the Fed and

other major monetary authorities had still been mulling over the future rate path, it would be

suitable for the Bank to “wait and see” until further informed by future developments.

One board director pointed out that the domestic economic growth rate was expected to

improve quarter by quarter in the second half of the year. However, the 2% forecast by major

institutions would not be sufficient to merit a rate increase. On the other hand, a rate cut was

neither imperative. Although trade tensions could intensify between the US and China and

some central banks had begun to reduce rates, there remained high and volatile uncertainties

over the international economic and trade situations. In this light, a rate hold now which

would provide room for any warranted rate adjustments in the future.

Several board directors expressed support for keeping policy rates steady and

commented on future deliberations about monetary policy. One board director noted that the

effect of monetary policy on economic activity in the short term would depend on actual

expenditures such as corporate investment and fiscal spending. For instance, the Bank of

Japan’s monetary easing, a stance in place since 1992 to address the persistent economic

downturn, has not brought about genuine improvements in the economy throughout the past

three decades. Japan’s experience showed that monetary policy had a limited short-term

stimulus effect while protracted low interest rates could have adverse implications. Therefore,

the Bank’s policymaking should not only consider short-term factors but also monitor

long-term ones.

One board director also remarked that low interest rates since the global financial crisis,

when major economies fought back with “quantitative easing” (QE) measures, had rendered

monetary policy less effective in the face of short-term economic fluctuations. Nevertheless,

low interest rates would not stay forever, and monetary policymakers need to take a long view.

Another board director then noted that changes in long-term economic growth forecasts

served as a key factor in monetary policy deliberations.

One board director pointed to the low levels of domestic interest rates at present and

stated that the Bank might need to take stock of the efficacy of rate cuts should the Fed begin

reducing the fed funds rate. While low rates partly restrict monetary policy effectiveness, the

fact that Taiwan’s banking system has enjoyed ample liquidity and ease in funding reflects in

part that monetary policy tools have worked. The board director suggested that in due course

9


-----

it would be worth exploring the possibility of deploying other monetary policy tools.

Another board director gave the opinion that, though Japan had adopted QE and fiscal

expansion on multiple occasions since 1992, the measures only produced lean results as the

economic upturns had often been countered by unfortunate difficulties as well as structural

weaknesses. Monetary policy is never a cure-all remedy for economic distresses, and its

limited effects have been further thwarted by an increasingly globalized world. Therefore, it

seems a more effective solution to adopt a mix of monetary and fiscal policies and structural

reforms.

One board director noted that low interest rates have become an almost worldwide

phenomenon since 2008. With the possibility of the Fed reducing rates, the Bank needs to

take into account the effect of its policy decisions on private consumption and excess saving.

Another board director remarked that a wide range of information, including output, prices,

and other economic and financial developments at home and abroad, would be taken into

account for monetary policymaking at the Bank, inhibiting the use of rate adjustments to serve

specific sectors. In terms of measures to promote private consumption by appealing to savers,

a twofold solution of higher wage income and higher saving returns seem the faster route to

reach that objective. In Taiwan, where the locals prefer low-risk assets such as deposits and

insurance policies, savers could garner better returns through more efficient asset allocation;

to that end, the authorities could adopt a three-pronged approach, namely improving financial

awareness, enhancing pension fund returns, and raising productivity of the ALM

(asset/liability management) industry.

One board director explained further that monetary policy affects a wide universe of

variables, including consumption, investment, cross-border capital flows, inflation, and so on.

And the government has implemented stimulus programs that comprise a mixture of industrial

policy and economic policy. In the future, perhaps monetary policy could also gain some

more room for maneuver through close cooperation between the Bank and various

government agencies.

**3. Monetary Policy Decision: The board directors reached a unanimous vote to keep the**

discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations

without collateral unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.

 Monetary Policy Decision of the Board Meeting

I. Global economic and financial conditions

Since the Board met in late March this year, the global economy has

moderated further and trade growth has weakened. Meanwhile, escalating

US-China trade conflicts and stalled Brexit progress have roiled international

financial markets and increased downside risks to the world economy.

International institutions have thus widely trimmed down growth projections for

the world economy and trade volume this year, and major economies have broadly

adopted a more accommodative monetary policy stance.

Looking ahead, global economic expansion may be further dampened by a

multitude of uncertainties such as the developments of the US-China trade friction

and the trade disputes among the US and other economies, heightened financial

fragility of debt-ridden economies, the Brexit impasse, geopolitical tensions, and

the volatile international oil prices.

II. Domestic economic and financial conditions

1. Since the beginning of this year, rising global economic and trade uncertainties

have caused the global economy to decelerate, weighing on Taiwan's exports. In

addition, the domestic stock market has moved with international stock markets

and experienced greater fluctuations, denting consumer confidence and leading to

a slowdown in the domestic economy. For the first four months of this year, the

average unemployment rate was slightly higher than the same period of the

previous year, and wage growth also expanded at a slower pace. However, the

number of employed persons steadily increased, indicating that labor market

conditions remained stable.

As for the second half of the year, global demand is expected to stay sluggish,

yet the benefits from diverted orders owing to the US-China trade conflicts, as

well as a lower base effect, are likely to slightly push up export growth. Moreover,

12


-----

the government's policies aimed at stimulating domestic demand should help spur

private consumption and investment. As a result, the Bank forecasts Taiwan's

economy to advance by 2.36% for the second half of the year (with 1.73% for the

first half of the year), and 2.06% for the entire year. Nevertheless, future

development of US-China trade negotiations will be a crucial factor for domestic

economic growth.

2. For the first five months of this year, both the consumer price index (CPI) and the

core CPI (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items) rose at a moderate pace,

posting average annual growth rates of 0.51% and 0.49%, respectively.

With the active typhoon season approaching, food prices could be disrupted

by unfavorable weather conditions. In this view, CPI inflation is expected to

increase faster in the second half of the year than in the first half. On the other

hand, international oil prices are likely to trend lower than last year amid a

softening global economic outlook, while domestic demand remains mild. A

balance of these factors points to a stable inflation outlook for the year as a whole.

The Bank forecasts the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to be 0.87% and

0.76% for the year of 2019, respectively (Appendix Table 1).

3. For the first five months of the year, the average annual growth rates of reserve

money and the monetary aggregate M2 were 6.40% and 3.25%, respectively, while

bank loans and investments grew by 5.14% year on year during the same period.

In recent months, net foreign capital outflow and the inflow of tax revenue

towards the national coffers have led to slightly tighter funding conditions, and

short-term market rates have risen modestly. The Bank has managed market

liquidity with flexibility, and excess reserves of financial institutions have been

maintained at a level of over NT$40 billion. In the meantime, domestic 10-year

government bond yields have dropped in line with declining US bond yields,

while the NT dollar has weakened against the US dollar (USD) amid international

USD strength. Overall, domestic financial conditions remain accommodative.

III. Monetary policy decisions

Based on the latest information about economic and financial conditions at

13


-----

home and abroad, the Board considers that domestic inflation is moderate, the

negative output gap has widened marginally, and the inflation outlook stays stable.

Although risks to the global economic prospects tilt increasingly towards the

downside, steady domestic demand and a lower base effect would likely shore up

the economic growth in the second half of 2019 to a pace faster than the first half

year. Overall, the domestic economic expansion is expected to advance with mild

growth momentum. Furthermore, Taiwan's real interest rates continue to register

around the middle range among a host of economies (Appendix Table 2).

Therefore, the Board judges that a policy rate hold and a continued

accommodative monetary policy stance will help ensure price stability and foster

sound development of the economy and the financial sector.

The Board reached the following decision unanimously at the Meeting today:

The discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the

rate on accommodations without collateral are kept unchanged at 1.375%,

1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.

In light of multiple uncertainties overseas, the Bank will closely monitor the

developments regarding monetary policy of major economies, US-China trade talks,

geopolitical risks, and global financial markets, as well as their implications for Taiwan's

economy and financial conditions. We will act timely as appropriate to fulfill the central

bank's statutory mandate.

IV. The recent surge in cross-border capital movements has amplified financial market

volatility for many economies including Taiwan. However, compared with other major

currencies, the NT dollar has experienced lower volatility in its exchange rate vis-à-vis

the US dollar.

In principle, the NT dollar exchange rate is determined by market forces. Nonetheless, if

irregular factors (such as massive inflows or outflows of short-term capital) as well as

seasonal ones lead to excess volatility and disorderly movements in the NT dollar

exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial stability, the Bank

will, in accordance with its mandate, step in to maintain an orderly foreign exchange

market.
