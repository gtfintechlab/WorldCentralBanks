##### AGENDA: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND

 MONETARY POLICY DECISION

 I. Staff Review of Economic and Financial Conditions 

###### 1. International Economic and Financial Conditions

 Developments since the Board met in June 2023 showed a slow recovery in global

 final demand owing to the cumulative effect of aggressive tightening by major central

 banks in the US and Europe. Recent data pointed to continued contraction in the

 manufacturing sector, whereas the services sector expanded at a slower pace compared

 to the previous rebound that benefited from the lifting of pandemic restrictions. Among

 major economies, growth was uneven: The US economy advanced steadily, the euro

 area and the UK sputtered, Japan posted mild growth, and China saw greater risk of an

 economic slowdown. International institutions forecasted moderate growth momentum

 for the global economy in 2024. 

 In terms of international commodity price trends since July, crude oil prices surged

 to a new yearly high as Saudi Arabia’s oil production cut and Russia’s oil export cut

 were extended to the end of 2023. According to international institutions, this year’s oil

 prices would be lower than 2022 but would rebound slightly next year. In the months

 since July, grains prices first rose and then trended down, while the Reuters/Jefferies

 CRB (RJ/CRB) Index, a global commodities benchmark, moved up alongside crude oil

 price upswings. 

 In regard to inflation trends in the year to date, global goods price inflation eased

 on cooling demand, whereas the services price uptrend sustained owing to downward

 price stickiness. Combined with recent oil price surges, the global inflation rate eased at

 a slow pace. 

 Meanwhile, some central banks continued with monetary tightening to combat

 still-high inflation, while some others maintained an accommodative stance. The US

 Federal Reserve (Fed) raised the policy rate by 0.25 percentage points in July, followed

 by a rate hold in September. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) further

 increased its policy rates, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) stayed dovish, while the People’s

 Bank of China (PBoC) lowered several policy rates to stimulate a stagnant economy. 

2


-----

###### In the financial markets, US and German government bonds yield curves inverted

 owing to recent market expectations about the Fed and the ECB keeping policy rates at

 high levels for a considerable time, along with concerns that the cumulative effects of

 monetary tightening could suppress future economic growth. With the fed funds rate

 expected to stay elevated, major stock markets in the world recorded weaker rallies, the

 US dollar index swung high, and major currencies broadly depreciated against the US

 dollar. 

 Looking ahead, global economic prospects face many downside risks, including

 the cumulative effect of major central banks’ tightening and the duration for the policy

 rates to stay elevated, greater risk for the Chinese economic slowdown to worsen, and

 fragmentation in the world economy, all of which could weigh on the momentum of the

 global economic recovery. In addition, global inflation prospects remain uncertain as

 commodity supply is threatened by climate change and geopolitical risks. If heightened,

 they could push commodity prices higher. 

 2. Domestic Economic and Financial Conditions

 (1) Economic situation

 Recent data showed the coincident indicators went back up but leading indicators

 declined further, suggesting lingering sluggishness. The domestic manufacturing sector

 experienced relatively weak growth momentum. The Manufacturing Purchasing

 Managers’ Index (PMI) stayed in contraction phase in August, while the Non
 Manufacturing Index (NMI) showed softer expansion, with business sentiment for

 future outlook remaining cautious.

 In respect of external demand, weak global final demand dragged Taiwan’s export

 growth into negative territory in the year to date, with the first eight months of the year

 witnessing a decline of 15.7%. All primary export categories posted negative growth,

 except for ICT/AV (information, communication and technology, and audio-visual)

 products as they were buttressed by demand for AI and other emerging technology

 applications. Looking ahead, it was expected exports would benefit from growing

 demand for emerging tech applications, and rising travel service proceeds bolstered by

3


-----

###### an increase in inbound tourists. Combined with a lower base effect, the Bank forecasted

 Taiwan’s exports to resume positive growth in real terms for the second half of the year,

 but the growth rate would remain in negative territory for the year as a whole before

 picking up next year.

 Private investment, given its high correlation with exports, would likely be

 dampened by languid domestic production activity owing to a lackluster export outlook

 and by cautious business sentiment that led to curtailed or delayed capital expenditures.

 The Bank expected real private investment growth to still sputter in the second half of

 the year, with negative growth for the year as a whole followed by mild growth next

 year. 

 Private consumption were supported by stronger post-pandemic in-store shopping

 and thriving cross-border travel demand. The Bank expected real private consumption

 growth to extend the gains in the second half of the year and to register solid growth for

 the year as a whole. For next year, a higher base effect would bring about mild growth. 

 In the labor market, the total number of employed persons continued rising and the

 unemployment rate decreased to below the figure registered a year ago. However,

 manufacturing furloughs remained at higher levels owing to tepid export growth. In

 terms of hiring and work conditions, the manufacturing sector saw a further decrease in

 the number of employed persons in July, while its overtime hours worked per month for

 the Jan.-Jul. period were lower than the same period last year. In the services sector, for

 the month of July, the number of employed persons and the amount of overtime hours

 worked both increased year on year. In regard to wage growth in the year to date,

 nominal growth of total earnings of manufacturing workers slowed markedly year on

 year as exports stagnated, whereas that of services workers picked up year on year

 thanks to post-pandemic resurgence of in-person services consumption. 

 Overall, taking into account anemic growth momentum for exports and private

 investment, the Bank revised the 2023 domestic economic growth rate forecast to

 1.46%, down by 0.26 percentage points from its June forecast. While the first half of the

 year witnessed a contraction by 0.98%, the economy was projected by the Bank to

 rebound at a pace of 3.81% in the second half of the year and would expand by 1.46%

4


-----

###### for the year as a whole.

 Looking to next year, Taiwan’s exports and investment would likely gather pace

 with inventory returning to normal amid a global goods trade recovery and emerging

 tech applications on the rise. Minimum wage and public sector pay were scheduled to

 be raised next year and private consumption would enjoy further growth. Therefore, the

 Bank forecasted the economic growth rate to be 3.08% in 2024. 

 In addition, the Bank estimated that Taiwan would have a negative output gap in

 both 2023 and 2024. Major institutions at home and abroad projected Taiwan’s economy

 to grow by 0.77%-2.00% in 2023 and by 2.30%-3.40% in 2024. 

 (2) Financial conditions 

 From June 2023 onwards, interbank funds transfers increased against a backdrop

 of banks turning in the collected income taxes to the National Treasury, large firms

 giving out cash dividends, and foreign institutional investors making outward

 remittances of the proceeds from net-selling local stocks. Nevertheless, market liquidity

 conditions were broadly stable thanks to the Bank’s open market operations, and thus

 the interest rates of banks and in the money markets fluctuated moderately. For the

 months of June to August, excess reserves of banks averaged somewhat above NT$60

 billion. 

 With regard to bank credit in the year so far, corporate funding needs waned as

 economic activity weakened more than last year and export growth remained negative,

 and the annual growth rate of housing loans also declined compared to last year, both

 weighing on bank lending to the private sector. As a result, bank loans and investments

 posted an average annual growth rate of 5.80% in the Jan.-Aug. period, lower than

 7.77% over the same period last year. 

 With regard to money supply, continued export contraction led to a reduction in

 net foreign exchange (FX) receipts from export/import trade transactions. The resultant

 slowdown in FX deposit growth and the aforementioned year-on-year decline in bank

 loans and investments combined to bring down the annual growth rate of M2. Measured

 on a daily average basis, M2 expanded by 6.60% for the first eight months of the year,

 lower than 7.66% of the same period last year. 

5


-----

###### In the year so far, the housing market recorded slower transaction activity and a

 gradual moderation in the price uptrend. Construction and real estate industries as well

 as banks continued to be cautious about the housing market outlook. Since the Bank

 implemented selected credit control measures with a total of five amendments beginning

 December 2020, the annual growth rate of banks’ real estate lending continued falling,

 and the nonperforming ratios of housing loans and of construction loans remained low,

 indicating good credit quality. 

 (3) Price trends 

 The annual growth rate of the consumer price index (CPI) broadly trended down in

 the year so far and slowed to 1.75% in June. Then, as vegetables and other food items

 saw faster price rises and fuel and lubricant costs also turned upwards, the annual CPI

 growth rate climbed to 2.52% in August, while the core CPI (i.e., excluding fruit and

 vegetables and energy items) increased by 2.56% year on year.

 The annual CPI growth rate averaged 2.29% during the first eight months of the

 year. Around 66% of this increase came from price rises in food (such as food away

 from home and meat) and entertainment services, as well as higher rent, with a combined

 contribution of 1.51 percentage points. For the same period, the annual growth rate of

 the core CPI averaged 2.66%. 

 By frequency of purchase, prices of staples more frequently purchased rose by

 slightly smaller margins in August. As international raw material prices declined, import

 prices posted negative growth for several consecutive months, indicating still subdued

 pressures of imported inflation. 

 By type of items, commodity price uptrends softened in the year so far, reflecting

 downswings in domestic import prices and producer prices. In contrast, services prices

 still exhibited strong rises owing to still robust demand for entertainment services in

 such areas as food/beverages and hospitality, translating into a slow moderation in the

 domestic inflation rate. The Bank expected that in the second half of the year, the

 domestic inflation rate would be somewhat lower than in the first half of the year. For

 the year as a whole, the CPI and core CPI inflation rates were forecasted to be 2.22%

 and 2.44%, respectively, lower than last year’s 2.95% and 2.61%. 

6


-----

###### For next year, international institutions projected a modest rebound in international

 oil prices, which would then mildly push up domestic commodity prices. In contrast,

 services prices would likely extend the slowdown from the fourth quarter of 2023

 onwards. The Bank forecasted the CPI and core CPI inflation rates to further decrease

 to 1.83% and 1.73% in 2024, respectively. 

 Forecasts by major domestic and foreign institutions for Taiwan’s inflation rate

 ranged between 2.00% and 2.60% for this year and between 1.10% and 1.90% for the

 year 2024. The future path of domestic inflation would be affected by weather events

 and price trends of international commodities as well as domestic services. 

 3. Considerations for Monetary Policy Decision-Making

 (1) Domestic inflation to come down gradually, with the inflation rate slowing to below

 2% next year 

 A. According to the Bank’s projections, the inflation rate in the second half of the year

 would be slightly lower than the first half; for the year as a whole, the annual CPI

 and core CPI growth rates are forecasted to be 2.22% and 2.44%, respectively, lower

 than the 2.95% and 2.61% registered last year. 

 B. For next year, in view of a modest rebound in global oil prices from this year’s

 levels as projected by international institutions and a slower rise in domestic services

 prices, the Bank forecasts Taiwan’s annual CPI and core CPI growth rates to further

 come down to 1.83% and 1.73%. 

 C. The future path of domestic inflation trends would likely be affected by movements

 of international commodity prices and domestic services prices, as well as weather

 events. 

 (2) Domestic economic growth slower than expected, and the output gap expected to be

 negative for both 2023 and 2024

 A. Taiwan’s economic growth rate is forecasted by the Bank to be 1.46% this year,

 downgraded from the 1.72% forecasted in June. 

 B. The global economy is expected by international institutions to expand at a tepid

7


-----

###### pace, with the global economic and financial outlook facing the following

 headwinds: (1) The cumulative effect of monetary tightening and the duration of

 high policy rates adopted by major central banks, (2) heightened risk of China’s

 economic downturn, and (3) global economic fragmentation, all of which could slow

 the momentum for the world to achieve an economic recovery.

 II. Proposition and Decision about Monetary Policy 

**1.** **Policy Propositions: To maintain the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of**

###### secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations at 1.875%, 2.25%,

 and 4.125%, respectively 

 2. Board members reached a unanimous decision to keep the policy rates unchanged.

 Related discussions are summarized as follows.

 One board director pointed out that while Taiwan’s exports still recorded a double
 digit decline in the Jan.-Aug. period compared to a year ago, the August figure showed

 a narrower year-on-year contraction by single digits for the first time in ten months.

 Looking at the coming quarters, with the supply chain inventory drawdown nearing the

 end, AI-related business booming, new tech products hitting the market, and orders

 rising for the high season, it was expected that growth in exports would see a smaller

 decline in only single digits for the third quarter of 2023 and would turn positive in the

 fourth quarter, albeit still in negative territory for the year as a whole. The export decline

 also caused private investment to constrict. By contrast, after the pandemic concerns

 receded, pent-up demand was released briskly, sending private consumption growth to

 a 33-year high in the second quarter of 2023. Both retail and food/beverage sectors

 witnessed the strongest sales in history during the Jan.-Jul. period, reflecting robust

 consumer spending and revealing Taiwan’s “cold out, warm within” economic situation.

 Provided that domestic inflation softens steadily, a rate hold would be in favor so that

 domestic demand sectors (consumption, investment, etc.) would not be thwarted by

 higher interest rates. 

 One board director noted that exports’ vital role in the economy makes Taiwan

 closely interconnected with, and susceptible to, the world economy. The

8


-----

###### underperformance of Taiwan’s exports this year mainly resulted from two factors: (1)

 A pullback from pandemic-era upsurges, and (2) the US-China confrontation, as well as

 a disappointing Chinese economic recovery. At present, the anticipated upgrade across

 the AI supply chain would likely propel export growth, whereas other products remained

 stymied by sluggish global demand. Overall, in the fourth quarter this year, Taiwan’s

 exports would perform better than the third quarter, with broad expectations of a

 remarkable upturn next year. As for domestic demand, a wide range of consumption

 industries enjoyed record high growth, but still some others were cramped by labor

 shortage. Considering that with the exception of a certain electronics industries, most

 sectors were still struggling, a rate hike would not be an appropriate move. 

 One board director stated the current domestic downturn was partly due to a higher

 base effect arising from robust economic growth in the past three years, while global

 inflation also took its toll on our economy. As international forecasts put the 2023-2027

 average inflation rate of the world at still high levels, leading to a new normal of elevated

 prices, Taiwan’s exports would therefore be markedly hindered under the

 circumstances. Meanwhile, despite the current steady growth in domestic demand, once

 the policy rates are raised, mortgage borrowers’ interest burden would increase, causing

 households to cut spending and thereby denting domestic demand momentum. In

 addition, a rate hike now would have only modest effects on future price trends.

 Therefore, the director was in favor of keeping the policy rates steady. 

 One board director pointed out that the index of import prices was trending down,

 conducive to domestic price stability. In August 2023, the annual growth rate of the CPI

 went up; meanwhile, the core CPI recorded a lower annual growth rate, but the Bank’s

 internal research showed that leading indicators for the core CPI were on the rise, which

 called for attention. In addition, despite some signs of cooling in housing transactions

 and slower price rises, the uptrend in housing prices still continued; given that residential

 rent serves as a lagging indicator of housing prices and has a significant weighting in

 the CPI basket, rises in rent could in turn drive up overall prices. In the meantime, the

 annual growth rates of the commodities or services whose price changes consumers are

 more conscious of were still high, which could buoy up public inflation expectations.

 On the other hand, the Bank made another downgrade to its 2023 GDP growth rate

9


-----

###### forecast and estimated that the output gap would remain negative this year. Since current

 economic readings were divergent, the director approved of a rate hold for the time

 being, and noted that continued monitoring was warranted for another quarter, with a

 possibility of having to proactively address the issue of inflation. 

 One board director discussed domestic economic fundamentals. Regarding export

 growth, although there were signs of recovery after a series of declines for 12

 consecutive months, it was not rebounding forcefully and order visibility was low.

 Meanwhile, private consumption continued on the growth path but at a slower pace, and

 private investment just recorded the sixth consecutive month of negative growth, with

 firms wary of making investment plans. As for prices, temporary factors caused the

 annual CPI growth rate to exceed 2% again in August; and the overall price trend, though

 heading downwards, still called for continuous monitoring. In sum, the director was in

 favor of a rate hold. Another board director pointed out that the actual value of Taiwan’s

 current unemployment rate was similar to the natural unemployment rate estimated by

 the Bank, indicating the policy rates were currently at appropriate levels. Therefore, a

 rate hold would be the proper move in today’s Meeting. 

 One board director stated the importance of heeding the possible impact of the

 upcoming electricity tariff hike on the prices in the services sector. In addition, the hiring

 bottleneck also warranted special attention as continued labor shortage in services and

 construction industries pushed up wage and related prices, carrying adverse implications

 for inflation. 

 Another board director noted that the import price index in US dollar terms dropped

 in the Jan.-Aug. period; in NT dollar terms, the index also fell despite NTD weakness

 vis-à-vis the USD. The producer price index also decreased, another sign of easing

 inflationary pressures. Regarding the influence of international oil prices on domestic

 inflation, despite the recent uptrend, it was still expected that for the year as a whole, oil

 prices would on average exert downward pressures on the domestic inflation rate

 compared to last year. As for the upcoming power tariff hike partially imposed on some

 domestically-oriented industries from October onwards, the Bank estimated it would

 have a limited impact on this year’s inflation rate. Looking at economic growth, the

 forecasted underperformance this year was attributable to the global economic malaise

10


-----

###### causing Taiwan’s exports and, in turn, private investment to both record negative

 growth. All in all, these developments in prices and economic growth warranted a policy

 rate hold at the current juncture. Nevertheless, uncertainties still abounded for price

 trends and economic activity; in the future, the Board could still consider adjusting the

 policy rates if deemed necessary. 

 One board director stated that monetary policy-making needs to take into account

 public perception of prices. In particular, goods purchased at least once per month and

 the top 17 staple goods in the CPI basket both registered annual growth rates higher than

 that of the overall CPI; the annual growth rate of the core CPI also rose faster than the

 overall CPI. Regarding the CPI for rent, it climbed back up in August from a modest

 downswing earlier. For the first eight months of the year, the annual CPI growth rate for

 rent came higher than last year, while that for entertainment services was elevated; given

 that housing rent and prices of services tend to exhibit downward price stickiness, the

 future path of these categories warrant continuous monitoring. The director expressed

 support for a rate hold today, but noted that by the time the next quarterly Board Meeting

 is convened, the Bank should pay special attention to price uptrends and to whether

 consumer sentiment about prices would step up inflation expectations and create an

 impact on price stability. Should there be renewed signs of prices firming up, the Bank

 would probably need to take stronger initiative to clamp down inflation. 

 One board director pointed to tepid exports and private investment and cautioned

 that these sectors remained mired in negative growth despite some signs of recovery.

 The Bank’s downgrade of its forecast for Taiwan’s 2023 GDP growth rate implied still

 lukewarm growth momentum for the domestic economy. With the world, especially

 China, still facing downside risks to the economy, Taiwan’s export growth and future

 economic recovery could be constrained. On the other hand, the price trends in the

 intermeeting period were similar to those considered for the previous Board Meeting,

 and it was forecasted that the inflation and core inflation rates would be lower this year

 than last year and would likely ease to below 2% next year. In terms of economic growth,

 despite the aforementioned forecast downgrade for this year, growth was projected to

 accelerate next year. These showed that relevant policy efforts to rein in inflation and to

 reinvigorate the economy had been effective and hence it would be right to continue

11


-----

###### forward on the same path. The director therefore supported the decision to keep the

 policy rates steady. 

 One board director noted Taiwan’s economy was slackening, particularly pointing

 out how worrying the slowdown was in exports and private investment, the two driving

 forces behind Taiwan’s economic growth. On the other hand, the domestic inflationary

 pressure were diminishing and the inflation rate was expected to decline to below 2%

 next year. After considering for the Bank’s mandate of price stability and economic

 growth, the director saw little reason for either a rate hike or a rate cut and stated that a

 rate hold would be the sensible decision. 

 3. Monetary Policy Decision: 

 The board directors decided unanimously to keep the discount rate, the rate on

 refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations

 unchanged at 1.875%, 2.25%, and 4.125%, respectively. 

 Voting for the proposition: Chin-Long Yang, Tsui-Yun Chuang, Mei-Hua

 Wang, Tzung-Ta Yen, Mei-Lie Chu, Chung-Dar Lei, Jin-Lung Lin, Chao-Hsi

 Huang, Shiu-Sheng Chen, Fu-Sheng Hung, Yi-Ting Li, Shi-Kuan Chen, Chien
 Yi Chang, Ming-Jou Yang, and Chi-Chung Chen (Excused, Appointing Tzung
 Ta Yen as Proxy)

 Voting against the proposition: None

 III. The Press Release 

 The board directors approved unanimously to issue the following press release in

 the post-meeting press conference, together with the Supplementary Materials for the

 Post-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank.

12


-----

##### Press Release  September 21, 2023

 Monetary Policy Decision of the Board Meeting (2023Q3)

###### I. Global economic and financial conditions

 Since the Board met in June this year, the cumulative effects of significant

 policy rate hikes by major central banks in the US and Europe since 2022

 have continued to work through the economy. Growth in the global

 manufacturing sector has remained tepid, while services activity has turned

 weaker. There has been a divergence in economic growth across major

 economies. The US economy has exhibited solid expansion, whereas the euro

 area and the UK have registered anemic economic growth. Japan's economy

 has grown mildly, yet China has faced rising downside economic risks. With

 regard to inflation trends, commodity prices have declined as global demand

 softened, whereas services prices have remained stubbornly high because of

 downward price stickiness, leading global inflation to trend down at a slow

 pace.

 In recent months, considering still elevated inflation rates, some central

 banks continued their rate hike paths, while other central banks kept policy

 rates on hold. As inflationary pressures linger in major economies, high

 interest rates may sustain for some time. It is thus expected that the world

 economic and trade growth momentum would remain subdued. In recent

 months, global financial markets fluctuated as investor expectations on US

 and European monetary policy paths shifted. The US dollar index rebounded

 and major currencies broadly depreciated against the US dollar.

 Looking ahead, the global economic and financial outlooks are clouded by multiple

 uncertainties, such as the cumulative effects of monetary tightening by major central

 banks and the duration of interest rates staying high, China's economic slowdown,

 and fragmentation of the global economy, which could all restrain the momentum for

 global economic recovery. International institutions projected the world

 economy to grow at a moderate pace and the inflation rate to drop further in

 2024. Nevertheless, geopolitical risks and climate change may affect the

 supply of commodities, and the global inflation trends remain uncertain.

 II. Domestic economic and financial conditions

 1. In the months since midyear, the decline in Taiwan's export growth has

13


-----

###### slowed as continued sluggishness in global final demand was somewhat offset

 by stronger export momentum of information communication technology

 products to meet demand for emerging technology applications and by

 narrower contractions in traditional sector exports. In respect of domestic

 demand, corporate investment willingness remained muted, with imports of

 capital equipment still mired in double-digit negative growth. In contrast,

 private consumption rose steadily on the back of strong post-pandemic

 demand for dining and tourism. For the second half of the year, the Bank

 projected the GDP growth rate to rebound to 3.81% on account of a lower

 base effect. The Bank's GDP growth forecast for the year as a whole was

 1.46% (see Appendix Table 1 for the forecasts by major institutions), lower

 than the June forecast of 1.72%. Regarding labor market conditions in recent

 months, job gains continued, the unemployment rate came lower than a year

 ago, and nominal wage increased mildly. 

 For the outlook of next year, it was expected that exports and private

 investment would gather pace amid a pickup in global goods trade growth

 and further development in emerging technology applications. Private

 consumption would also continue expanding next year thanks to the planned

 minimal wage hike and public sector pay raise, albeit with slower year-on
 year growth than 2023 owing to a higher base effect. The Bank expected

 Taiwan's economy to grow by 3.08% in 2024. 

 2. In the months from June onwards, the annual growth rate of the consumer

 price index (CPI) rebounded after dipping, mainly reflecting changes in fruit,

 vegetables, and oil prices, while the annual growth rate of the core CPI (i.e.,

 excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items) edged down. For the first eight

 months of the year, the headline inflation rate averaged 2.29% and the core

 inflation rate averaged 2.66%. According to the Bank's projections, inflation

 would trend slightly lower in the second half of the year than in the first. For

 this year as a whole, the annual growth rate of the CPI and that of the core

 CPI were forecasted to register 2.22% and 2.44%, respectively (see Appendix

 Table 2 for the forecasts by major institutions), lower than the 2022 readings

 of 2.95% and 2.61%. Indeed, domestic inflation came down slowly in the year

 so far, mainly because a gradual moderation in commodity inflation amid

 faltering import and production price trends was counteracted by elevated

14


-----

###### services inflation owing to robust post-pandemic demand for entertainment

 services. 

 In regard to the price trends next year, it was expected that, despite a modest

 rebound in international oil prices, softer domestic services inflation would

 bring Taiwan's inflation rate lower than this year. The Bank forecasted the

 headline and core inflation rates to further slow down to 1.83% and 1.73% in

 2024, noting that the future path of domestic inflation could still be affected

 by factors including the price trends of international commodities and

 domestic services, as well as weather-related disruptions. 

 3. Domestic market liquidity was ample and short and long-term market rates

 fluctuated within a small range in recent months. Banks' excess reserves

 averaged slightly above NT$60 billion for the June-August period. The

 annual growth rate of M2 (measured on a daily average basis) and that of

 bank loans and investments averaged 6.60% and 5.80% respectively in the

 first eight months of the year, lower than the 7.66% and 7.77% recorded in

 the same period last year.

 III. The Board decided unanimously to keep the policy rates on hold 

 While taking into account the aforementioned economic and financial

 conditions at home and abroad, the Board also considered the following:

 Domestic inflation is softening gradually and the inflation rate is expected

 to come down to below 2% next year. Furthermore, the domestic economy

 would likely expand at a slower-than-expected pace this year and the output

 gap is estimated to be negative for both this and next year. The Board judged

 that a rate hold will help foster sound economic and financial development

 on the whole. 

 At the meeting today, the Board decided to maintain the discount rate, the

 rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary

 accommodations at current levels of 1.875%, 2.25%, and 4.125%,

 respectively. 

 Going forward, in view of downside risks to the global economy and the

 persistence of inflationary pressures, the Bank will stay attentive to the

 developments including the spillover effects of monetary tightening by major

 economies, signs of steepening in China's economic slowdown, international

15


-----

###### raw material price changes, geopolitical risks, and extreme weather events.

 The Bank will assess their implications for domestic economic activity and

 financial conditions and adjust its monetary policy in a timely manner as

 warranted, so as to fulfill the statutory duties of maintaining financial and

 price stability and fostering economic development within the scope of the

 above objectives. 

 IV. The Bank has made five amendments to its selective credit control measures since

 December 2020 to help enhance bank management of real estate credit risk and curb

 an excessive flow of credit resources into the real estate market. The Bank's

 tightening of the policy rates and the reserve requirement ratios since March 2022

 have further strengthened the effectiveness of the selective credit controls. In the

 year to date, growth in construction loans and housing loans have both slowed and

 the non-performing loan ratio of real estate lending has stayed low, indicating good

 credit quality. As government agencies carry on with their policy efforts under the

 Healthy Real Estate Market Plan and improve relevant mechanisms and measures,

 housing transactions and the price uptrend have both eased so far this year, with more

 policy effects expected to show successively. Going forward, the Bank will

 continuously monitor the developments in housing credit and the real estate market

 and the implementation results of the selective credit control measures, and will

 make adjustments as needed in order to promote financial stability and sound

 banking operations.
