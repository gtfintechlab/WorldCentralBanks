##### AGENDA: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND

 MONETARY POLICY DECISION

 I. Staff Review of Economic and Financial Conditions 

###### 1. International Economic and Financial Conditions

 Developments since the Board met in December 2022 pointed to tepid growth

 momentum in advanced economies, while policy rates could stay high for some time

 owing to elevated inflationary pressures. It was therefore expected that global economic

 growth momentum would remain sluggish in 2023. 

 With global goods demand cooling off, the European energy crunch thawing on a

 warm winter, and China lifting pandemic lockdown measures, concerns about goods

 supply disruptions also eased, global supply chain pressures fell to pre-pandemic levels

 and container freight rates dropped significantly. 

 In respect of international commodities, oil prices began the year with fluctuations

 reflecting the effects of China’s reopening, major central banks’ rate hikes, and the US

 plan to release its emergency crude oil stock. In recent weeks, oil prices first declined

 on market worries that banking crises in the US and Europe could hurt the economy and

 weaken crude oil demand before stabilizing as market concerns eased. International

 forecasters expected oil prices this year to register lower than last year. In terms of grain

 prices, this year had so far witnessed a downtrend as weather conditions in Argentine

 and US crop areas improved and the Black Sea grain export deal was extended.

 Meanwhile the Reuters/Jefferies CRB (RJ/CRB) Index, the global commodities

 benchmark, swung downwards in line with crude oil and grain price declines.

 With respect to global inflation, it was expected to soften this year as a result of the

 effects from monetary tightening by major economies, global consumer demand cooling

 off, and international energy prices trending down. Nevertheless, major economies were

 still confronted by inflationary pressures from rising production costs and further wage

 growth. Regarding monetary policy in the year so far, most economies, including the

 US and Europe, continued to raise policy rates whereas some central banks began to

 slow or pause the pace of rate hikes based on considerations of economic prospects and

 in order to assess the effects of previous rate increases. 

2


-----

###### Recently, failures or financial distresses of some banks in the US and Europe had

 roiled international financial markets. Consequently, most major stock markets dived

 from recent highs, US government bond yields recorded volatile swings, and the VIX

 “fear index” climbed steeply. 

 Looking ahead, the global economy faces a myriad of uncertainties, mainly

 including: (1) the pace of inflation cool-down in major economies; (2) the path of

 monetary tightening by US and European central banks and the spillover effects

 therefrom; (3) China’s economic recovery; (4) uncertainties over commodities supply

 heightened by intensifying climate change, and geopolitical risks also escalating, which

 could all push up inflation. Among them, spillover from major central banks’ massive

 rate hikes to other economies could pose greater downside risk to the global economy. 

 2. Domestic Economic and Financial Conditions

 (1) Economic situation

 The coincident indicators continued to trend down recently. Manufacturing and

 non-manufacturing sentiment for the outlook for the next six months, albeit climbing

 back up, still exhibited caution. 

 In terms of external demand, Taiwan’s export growth remained in negative territory

 in the year to date, reflecting sluggish global final demand and ongoing inventory

 adjustments. For the year as a whole, the Bank expected exports to grow at a languid

 pace owing to continued tightening by major central banks and weak global economic

 and trade growth momentum. While the first half of the year would still witness export

 contraction, a gradual rebound was projected for the second half of the year, when

 exports would resume positive growth thanks to reduced inventory levels in global

 supply chains. 

 Private investment, whose growth has long been highly correlated with exports,

 could fare poorly this year; the Bank expected private investment to show negative

 growth in 2023 in consequence of sluggish export growth, ongoing inventory

 adjustments, and cautious business outlook sentiment. 

3


-----

###### In terms of private consumption, the easing of pandemic containment measures and

 border controls would bolster consumer confidence and retail and food/beverage sales;

 the planned hike in minimum wage and higher income tax-free allowance, as well as the

 government’s universal surplus tax rebate program, would also help sustain growth

 momentum. Therefore, the Bank expected private consumption to post solid growth for

 the year as a whole. 

 In the labor market, business activity gradually picked up with the domestic

 pandemic situation under control, leading the overall unemployment rate to trend lower

 and the number of employed persons to rise higher month by month in the year so far.

 However, the number of furloughed manufacturing workers increased as a result of the

 export slowdown. 

 Overall, in view of bleak prospects for exports and private investment, the Bank

 downgraded the 2023 GDP growth rate forecast to 2.21%, lower than the 2022 growth

 rate of 2.45%. The economy was projected to grow modestly (by 0.5%) in the first half

 of the year amid weak export and investment growth. In the second half of the year,

 despite still sluggish investment activity, economic growth was expected to rebound (by

 3.84%), with exports gaining traction as a result of global supply chain destocking and

 domestic demand buttressed by steady private consumption growth and the

 government’s tax surplus rebates. Major institutions at home and abroad projected

 Taiwan’s economy to expand at a pace between 1.39% and 2.58% this year.

 (2) Financial conditions 

 Market interest rates moved upwards on the heels of the Bank’s policy rate hike in

 December 2022. In January 2023, a flow of currency back into the banking system after

 the Lunar New Year holidays caused interest rates of bank and money markets to

 fluctuate within a tight range. For the first two months of the year, the average bank

 excess reserves was slightly above NT$60 billion. The recent global financial market

 turbulence was judged to have little impact on domestic financial stability given a sound

 banking system, adequate capital levels, and ample liquidity. 

 In terms of bank credit, the annual growth rate of bank loans and investments turned

 to a downtrend after December 2022 as exports contracted, mortgage growth declined

4


-----

###### year on year, and bank investments shrank further. In January 2023, the annual growth

 rate of bank loans and investments continued to fall to 5.37% owing to fewer business

 days in the month of the Lunar New Year holidays, while the rate edged up to 5.52% in

 February thanks to rising bank investments. The rate averaged 5.45% for the first two

 months of the year. 

 Regarding money supply, as bank loans and investments began to trend down in

 November 2022, the annual growth rate of M2 dropped from 7.37% in November 2022

 to 6.67% in January 2023. In February, M2 growth edged up to 6.80% owing to net

 foreign capital inflows and faster growth in bank loans and investments. For the first

 two months of the year, the annual M2 growth rate averaged 6.73%. 

 In the housing market, recent data showed housing trading cooled down, while real

 estate lending continued to post slower year-on-year growth, albeit with a still high

 outstanding balance. The Bank’s four rounds of selective credit control measures since

 December 2020 have proved to help strengthen bank management of credit risk. The

 Bank’s monetary tightening since March 2022 have also provided additional

 reinforcement for the credit controls. More results were expected to show in the future

 as the government continued to implement measures under the Healthy Real Estate

 Market Plan and to develop comprehensive mechanisms and programs as needed. 

 (3) Price trends 

 In January and February this year, the inflation rate fluctuated more markedly

 owing to the Lunar New Year holidays. The average annual growth rate of the consumer

 price index (CPI) was 2.74% for the first two months of 2023, while the annual growth

 rate of the core CPI (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items) averaged 2.77%,

 both extending the moderation since the second half of 2022.

 The factors contributing to the 2.74% inflation rate for the Jan.-Feb. period mainly

 included rising prices of food (including food away from home) and of entertainment

 services and higher housing rent, with a combined contribution of 1.89 percentage points,

 or 69%, to the increase of the inflation rate. 

5


-----

###### Looking at different categories of the CPI basket, prices of goods declined recently

 while prices of services, which tend to be “sticky” (e.g., easy to increase but slow to

 decrease), continued to trend upwards. Meanwhile, although staples with a higher

 purchase frequency had seen smaller price rises in the year so far, they still gained more

 markedly compared to the overall inflation rate, thereby intensifying consumer

 sentiment of price rises.

 In February, the annual growth rate of the NT dollar-denominated import price

 index came down for the fifth month in a row, while the producer price index also

 dropped, indicating that pressures of imported inflation abated. For the year as a whole,

 it was expected that prices of crude oil and other raw materials would continue to trend

 lower than last year, and thus domestic inflation would likely cool down gradually.

 However, as lives began to return to normal after the pandemic waned, entertainment

 prices experienced sharper-than-expected price surges; in addition, worldwide avian flu

 pushed up prices of eggs and chicken meat and the domestic electricity tariffs were also

 raised significantly. In this view, the Bank revised its inflation forecasts to 2.09% for

 both the inflation and core inflation rates for this year, which were lower than the levels

 of 2022 at 2.95% and 2.61%, respectively. Projections for Taiwan’s annual CPI growth

 rate made by major domestic and foreign forecasting institutions ranged between 1.36%

 and 2.50%. Price trends of international commodities and domestic services as well as

 weather events are among the possible factors affecting Taiwan’s inflation this year. 

 Overall, in respect of this year’s domestic price outlook, upside pressures could

 come from (1) reinvigorating demand for entertainment consumption in the post
 pandemic period; (2) stickiness in prices of services; (3) spillover effects from the

 electricity tariff hike; (4) higher food prices as a result of the avian flu. On the other

 hand, downside pressures could arise from (1) crude oil and other raw material prices

 declining to levels lower than last year; (2) domestic prices of mobile phones and other

 communication devices witnessing a further downtrend. 

6

###### 3. Considerations for Monetary Policy

 Major considerations: 

 (1) The domestic inflation slowdown was projected to continue, with the annual growth

 rates of CPI and core CPI both forecasted to be 2.09%. Nevertheless, uncertainties

 still exist for this outlook. In addition, the higher-than-usual price rises at home in the

 recent year could push up inflation expectations. 

 (2) The global economy is shrouded in many uncertainties. However, Taiwan’s economy

 would likely pick up pace in the second half of the year and post mild growth for the

 year as a whole. 

 (3) Although recent unsettling troubles in the US and European banking system roiled

 global financial markets, the domestic banking system is underpinned by sound

 operations, adequate capital, and ample liquidity, indicating little impact on domestic

 financial stability. 

 II. Proposition and Decision about Monetary Policy 

**1.** **Policy Proposition: To raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured**

###### loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points to

 1.875%, 2.25%, and 4.125%, respectively. 

 2. Board members reached a unanimous decision to raise the policy rates by 0.125

 percentage points. Related discussions are summarized as follows.

 One board director stated that currently domestic inflation remained elevated and

 the forecast was upgraded to above 2%, indicating that inflationary pressures still linger.

 Additionally, the upcoming power tariff hike in April could add to inflationary

 pressures. The director therefore supported a rate increase to rein in inflation but

 contended that a smaller size of increase would be appropriate considering the

 downgraded 2023 economic growth forecast, which warranted a hike by 0.125

 percentage points. Furthermore, a series of bank failures or distresses that arose in the

 US and Europe in March, albeit without imminent global financial systemic risk,

 resulted in high uncertainties over global financial conditions. In this view, the Bank

7


-----

###### needs to closely monitor the developments of these events and the stances of major

 central banks so as to adopt appropriate policy responses as needed. 

 One board director noted that staple prices continued to face considerable upside

 pressures, and energy prices, of which the rising costs had been absorbed by state-owned

 oil and electricity enterprises (i.e., the CPC and Taipower), could drive up prices after

 the electricity tariffs are hiked in April. Taking into account the relatively milder

 inflation in Taiwan compared to major economies, and the slower pace of the Fed’s rate

 hike by only 0.25 percentage points yesterday (March 22), the director supported the

 proposition of raising the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points. 

 One board director noted the current economic situation was a moderate domestic

 economy confronted by an external cool-down. Concerning external demand, export

 contraction in the year to date, which led several research institutions to downgrade their

 forecasts for Taiwan’s 2023 GDP growth rate, was the consequence of US and Europe’s

 monetary tightening to combat high inflation and exports could therefore remain weak

 at least for the first half of the year. While taking into account the continuous export

 contraction, the Bank’s monetary policy actions would have a relatively limited impact

 on this issue given that waning foreign demand was the culprit. Meanwhile, domestic

 demand was still sound in contrast to softening external demand. Regarding inflation,

 several factors, including rising food-away-from-home prices and housing rent, the

 government’s surplus tax rebates, the electricity tariff hike, the post-pandemic services

 recovery, and consumer perception of price increases, could all further fuel inflation

 expectations. In view of the current economic down-cycle and negative private

 investment growth at home and weaker demand abroad, the domestic situations of

 aggregate demand and prices were judged to be acceptable; however, a 0.125 percentage

 point rate hike would be warranted in order to curb inflation expectations. 

 One board director expressed the view that Taiwan remained under inflationary

 pressures, noting that the inflation rate was coming down but very slowly and the general

 public tended to perceive inflation as higher. Therefore, the director supported a 0.125

 percentage point rate hike in the hope of containing inflation expectations. With respect

 to the domestic economy, private consumption was expected to post solid growth

 whereas exports and private investment were projected to contract; meanwhile,

8


-----

###### uncertainties surrounding international financial conditions were still high, warranting

 close attention. Therefore, it would be appropriate to raise the policy rates by 0.125

 percentage points in today’s meeting. 

 Another board director remarked that the Bank should take action to vigorously

 fight inflation and, in particular, inflation expectations; therefore, the director supported

 the rate hike proposition. While nominal regular earnings of all payroll employees in the

 industrial and services sectors posted the highest annual growth rate since 2000, real

 regular earnings (adjusted for inflation) actually slipped to negative growth. Considering

 that continued rises in nominal wage might indicate higher inflation expectations and

 could result in the so-called “second round effects,” it was important to keep watch on

 whether wage increases would feed into the price uptrend. In addition, the top 17 staple

 items in the CPI basket had been rising faster than the overall inflation rate since entering

 the year, representing more upside pressures for inflation expectations. At this juncture,

 the Bank’s strong commitment to rein in inflation would help lower inflation

 expectations. Furthermore, the average rent increase in the year to date exceeded that of

 last year; considering a lag in the effect of higher housing prices on rent and that rent

 rises tend to be sticky and persistent, continuous monitoring would be important. And

 while wealth distribution and income equality are not part of the Bank’s mandate, the

 issue of inflation imposing greater hardship on low-income households still warrants

 attention. 

 One board director stated that the forecast model showed that the probability of

 Taiwan entering an economic recession in the next quarter was 20% - 40%; meanwhile,

 labor market conditions were steady, whereas the CPI and core CPI rates stayed above

 2%. On the other hand, the bid rate for the certificates of deposit issued by the Bank and

 the interest rates on commercial paper in the money market both continued to decline,

 indicating sufficient liquidity. Therefore, the pressing issue of inflation should be given

 priority. In this view, the director supported a rate hike to curb inflation expectations

 while a size of 0.125 percentage points would be appropriate given the still high

 uncertainties over international economic and financial conditions. Furthermore, there

 seemed to be a pattern in the Bank’s monetary policymaking since 2000 where the Bank

 showed more caution in rate increase decisions; during some of the periods with robust

9


-----

###### economic growth and low unemployment, the Bank raised the policy rates in small

 increments of 0.125 percentage points, an approach seldom seen in other central banks

 that could lead to protracted low interest rates and subject Taiwan to a low-interest-rate

 trap. Looking ahead, once the global and domestic economic activity resumes steady

 growth, it would then be appropriate to keep in line with the more common practice of

 other central banks by adjusting the policy rates in increments of 0.25 percentage points. 

 Another board director noted that current international financial conditions have

 faced increasingly higher uncertainties than before; a similar situation would lead to

 different assessments in different times, hence the difference in the size of policy rate

 adjustments. For instance, the recent US and European banking turmoil created ripples

 of financial instability to other economies. In Taiwan, the impact was relatively mild

 because domestic banks have a different balance sheet structure than those in the US

 and Europe. However, in a global context, Taiwan as a small open economy is

 susceptible to international economic and financial changes, and the impact of recent

 events on international markets, which could also affect the Bank’s future monetary

 policy path, remains to be seen given the uncertainties. Since a comparison can hardly

 be drawn for the size of rate adjustments in different contexts, there would be no telling

 whether the past or the current rate changes are big or small, an issue that might warrant

 contemplation in the future. 

 One board director pointed out that both economic and financial conditions faced

 high uncertainties, mainly surrounding the recent bank debacles in the US and Europe,

 which were generally judged to be largely devoid of systemic risk. Given the high

 uncertainties, the director supported a 0.125 percentage point rate increase. In terms of

 inflation, external estimation put the inflationary effect of the April electricity tariff hike

 at 0.2 percentage points of the CPI annual growth rate. It should also be noted that the

 real interest rate, instead of the nominal interest rate, is what monetary policy decisions

 take into consideration, as it plays a crucial role in such activity as consumption,

 investment, and bank lending. While a 0.125 percentage point hike today would help

 bring the currently negative real interest rate closer to positive territory, the fact that

 Taiwan has registered a negative real interest rate for three consecutive years calls for

 attention to its effect on the domestic economic and financial conditions.  

10


-----

###### One board director was in favor of raising the policy rates by 0.125 percentage

 points, citing the importance of continued rate increases to affirm the Bank’s inflation
 fighting commitment given the assessment of trends in domestic inflation expectations.

 In addition, the 30-day commercial paper rate had previously risen faster than the Bank’s

 rate hikes, partly reflecting the two increases in reserve requirement ratios by the Bank

 last year, which had caused funding conditions to tighten. Despite a recent downtrend

 in the 30-day commercial paper rate, future developments in the money markets still

 require monitoring. As for the issue of a negative real interest rate, if inflation is

 successfully subdued, the real interest rate would turn positive; in contrast, if inflation

 stays elevated, further rate hikes could be warranted. 

 Another board director noted that, beginning from 2021, unexpected events such

 as pandemic resurgences and the Russian-Ukraine war pushed up international energy

 and food prices, driving the domestic inflation rate upwards. With the Bank adopting a

 gradual tightening stance since March 2022, the average one-year time deposit floating

 rate of the top five domestic banks climbed correspondingly. Combined with the effect

 of today’s rate hike and the projected inflation slowdown, the currently negative real

 deposit rate (the time deposit rate minus the inflation rate) would likely move closer to

 positive territory. In addition, the level of Taiwan’s real deposit rate was moderate

 compared to major economies, with most of these economies also posting negative real

 deposit rates. Given that the domestic economy was expected to grow at a slow pace

 owing to tepid exports and investment and that international economic conditions still

 faced high uncertainties, a negative real interest rate would be conducive to fostering

 economic growth. 

 One board director pointed out that, based on the Bank’s forecast for Taiwan’s

 annual GDP growth rate this year, a negative growth rate in the first quarter would be

 followed by growth above 2% for three consecutive quarters in the rest of the year.

 Meanwhile, the inflation rate, though forecasted to run above 2% in the first three

 quarters of the year, would likely come down to below 2% in the fourth quarter. In this

 economic context, it would be necessary for the Bank to maintain its policy stance with

 further rate hikes. In terms of the upcoming electricity tariff hike in April, despite

 external estimations of the hike contributing 0.2 percentage points to the inflation rate,

11


-----

###### the effect on the overall price trends could be greater than estimated; with inflation

 expectations being entrenched, higher electricity tariffs could drive up services prices

 including those of transportation, food away from home, and housing rent. Considering

 that the hike could have a far wider ripple effect, close monitoring of its influence on

 future price gains is warranted. 

 3. Monetary Policy Decision: 

 The board directors decided unanimously to raise the discount rate, the rate on

 refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by

 0.125 percentage points to 1.875%, 2.25%, and 4.125%, respectively.

 press release in the post-meeting press conference, together with the Supplementary

 Materials for the Post-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank.

-----

##### Press Release  March 23, 2023

 Monetary Policy Decision of the Board Meeting (2023Q1)

###### I. Global economic and financial conditions

 Since the Board met in December last year, global economic and trade momentum

 has moderated, prices of commodities such as international crude oil have

 exhibited a downtrend, and global inflation has fallen back down gradually.

 Recently, major central banks have continued with monetary policy tightening,

 whereas some central banks have slowed or paused the pace of policy rate hikes

 based on the assessment of economic prospects and cumulative effects from

 previous rate rises. Nevertheless, in view of inflationary pressures remaining

 elevated in major economies, high interest rates could persist for an extended

 period. Global economic growth is expected to slow further in 2023.

 Looking ahead, the monetary tightening effect from drastic rate hikes by major

 central banks in the US and Europe may spill over to other economies, intensifying

 downside risks to the world economy. Meanwhile, tight labor markets in the US

 and Europe and fragmentation of the global economy could make it difficult to

 ease inflationary pressures. In addition, the pace of China's economic recovery,

 climate change, and geopolitical risks could weigh on commodity prices,

 increasing uncertainties over global inflation trends.

 Recent concerns over the turbulence in the banking sectors of the US and Europe

 and the ensuing effects on market expectations about the size of rate hikes by major

 central banks have heightened volatility in international financial markets. The

 outlook for global financial stability warrants close attention. 

 II. Domestic economic and financial conditions

 1. From the beginning of 2023, with the easing of pandemic-related restrictions and

 border controls, domestic consumer economic activity gradually returned to

 normal, consumer confidence stabilized, and the retail and food/beverage sectors

 registered growing sales. However, as waning global final demand prompted

 businesses to continue with inventory destocking, Taiwan's exports have witnessed

 negative growth for consecutive months and private investment has also turned

 conservative. In terms of labor market conditions, the overall unemployment rate

 dropped, yet the number of furloughed employees in the manufacturing sector

 increased.

13


-----

###### The economy is expected to grow modestly in the first half of this year, restrained

 by weak export and investment growth. For the second half of the year, despite

 sluggish investment growth, exports would likely regain momentum from reduced

 inventory levels in global supply chains, while domestic demand continues to firm

 up thanks to solid private consumption growth and the government's newly
 launched initiative to promote post-pandemic economic resilience and to share

 growth results nationwide with a universal surplus tax rebate program; it is

 therefore expected that economic growth would rebound in the latter half of 2023.

 The Bank revises its GDP growth forecast downward to 2.21% in 2023 (Appendix

 Table 1), a pace slower than the 2.45% in 2022.

 2. The annual growth rate of the consumer price index (CPI) averaged 2.74% for the

 first two months of the year owing mainly to price rises in food (such as food away

 from home) and services for entertainment as well as higher rent. The annual

 growth rate of the core CPI (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items)

 averaged 2.77% for the same period, edging down continuously since entering the

 second half of last year. 

 For year 2023 as a whole, as global supply chain bottlenecks are likely to be

 resolved and raw material prices (including crude oil) are projected to trend lower

 than 2022, it is expected that domestic inflation would also gradually cool down.

 Nonetheless, with resumption of normal life post the pandemic likely to bolster

 prices of services for entertainment, the global outbreak of avian flu pushing up

 domestic food prices, and electricity rates hiked markedly, the Bank therefore

 upgrades its forecasts for this year's CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to 2.09%

 for both (Appendix Table 2), lower than the previous year's 2.95% and 2.61%.

 However, this outlook could still change depending on prices trends of

 international commodities and domestic services, as well as weather events.

 3. Banks' excess reserves stayed slightly above NT$60 billion on average for the first

 two months of the year. The annual growth rate of M2 (measured on a daily

 average basis) averaged 6.73% in the first two months of 2023, slowing from the

 7.25% of the fourth quarter of 2022. Bank loans and investments also decreased

 from 6.66% to 5.45%. Reflecting the Bank's monetary tightening, interest rates on

 bank deposits and loans rose higher and money market rates all trended up.

 Furthermore, Taiwan's banking system remains sound, well-capitalized, and flush

14


-----

###### with liquidity, which would help ward off destabilizing effects from the recent

 global financial market turmoil.

 III. Monetary policy decision: The Board reached a unanimous decision to raise the

 policy rates by 0.125 percentage points. 

 In today's meeting, the Board considered the following assessment of economic

 and financial conditions at home and abroad. The international economic outlook

 still faces many uncertainties and Taiwan's exports and investments would slow

 this year. Nonetheless, steady private consumption growth and a rebound in export

 momentum are expected to drive economic expansion in the second half of the

 year; for the year as a whole, the economy is projected to post mild growth. In

 terms of inflation, the domestic inflation rate is on track to come down this year,

 with the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates both forecasted to be 2.09%;

 however, uncertainties remain for this outlook, and higher-than-usual domestic

 price gains in recent years could buoy up inflation expectations. To rein in inflation

 expectations, the Board judged that a continued policy rate hike will help achieve

 the policy objectives of promoting price stability and fostering sound economic

 and financial development on the whole. 

 At the meeting today, the Board decided to raise the discount rate, the rate on

 refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125

 percentage points each to 1.875%, 2.25%, and 4.125%, respectively, effective

 March 24, 2023.

 Looking ahead, the Bank will continue to monitor the cumulative effects from its

 monetary tightening since 2022 as well as the spillover of monetary policy moves

 by major economies and keep close watch on the fallout from the recent debacles

 in some US and European banks. The Bank will take these into account in

 assessing the implications for domestic economic and financial conditions and

 adjust its monetary policy in a timely manner as warranted, so as to fulfill the

 statutory duties of maintaining financial and price stability and fostering economic

 development within the scope of the above objectives.

 IV. The Bank's recent round of selective credit control measures, implemented with

 four successive amendments from December 2020, has so far successfully bolstered

 credit risk management of the banking sector. In the year to date, growth in banks'

 construction and housing loans continued to slow, real estate lending as a share of

15


-----

###### total lending has broadly held steady, and the level of non-performing loan ratio for

 real estate lending has stayed low. The effectiveness of the existing credit controls

 have also been amplified by the Bank's continuous monetary policy tightening since

 March 2022. More results are also to emerge gradually as government agencies are

 making headway with their policy efforts under the Healthy Real Estate Market

 Plan and improving relevant mechanisms and measures. In recent months, housing

 market transactions have decreased considerably and housing price uptrends have

 moderated. Going forward, the Bank will continuously monitor the developments

 in housing credit and market, review the implementation of the selective credit

 control measures, and make adjustments as needed in order to promote financial

 stability and sound banking operations. 

 V. The NT dollar exchange rate is in principle determined by market forces.

 Nonetheless, when seasonal or irregular factors (such as massive inflows or

 outflows of short-term capital) lead to excess volatility and disorderly movements

 in the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial

 stability, the Bank, in line with its statutory mandates, will step in to maintain an

 orderly market.
