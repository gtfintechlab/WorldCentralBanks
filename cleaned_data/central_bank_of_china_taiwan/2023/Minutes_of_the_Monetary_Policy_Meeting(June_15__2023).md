##### AGENDA: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND

 MONETARY POLICY DECISION

 I. Staff Review of Economic and Financial Conditions 

###### 1. International Economic and Financial Conditions

 Developments since the Board met in March 2023 suggested that advanced

 economies continued to experience weak growth momentum, and their central banks

 would likely keep interest rates at relatively high levels for some time in view of still

 strong inflationary pressures. It was therefore projected that the global economy would

 grow at a slower pace this year. By sector, the manufacturing industry suffered a

 downturn as global final demand was hit by the cumulative tightening effect from major

 central banks’ aggressive rate hikes, whereas the services sector rebounded as countries

 lifted pandemic-related restrictions. 

 In respect of international commodity prices, crude oil prices swung lower after

 mid-April as market concerns over the US and China’s economic outlook weighed on

 oil demand prospects, with international institutions forecasting this year’s oil prices to

 register lower than last year. In terms of grain prices since April, a decline was followed

 by a rebound. Meanwhile, the Reuters/Jefferies CRB (RJ/CRB) Index, a global

 commodities benchmark, trended down in line with crude oil and grain price falls. 

 The inflation rates of major economies softened somewhat but were still relatively

 high in the year so far, mainly because rising and sticky prices of services restrained the

 slowing down in core inflation (i.e., after excluding prices of volatile items). Broken

 down by type in the CPI basket, commodity prices in major economies declined year on

 year, reflecting energy price falls. In contrast, services prices continued with strong

 uptrends because of a partial shift of consumer demand from commodities to services

 following post-pandemic normalization and a resultant shortage of supply of

 food/beverage and recreational services coupled with higher hiring costs buoyed up by

 a labor supply-demand imbalance. As a consequence of elevated services prices, global

 inflation moderated rather slowly. 

 Among central banks in major economies, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the

 European Central Bank (ECB) maintained a restrictive monetary policy stance, with the

2


-----

###### Fed pausing in June and the ECB further raising policy rates. Meanwhile, the Bank of

 Japan remained accommodative and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) reduced policy

 rates. 

 In the financial markets since April, the US banking industry had seen financial

 pressures easing, and volatility in the US government bond market had decreased from

 a previous peak after a bill was signed to suspend the debt limit. In the meantime, most

 major stock markets recorded upswings. The US dollar index rebounded and major

 currencies broadly depreciated against the US dollar. 

 Looking ahead, global financial and economic prospects are facing uncertainties

 associated with how much longer major central banks maintain policy rates at high

 levels, tightness in global financial conditions, the strength of China’s economic

 recovery, geopolitical risks, and climate change. 

 2. Domestic Economic and Financial Conditions

 (1) Economic situation

 Recent data showed the coincident indicators declined further. Growth in GDP

 from manufacturing contracted owing to significantly weaker momentum. 

 In respect of external demand, sluggish global final demand, ongoing inventory

 adjustments, and a higher base effect combined to drag Taiwan’s exports down by

 16.9% year on year for the first five months of 2023. For the second half of the year, it

 was expected exports would benefit from a stabilized global economy, continued

 demand for emerging tech applications, and rising travel service proceeds bolstered by

 an increase in inbound tourists. The Bank forecasted Taiwan’s exports to resume

 positive growth in real terms for the second half of the year but the growth rate for the

 year as a whole would remain in negative territory. 

 Private investment, given its high correlation with exports, was projected by the

 Bank to record negative real growth this year as inventory adjustments continued amid

 export sluggishness and the outlook sentiment was cautious.

 Private consumption gained support from the easing of pandemic containment

 measures and border controls, which led to rising sales of retail and food/beverage

3


-----

###### industries and boosted overseas travel sentiment. Coupled with the government’s

 universal surplus tax rebate program (NT$6,000 per person), private consumption was

 forecasted by the Bank to register solid steady growth in real terms this year. 

 In the labor market, the unemployment rate fell to 3.50% in April while the number

 of employed persons trended back up month by month. In terms of furlough, the

 manufacturing sector saw an increase in the number of furloughed workers with exports

 stagnating, whereas the support services sector saw a decrease owing to border

 reopening. Moreover, in recent months, the number of employed persons and the amount

 of overtime hours worked both continued decreasing in the manufacturing sector but

 rose further in the services sector. In regard to wage growth in the year to date, nominal

 growth of total earnings of manufacturing workers slowed year on year owing to export

 contraction, whereas that of services workers increased as in-person consumption

 rebounded after the pandemic receded. 

 Overall, the prospects of domestic exports and private investment would be

 clouded by still tepid growth momentum for the global economy, which is exerting a

 drag on economic growth. Therefore, the Bank revised the forecast for Taiwan’s 2023

 economic growth rate from 2.21% in March to 1.72% with the first half of the year

 slowing to a pace of -0.74% before picking up to 4.07% in the second half of the year. 

 Broken down by quarter, economic growth contracted by 2.87% in the first quarter

 as exports and private investment were hampered by soft global final demand and

 continued supply chain de-stocking. While exports and private investment were

 expected to remain weak in the second quarter, the upturn in private consumption would

 propel the economy towards positive growth. For the third and fourth quarters of the

 year, modest private investment momentum would likely be countered by steady private

 consumption growth and a gradual export rebound, helping economic growth to

 accelerate from quarter to quarter. 

 The Bank estimated that Taiwan would show a negative output gap this year. As

 for the forecasts by major institutions at home and abroad, a myriad of uncertainties

 resulted in divergent views on Taiwan’s 2023 GDP growth rate, spanning a wider range

 between 0.70% and 2.31%.

###### (2) Financial conditions 

 After March 2023, interest rates of banks and in the money markets climbed in line

 with the Bank’s fifth policy rate hike and fluctuated in a narrow range. Excess reserves

 of banks averaged NT$56.1 billion in May. 

 With regard to bank credit in the year so far, the annual growth rate of bank loans

 and investments averaged 5.55% in the first four months of the year, lower than 6.66%

 in the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting diminishing private corporate funding needs

 amid the economic downturn and slower year-on-year expansion in housing loans. 

 With regard to money supply, the annual growth rate of M2 fell from 6.80% in

 February to 6.58% in March; the rate edged up to 6.70% in April as demand deposits

 increased as a result of the government’s universal surplus tax rebates. Measured on a

 daily average basis, M2 expanded by 6.69% for the first four months of the year, lower

 than 7.25% of the fourth quarter last year. 

 In the housing market, the number of transactions had shrunk markedly since the

 beginning of the year and housing price uptrends had also moderated. Industry outlook

 sentiment for the next six months worsened further and consumer sentiment also tilted

 to the downside. With regard to real estate lending by banks, the annual growth rate had

 slowed since the Bank implemented selected credit control measures in December 2020.

 The nonperforming ratio remained low. However, real estate lending as a share of total

 lending was still high. In addition, second housing loans taken out by natural persons

 increased both in terms of the number of borrowers and as a share of total borrowers of

 newly-extended housing loans. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of second

 housing loans taken out by natural persons for homes in the designated “specific areas”

 was not only high but also rising. 

 (3) Price trends 

 From March 2023 onwards, the annual growth rate of consumer price index (CPI)

 edged down on account of milder increases in food (fruit and vegetables, etc.) prices

 and subdued fuel and lubricant fees, reaching 2.02% in May. Meanwhile, core CPI (i.e.,

 excluding fruit and vegetables and energy items) increased by 2.57% year on year,

5


-----

###### abating rather slowly mainly because prices of food/beverage and

 travel/accommodation services were buttressed by booming demand amid the post
 pandemic reopening period. 

 The annual CPI growth rate averaged 2.44% during the first five months of the year.

 Around 70% of this increase came from price rises in food (such as food away from

 home) and entertainment services as well as higher rent, with a combined contribution

 of 1.72 percentage points. For the same period, the annual growth rate of the core CPI

 averaged 2.68%. 

 By type of items, commodity prices exhibited slower growth whereas services

 prices still rose at a brisk pace. While these trends were similar to those in major

 economies, Taiwan’s inflation rate was lower overall. 

 By frequency of purchase, staples more frequently purchased showed smaller price

 rises in May. Import prices in NT dollar terms decreased by 8.56% year on year in May,

 marking the eighth consecutive month of decline. The producer price index also

 extended a decrease by 3.75%, indicating receding pressures of imported inflation. 

 For the second half of 2023, prices of crude oil and other raw materials would likely

 drop below their 2022 levels, and the concomitant decline in domestic import prices

 were expected to further weaken commodity prices in the CPI basket. By contrast,

 services prices would stay elevated as the post-pandemic reopening buoyed up

 entertainment services prices and higher costs of food ingredients and hiring made food
 away-from-home more expensive. The Bank expected the inflation rate to come down

 slowly during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter witnessing a pace of

 around 2%. For the year as a whole, the CPI and the core CPI would respectively post

 annual growth rates of 2.24% and 2.38%, lower than the 2.95% and 2.61% of last year. 

 Forecasts by major domestic and foreign institutions for Taiwan’s 2023 inflation

 rate ranged between 2.00% and 2.30% with an average value of 2.16%. Factors behind

 the inflation outlook for the second half of the year included the trends of international

 commodity prices and domestic services as well as weather events. 

6


-----

###### 3. Considerations for Monetary Policy

 (1) Considerations for the policy rate decision

 A. Domestic inflation to come down gradually in the second half of the year, with the

 inflation rate slowing to 2% in the fourth quarter 

 (a) The Bank forecasted the annual growth rates of the CPI and core CPI in 2023 to be

 2.24% and 2.38%, respectively, lower than last year’s 2.95% and 2.61%. 

 (b) Price trends of international commodities and domestic services as well as weather

 events, are among the factors affecting Taiwan’s inflation outlook in the second half

 of the year. 

 B. The global economic outlook facing a myriad of uncertainties; the domestic output

 gap to turn negative this year and the domestic economy slowing more markedly than

 previously forecasted

 (a) The Bank downgraded this year’s economic growth rate from 2.21% in March to

 1.72%. 

 (b) Uncertainties over the global economic and financial prospects included the duration

 of interest rates being kept high by major central banks, the tightness in global

 financial conditions, the pace of China’s post-pandemic economic recovery,

 geopolitical risks, and climate change.

 (2) Considerations for adjusting the selective credit control measures

 A. With the four amendments since December 2020 to the Regulations Governing the

 Extension of Mortgage Loans by Financial Institutions, the annual growth rates of

 banks’ real estate lending had slowed down, conducive to bank risk management

 associated with housing credit. 

 B. In view of a still high proportion of real estate lending in total lending in recent months,

 the Bank judged it was necessary to continue with credit control measures in order to

 improve management of credit resources of the banking sector and to mitigate credit

 risks associated therewith. Currently, the only restriction imposed on the newly
 extended second housing loans for homes in the “specific areas” was the prohibition

7


-----

###### of a grace period (during which borrowers pay just the interest but not the principal)

 and some banks appeared to have applied looser mortgage underwriting standards

 compared to other banks. A 70% LTV ratio cap was thus to be introduced for the

 second housing loans taken out by natural persons for homes in the “specific areas”

 so as to strengthen real estate-related credit risk management. 

 (a) Real estate lending as a percentage of total bank lending continued to be high: At

 the end of April, the ratio of real estate lending to total lending was 37.02%, still

 higher than 36.83% at the end of 2022 and 36.43% at the end of 2020, suggesting

 an excessive flow of banks’ credit resources into the real estate sector.

 (b) Recent data pointed to an increase in natural persons’ second housing loans in terms

 of the borrower number and as a share of total: According to the Joint Credit

 Information Center, in the first quarter of the year, the number of newly-extended

 second housing loans taken out by natural persons increased and its share as a

 percentage of total borrowers of newly-extended housing loans also rose from

 12.6% in the previous quarter to 15.2%.

 (c) The average LTV ratio for natural persons’ second housing loans for homes in the

 “specific areas” was high and on the rise: The Bank’s statistical data showed that

 the average LTV ratio of this loan bracket was 75.5% in October 2021 but rose to

 77.1% in April, showing a trend towards looser loan underwriting by banks.

 II. Proposition and Decision about Monetary Policy 

**1.** **Policy Propositions: To maintain the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of**

###### secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations at 1.875%, 2.25%,

 and 4.125%, respectively, and to adjust the selective credit control measures 

 2. Board members reached a unanimous decision to keep the policy rates unchanged and

 to adjust the selective credit control measures. Related discussions are summarized as

 follows.

8


-----

###### (1) Discussion on the policy rate proposition

 One board director pointed out that the Bank, in view of weak momentum for

 domestic economic growth, downgraded its forecast for Taiwan’s 2023 GDP growth

 rate to below 2% with a possibility of turning lower. Meanwhile, manufacturing growth

 staggered, and exports contracted for nine months in a row. It was expected that exports

 and private investment would both post negative real growth this year. Given such

 prospects, a further rate hike would not be appropriate. In addition, the inflation rate had

 eased and forecasted by the Bank to fall to below 2% in the fourth quarter and to register

 lower for the year as a whole compared to last year. The director therefore approved of

 a rate hold. 

 One board director stated that continued rate hikes by various central banks to

 contain inflation had inhibited global economic growth. Against this backdrop, weak

 final demand had led to continuous supply chain inventory drawdown, dampening

 Taiwan’s exports. According to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and

 Statistics (DGBAS), exports would resume positive growth in the fourth quarter but

 would still be in contraction territory for the year as a whole. Domestic demand, on the

 other hand, gained support from private consumption thanks to the lifting of pandemic
 related restrictions and the universal surplus tax rebates as well as other stimulus

 schemes under the government’s special budget for post-pandemic economic recovery.

 In sum, Taiwan’s economy was “warm inside, cold outside,” experiencing moderate

 domestic demand growth compounded by an external demand downturn. The Bank took

 a cautious view on this year’s GDP growth while forecasted the inflation rate to come

 down gradually. The director approved of a policy rate hold, citing the multitude of

 uncertainties over the economic outlook. 

 One board director noted that the Bank’s GDP growth forecast downgrade was

 mainly attributable to shrinking exports. The director then cited the International

 Monetary Fund, whose World Economic Outlook stated that continued rate hikes by

 major economies since last year caused the world to face anemic economic growth in

 the next five years, a rocky road fraught with uncertainties. In this light, a rate hold

 would be the sensible decision that would allow the Bank to pause for new information

 such as the lagged effect of monetary tightening and take stock of a need for future rate

9


-----

###### adjustments. 

 Another board director, in favor of a rate hold, stated that a pause would be

 appropriate so that the Bank may review the effects of its monetary policy and take this

 into consideration for the next policy meeting. Nevertheless, the director cautioned that

 prices of services continued to rise markedly and, like core inflation, tend to resist

 downward change; it was important to prevent inflation expectations from firming up. 

 One board director pointed out that the Bank trimmed the forecast for the 2023

 GDP growth rate by 0.5 percentage points in June, a considerable downgrade compared

 to its March forecast. In addition, several neighboring economies had turned less

 hawkish with rate holds or even rate cuts. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s inflation was also

 trending down. Given the above, it would be appropriate to keep the policy rates

 unchanged. 

 One board director pointed to such developments as the Fed pausing rate hikes in

 June, domestic inflation stabilizing, the economy contracting significantly in the first

 quarter, and the Bank already delivering five rate hikes. Therefore, a rate hold would be

 a reasonable decision for today’s Meeting. 

 One board director noted that although recent declines in animal feed costs took

 pork prices lower, price stickiness would prevent related food-away-from-home prices

 from decreasing correspondingly. In the CPI basket, the top 17 staple goods continued

 seeing marked rises, and services and food away from home showed downward price

 stickiness. For the year as a whole, it was expected that a higher base effect would

 weaken this year’s inflation rate provided that prices of pork and other related items

 would not rise further. In terms of economic growth, the pace of expansion would

 probably fall short of 2%. Export growth has been a key driving force for Taiwan, but

 recently it shrank faster than in South Korea and Japan, mainly owing to higher bases in

 the previous three years amid an economic boom. Given the above, a further rate hike at

 this juncture, while having an uncertain effect on core inflation, could risk dampening

 domestic demand instead. In addition, Taiwan’s inflation was primarily fueled by external

 factors; and while the unemployment rate came to a 23-year low in April, efforts to bring

 down inflation would imply a trade-off towards higher unemployment. Furthermore, the

10


-----

###### economy already passed its fifteenth cyclical peak and began slowing gradually. In this

 view, the director approved of a rate hold and added that the Bank needs to closely monitor

 future price trends as reference for future interest rate decision-making.

 One board director, referring to Taiwan’s “warm inside, cold outside” economy,

 pointed out that while external demand was dampened by tighter monetary and

 economic conditions abroad, domestic private investment could also be dented as

 exports and the manufacturing production index continued declining. Without a pause

 in rate hikes, corporate investment could take a further hit. Therefore, a rate hold is the

 right decision, while continuous monitoring of future domestic price trends remains

 important. At present, the CPI sub-index of top 17 staple goods continued to record high

 annual growth rates, likely adding to inflation expectations. Although the headline and

 core inflation rates were edging downwards, their average values for the first five

 months of 2023 were still higher than those of the previous ten years. Moreover, the

 average real annual growth rates of total employee earnings turned negative for the

 January-April period of the year, the first negative growth in seven years, warranting

 continued attention to the potential impact of prices on real total earnings growth. 

 One board director pointed out that external demand shocks have been the key driver

 of Taiwan’s business cycles and, in particular, export growth; domestic interest rate policy

 could be of help, albeit to a limited extent. The director cited recent data as the reasons

 backing up a rate hold for now: First, the headline inflation rate began trending down after

 a streak of rate hikes and the economy still faced a relatively low probability of recession

 in the next quarter despite the recent forecast downgrade. As for core inflation, it slowed

 slightly but remained elevated. In particular, the top 17 staples continued to post

 significant year-on-year price rises, which could raise public expectations of inflation.

 Taking into account the upside and downside factors, the director approved of a rate hold

 and noted that, given the transmission lags of monetary policy, it was with hope that more

 effects would show progressively. However, the Bank should, at the sign of resurgence in

 headline or core inflation, confront it proactively and raise the policy rates at a regular

 pace. 

11


-----

###### Another board director approved of a rate hold and expressed concern about rising

 prices. For the first five months of the year, the annual growth rate of the CPI sub-index

 of top 17 staples averaged higher than the previous year and that of the core CPI was

 also elevated. Meanwhile, higher rents continued to exert upside pressures on the

 inflation rate. Food price trends also require continued monitoring as they face potential

 shocks from supply uncertainties owing to weather-related interruptions or grain export

 controls implemented by several major crop-producing economies. If inflation shows

 any hint of becoming unanchored by the next Board Meeting, the Bank should take a

 stronger approach to contain inflation. 

 (2) Discussion on the proposition to adjust selective credit control measures

 Several board directors expressed the opinion that by introducing a new 70% cap

 on the LTV ratio on second housing loans taken out by natural persons for homes in the

 designated “specific areas” it would help enhance lending risk management of banks,

 improve proper allocation of credit resources, achieve a healthy housing market, and

 promote financial stability. 

 One board director shared that the Bank noticed a continuous increase in banks’

 real estate loans with a large balance as a percentage of total loans. There was also a

 rising number of second housing loans taken out by natural persons, making up a greater

 share of total borrowers of newly-extended housing loans. As some banks became more

 flexible about the LTV ratios, the average LTV ratio of natural persons’ second housing

 loans in the “specific areas” thus climbed to above 70%. The proposition to restrict the

 LTV ratios of this loan bracket seemed to aim at the concern that excessive lending to

 the real estate sector could undermine banks’ risk control. In this view, the director

 approved of this proposition. 

 One board director remarked that the previous series of selective credit controls

 were indeed introduced with the aim of a healthy housing market; in the meantime, the

 Bank continued monitoring banks’ loan portfolio to curb an inordinate flow of capital

 into the real estate sector. The director was in favor of the new control measure. Another

 board director also stated that, given the interest rate hold, implementing a new 70% cap

 on the second housing loans by natural persons for homes in the “specific areas” would

12


-----

###### improve the efficiency of bank credit resources. 

 One board director noted that not only housing price rises eased but transaction

 level also cooled down somewhat. In addition, the annual growth rates of housing loans

 and construction loans both declined. These developments carried positive implications

 for financial stability and indicated that the Bank’s rate hikes were beginning to show

 results. 

 One board director expressed the view that financial crises in history tended to be

 associated with real estate market debacles, warranting the Bank’s earnest attention to

 this sector. And the current higher ratio of housing credit to total bank lending also

 represented potential financial risk that should be mitigated. Another board director

 pointed out that in one of the previous amendments to the selective credit controls, the

 grace period was removed for natural persons’ second housing loans in the “specific

 areas” but no LTV ratio caps were introduced concurrently. This seemed to have led

 banks to gradually relax loan standards for this bracket and somewhat fueled speculative

 sentiment. In this view, the director approved of this amendment. 

 One board director stated that, from the perspective of bank lending risk

 management, it was sensible to introduce the new restriction. The average LTV ratio of

 natural persons’ second housing loans in the “specific areas” was 75.5% in October

 2021; thereafter, it rose to 77.1% in April 2023. A 70% cap seemed to be the appropriate

 move without excessive impact. 

 Several board directors discussed the level of the new cap. One board director

 pointed out that, for the second housing loans taken out by natural persons for homes in

 the “specific areas,” the proposed cap on the LTV ratio was 70%, while the current cap

 on the third housing loans and on any housing loans taken out by corporate entities was

 40%. The different cap levels for different loan types showed that today’s new rule took

 into account the actual needs of homebuyers (e.g., needs to expand or downsize, to buy

 homes for children/parents, to move, etc.). The new restriction was judged to be able to

 nudge second home buyers towards selling their first homes sooner as they could be

 exempted from the 70% cap when repaying the first housing loan within a short period

 after taking out the second one. Furthermore, compared to the previous 60% cap on the

13


-----

###### same loan bracket implemented in June 2010 and the current bank data average of 77%,

 the new cap of 70% was moderate.  

 3. Monetary Policy Decisions: 

 The board directors decided unanimously to keep the discount rate, the rate on

 refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations

 unchanged at 1.875%, 2.25%, and 4.125%, respectively, and to adjust the

 selective credit controls.

##### Press Release  June 15, 2023

 Monetary Policy Decision of the Board Meeting (2023Q2)

###### I. Global economic and financial conditions

 Since the Board met in March this year, the cumulative tightening effects of

 continuous rate hikes by major central banks in the US and Europe have weakened

 global final demand and resulted in a tepid performance in the manufacturing sector.

 Nevertheless, the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions in most countries has

 supported a rebound in the services sector. Against such a background, commodity

 prices have registered a narrower increase because of cooling demand, whereas

 services price increase have remained stubbornly strong as a partial shift of

 consumer demand from commodity to services boosted demand for food/beverage

 and entertainment services and the related imbalance between services labor supply

 and demand also pushed up labor costs. As a consequence, global inflation has

 trended down at a rather gradual pace.

 Recently, some central banks continued raising policy rates, yet a few central banks

 paused the pace of rate hikes in order to assess the cumulative effects of this

 monetary tightening cycle on economic activity and inflation. In view of inflationary

 pressures in major economies remaining elevated, interest rates could stay at

 restrictive levels for a considerable time. It is therefore expected that global

 economic and trade growth momentum would remain sluggish.

 Looking ahead, the global economic and financial outlooks are still shrouded in

 many uncertainties, such as the duration of policy rates of major economies staying

 high, the degree of tightening of global financial conditions, the pace of China’s

 economic recovery, geopolitical risks, and climate change.

 II. Domestic economic and financial conditions

 1. For the first quarter of the year, private consumption picked up as life gradually

 returned to normal as domestic pandemic-related restrictions and border controls

 were further relaxed. Nevertheless, a sluggish global economy and continued

 inventory reductions in supply chains caused Taiwan's exports to decrease even

 more markedly, while growth in private investment also turned negative. Overall,

 the annual GDP growth rate slowed to -2.87% in the first quarter. Thereafter,

 despite continued weakness in exports and private investment in recent months, an

 expansion in private consumption was expected to bolster economic growth for

15


-----

###### the second quarter. Meanwhile, labor market conditions improved with the

 unemployment rate coming down and the number of employed persons rising

 further. In the year so far, nominal total earnings in the services sector rose over

 the same period last year thanks to post-pandemic resurgence in face-to-face

 consumption activity, whereas the manufacturing sector, hit by shrinking exports,

 posted slower year-on-year earnings growth and experienced an increase in the

 number of furloughed employees.  

 For the outlook of the second half of 2023, while private consumption is likely to

 continue growing steadily, exports would also gradually gather steam amid a

 stabilizing global economy and demand for emerging technology applications. The

 Bank expected Taiwan's economic growth to accelerate in the second half of the

 year compared to the previous half. For the year as a whole, the economy was

 forecasted to expand by 1.72% (see Appendix Table for the forecasts by major

 institutions), down from the March projection of 2.21%.

 2. In the months from March onwards, moderating price increases in food items (such

 as fruit and vegetables) and softening fuel and lubricant fees combined to drive the

 annual growth rate of the consumer price index (CPI) on a slow downtrend that

 began in the second half of 2022, taking the inflation rate to 2.02% in May. The

 annual growth rate of the core CPI (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items)

 was 2.57% in May, a slower descent mainly because of demand-driven price rises

 in domestic accommodation and food services in the post-pandemic period. For

 the first five months of 2023, the annual growth rate of the CPI averaged 2.44%

 and that of the core CPI averaged 2.68%. 

 Looking at the second half of 2023, it was expected that prices of crude oil and

 other raw materials would trend below the levels of 2022, bringing down related

 import prices for Taiwan and thus leading to a further softening in domestic

 commodity prices. However, domestic services prices stayed elevated owing to

 price rises in entertainment services and in food away from home, the latter of

 which reflected higher food ingredients and hiring costs. The Bank therefore

 forecasted that the inflation rate would continue to come down gradually in the

 second half of the year, with the headline and core inflation rates projected to slow

 down to 2.24% and 2.38% (see Appendix Table for the forecasts by major

 institutions) in 2023 from 2.95% and 2.61% the previous year, while noting that

 price trends of international commodities and domestic services and the effects of

###### weather events could still affect the domestic inflation outlook in the second half

 of this year. 

 3. Banks' excess reserves stayed slightly above NT$60 billion on average for the

 March-April period. The annual growth rate of M2 (measured on a daily average

 basis) decreased from 7.25% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to an average of 6.69%

 in the first four months of 2023. Bank loans and investments further decreased

 from 6.66% of the fourth quarter of 2022 to 5.55% in the first four months of 2023.

 Short-term market rates and interest rates on bank deposits and loans both

 exhibited uptrends following the Bank's March rate hike, the fifth one in this

 tightening cycle.

 III. Monetary policy decisions: The Board decided unanimously to hold the policy rates

 steady and to adjust the selective credit control measures 

 1. In today's meeting, the Board considered the following assessment of economic

 and financial conditions at home and abroad. Domestic inflation is expected to

 come down moderately in the second half of the year, bringing the inflation rate to

 around 2% in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the international economic outlook is

 confronted by many uncertainties, the domestic output gap would likely turn

 negative, and the domestic economy is projected to grow at a slower pace than

 previously forecasted. Taking into account the previous streak of five policy rate

 hikes and two increases in the required reserve ratios, the Board judged that a rate

 hold would allow the Bank to assess the cumulative effects and implications of its

 monetary tightening and would help foster sound economic and financial

 development on the whole. 

 At the meeting today, the Board decided to maintain the discount rate, the rate on

 refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations at current

 levels of 1.875%, 2.25%, and 4.125%, respectively. 

 Looking ahead, the Bank will continue to monitor the implications for domestic

 economic activity and financial conditions arising from domestic monetary

 tightening and from the spillovers of major central banks' rate hikes. Accordingly,

 the Bank will adjust its monetary policy in a timely manner as warranted, so as to

 fulfill the statutory duties of maintaining financial and price stability and fostering

 economic development within the scope of the above objectives.

###### 2. The Bank has made four adjustments to its selective credit control measures since

 December 2020. The policy measures have so far effectively helped banks mitigate

 credit risk associated with real estate lending, reflected by steady slowdown in

 banks' construction and housing loan growth and the continuously low level of the

 non-performing loan ratio for real estate lending. 

 Nevertheless, recent indicators showed that real estate lending still made up a large

 proportion in total bank lending; in the first quarter of 2023, second home loans

 taken out by natural persons saw both an increase in number and an expansion in

 its ratio to total borrowers of newly-extended home loans, compared to the

 previous quarter; and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio granted to second home loans

 taken out by natural persons for homes in the designated ''specific areas'' averaged

 at high levels and continued rising. In this light, the Bank decided to amend the

 Regulations Governing the Extension of Mortgage Loans by Financial Institutions

 with the aim of further strengthening management of bank credit resources and

 containing related credit risk. The amendments, including the introduction of a

 70% cap on the LTV ratio for a second home loan of a natural person for housing

 in a "specific area," will take effect on June 16, 2023 (see Appendix for more

 details). 

 It is expected that more results will continue to emerge as government agencies

 are making headway with their policy efforts under the Healthy Real Estate Market

 Plan and improving relevant mechanisms and measures. Going forward, the Bank

 will continuously monitor the developments in housing credit and market, review

 the implementation of the selective credit control measures, and make adjustments

 as needed in order to promote financial stability and sound banking operations.

 IV. The NT dollar exchange rate is in principle determined by market forces.

 Nonetheless, when seasonal or irregular factors (such as massive inflows or

 outflows of short-term capital) lead to excess volatility or disorderly movements in

 the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial

 stability, the Bank, in accordance with its statutory mandates, will step in to

 maintain an orderly market.
