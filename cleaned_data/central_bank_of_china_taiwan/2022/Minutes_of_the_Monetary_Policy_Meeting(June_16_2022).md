##### AGENDA: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND

 MONETARY POLICY DECISION

 I. Staff Review of Economic and Financial Conditions 

###### 1. International Economic and Financial Conditions

 The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war pushed up international raw material prices;

 China’s zero-COVID policy added to global supply chain pressures, causing a broad

 slowdown in corporate expansion in major economies. Moreover, the US and some

 other economies began monetary tightening at a faster pace. For this year as a whole,

 international institutions expected the global economic growth to moderate.

 International oil prices had swung upwards since April, reflecting the impact from

 the EU’s proposal to phase out Russian crude oil by the end of the year. International

 institutions forecasted this year’s oil prices to climb higher than last year. Grain prices

 had gone up since April as exports were disrupted by the Ukraine war, but came down

 slightly after successful talks to resume fertilizer exports from Ukraine and Russia. 

 As significantly upturns in food and energy prices pushed up inflation in major

 economies, international institutions continued to revise up their projections for this

 year’s global inflation and expected to see inflation reach markedly higher levels this

 year compared to last year. 

 Against a backdrop of inflation climbing in major economies, the US Federal

 Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of England continued with policy rate hikes, the European

 Central Bank (ECB) was set to end its bond buying program, while Japan’s and China’s

 central banks maintained a broadly loose monetary policy stance. 

 US and German 10-year government bond yields went up on recent market

 expectations that the Fed would tighten faster and begin shrinking its balance sheet and

 the ECB would end asset purchases and gradually start rate hikes. Major central bank

 hawkishness also led to extended declines in global stock markets. Also reflecting

 market expectations that the Fed would roll out larger rate increases than other major

 central banks, the US dollar index trended up from April onwards as the currencies of

 major economies weakened against the US dollar.

-----

###### Looking ahead, the global economy faces multiple downside risks, including the

 following: (1) the Ukraine war exacerbates supply chain disruptions and the global food

 crisis; (2) elevated inflation could amplify inflation expectations, adding to upside price

 pressures; (3) faster rate hikes by many economies could significantly worsen the

 financial crunch, creating additional downward pressures for global economic growth;

 (4) China’s economic slowdown could act as a drag on the global economic growth. In

 addition, recurring waves of COVID-19 complicate an already uncertain global

 economic outlook. 

 2. Domestic Economic and Financial Conditions

 (1) Economic situation

 Taiwan’s economy posted solid growth in the first quarter of the year, with the

 manufacturing sector keeping a steady pace and the services sector recovering. The

 coincident indicator for business outlook continued to rise mildly in April, while the

 leading indicator fell for the sixth consecutive month. 

 With pronounced price rises, the average real total earnings growth of the non-farm

 employees increased marginally for the first four months of the year. 54.0% of them saw

 negative growth, with a majority in the services sector. 

 The domestic COVID-19 case spike from mid-April onwards had led to an increase

 in the number of furloughed employees. As people shunned from dining out and

 traveling, private consumption slowed drastically and the recovery in the domestically
 oriented services sector sputtered. 

 In terms of external demand, exports registered double-digit growth year on year

 for the January-to-May 2022 period. Looking ahead to the second half of the year,

 despite continued demand for emerging technology applications and digital

 transformation-related products, export growth is expected to be slightly constrained by

 a slowing global economy. Overall, the Bank projected exports to post solid growth for

 the year as a whole. 

 In regard to domestic demand, as several large tech firms stepped up capital

 expenditure for the year and infrastructure projects such as green energy and 5G

 networks got underway, private investment would likely gain stronger momentum.

3


-----

###### However, there remain many economic and trade uncertainties around the world, casting

 a shadow over investment plans in Taiwan. Overall, the Bank expected private

 investment to grow mildly for the year as a whole. 

 In terms of private consumption, growth was dampened by a coronavirus case spike

 from mid-April but was expected to gradually pick up in the latter half of the year when

 infection cases begin to decrease steadily and the implementation of government

 stimulus measures helps bolster domestically-oriented services. The Bank projected

 private consumption growth this year to gather pace. 

 Overall, with domestic consumption disrupted by local COVID-19 waves and

 investment outlook clouded by considerable downside risk to the global economy, the

 Bank projected the economy to expand by 3.75% this year, down from the March

 forecast of 4.05%, while the growth projections by major institutions ranged between

 2.77% and 4.50%.

 (2) Financial conditions 

 Domestic long and short-term interest rates climbed upwards in recent months,

 reflecting the Bank’s March rate hike and global financial market volatility created by

 the Fed’s tightening and the ongoing Ukraine war. The average bank excess reserves

 stood at around NT$70 billion. 

 Bank loans and investments had risen steadily in the year so far with both private

 and public enterprises increasing their demand for funding. In terms of money supply,

 the annual growth rate of M2 generally trended downwards from the latter half of 2021;

 in recent months, M2 growth picked up moderately as bank credit grew further. 

 In the housing market, growth in transaction volume had moderated since the

 beginning of the year, reflecting government efforts under the Executive Yuan’s Healthy

 Housing Market Plan as well as a more recent local outbreak of the coronavirus. During

 the first four months of the year, the total number of building ownership transfers

 nationwide rose by 3.34% year on year. For the six Special Municipalities, building

 ownership transfers increased by 0.7% year on year in the first five months of 2022, but

 the monthly data showed a 7.7% decline in May compared to the same month last year.

 In the meantime, construction costs for new housing units continued rising, and the

4


-----

###### national Urban Land Price Index, compiled by the Ministry of the Interior, also trended

 up, both driving prices of new housing units upwards. Furthermore, the Housing Price

 Index, also compiled by the Ministry of the Interior, climbed 8.63% year on year during

 the fourth quarter of 2021, while the price indices for existing homes and for new

 housing projects rose further by 14.66% and 27.19% year on year, respectively, in the

 first quarter of 2022. Recent sentiment-related data showed that both builders and real

 estate businesses turned somewhat cautious about the outlook of the housing market,

 while banks also became less optimistic about the outlook of residential housing in

 major cities. 

 As of the end of April 2022, the annual growth rates of real estate lending, housing

 loans, and construction loans edged down to 10.20%, 9.39%, and 13.30%, respectively.

 Real estate loans as a share of total loans slightly shrank to 36.91%, lower than the

 37.16% registered at the end of last year. Meanwhile, the construction loan ratio of

 domestic banks stood at 26.86%, still below the 30% cap prescribed in Article 72-2 of

 the Banking Act.[2] The ratio of non-performing housing loans extended by domestic

 banks remained low at 0.08%. 

 Since the Bank made four amendments to its selective credit controls from

 December 2020 onwards, banks’ loan portfolio concentration in real estate lending had

 kept steady, which was conducive to bank credit risk management. The Bank’s

 tightening stance since March was also judged to amplify the effectiveness of selective

 credit controls. In addition, the Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Finance, Financial

 Supervisory Commission, and local governments had all stepped up policy efforts to

 ensure housing market health, and the results were expected to gradually show at a later

 time. 

 (3) Price trends 

 Since the beginning of the year, costs of imported products such as food and crude

 oil had risen, pushing up prices of related domestic products, while unfavorable weather

 factors also affected the harvest of fruit and vegetables, both resulting in higher domestic

2 According to Article 72-2 of the Banking Act, the total amount of loans extended for residential construction

and construction for business purposes by a Commercial Bank shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the
aggregate of such Commercial Bank's deposits and Bank Debentures issued at the time such loans is extended.

5


-----

###### inflation. For the first five months of the year, the annual CPI growth rate averaged

 3.04%, mainly reflecting price rises in food, fuel and lubricants, and consumer durables.

 As there was a more marked increase in prices of staples with a higher purchase

 frequency, consumers tended to be more conscious of upward price trends. 

 The Bank’s survey for inflation expectations found that, compared to the previous

 quarter, an increased share of respondents in the corporate sector and in investment trust

 companies expected the inflation rate to exceed 2.5% within the next 12 months,

 reflecting rising international raw material prices and a consequent price hike of related

 products by domestic firms. Projections for Taiwan’s inflation rate for 2022 made by

 major forecasting institutions also turned upwards, indicating rising inflationary

 pressures. 

 Given the still marked imported inflation pressures and the expectation that the

 inflation rate would slow gradually in the second half of the year as international crude

 oil price growth eases, the Bank forecasted the annual growth rates of CPI and core CPI

 to be 2.83% and 2.42%, respectively, for the year as a whole. Meanwhile, the projections

 by domestic and foreign institutions for the 2022 annual CPI growth rate ranged between

 2.20% and 3.80%.

 Compared to major economies, though, Taiwan’s inflation rate this year was mild,

 reflecting slack domestic private consumption demand and the government’s robust

 supply-side measures to contain price volatility. International institutions expected

 Taiwan’s longer-term inflation to register around a mild level of 1.5%. 

 Looking ahead, upside pressures for domestic prices could arise from (1) upward

 price adjustments to reflect rising international freight fares and raw material prices; (2)

 the easing of border controls and continuous oil price uptrends resulting in a sizeable

 increase in airfares by aviation companies. On the other hand, downside pressures could

 come from (1) government plans to reduce customs duties and commodity and business

 taxes, in order to help ease the pressures of rising costs on product providers; (2)

 promotional price cuts to prop up consumer interest amid an ongoing coronavirus

 outbreak; (3) telecom operators cutting prices of mobile phones and other

 communication devices amid intense competition. 

6


-----

###### 3. Considerations for Monetary Policy

 (1) Considerations based on external and domestic economic and financial conditions

 A. International commodity prices continued trending up, imposing heavy imported

 inflation pressures on domestic prices, which would likely stay at elevated levels.

 The Bank revised up forecasts for this year’s CPI and core CPI annual growth rates

 to 2.83% and 2.42%, respectively. 

 B. The recent COVID-19 case surge at home disrupted the recovery of domestically
 oriented services sector and restrained private consumption growth. 

 C. Domestic economic growth momentum could be dampened by a global economic

 outlook facing downward risks. The Bank revised down this year’s economic

 growth rate projection to 3.75%.

 (2) Considerations for raising the policy rates by 12.5 basis points 

 A. The domestic price uptrend in the year so far was mainly due to supply-side factors

 such as higher costs for importing crude oil and food. To counter cost-push inflation

 shocks, a policy mix combining various suitable tools would be required to maintain

 price stability. 

 (i) The government took measures to stabilize oil and electricity rates, and reduced

 several customs duties, commodity taxes, and business taxes where necessary.

 These supply-side measures adopted to address energy and food price volatility

 had greatly buttressed overall price stability. 

 (ii) In the face of drastic price volatility caused by supply-side factors, monetary

 policy responses such as aggressive tightening could concomitantly restrain

 economic output; therefore, supply-side measures would serve better under the

 circumstances. However, as inflation was expected to stay elevated for an

 extended period of time, an appropriate tightening stance would still be needed

 to help anchor inflation expectations and reach a better supply-demand balance,

 so as to maintain price stability. 

7


-----

###### B. The Bank raised the policy rates by 25 basis points in March this year, a decision

 based on the anticipation that the domestically-oriented services sector was on track

 towards continued revival and thus the policy rates could be brought back up to the

 pre-pandemic level. However, that pace of services recovery was disrupted by the

 recent spike in coronavirus infections, which dampened private consumption

 growth and rattled labor market conditions. 

 (i) The government, in response to recent Omicron waves, extended the special

 regulations governing pandemic relief measures to June 30, 2023. Accordingly,

 relevant relief loan programs would expire later than originally scheduled.

 (ii) The Bank’s Special Accommodation Facility to Support Bank Credit to SMEs

 (hereinafter the “Special Accommodation Facility”) would expire at the end

 of June this year, meaning that the rates of such preferential loans would go

 up afterwards. 

 C. In light of elevated domestic inflation, a larger policy rate increase would more

 significantly exacerbate interest burdens of economically-vulnerable businesses and

 workers taking out relief loans and other policy loans; it would be more appropriate

 to adopt a more moderate pace for today’s rate hike. 

 (3) Considerations for raising the reserve requirement ratios by 25 basis points 

 A. In light of the ongoing price uptrends at home, the Bank proposed to simultaneously

 raise policy rates and reserve requirement ratios to rein in public expectations for

 price growth. The Bank judged that adopting a monetary policy mix to affect price

 (interest rates) and quantity (money stock) would not only help amplify policy

 effects but also clearly demonstrate the Bank’s stance to continue tightening. 

 B. Higher policy rates tend to affect not just one particular part but a broad range of the

 economy, including the deposit rates of financial institutions which current relief

 loans or other policy loans are typically linked to. Therefore, it would be more

 appropriate to refrain from unwarranted large rate increases. On the other hand,

 since higher reserve requirement ratios do not directly affect deposit rates, using this

8


-----

###### tool as part of the policy mix would therefore not add to the interest burden of

 vulnerable workers and firms. 

 C. With the increase of reserve requirement ratios, banks would shift their funds from

 central bank-issued certificates of deposit or redeposits to required reserves, so that

 bank capital would park with the central bank for a longer period. This would reduce

 the stock of money in the economy, thereby alleviating inflationary pressures and

 helping maintain price stability. 

 D. As banks will have to set aside more funds to be held as reserves, they would be

 more cautious in making new investments and extending new credit. This would

 constrain the capacity of credit creation by banks and, in turn, help maintain M2

 growth at an appropriate level. 

 II. Proposition and Decision about Monetary Policy 

 1. Policy Propositions: To raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured

 loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 12.5 basis points to 1.5%,

 1.875%, and 3.75%, respectively; and to increase the reserve requirement ratios

 on NT dollar demand deposits and time (savings) deposits by 25 basis points. 

 2. Board members reached a unanimous vote to raise the policy rates by 12.5 basis points

 and to increase the reserve requirement ratios on NT dollar demand deposits and time

 (savings) deposits by 25 basis points. Related discussions are summarized as follows.

 (1) Discussions on today’s monetary policy propositions

 One board director stated that this year’s price rises were mainly due to imported

 inflation, and supply-side inflationary pressures were beyond the influence of monetary

 policy. Nevertheless, considering that price stability is part of the Bank’s statutory

 mandate, it would be imperative to adopt an appropriate increase in the policy rates to

 rein in inflation. Meanwhile, data showed that since the Bank’s March rate hike, the

 average excess reserves of financial institutions had come to levels higher than the same

 period last year. Therefore, raising the reserve requirement ratios by an appropriate

 extent would reduce the money stock and restrain bank credit expansion, thereby making

9


-----

###### up a tightening move that affects both quantity (money stock) and price (interest rates).

 Furthermore, in deciding the pace of the policy rate hike, one should also take into

 account the recent local COVID-19 resurgence’s impact on the SMEs. Therefore, the

 board director was in favor of a 12.5 basis-point rate hike and a 25 basis-point increase

 in the reserve requirement ratios. 

 Another board director agreed with today’s propositions and stated that the

 considerations supporting the policy rate increase by only 12.5 basis points – including

 financial conditions having tightened, economic activity likely slackening off, relief

 loan programs closing (leaving the respective loan rates at the discretion of banks), and

 domestic demand recovery sputtering (e.g., domestically-oriented services sector

 posting negative real earnings growth) – were understandable. However, one of the main

 objectives of interest rate tools is to anchor inflation expectations; the Bank should

 communicate to the public that today’s decisions took into consideration the impact of

 evolving price trends and therefore it opted for an approach that would affect both

 money stock and interest rates. Such communication would promote policy

 effectiveness by improving public understanding of potential changes in inflation

 expectations and borrowing costs over the coming months or an extended time. 

 One board director pointed out that although domestic inflation had been trending

 up owing to rising international oil prices, the government had introduced many supply
 side measures, including a domestic oil price stabilizing mechanism and electricity rate

 freezes, to mitigate such supply-side inflation. Meanwhile, the Bank’s policy rate hike

 would also help temper inflation expectations, albeit with possible negative

 implications, especially for the domestically-oriented services sector. 

 One board director noted that the services sector was battered by the pandemic and

 was having a hard time regaining its footing; with the Bank’s Special Accommodation

 Facility set to close soon, a further 25 basis-point rate hike would weigh on the services

 sector as well as the SMEs. In this view, it would help to tap an alternative solution by

 using the reserve requirement tool in tandem. The director, expressing support for

 today’s policy propositions, added that the reserve requirement tool influences through

 the stock of money. While it has been a while since the tool was last deployed, the

 increase in the reserve requirement ratios in today’s meeting would affect money supply

10


-----

###### through the money multiplier effect, the positive and negative outcomes of which should

 be rigorously followed to help guide future policy formulation. 

 Another board director, approving of today’s policy propositions, noted that

 although the broad, ongoing price rises chiefly resulted from supply-side factors, the

 central bank should still take actions where needed. The director also pointed out that

 the downward revision to the Bank’s domestic GDP forecast primarily reflected below
 expectation progress in private consumption. The rate hike, albeit based on a

 comprehensive assessment of the overall economic and financial conditions, would be

 helpful to some parts of the economy while undesirable to others. The Bank’s monetary

 tightening was aimed at combating inflation. The key would be to bring down inflation

 expectations of the household and corporate sectors, preventing such mentality from

 becoming entrenched and thus causing prices to spiral upwards. Since today’s increase

 in policy rates was smaller than the March rate hike and the reserve requirement tool

 functions indirectly via the bank credit channel, adequate communication to the public

 about the inflation-fighting effects of today’s decisions would be important for the

 policy to work well in containing inflation expectations. 

 One board director agreed with a 25 basis-point rise in the reserve requirement

 ratios and, while supporting a policy rate hike, recognized the challenge in deciding on

 a rate hike by either 12.5 or 25 basis points. After the Bank raised the policy rates by 25

 basis points in March, data showed that the overnight call loan rate and other short-term

 interest rates did not increase by a corresponding extent, implying that the March rate

 decision somehow did not go far beyond an announcement effect. Therefore, a further

 hike by 25 basis points would be more appropriate in today’s meeting, whereas a 12.5

 basis-point hike, if adopted, should be accompanied by a 12.5 basis-point hike in the

 interest rates on 7-day (or other short-term ) certificates of deposit issued by the Bank. 

 One board director pointed out that Taiwan’s inflationary pressures were in fact

 much higher than what the actual data showed. Be it supply-side or demand-side,

 inflation of either type would certainly affect inflation expectations, an area where the

 Bank should tackle. Historically, regardless of the type of inflation, an easy money

 environment seems to have been the underlying cause of rising inflation. The clearer,

 the firmer, and the sooner an effective monetary policy is introduced, the more likely it

11


-----

###### will be to well anchor inflation expectations early on and to ward off the risk of an

 economic recession. Though monetary policy is not a cure-all, its timely effective

 deployment would help treat the problems. Slow and conservative rate hikes might not

 be powerful enough to constrain inflation and anchor inflation expectations. Meanwhile,

 despite four amendments to the selective credit controls on housing credit, each round

 was implemented with a light touch and may not be effective. Indeed, some of the

 relevant indicators – such as housing prices, housing loan portfolio concentration, the

 household debt-to-GDP ratio, housing prices-to-income ratio, and the housing loan

 burden ratio – had continued to hit record highs. This director expressed concern that

 the Board did not take action against the housing price issue in the March meeting,

 neither did it in today’s meeting. In addition, although a policy mix has the benefit of

 amplifying the intended effect, the one proposed in today’s meeting still appeared to err

 on the side of caution. Compared to the monetary policy conduct of central banks the

 world over, the extent of a 12.5 basis-point increase seemed to be out of norm and lack

 potency. 

 One board director noted that Taiwan’s inflation had been mild so far this year

 compared to other economies; though inflation expectations had risen, the inflation rate

 was expected to gradually trend down in the second half of the year. Against this

 backdrop, it was warranted to raise the policy rates to stem higher inflation, but the pace

 should not be rushed in order not to adversely impact vulnerable sectors, such as the

 domestically-oriented services sector, in which a growing number of employees were

 furloughed amid the impact from the recent Omicron outbreak. Meanwhile, as domestic

 banks’ excess reserves stood at high levels, raising the reserve requirement ratios would

 help restrain the liquidity of money supply. In all, the director agreed with today’s

 propositions. 

 Another board director also expressed support for the policy propositions, stating

 that the simultaneous tightening through price (interest rates) and quantity (money

 stock) would not only demonstrate the Bank’s resolve to keep inflation in check but also

 show the market that the Bank is keeping an eye on the overnight call loan rate, an

 indicator of short-term funding costs. Nevertheless, the reserve requirement adjustment

 has not been frequently deployed, and the effect of such policy implementation on bank

12


-----

###### excess reserves and market interest rates would need to be closely monitored. Moreover,

 with a policy rate hike, financially vulnerable borrowers would feel the pain of a heavier

 interest burden when banks correspondingly raise their interest rates on loans (as well

 as on deposits); on the other hand, larger corporates would be better equipped to sustain

 a rate hike as their funding costs via debt issuance are largely determined by bills finance

 and capital market interest rates. In this view, today’s proposition to administer a smaller

 rate hike, along with raising the reserve requirements, would be an equitable approach

 that looks out for the economically disadvantaged people. 

 One board director pointed out that in the past three years, unanticipated shocks

 including the US-China trade conflicts, the coronavirus outbreak, and the Russian

 invasion of Ukraine had resulted in volatile price uptrends internationally and

 domestically, leading foreign and local institutions to keep upgrading inflation

 projections. In the US, inflation was spurred by both supply and demand factors,

 prompting the Fed to combat inflation with aggressive rate hikes. On the other hand,

 Taiwan’s inflation was mainly induced by supply constraints; with domestic consumer

 demand still lukewarm and the government adopting supply-side measures to stabilize

 prices, inflation remained mild compared to major economies, thus warranting a more

 moderate pace of rate hikes. Nonetheless, if inflation becomes persistently high, then

 monetary tightening should step up. In regard to housing market-related measures, the

 Bank’s four recent rounds of selective credit controls were in fact financial stability

 measures introduced to avoid an inordinate credit flow into the real estate sector, instead

 of attempts aiming directly at housing prices. Therefore, the effectiveness of such

 measures would be better reflected by financial stability-related indicators such as

 portfolio concentration and non-performing loan ratios of real estate lending. Currently,

 banks had shown good real estate credit management, housing transactions had slowed

 somewhat, and the policy efforts by other government agencies to ensure a sound

 housing market were expected to gradually make headway. In addition, monetary

 tightening since March would also help dampen housing credit growth. Based on such

 an assessment, it was judged appropriate to maintain the selective credit controls at

 current status. In the future, the Bank should continue monitoring developments related

 to real estate lending and, if necessary, take further measures in a timely manner. 

13


-----

###### One board director expressed concern because the proposition’s 12.5 basis points

 would trail farther behind the Fed’s rate hikes which included a 75 basis-point rise in

 June and another hike expected in July. Despite the fact that recent NTD weakness was

 mainly caused by foreign portfolio investment outflows, more downward pressures on

 the currency could ensue if a wider US-Taiwan interest rate differential induces more

 capital outflows. And since Taiwan’s price uptrends were due in large part to rises in

 import prices of raw materials, a weaker currency would also weigh on price stability.

 In addition, the relative mild inflation in Taiwan was mainly supported by utility (oil,

 electricity, natural gas, etc.) fee freezes and subsidies from the government. In sum,

 recent data pointed to little change in domestic economic and financial conditions;

 combined with the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes, it would seem more fitting for the Bank

 to raise the policy rates by 25 basis points. On the other hand, the last time the Bank

 adjusted reserve requirements was more than a decade ago, and the effect of this type of

 adjustment at a time when bank excess reserves stayed somewhat elevated would be

 limited. 

 One board director approved of a 12.5 basis-point rate hike, noting that an

 appropriate hike would help rein in inflation expectations. However, given this was a

 small increase by 12.5 basis points, it would be important to heed potential impacts of a

 wider US-Taiwan interest rate differential on capital flows and NT dollar exchange

 rates. As Taiwan faced mainly the kind of price pressures arising from imported

 inflation, the widening differential would possibly induce capital outflows and further

 weaken the NTD, aggravating the problem of imported inflation. 

 One board director stated that the US government bond yields have surged as the

 Fed tightened at a faster pace; this not only weakened the US economic outlook and

 weighed on future stock dividend growth, but also pushed up the discount rate (used in

 business valuation that converts future returns into present value) and led investors to

 downgrade stock valuations, causing sharp corrections in the US stock markets.

 Reflecting the US financial market turbulence, Taiwan’s stock indices also fluctuated

 downwards, triggering a sell-off by foreign institutional investors who, based on asset

 re-allocation and funds redemption strategies, executed large profit-taking trades and

 moved capital out, causing the NT dollar to weaken more markedly than usual. In

14


-----

###### addition, the majority of foreign capital in Taiwan is held in the form of stock holdings,

 and data also pointed to little change in the balance of foreign investor holdings of

 Taiwanese government bonds and NTD deposits. These showed that the widening

 interest rate spread between the US and Taiwan was not the main driver for the recent

 foreign capital outflow. 

 (2) Discussions on the future path of monetary policy 

 One board director stated that the domestic inflation rate had been above 2% since

 April 2021 and was expected to remain so for the rest of 2022, longer than previously

 projected, while surveyed data also showed that experts and scholars still envisaged

 inflation exceeding 2% next year. On top of that, if the coronavirus outbreak eases in

 the second half year or sometime in the future, the domestic economic activity would

 also rebound. Persistent price uptrends would continue to buoy inflation expectations.

 Therefore, it is important for future monetary policy deliberations to focus on the issue

 of inflation and inflation expectations. 

 Several board directors discussed economic uncertainties lying ahead and a wider

 US-Taiwan interest rate differential, and stated that the Bank’s monetary policy conduct

 should be more nimble. If needed, the Bank may hold emergency meetings of Executive

 Directors before the next scheduled meeting (in September) so as to make swift, nimble

 policy adjustments as warranted.

 3. Monetary Policy Decision: The board directors reached a unanimous vote to

 raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on

 temporary accommodations by 12.5 basis points to 1.5%, 1.875%, and 3.75%,

 respectively; and to increase the reserve requirement ratios on NT dollar

 demand deposits and time (savings) deposits by 25 basis points. 

##### III. The Press Release 

###### The board directors and supervisors approved unanimously to issue the following

 press release in the post-meeting press conference, together with the Supplementary

 Materials for the Post-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank.

##### Press Release  June 16, 2022

 Monetary Policy Decision of the Board Meeting

I. Global economic and financial conditions

Since the Board met in March this year, the continued Russia-Ukraine conflict has pushed

up commodity prices and the strict pandemic-related restrictions in China have exacerbated

international supply chain bottlenecks, significantly heightening global inflationary

pressures. Meanwhile, further policy rate hikes by central banks in major economies like

the US have induced tighter financial conditions. As a result, it is expected that growth

momentum for the global economy is likely to soften this year. Recent global financial

market turbulence has also intensified in the wake of monetary tightening in major

economies. International institutions have further downgraded their forecasts for the 2022

global economic growth and revised this year's global inflation forecasts upwards.

Looking ahead, the global economy is still clouded by multiple downside risks, mainly

including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, inflation expectations likely being pushed up by high

global inflation, a slowdown in China's economic growth, and tightening international

financial conditions, which could weigh on global production as well as economic and trade

activity. Moreover, recurring COVID-19 pandemic outbreaks would also add to

uncertainties to the global economy.

II. Domestic economic and financial conditions

1. In the first quarter of the year, bolstered by growth in exports and private investment, the

domestic economy expanded at a solid pace. The manufacturing sector showed steady

expansion, while the services sector gradually recovered. In terms of labor market

conditions, the unemployment rate fell slightly compared to the same period of the previous

year, whereas the number of employed persons recorded a modest year-on-year decrease.

As inflation was elevated, the average real total earnings of all payroll employees in the

industrial and services sectors only registered marginal growth, and there remained a

pronounced difference in wage growth across sectors.

The domestic COVID-19 resurgence since mid-April caused companies to institute more

furloughs and consumers to shun away from dining out and travel. As a result, consumer

spending slumped, and the recovery of domestically-oriented services sector faltered.

Looking ahead to the second half of the year, though the global economic expansion is

likely to moderate, it is expected that continued demand for emerging technology

applications and digital transformation-related products would buttress Taiwan's export

growth. Private investment is projected to extend the uptrend and government consumption

is also set to increase, while private consumption would gradually pick up once the domestic

coronavirus outbreak eases. The Bank forecasts Taiwan's economy to grow by 3.75% this

year (Appendix Table), lower than the March forecast of 4.05%.

2. From the beginning of 2022, domestic prices of food and oil related products were pushed

up by rising import costs and domestic harvests of fruit and vegetables were restrained by

unfavorable weather conditions, leading the consumer price index (CPI) annual growth rate

to trend upwards. For the first five months of the year, the annual growth rates of the CPI

and core CPI (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items) averaged 3.04% and 2.33%,

respectively. The Bank expects the inflation rate to gradually come down in the second half

of the year, but still at elevated levels. For the year as a whole, the Bank revises the CPI and

core CPI annual growth rate projections upwards to 2.83% and 2.42%, respectively (see

Appendix Table).

3. Recently, banks' excess reserves stood around NT$70 billion. The annual growth rate of

bank loans and investments averaged 8.62% for the first four months of the year, while that

of M2 (on a daily average basis) registered 7.94% for the same period. Meanwhile, short
and long-term market interest rates both rose higher.

III. Monetary policy decisions: Raising the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points and raising

the reserve requirement ratios by 0.25 percentage points

In today's meeting, the Board considered these developments in domestic and foreign

economic and financial conditions. Given mounting pressures of imported inflation fueled

by rising international commodity prices, domestic inflation is expected to remain elevated.

Meanwhile, as the recent surge of COVID-19 inflections at home disrupted the recovery of

domestically-oriented services sector, private consumption growth would likely weaken. In

addition, shrouded by downside risks, a more subdued global economic outlook could further

weigh on Taiwan's growth momentum.

The Board judged that raising both the policy rates and the reserve requirement ratios would

send a clear message that the Bank continues to adopt a monetary policy stance of tightening.

This will help strengthen the policy effects and rein in domestic inflation expectations, so as

to achieve the policy objectives of price stability and sound financial and economic

development.

The Board decided unanimously at the meeting today to raise the discount rate, the rate on

refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations to 1.5%, 1.875%,

and 3.75%, respectively, effective June 17, 2022.

The Board also decided unanimously to increase the reserve requirement ratios on NT dollar

demand deposits and time (savings) deposits by 0.25 percentage points each (see Appendix

for the requirements by type of deposits), effective July 1, 2022.

Against the backdrop of intense inflationary pressures and significant downside risks faced

by the global economy, the Bank will keep close watch on the implications for domestic price

trends resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other geopolitical risks, international

commodity price movements, and the global pandemic progress, while also closely monitor

how the monetary policy tightening of major economies would affect economic and financial

conditions at home and abroad. Based on the assessments thereof, the Bank may adjust its

monetary policy timely and appropriately to fulfill the statutory duties of maintaining

financial and price stability, and fostering economic development within the scope of the

above objectives.

IV. The Bank's selective credit control measures, first introduced in December 2020 and adjusted

later for three times, have so far successfully slowed down the expansion of construction and

housing loans and kept real estate loan concentration broadly steady, thereby bolstering

banks' credit risk management. As the government's cross-agency efforts proceeded further

under the Healthy Real Estate Market Plan and the renewed pandemic waves created

additional concerns, trading in the housing market has cooled somewhat for the year to date,

and the annual growth rates of building ownership transfers in the entire nation and in the

Six Special Municipalities both declined to negative territory recently. Moreover, the

monetary policy tightening would also boost the effectiveness of the existing credit controls.

The Bank will stay attentive to the developments in real estate lending and continue to review

the implementation of the selective credit control measures, and make adjustments as needed

in order to promote financial stability.

V. The NT dollar exchange rate is in principle determined by market forces. Nonetheless, when

seasonal or irregular factors (such as massive inflows or outflows of short-term capital) lead

to excess volatility and disorderly movements in the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse

implications for economic and financial stability, the Bank, in line with its statutory

mandates, will step in to maintain an orderly market.
