##### AGENDA: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND

 MONETARY POLICY DECISION

 I. Staff Review of Economic and Financial Conditions 

###### 1. International Economic and Financial Conditions

 Since the second quarter this year, the U.S., the euro area, and China had all

 experienced economic slowdown. Global manufacturing expansion sputtered, business

 sentiment of major economies became more cautious about the economic outlook, and

 decreasing new orders and increasing inventories also pointed to weaker demand for

 goods consumption worldwide. Amid the global economic moderation and sluggish

 trade growth, supply chain bottlenecks had begun to ease and freight fees had dropped

 significantly from the peaks. However, the world continued to witness elevated

 inflation, many economies including the U.S. and Europe continued hiking policy rates

 and financial conditions were tight. It was projected that global economic growth would

 soften this year, with international institutions downgrading their forecasts for the

 world’s GDP growth rate in 2022 and expecting a further slowdown in 2023. 

 Regarding commodity prices, oil prices had swung downwards since July 2022,

 against a background of the European Union allowing Russia to export its crude oil to

 economies outside the EU, OPEC+ agreeing to increase oil output, and a global

 economic moderation dampening demand for crude oil. International institutions

 forecasted this year’s oil prices would exceed the levels of last year then edge down next

 year. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB (RJ/CRB) Index, the global commodities benchmark,

 fell in recent months from a previous high and fluctuated within a narrow range. 

 Surging energy and food prices have kept inflation in major economies at high

 levels this year so far. Nevertheless, given the monetary tightening actions by most

 major central banks and a recent decline in energy prices, the world would likely see

 next year’s inflation come down from previous highs. While the U.S., Europe and many

 other economies carried on with policy rate hikes to tame high inflation, Japan and China

 remained accommodative. 

 In terms of international financial market trends since August 2022, as the Federal

 Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) signaled for further tightening, the

2


-----

###### U.S. and German10-year government bond yields both rebounded. Major stock markets

 experienced turbulence in recent months in response to U.S. inflation data and Fed

 policy paths. The DXY index set a new record high in more than 20 years, leading major

 currencies to depreciate against the US dollar. 

 Looking ahead, the global economy faces multiple downside risks, including the

 following: (1) Aggressive tightening by major central banks including the Fed and the

 ECB, roiling global financial markets and depressing economic activity worldwide,

 heightening the risk of defaults by countries with high levels of external debt; (2) the

 Russia-Ukraine war continuing on, taking a toll on the European economy amid the

 resulting energy crisis and hurting political and economic stability amid financial market

 turbulence; (3) China’s “zero-COVID” policy posing a threat to the easing of global

 supply chain bottlenecks, and the real estate market pressures destabilizing global

 financial stability. In addition, geopolitical risks, extreme weather events, and pandemic

 waves also cast a long shadow over the global economic outlook. 

 2. Domestic Economic and Financial Conditions

 (1) Economic situation

 In recent months, the domestic economic expansion moderated, with both leading

 and coincident indicators for business outlook on a downtrend. Manufacturing and non
 manufacturing sentiment for the outlook for the next six months also became cautious. 

 In terms of external demand since July 2022, robust demand for integrated circuits

 and mineral products counteracted by global final demand losing steam led export

 growth to slow down year on year, registering 2% in August. Looking ahead, emerging

 technology applications and digital transformation would continue supporting demand

 and extend the gains in related supply chain exports. However, with major central banks

 tightening further and external demand cooling down, Taiwan could witness slowing

 growth momentum for its exports. Overall, the Bank projected exports to post solid

 growth this year and slower growth next year. 

 In respect of domestic demand, private investment grew at a slower pace mainly

 because raw material shortfalls resulted in an extension of equipment delivery time,

3


-----

###### while labor shortage and inventory adjustments as well as a cautious economic outlook

 prompted some firms to postpone capital expenditure plans. The Bank expected private

 investment to still post steady growth this year and slower growth next year. 

 In terms of private consumption, growth momentum strengthened, as an abated

 domestic pandemic and the government’s domestic tourism stimulus measures

 encouraged consumers to spend and travel. The Bank projected private consumption

 growth to be mild this year and to gather pace next year. 

 With the pandemic’s impact diminishing at home, the number of employed persons

 increased by 0.29% year on year in July. The unemployment rate rose to 3.78% in July

 owing to seasonal factors, but the seasonally-adjusted figure was 3.68%, declining to

 the level before the domestic COVID-19 resurgence in April this year. This also showed

 that labor market conditions were picking up. 

 Overall, while the previous pandemic impacts had eased, the global economy could

 increasingly face greater downside risks, and domestic firms were conservative about

 the economic outlook. In this view, the Bank revised the GDP growth rate forecasts to

 3.51% this year and 2.90% next year. The growth projections by major institutions

 ranged between 2.60% and 3.81% for this year and between 1.90% and 3.41% for next

 year. 

 (2) Financial conditions 

 Domestic long and short-term interest rates went upwards as the Bank’s hikes in

 policy rates and the reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) took effect in June and July,

 respectively. As for excess reserves, the total amount as held by all banks stood at a

 level over NT$60 billion in recent months. 

 In July, short-term market rates and bank deposit rates both rose by more than 0.125

 percentage points – the size of the June hike in policy rates, a testament of direct

 transmission from the policy rate hike to the market. 

 Bank loans and investments had gradually slowed month by month to an annual

 growth rate of 6.55% in July, mainly because of an increase in government tax revenue,

 government repaying the borrowings, and banks scaling back investments owing to

 funding needs and foreign capital outflows. The annual growth rate edged up in August,

4


-----

###### though, buoyed by greater demand of government enterprises for funding. In terms of

 money supply, reflecting the slowdown in bank loans and investments and a year-on
 year increase of foreign capital outflows, as well as the Bank’s hikes of policy rates and

 the RRRs, the M2 annual growth rate had trended downwards since May this year, with

 the pace of growth averaging 7.66% for the first eight months of the year. 

 In the housing market, trading had moderated in the year so far. During the period

 of January to July, the total number of building ownership transfers nationwide

 decreased by 1.64% compared to the same period last year, while that number for the

 six Special Municipalities nudged up by 0.2% for the first eight months of year.

 Construction costs for newly-built homes continued climbing but at a slower pace.

 Prices of new housing units were trending up, reflecting the rise in national Urban Land

 Price Index (compiled by the Ministry of the Interior) in March 2022. The price indices

 for existing homes and new housing projects rose further by 14.77% and 34.72% in the

 second quarter of the year. Meanwhile, affected by the domestic pandemic resurgence

 and the Bank’s policy measures, recent sentiment-related data showed that builders and

 real estate businesses turned cautious about the housing market outlook, while banks

 became less optimistic about the outlook of residential housing in major cities.

 As of the end of July 2022, the annual growth rates of real estate lending, housing

 loans, and construction loans edged down to 9.46%, 8.64%, and 12.53%, respectively.

 Real estate loans as a share of total loans slightly shrank to 37.07% from the 37.16%

 registered at the end of last year. Meanwhile, the construction loan ratio of domestic

 banks was 27.05%, still below the 30% cap prescribed in Article 72-2 of the Banking

 Act.[2] The ratio of non-performing housing loans extended by domestic banks remained

 low at 0.08%. 

 Since the Bank deployed selective credit control measures by making four

 amendments to relevant regulations from December 2020 onwards, banks’ loan

 portfolio concentration in the real estate sector had kept steady, which was conducive to

 bank credit risk management. The Bank’s tightening stance since March 2022 was also

2 According to Article 72-2 of the Banking Act, the total amount of loans extended for residential construction

and construction for business purposes by a Commercial Bank shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the
aggregate of such Commercial Bank's deposits and Bank Debentures issued at the time such loans is extended.

-----

###### judged to amplify the effectiveness of selective credit controls. In addition, housing

 market trading had started to slacken since the beginning of the year as a result of the

 concerted efforts under the government’s Healthy Real Estate Market Plan as well as

 the pandemic’s impact; given time, more results of the policy efforts are expected to

 show. 

 (3) Price trends 

 In the year to date, Taiwan had suffered considerable pressures of imported

 inflation owing to global supply chain bottlenecks and the Russia-Ukraine war pushing

 up international grain and energy prices. More recently, though, as international raw

 material prices softened and domestic food price rises were also slowed by declines in

 vegetable prices, the annual growth rate of the consumer price index (CPI) dropped from

 3.36% in July to 2.66% in August and that of the core CPI edged down to 2.73%. 

 For the first eight months of the year, the annual CPI growth rate averaged 3.10%,

 mainly owing to rising prices for food, fuel and lubricants, consumer durables, and

 residential rent. As there was a more marked increase in prices of staples with a higher

 purchase frequency, consumers tended to be more conscious of upward price trends.

 Recent data on multiple inflation-related indicators all pointed to a prospective ease

 in domestic inflationary pressures. Spot crude oil prices already dropped from previous

 highs and would likely trend down steadily in the future, while international commodity

 futures also saw price corrections. The import price index and the producer price index

 also gradually came down. As for the NT dollar depreciation’s impact on domestic price

 trends, it remained within manageable range: If the NTD-USD exchange rate came from

 the 2021 average of 28.02 to the estimated 2022 average of 29.5 (representing a

 depreciation of 5.02%), this year’s CPI annual growth rate would rise by 0.12 - 0.25

 percentage points; if the exchange rate came to 30 (a depreciation of 6.60%), the effect

 on the CPI annual growth rate would edge up to a rise by 0.16 - 0.33 percentage points. 

 Given the decline in international raw material prices and a higher base effect, the

 annual CPI growth rate was expected to gradually come down from the third quarter of

 the year onwards. Looking ahead to next year, as global supply chain bottlenecks ease,

 global freight rates trend low, and international raw material prices continue with a

6


-----

###### downswing, domestic inflation would likely decrease to below 2%. The Bank forecasted

 the annual growth rate of the CPI and the core CPI to register 2.95% and 2.52% for 2022

 and to decline to 1.88% and 1.87% for 2023. Projections for Taiwan’s annual CPI

 growth rate made by major forecasting institutions ranged between 2.85% and 3.30%

 for 2022 and between 1.30% and 2.40% for 2023, with the forecast average below 2%

 for next year. 

 Looking ahead, upside pressures for domestic prices could arise from (1)

 downward price stickiness (i.e., “easy to rise but hard to fall”) in some items of the

 services category, including food away from home and residential rent; (2) the easing of

 border controls leading to hikes in airfares and travel group fees; (3) greater demand for

 domestic travel as concerns over pandemic waves diminished, and the resulting rise in

 prices for hotels and accommodation; (4) the planned hike of minimum wages next year.

 On the other hand, downside pressures could come from (1) an expected softening of

 crude oil and other raw material prices in the second half of the year; (2) lower

 international freight rates as supply chain bottlenecks ease; (3) telecom operators cutting

 prices of mobile phones and other communication devices amid intense competition. 

 Since the beginning of this year, the U.S., Europe, and some Asia-Pacific

 economies had aggressively raised their policy rates to tame relatively higher

 inflationary pressures. Taiwan’s price uptrends were similar to Japan and China; the

 Bank of Japan maintained an accommodative monetary policy stance and China’s

 central bank even reduced policy rates, whereas the Bank continued with a tightening

 stance with gradual rate hikes. 

 3. Considerations for Monetary Policy

 Major considerations: 

 (1) The domestic inflation rate is likely to gradually come down in the second half of the

 year, but could still register above 2% for the year as a whole before declining to below

 2% next year. 

 (2) The domestic economy is expected to see growth moderating to a pace slower than

 3% next year. 

7


-----

###### Primary causes for moderations in domestic inflation and in economic growth:

 (1) Spillover effects from the global economic downturn and tight financial conditions: 

 As major economies including the U.S. and Europe take big steps in monetary

 tightening and global financial conditions become tighter, global economic growth is

 expected to slow in 2022 and 2023 and faces heightened downside risk. As a small

 open economy, Taiwan could be impacted by spillover effects via the following three

 channels: 

 A. The real economy: With global final demand weakening, Taiwan’s exports have

 seen slower growth in recent months and private investment has turned

 conservative. The domestic GDP growth rate is projected by the Bank to slow to

 below 3% next year, which would also take some heat off domestic inflation. 

 B. Prices: Global economic slowdown, declines in crude oil and other raw material

 prices on tepid demand, and lower international freight rates on the easing of global

 supply chain bottlenecks would combine to help mitigate pressures from imported

 inflation. 

 C. Finance: As the Fed continues with rate hikes and global stock markets slump on

 concern about a global recession, Taiwan’s stock markets would experience more

 volatile downswings along with massive foreign capital outflows, and domestic

 financial conditions could tighten further. 

 (2) The government’s continued efforts to implement supply-side measures in response

 to fluctuations in energy and food prices, providing substantial support for sustaining

 overall price stability: 

 A. Continued adjustments, as seen needed, of the tariff reduction measures, including

 commodity taxes on gasoline, diesel, and cement, and tariffs on beef, formula milk,

 butter, and wheat; an extension of business tax exemption on imported soybeans,

 wheat, and corns. 

 B. A freeze on electricity tariff adjustments for the second half of the year, as per the

 resolution of the government’s review committee for electricity tariffs.  

8


-----

###### (3) The Bank’s approach of simultaneously affecting price (interest rate) and quantity

 (money stock) with hikes in both the policy rates and the RRRs, helping to rein in

 domestic inflation expectations: 

 A. Reflecting the policy rate hikes, long and short-term market rates have gone

 upwards and financial conditions have broadly tightened. 

 B. The RRR increase is expected to reinforce money and credit management and slow

 down monetary growth: As banks are required to set aside more reserves, their

 credit creation capacity would be restrained, helping to keep M2 growth at an

 appropriate pace. In recent months, the annual growth rate of M2 has declined,

 with the rate averaging 7.66% for the first eight months of the year – still higher

 than the 6.5% upper threshold of the Bank’s reference range. If the RRRs are to be

 raised further in the future, M2 growth would likely soften more markedly, which

 could amplify the effect of denting inflation expectations. 

 II. Proposition and Decision about Monetary Policy 

 1. Policy Propositions: To raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured

 loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points to

 1.625%, 2%, and 3.875%, respectively; and to increase the reserve requirement

 ratios on NT dollar demand deposits and time (savings) deposits by 0.25

 percentage points, respectively. 

 2. Board members decided to raise the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points each

 and reached a unanimous vote to increase the reserve requirement ratios on NT

 dollar demand deposits and time (savings) deposits by 0.25 percentage points.

 Related discussions are summarized as follows.

 (1) Discussions on today’s monetary policy propositions

 One board director stated that inflation has become a challenge to central banks

 around the world, with all major economies except Japan and China commencing a

 monetary tightening cycle. However, the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes could heighten the

 risk of a hard landing and further roil the financial markets. By contrast, Taiwan does

9


-----

###### not need to move at such a drastic pace. Meanwhile, the domestic economic growth

 would moderate this year and likely to slow further next year. The six-month outlook

 sub-index data under the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) and the

 Non-Manufacturing PMI have in recent months dropped below 50 in the contraction

 territory, and export growth momentum has also weakened considerably. The inflation

 rate has turned from upswings in the first half of 2022 to a gradual downtrend since July

 and is expected to ease to below 2%, which is within the Bank’s tolerance range. If the

 Bank hikes too fast, corporates and households would experience greater hardship as

 they face higher borrowing costs and consumers would also feel the pain; it is therefore

 not appropriate to have steep policy rate hikes. In the meantime, raising the reserve

 requirement ratios (RRRs) would reduce market liquidity and rein in upside price

 pressures. In this view, the board director was in favor of a 0.125 percentage point rate

 hike and a 0.25 percentage point RRR increase.

 One board director also supported the propositions that would simultaneously

 affect interest rates and money stock. The director, who had previously worried that the

 June RRR increase might have taken a heavy toll on banks’ excess reserves and hit

 money supply as well as market interest rates, pointed out that excess reserves actually

 expanded in recent months. However, this was not due to ineffectiveness of the ratio

 increase policy but rather because the effect was offset by other factors, including the

 existing tendency for banks to keep excess reserves at high levels, the uneven

 distribution of excess reserves among foreign and domestic banks who also react

 differently to such ratio adjustments, the volume of certificates of deposits (CD) issued

 by the Bank, stock market turbulence and foreign capital flows, etc. Considering that

 the RRR policy tool is still relevant and that it is not frequently put to use, it is important

 to explore in depth how and how well the tool works. 

 One board director noted that as the RRR increase has the effect of reducing money

 stock, the Bank’s CD issuance would naturally decrease on less strong bank demand for

 liquidity; the issuance decrease and the ratio hike do not contradict each other.

 Furthermore, though in theory a “quantity” policy tool’s effect on “price” would take

 some time to show, it has been observed that in recent months money market rates rose

 significantly in increments larger than the Bank’s policy rate hike, and corporate bond

10


-----

###### yields also climbed swiftly and steeply; this mainly reflected three other factors with

 similar impacts on liquidity, namely foreign capital outflows, the RRR increase, and the

 tax season. The Bank has continued studying the channels and effects of reserve

 requirement ratio hikes. Preliminary findings show that such a policy has a greater effect

 on M2; when compared with a policy rate hike, a reserve requirement ratio increase

 exerts a more pronounced effect on CPI but a smaller effect on GDP. 

 Another board director also stated that an RRR increase could potentially bring

 about a greater effect than a policy rate hike. Such a policy tool tends to affect excess

 reserves of the banking sector on the whole; that kind of extensive reach could be one

 of the reasons why this policy tool has been rarely deployed among Western central

 banks. Moreover, the fact that domestic short-term market rates have risen much more

 than the size of recent policy rate hikes also demonstrated that the RRR increase had

 exerted a greater effect than the policy rate hike. On another front, policy rate hikes

 would directly affect banks’ interest rates on deposits and loans, which would

 significantly hit first-time homebuyers, while RRR hikes affect market interest rates and

 push up short-term funding costs of corporates, who generally have greater capacity

 (than first-time homebuyers) to withstand rising costs of funding. Therefore, it seems

 the appropriate approach to take the middle course by raising the policy rates by 0.125

 percentage points and the RRRs by 0.25 percentage points. In this view, this director

 supported a 0.125 percentage point hike in policy rates accompanied by a 0.25

 percentage point hike in RRRs.

 One board director agreed with a 0.25 percentage point hike in RRRs but favored

 a 0.25 percentage point hike in policy rates, based on the following reasons. First, the

 current conditions of and outlooks for domestic job market and economic growth were

 steady, with the probability of Taiwan entering a recession in the next quarter lower than

 50%. Second, while the annual growth rate of CPI declined in August, that of core CPI

 remained elevated. Foreign research work shows that inflation expectations need to be

 anchored at a lower level in order to prevent inflation from being persistently high. With

 domestic staple goods still posting sizable rises and affecting consumer sentiment,

 policy rates should be raised at a more aggressive pace, even by 0.25 percentage points

 in one move. This would help anchor inflation expectations at a lower level with an

11


-----

###### inflation-fighting message, thereby boosting monetary policy credibility. 

 One board director stated that the Bank needs to review how it kept underestimating

 the rise in inflation in the course of more than one year. It was not until March this year

 did the Bank recognize the risk of rising inflation and raise the policy rates by 0.25

 percentage points. Later, even as domestic inflation got increasingly higher, the Bank

 only devised a 0.125 percentage point rate hike, along with an RRR hike by 0.25

 percentage points. That was in stark contrast with many other central banks, with the

 policy actions repeating a previous pattern of small-step hikes of 0.125 percentage

 points. While domestic inflation showed signs of moderation recently, it would be too

 sanguine to conclude that it has embarked on a downtrend. International energy and food

 prices are highly likely to go up again and domestic price gains have become entrenched

 in a wide range of goods, particularly food items, which would keep inflation

 expectations from softening any time soon. In addition, government measures to hold

 prices of some goods steady and the fact that residential rent, one of the CPI components,

 seemed insufficiently represented implied that Taiwan’s inflationary pressures could

 have far exceeded the published statistical data; in other words, had the housing costs

 been truthfully reflected in the CPI data and/or the price stabilization measures

 withdrawn, Taiwan’s inflation data would see a significant upward revision. Therefore,

 the Bank cannot be content with inflation being relatively mild, nor let the guard down

 seeing signs of inflation moderating. Moreover, a protracted low interest rate

 environment at home has led to chronic ailments in the macro-economy and the financial

 sector. Therefore, today’s proposition of a 0.125 percentage point hike in policy rates

 would not help to rein in inflation and inflation expectations. Furthermore, the interest

 rate differential between Taiwan and the U.S. will continue to widen, exerting

 depreciation pressures on the NT dollar and worsening imported inflation. 

 One board director pointed out that in recent months the Bank’s inflation forecasts

 had sometimes overshot and sometimes undershot the actual figures, indicating little

 evidence of a “systemic underestimation.” The Bank bases its inflation forecasts on the

 latest available information about domestic and foreign economic and financial

 conditions, whereas unexpected critical exogenous shocks make forecasting more

 challenging as it is difficult for them to be captured through models or expert analysis,

12


-----

###### which could lead to forecasting errors. Since the start of this year, given a series of

 unexpected exogenous shocks overseas, including pandemic-induced supply chain

 bottlenecks, the Russia-Ukraine war, and China’s pandemic-related lockdowns, the

 Bank had upgraded its inflation forecasts for 2022, as did the central banks of several

 major economies. As for the NT dollar, the main factor driving down its value against

 the US dollar in the year to date would be large foreign capital outflows: As the Fed’s

 aggressive rate hikes to tame high inflation had led US stock markets to plummet and

 dragged down Taiwan’s stock indices, foreign investors looking for global asset re
 allocation therefore off-loaded their shares to lock in profits and transferred the gains

 out of Taiwan. In addition, since a large proportion of foreign capital inflows usually

 goes into the stock markets, the interest rate differential does not play a major role in

 their investment decisions. The view that a widening Taiwan-U.S. differential caused

 capital outflows and weakened the NT dollar is not true to the actual conditions in

 Taiwan’s financial markets. 

 One board director noted that despite the appearance of steady economic

 expansion, non-farm real regular earnings continued to post negative growth, reflecting

 that inflation still imposed a hefty impact. Also, rises in prices of the top 17 staple goods

 and of the items purchased at least once a month both significantly outpaced the rise in

 headline inflation, indicating that lower-income households would be more exposed to

 the strains from inflation. In addition, housing prices in all areas registered double-digit

 growth year on year in the second quarter, and housing price rises could feed into rents;

 among the CPI components, residential rent rises, which are often sticky and lasting,

 represent marked inflationary pressures. Therefore, it is important to contemplate how

 monetary policy may help to anchor inflation expectations at a lower level. Given the

 ongoing inflationary pressures, and taking into account the feed-through from

 continuous housing price rises to rents and then to inflation, it would be in line with the

 important objective of price stability to raise the policy rates by 0.25 percentage points.

 Furthermore, a policy rate hike – whatever the size – sends a clear message of tightening

 to the public, whereas an RRR increase, albeit also a tightening move, would seem less

 straightforward data-wise and its effect would take some time to show; in this view, an

 RRR increase cannot replace a policy rate hike in terms of clearly sounding an inflation
13


-----

###### fighting message to rein in expectations.

 Another board director expressed the view that a 0.125 percentage point rate hike

 was rather mild. With international sea transport gridlock thawing and global energy

 prices softening, domestic inflationary pressures would likely ease. Against this

 background, while considering potential impact on homebuyers’ interest burden, the

 director supported the 0.125 percentage point hike in policy rates. Regarding the RRR

 increase proposition, given that the M2 annual growth rate remained above the upper

 limit (6.5%) of the Bank’s reference range, the director also agreed with a 0.25

 percentage point RRR hike. 

 Another board director showing support for the two propositions also pointed out

 the following. Ocean freight rates pushed up by the pandemic have come down. While

 Ukrainian grain exports hampered by the war have been easing somewhat, many of their

 crop areas were no longer arable; combined with adverse weather conditions (such as

 droughts) in other major food commodity exporters, feed prices remained elevated,

 which could affect domestic prices of eggs and meat and impact the CPI trends. Under

 the circumstances, a policy rate hike would somewhat relieve household burdens

 associated with rising food prices; on the other hand, it could add to funding costs for

 housing and credit loans, hence the need to take into account the potential influences of

 policy rate hikes in terms of the size. 

 One board director, in favor of both of the propositions, stated that despite steady

 economic growth, the National Development Council’s Monitoring Indicator had in

 recent months descended to the lower threshold of the “stable” signal range, the Leading

 Indicators had trended further downwards, and exports had also showed signs of

 weakening. While Taiwan’s inflation was mild relative to other major economies, it was

 partly sustained by tariff and tax control measures aiming at restraining raw material

 prices. If the war in Ukraine rages on and extreme weather conditions lack

 improvements, domestic inflation might not see meaningful declines; continued

 monitoring should be warranted. The director gave the reason for supporting a 0.125

 percentage point rate hike, citing the consideration that higher policy rates affect the

 entire economy instead of specific segments, including posing an impact on borrowers’

 interest payments. Still, the director recognized the importance to convey the Bank’s

14


-----

###### tightening stance. The RRR increase by 0.25 percentage point would affect money stock

 with a powerful punch. In order to help anchor inflation expectations at a lower level,

 the Bank should communicate its stance in a clear and unequivocal way. 

 One board director pointed out the relatively lower inflation in Taiwan was mainly

 due to government efforts to reduce tariff and commodity tax rates and keep down

 electricity and oil prices through state-owned businesses, both of which were temporary

 measures. The director did not see the inflation rate to decline to below 2% in the second

 half of 2022 and in the year of 2023. Against a background of bold rate hikes by major

 central banks and a projected domestic inflation rate of nearly 3%, the fact that the

 Bank’s policy rates were only 0.25 percentage points higher than before the pandemic

 might not favorably affect inflation expectations. As for the RRR increase, it is a tool

 seldom used because it usually strikes hard and fast, but there would be two consecutive

 0.25 percentage point RRR increases in Taiwan after today’s meeting; the Bank needs

 to indicate the actual effects of such a tool on the inflation rate. 

 Another board director pointed to the complex international economic and financial

 conditions recently. Many major central banks continued to raise their policy rates to

 tackle inflation whereas some economies still kept an accommodative monetary policy

 stance or even reduced rates. Being key players in the world, these economies’ policies

 carry a weight on the global economic and financial scenes. At the current juncture,

 international uncertainties remain, the war in Ukraine continues, and the future outlook

 is clouded, therefore the director agreed to a policy hike but at a measured pace. The

 Fed’s aggressive hikes came with a worrying economic outlook; if the U.S. economy

 has a hard landing, then Taiwan could, in the following six months, sustain injury in

 many aspects including investment, consumption, and exports, a consideration that

 warranted the director’s support for a 0.125 percentage point rate hike. As for the

 proposed RRR increase by 0.25 percentage points, it would not bring about too much a

 hit given the enormous scale of Taiwan’s excess reserves now. 

 (2) Discussions on housing prices, residential rent, and consumer price measurement

 One board director noted that although tax policies may be the most effective tool

 to tamp down housing prices, as repeatedly stressed by the Bank and supported by some

15

###### researches, this does not keep monetary authorities on the sidelines when housing prices

 continue to surge. For the Bank to safeguard financial stability, it needs to take policy

 actions in response to housing price changes. For instance, according to some

 economists at the Bank for International Settlements, housing prices in South Korea

 have dropped significantly since its central bank began a series of rate hikes last year.

 By contrast, it is wrong when the Bank pays great attention to indicators like housing

 credit growth and concentration but not enough emphasis on price changes. 

 Another board director pointed out that information on housing price trends are

 reflected in the Bank’s publications, internal reports, quarterly Board Meeting reference

 materials, etc., indicating that the Bank has been keeping close watch. Indicators such

 as housing credit growth and concentration would reveal the trends in housing prices

 and housing market trading. Moreover, though being closely watched by the Bank,

 housing prices as an indicator does not in itself necessitate a systemic policy response.

 Indeed, housing prices has a role in financial stability but it is also affected by many

 factors. The Bank’s response measures were meant to stem market speculation and

 prevent credit resources from gushing into the real estate sector. When housing prices

 are bolstered by economic fundamentals, the ensuing price rises would not be interfered

 with unless financial stability becomes compromised. The Bank tackles housing market

 risks with selective credit control measures. The primary purpose of a policy rate hike

 is to combat inflation, with concomitant effects on housing prices; this is the same in the

 cases of rate hike decisions by other economies (including the U.S., South Korea, the

 U.K., and the euro area) as they aim at high inflation instead of housing prices. 

 Another board director remarked that with domestic housing prices going higher in

 the second quarter this year, today’s rate hike would also help put the brakes on those

 price rises. In addition, since the Bank had already sent out messages of beginning a rate

 hike cycle, gradual hikes should not markedly increase mortgage borrowers’ burdens

 while still conveying the Bank’s gradual tightening stance. 

 Two board directors remarked on housing prices, rent, and CPI measurement. One

 of them suggested that costs of housing should be reflected in the CPI statistics; the other

 cited examples of other central banks: The Fed chairman showed concerns about how

 rising home prices could lead to rent rises and thus push up inflation; the ECB had

16


-----

###### several years ago contemplated incorporating owner-occupied housing (OOH) prices in

 the CPI. Though such a concept has not been adopted in the official CPI program, it

 indicates the kind of thought given to OOH prices – in addition to rent – in that their

 increases may have a potential effect on the CPI. 

 One supervisor stated that according to the DGBAS, who is responsible for CPI

 statistics compilation in Taiwan, residential rent has a weight of about 15%, while the

 U.S. assigns a higher weight to rent (above 30%) and the sample of housing units are

 for urban U.S. Across many countries, data show that housing prices have posted larger

 increases than rents. When home prices go up, prospective purchases would take into

 account buyers’ income and affordability, whereas rent surveys for CPI statistics reflect

 only the price factor. The international norm for CPI compilation is to seek to reflect the

 change in the cost of buying a fixed basket of goods and services of constant quality,

 whereas changes (such as improvements) in the quality or rises in the prices of a home

 property are not included in the CPI measurement. And the CPI data compiled by the

 DGBAS only measure the changes in residential rent, but not housing prices. Recently,

 residential rent seemed to be trending upwards, and that uptrend was indicated by the

 DGBAS’ CPI data using a compilation approach in line with the international principles.

 Regarding the previously mentioned idea of incorporating housing prices into CPI

 compilation, the supervisor noted that this was simply one of the suggestions once

 floated by the ECB, and currently there are no countries directly including housing

 prices in their CPI measurement. 

 One board director noted that the DGBAS is Taiwan’s CPI compiler and follows

 the international principles; the institution’s authority and efforts deserve respect. Most

 countries, including the U.S. and Japan, use the “rental equivalence” approach; their rent

 is generally less susceptible to housing price changes, showing a more stable trend with

 little deviation from the CPI. This is also the case for Taiwan. 

 3. Monetary Policy Decision: 

 On Proposition 1, the board directors decided to raise the discount rate, the rate on

 refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125

 percentage points to 1.625%, 2%, and 3.875%, respectively.

##### Press Release  September 22, 2022

 Monetary Policy Decision of the Board Meeting (2022Q3)

###### I. Global economic and financial conditions

 Since the Board met in June this year, growth in the US, the euro area, and China

 has moderated, prices of commodities such as international crude oil have trended

 downward, and global supply chain bottlenecks have gradually eased, whereas

 global inflation remains at high levels. With most economies including the US and

 the European economies continuing with policy rate hikes, leading to a tightening

 of financial conditions, growth momentum for the global economy is expected to

 soften and international institutions have downgraded their forecasts for the 2022

 global economic growth. Meanwhile, recent developments in US inflation and the

 Fed's monetary policy stance have sparked a drastic increase in volatility in

 international financial markets. The US dollar has strengthened, with the

 international US Dollar Index reaching a 20-year high and major economies'

 currencies all depreciating against the US dollar.

 Looking ahead, the global economy faces multiple downside risks, including the

 following: (1) aggressive monetary policy tightening by the US and the European

 economies inducing tighter international financial conditions, which could weigh

 on global economic activity; (2) the energy crisis fueled by the ongoing Russia
 Ukraine war dragging down economic growth in Europe; (3) China's zero-COVID

 policy affecting the easing of global supply chain bottlenecks and its real estate

 troubles undermining financial stability. In addition, geopolitical risks, extreme

 weather events, and the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic would also add to

 uncertainties surrounding the global economic and financial outlooks.

 International institutions project global economic growth to moderate further and

 inflation to fall back down in the year 2023. 

 II. Domestic economic and financial conditions

 1. Since around the middle of the year, domestic private consumption has rebounded

 on the stabilized pandemic situation at home. On the other hand, faltering final

 demand amid a slowing global economic expansion and the ensuing inventory

 adjustment by some firms have exerted a drag on Taiwan's export growth and

 private investment. The Bank trims its forecast for the economic growth this year

 to 3.51% (Appendix Table 1). 

19


-----

###### The pandemic's impact on the labor market has waned. The July 2022 figures

 showed that the number of employed persons increased by 0.29% year on year; the

 unemployment rate rose to 3.78% owing to seasonal factors but the seasonally
 adjusted rate came in at 3.68%, returning to the level before the domestic COVID
 19 flare-up in April this year. 

 Looking ahead to next year, employment and wage growth are likely to benefit

 from the recovery in domestically-oriented services sector, helping to extend the

 uptrend in private consumption. Meanwhile, the global economic moderation

 could dampen growth momentum for Taiwan's exports and private investment. For

 the year 2023, the Bank forecasts the economy to expand by 2.90%. 

 2. In recent months, domestic inflation eased on account of the decline in

 international crude oil and grain prices and local vegetable prices. The annual

 growth rate of consumer price index (CPI) dropped to 2.66% in August and that of

 core CPI (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items) edged down to 2.73%. For

 the first eight months, the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates averaged 3.10%

 and 2.49%, respectively. Given the softening in international raw material prices

 and the effect of a higher comparison base, the Bank expects the domestic inflation

 rate to gradually come down, with the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates at

 2.95% and 2.52%, respectively, for this year (Appendix Table 2).

 Looking ahead to next year, global supply chain bottlenecks would likely be

 gradually alleviated and international institutions mostly anticipate a price

 downtrend for crude oil and other raw materials. The Bank projects the CPI and

 core CPI annual growth rates to drop to 1.88% and 1.87%, respectively, in 2023. 

 3. Banks' excess reserves hovered slightly above NT$60 billion recently. For the first

 eight months of the year, the annual growth rate of bank loans and investments and

 that of M2 (measured on a daily average basis) were 7.77% and 7.66%,

 respectively. Short- and long-term market interest rates rose higher following the

 Bank's monetary tightening this year.

 III. Monetary policy decisions: Raising the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points and

 raising the reserve requirement ratios by 0.25 percentage points

 In today's meeting, the Board considered the following developments in domestic

 and foreign economic and financial conditions. Given the recent international

 commodity price decline, the domestic inflation rate is expected to come down

20


-----

###### gradually in the second half of the year, while registering above 2% for the year as

 a whole before dropping below 2% next year. Moreover, with a slowing global

 economy compounded by greater downside risk in the second half of the year

 through to next year, it is expected that the domestic economic growth momentum

 would weaken next year. The Board judged that, by continuing with policy rate

 hikes while also raising the reserve requirement ratios, it would help rein in

 domestic inflation expectations, maintain price stability, and help attain the policy

 objectives of fostering sound economic and financial development. 

 At the meeting today, the Board decided to raise the discount rate, the rate on

 refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125

 percentage points each to 1.625%, 2%, and 3.875%, respectively, effective

 September 23, 2022.

 The Board also decided to increase the reserve requirement ratios on NT dollar

 demand deposits and time (savings) deposits by 0.25 percentage points each (see

 Appendix for the requirements by type of deposits), effective October 1, 2022. 

 Against a backdrop of elevated inflationary pressures and intensified headwinds

 facing the global economy, the Bank will closely monitor the implications for

 domestic price trends brought forth by international raw material price movements,

 geopolitical risks, extreme weather events, and the course of the pandemic

 worldwide, while also paying close attention to the trajectory of monetary policy

 tightening in major economies and the effects therefrom on economic and financial

 conditions at home and abroad. The Bank may adjust its monetary policy

 accordingly in a timely manner as warranted, so as to fulfill the statutory duties of

 maintaining financial and price stability, and fostering economic development

 within the scope of the above objectives. 

 IV. The Bank's selective credit control measures, implemented with four successive

 amendments from December 2020, have so far successfully bolstered credit risk

 management of the banking sector. In the year so far, banks' construction and

 housing loans have expanded at a slower pace, real estate loan concentration has

 been broadly steady, and the level of non-performing loan ratio for real estate

 lending has been low. The effectiveness of the existing credit controls would also

 have been amplified by the Bank's monetary policy tightening. In addition, housing

 market transactions have been dampened somewhat in the year to date as a result of

 the government's cross-agency efforts under the Healthy Real Estate Market Plan

21


-----

###### and the pandemic flare-up in recent months. The Bank will actively keep track of

 the developments in real estate lending and continue to review the implementation

 of the selective credit control measures, and make adjustments as needed in order to

 promote financial stability.    

 V. While the currencies of major economies and the NT dollar have all depreciated

 against the US dollar so far this year, the NT dollar exchange rate has experienced

 comparatively less volatility. The Bank will keep close watch on international

 financial conditions and the trends of cross-border capital flows. In the event of

 excess volatility and disorderly movements in the NT dollar exchange rate with

 adverse implications for economic and financial stability, the Bank, in line with its

 statutory mandates, will step in to maintain an orderly market.
