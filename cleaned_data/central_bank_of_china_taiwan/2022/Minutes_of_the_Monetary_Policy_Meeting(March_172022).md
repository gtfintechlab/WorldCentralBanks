##### AGENDA: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND

 MONETARY POLICY DECISION

 I. Staff Review of Economic and Financial Conditions 

###### 1. International Economic and Financial Conditions

 At the beginning of the year (2022), the global economic recovery continued, and

 supply chain bottlenecks slightly eased but remained unresolved. Then, the Russian

 invasion of Ukraine in late February prompted major economies to impose sanctions

 against Russia, disrupting global economic activity, stoking the prices of energy, metal,

 and grains, and riling financial markets. 

 For the outlook of this year, the Russia-Ukraine war, surging commodity prices,

 persistent supply chain bottlenecks, and the tapering of fiscal and monetary stimuli could

 all weigh on the global economy. In this view, international institutions recently

 downgraded their forecasts for the 2022 global economic growth. 

 Global trade was also forecasted by international institutions to grow slower in

 2022 than in 2021 as the WTO Goods Trade Barometer slid deeper this year so far. The

 recent Russia-Ukraine conflict and the ensuing sanctions on Russia risk further

 disrupting global trade growth. 

 For the year to date, oil prices soared on geopolitical tensions in the Middle East

 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. More recently, though, possible demand slowdown

 from a COVID-19 flare-up in China and the Russia-Ukraine peace talks sent oil prices

 lower. For the year as a whole, international institutions projected oil prices to be higher

 than the previous year. Grain and metal prices also rose markedly as the Ukraine war

 and the sanctions on Russia hampered the supply and exportation of grains and base

 metals. 

 Unabated supply-demand imbalance owing to supply chain bottlenecks and the

 Ukraine war-induced price surges amid disrupted supply and exportation of raw

 materials exerted heavy pressures on global inflation, leading international institutions

 to revise this year’s global inflation forecasts upwards. 

 Since the Board last met in December 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) and

2


-----

###### the Bank of England had announced rate hikes, the European Central Bank (ECB) was

 likely to end its bond buying program in the third quarter of the 2022, while Japan’s and

 China’s central banks maintained a broadly loose monetary policy stance. 

 In the recent month, the 10-year government bond yields of the U.S. and Germany

 both rebounded as investors expected the Fed and the ECB to exit monetary easing.

 Global stock markets fluctuated downwards from a previous high after the Fed signaled

 a policy tightening. Then, stock markets took another hit as Russia invaded Ukraine in

 late February and faced a growing array of sanctions from major countries. In the foreign

 exchange market, the US dollar index trended up as investors expecting a faster rate hike

 cycle of the Fed turned to US dollar assets. Then, intensifying conflicts in Ukraine

 pushed up hedging demand and led the US dollar index to rise sharply and fluctuate at

 elevated levels. 

 Looking ahead, the global economy is confronted by multiple downside risks,

 including: (1) risks from geopolitical and military conflicts could escalate and impair

 global economic activity; (2) soaring raw material prices and tight labor market

 conditions could cause inflation to stay high; (3) the pace of major economies’ monetary

 policy normalization could be interrupted or disrupted, and financial market volatility

 could heighten; (4) new coronavirus variants could harm health and climate change

 could cause a global food crisis. These risks, should they materialize, will hinder global

 economic growth and jeopardize financial stability.

 2. Domestic Economic and Financial Conditions

 (1) Economic situation

 The easing of the domestic pandemic-related restrictions and continued export

 strength gave a further boost to economic activity, and firms were optimistic about the

 outlook in the coming six months. 

 In terms of external demand, emerging technology application and traditional

 manufacture continued enjoying strong demand, leading exports of major products and

 exports to major trading partners to expand by more than 10% for the year to date.

 Looking ahead, the Bank expected Taiwan’s export to register solid growth this year,

3

###### benefiting from growing business opportunities of products for digital transformation

 and emerging technology application, as well as firms increasing production capacity. 

 With respect to internal demand, private investment was expected to sustain growth

 with tech firms increasing capital outlay, major investment projects – such as green

 energy and government-supported infrastructure development – moving along, and

 maritime and air transporters procuring new equipment. Private consumption was also

 expected to pick up against a backdrop of stable COVID-19 situation at home, and other

 favorable factors including pay rises for public sector employees and base wage hike

 and improved prospects for listed companies to pay dividends thanks to healthy profits

 the previous year. 

 Since the second half of 2021, labor market conditions had gradually returned to

 the level before the May 2021 domestic COVID-19 flare-up; as the outbreak was

 contained and economic activity rebounded, the unemployment rate continued to fall

 and employment kept rising month by month. The nominal average regular earnings of

 all non-farm employees increased moderately. In particular, the harder-hit services

 sector saw a gradual rebound in wages and this sector’s real GDP also resumed growth

 thanks to improved domestic pandemic situation. These developments showed that

 recoveries across various sectors have become less uneven. 

 Overall, sustained growth in exports and private investment and reinvigorating

 private consumption were likely to help uphold stable economic growth momentum for

 the year despite a higher base effect and potential impact from the Ukraine war. The

 Bank projected Taiwan’s economy to expand by 4.05% this year, while the growth

 projections by major institutions ranged between 3.11% and 4.42%.

 (2) Financial conditions 

 From February onwards, though financial markets were disturbed by the Russian

 invasion of Ukraine, market liquidity remained ample and short term market rates

 fluctuated within a tight range. 

 Looking at domestic credit and money conditions, in January, government demand

 for funds increased owing to public sector pay raise, payment for year-end bonuses, and

4


-----

###### pandemic relief and subsidies, along with a typical rise in corporate funding demand

 ahead of the Chinese New Year holidays. As a result, the annual growth rate of domestic

 banks’ loans and investments rose, with loans to small and medium-sized enterprises

 (SMEs) also expanding. In terms of the annual growth rate of the monetary aggregate

 M2, though hovering above the 6.5% upper limit of the Bank’s reference range since

 August 2020, it began trending downwards from September 2021 on. 

 In the housing market, the price indices of new housing projects and of existing

 homes both continued rising to all-time highs in the fourth quarter of 2021. The number

 of building ownership transfers in 2021 also hit a record high in nearly eight years with

 348.2 thousand transfers. In the six Special Municipalities, ownership transfers posted

 an average annual growth rate of 0.21% in the first two months of the year. As the

 domestic COVID-19 situation remained subdued, housing transactions and prices both

 increased. Banks maintained positive about the residential housing market outlook,

 albeit with less optimism than previously observed.  

 As of the end of January 2022, the annual growth rates of real estate lending,

 housing loans, and construction loans edged down to 10.23%, 9.42%, and 13.41%,

 respectively. Real estate loan as a share of total loans slightly grew to 36.99%, but still

 lower than a historical high of 37.9% in October 2009. Meanwhile, the ratio of domestic

 banks’ construction loans to their deposits and bank debentures was 26.99%, staying

 below the 30% cap prescribed in Article 72-2 of the Banking Act.[2] The ratio of non
 performing housing loans extended by domestic banks remained low at 0.08%. 

 With a view to preserving financial stability and reinforcing credit risk

 management associated with real estate lending, the Bank implemented and adjusted the

 selective credit control measures with four amendments since December 2020, seeking

 to prevent credit resources from flooding the real estate market. These measures have

 proved effective in mitigating related bank credit risk as the regulated types of real estate

 loans had been granted in compliance with relevant rules and the loan-to-value (LTV)

 ratios thereof were significantly lower than before. 

2 According to Article 72-2 of the Banking Act, the total amount of loans extended for residential construction

and construction for business purposes by a Commercial Bank shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the
aggregate of such Commercial Bank's deposits and Bank Debentures issued at the time such loans is extended.

###### (3) Price trends 

 With a year-to-date global price rally for crude oil and other raw materials and a

 domestic price hike in some food and beverage products, home appliances, and

 automobiles, the annual CPI growth rate was still elevated, exceeding 2% for the seventh

 straight month. 

 For the first two months of the year, the annual CPI growth rate averaged 2.60%,

 reflecting price rises in fuel and lubricant products, food away from home, fruit, durable

 consumer goods, and transportation with a combined contribution of 1.57 percentage

 points to the increase. 

 As consumers tend to be more sensitive about price changes in goods they

 frequently purchase, the recent price hike in some staple goods as well as food and

 beverages amplified consumer sentiment of rising prices. The Bank’s survey for

 inflation expectations found that, compared to the previous quarter, a larger share of

 respondents in the corporate sector and in investment trust companies expected the

 annual CPI growth rate to exceed 2%, mainly because of international raw material price

 rises and domestic price hikes by some firms.  

 The global supply chain bottleneck could persist, and the Ukraine war-induced

 disruptions have pushed up commodity prices such as crude oil, grains, and base metals.

 This would further feed into domestic prices of energy, food, and durable consumer

 goods, adding to inflationary pressures. The Bank expected inflation to still run above

 2% in the first three quarters this year before sliding below 2% in the fourth quarter. For

 this year as a whole, the Bank forecasted the annual growth rates of CPI and core CPI

 to be 2.37% and 1.93%, respectively. Meanwhile, the CPI projections made by

 international institutions ranged between 1.50% and 2.75%.

 Looking ahead, the following factors could create upside price pressures for

 Taiwan: (1) persistent supply chain imbalance and the Russia-Ukraine war significantly

 driving global freight rates and commodity (such as crude oil and grains) prices

 upwards; (2) a proposed hike in the national health insurance copayment fees feeding

 into the prices of healthcare-related items. On the other hand, sources of downside

 pressures included (1) declines in communication devices prices and communications

6


-----

###### rates; (2) the government’s potential reduction of tax rates for commodity tax, customs

 duty, and business tax, helping to mitigate rising cost pressures for firms. 

 3. Considerations for Monetary Policy

 (1) Considerations for the policy rate decision

 A. Taiwan was faced with heavy pressures of imported inflation as Russia’s invasion

 of Ukraine significantly pushed up global commodity prices. The domestic annual

 CPI growth rate had exceeded 2% for several months in a row and this could

 continue into the third quarter of the year. The Bank forecasted this year’s CPI and

 core CPI annual growth rates to be 2.37% and 1.93%, respectively. 

 B. The pandemic-hit domestically-oriented services sector gradually rebounded, and

 labor market conditions steadily resumed the levels before the mid-2021 domestic

 COPVID-19 flare-up. The Bank forecasted this year’s economic growth rate to be

 4.05%. 

 C. Central banks in the U.S. and the U.K. both began policy rate hikes, while the ECB

 announced it would soon end the asset purchases. 

##### II. Proposition and Decision about Monetary Policy 

###### 1. Policy Proposition: To raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured

 loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 25 basis points to 1.375%,

 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively. 

 2. Board members reached a unanimous vote to raise the discount rate, the rate on

 refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 25 basis

 points to 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively. Related discussions are

 summarized as follows.

 (1) Discussion on the policy rate proposition

 One board director noted that the domestic economic growth was relatively stable

 and the economy was projected to expand at a pace faster than 4%. The annual CPI

 growth rate had been above 2% for several consecutive months and would likely stay

7


-----

###### around that level. Meanwhile, given the US Fed’s rate hike decision, the fact that

 domestic interest rates had been held at a relatively low level for some time could

 hamper effective capital allocation. Therefore, raising the policy rates would be an

 appropriate move. In addition, it was expected that a rate hike would have a dampening

 effect on housing price surges. 

 One board director pointed out that for a small open economy like Taiwan, it is

 difficult and unsound for monetary policy to proceed without regard to the moves and

 stances of major central banks, and monetary policy conduct in line with those in major

 economies would be more effective. Meanwhile, the domestic economy fared well, with

 the 2021 economic growth rate much higher than expected and the 2022 economy

 projected to enjoy solid growth. For several months in a row, the CPI inflation rate had

 exceeded 2% and the annual M2 growth rate had overshot the upper limit of the

 reference range amid accommodative liquidity conditions. Therefore, the board director

 supported the 25 basis points (bps) rate hike proposition and noted that the current focus

 for the Bank is not fostering economic growth but addressing the issues of inflation and

 bubbling asset prices. 

 One board director expressed support for the 25 bps rate hike based on assessments

 taking into account of cross-border capital movements and domestic price trends.

 However, this director noted that higher rates would add to the interest payment burdens

 on young people taking out their first housing loans or trading up for bigger homes, a

 potential situation that requires attention and could be taken into account in future policy

 discussions regarding selective credit controls. 

 One board director stated that Taiwan’s economy showed good growth in the last

 three years, whereas imported inflationary pressures caused the CPI inflation rate to

 hover above 2% for several months. The director viewed that the effect of a 25 bps hike

 was less about dampening housing prices than about sending a message. Furthermore,

 despite some results from the four rounds of selective credit controls, housing price

 expectations seemed to be buoyed up by repeated record highs in the past year. Given

 the current economic and financial situation, the director supported a 25 bps rate hike

 and suggested to continue monitoring the Fed’s rate path, global economic

8


-----

###### developments, and domestic price trends while prudently formulating monetary policy. 

 One board director gave the following reasons in favor of a 25 bps rate hike. First,

 the Fed had begun a rate hike cycle. Though inflation in Taiwan was not as concerning

 as in the U.S., the unemployment rate already dropped to close to the natural rate of

 unemployment, a sign that the economy might be heating up; a 25 bps rate increase

 would help dampen the heat. Second, protracted low interest rates in recent years had

 also helped shore up asset prices in Taiwan; combined with rising inflation expectations

 and the idea of buying real estate as an inflation hedge, housing prices could go further

 up. Raising the policy rates by 25 basis points could not only send an inflation-fighting

 message but also rein in the asset price buildup, making it an appropriate policy move. 

 One board director pointed out that though Taiwan’s inflation was below 3% and

 lower than major economies, inflationary pressures would actually be higher than what

 the data showed. In addition, more after-effects of the Ukraine war could arise;

 particularly, energy market shifts and supply chain shocks could result in lasting

 outcomes and effects. Housing prices rose quite sharply in the fourth quarter of 2021

 and it seemed that higher price expectations had become entrenched since more than a

 year ago, a sentiment difficult to dissolve. With interest rates staying low for a long

 while, speculators seeking short-term gains and first-time homebuyers wary of price

 surges scrambled to buy houses, creating a vicious loop that could be exacerbated if low

 rates persist longer. 

 One board director stated that the forecasting model designed to gauge the

 probability of recession in Taiwan showed a very slim likelihood. In addition, inflation

 was expected to remain above 2%, economic growth was strong and employment was

 solid. In this view, this would be the right timing for monetary policy normalization.

 The director therefore supported the proposition to raise the policy rates by 25 basis

 points. The Bank would need to closely monitor the developments of inflation

 expectation and continue conducting inflation expectation surveys. 

 One board director noted that the rate hike proposition was partly based on current

 economic strength, solid labor market recovery, and pressures from inflation. In

 addition, keeping inflation in check would likely boost slow-growing real wages.

-----

###### Inflation affects households of various income brackets in different ways. With the

 prices of items to buy at least once a month and the 17 major staples (on the

 government’s monitor list for price stabilization) rising more markedly than the overall

 CPI growth, the public tended to be more acutely aware of price hikes and to expect

 higher prices in the future too. Raising the policy rates would help dampen inflation

 expectation while also rein in expectation of higher housing prices. Moreover, in the

 post-Board Meeting press conference in December 2021, the Bank already floated the

 possibility of a future rate hike so as to promote public understanding of monetary policy

 and to guide public expectation of the policy path in the right direction, in hopes that

 borrowers including homebuyers would be prepared for future interest payments.

 Importantly, from the perspective of financial stability, the press conference

 communication also demonstrated central bank transparency and would be essential to

 anchoring inflation and stabilizing real estate prices. 

 Another board director expressed support for the rate hike mainly because the

 reasons for the Bank’s rate cut two years ago no longer existed; and while the recoveries

 among sectors were uneven – slow in the services sector but strong in the industrial

 sector, the situation was beyond the Bank’s capabilities and capacity. With this rate hike,

 the policy rates would return to the level before the last rate cut, which would be an

 appropriate move. 

 One board director stated that even though it seemed to be the timing for a rate

 hike, it would be preferable to wait until the next Board meeting in June or to hike the

 rates now but by 12.5 basis points instead. This was based on three reasons. First, the

 NT dollar had not turned weak. Second, until the Bank’s special accommodation facility

 to support SMEs concludes on June 30, 2022, this would still be a time when relief

 measures are judged needed to stay in place while many industries remain financially

 stressed; a rate hike at this juncture would add to funding pressures. Third, the around

 2% headline and core inflation rates at present were primarily caused by labor shortages

 and raw material supply logjams, both exerting great influence on inflation. 

 Another board director was also in favor of a rate hike, albeit with concern about

 the pace of 25 basis points. A rate hike would be appropriate given that the domestic

10


-----

###### inflation rate had been over 2% for several months in a row, that inflation pressures

 could continue rising with the Ukraine war pushing up prices of metal, energy, and farm

 produce, and that inflation expectations of investment trust companies and of the

 corporate sector tilted to the upside. The normalization move would also be warranted

 by the fact that interest rates had stayed low for a long while. Moreover, positive

 readings from data on exports, investment, and consumption indicated that a rate hike

 would not create much of a concern. Nevertheless, the Bank’s rate hike would then

 translate into higher interest burdens on borrowers of various types of the government’s

 policy loan programs; it would thus be important to reconsider whether a 12.5 or 25 bps

 rate hike is more appropriate. 

 One board director supported raising the policy rates and remarked that a rate hike,

 either by 25 basis points or by 12.5 basis points, would have an announcement effect

 nonetheless. The effect not only could guide public expectation and recognition of the

 Bank’s resolve to contain inflation but also would help facilitate a healthy housing

 market. 

 (2) Discussion on the Bank’s special accommodation facility to support SMEs 

 One board director pointed out the fact that the Bank’s special accommodation

 facility to support SMEs (hereinafter “the facility”) was introduced in March 2020 in

 tandem with a 25 bps rate reduction; accordingly, a 25 bps rate hike in this Meeting

 should lead to a simultaneous increase in the rate on the facility’s special

 accommodations to banks. However, the facility was scheduled to end on June 30, 2022;

 considering the imminence of the expiry date, the Bank would amend relevant rules to

 keep the rate on the facility’s special accommodations to banks at 0.1% through to June

 30, 2022, so that banks’ loans to SMEs could continue using preferential rates. Several

 board directors supported this proposition. 

 Another board director noted that many pandemic-hit SMEs were still not out of

 the woods, while the Bank’s facility was in effect closing down as the June 30, 2022

 expiry date is not so far from mid-March. Considering the likelihood that SMEs might

 still need funding support after the facility expires, the Board could give deeper thought

 to the impact on SME funding costs if the policy rates were to be raised by 25 basis

11


-----

###### points. 

 One board director took note of the public’s interest in whether the facility will be

 extended beyond June 30, 2022, and expressed the view that, with the domestic COVID
 19 outbreaks easing, the number and amount of SME loan cases guaranteed by the

 government (i.e., Small and Medium Enterprise Credit Guarantee Fund of Taiwan) and

 granted by banks under the facility had been rather modest since the end of February

 2022, indicating the Bank had fulfilled its interim mission. When the facility ends, the

 Bank would urge banks to keep credit flowing to the SMEs as needed. 

 (3) Discussion on the Bank’s selective credit control measures

 One board director pointed out that the latest data showed both existing and newly
 built homes recorded large price gains in the fourth quarter of 2021 that accelerated

 significantly from the previous quarter, with Hsinchu City and Hsinchu County leading

 the surge. In regard to lending, the recent slight decline in the annual growth rate of real

 estate loans was partly due to a higher base effect, instead of being a clear sign of the

 uptrend reversing. Meanwhile, real estate loans continued to take up a rising share in

 total loans. In addition, compared with recent data of other economies, Taiwan’s real

 housing price index seemed to have a relatively lower annual growth rate; however,

 Taiwan ranked higher than most countries in terms of accumulated growth in housing

 prices in the past 20 years. In this light, more discussion seemed imperative on the issue

 of imposing selective credit controls. 

 One board director took note of the elevated annual growth rate of housing prices

 at present and suggested the Bank pay close attention and, if necessary, further reinforce

 the selective credit control measures. Another board director also remarked that

 consumers conscious of surging housing prices in major cities and cautious against

 rising inflation were planning to buy real estate as an inflation hedge. This called for the

 Bank’s close attention and, if necessary, might require a new round of selective credit

 controls on the real estate market.

 One board director pointed to the relatively focused and limited scope of the Bank’s

 selective credit controls and suggested the possibility of broadening the measures’

 influence to a wider range in the future. On the other hand, the director stated that back

12


-----

###### in 2010, housing prices had not been significantly dented by the Bank’s macro
 prudential measures imposed on housing loans in the designated “specific areas” in

 Taipei City, New Taipei City, and Taoyuan; the housing market slump actually set in

 later in 2016 after the introduction of the consolidated land and housing sales tax, as

 well as an economic slowdown and a stock market decline. Therefore, it seemed

 uncertain whether housing prices would be brought down even if the current selective

 credit controls were to be enhanced for another around in the future.

 3. Monetary Policy Decision: The board directors reached a unanimous vote to raise

 the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary

 accommodations by 25 basis points to 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively. 

 III. The Press Release 

 The board directors and supervisors approved unanimously to issue the following

 press release in the post-meeting press conference, together with the Supplementary

 Materials for the Post-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank.

##### Press Release  March 17, 2022

 Monetary Policy Decision of the Board Meeting (2022Q1)

###### I. Global economic and financial conditions

 Since the Board met in December last year, the global economic recovery has

 remained on track amid an Omicron-driven pandemic resurgence and lingering

 supply chain bottlenecks. The recent Russian invasion of Ukraine has propelled

 major economies to impose economic and financial sanctions on Russia, hampering

 global commodity supply, inducing commodity price surges, and thereby creating

 further inflationary pressures. In addition, as the US Fed and other central banks in

 major economies began to reduce monetary policy accommodation, the global

 economy this year is expected to grow at a slower pace. Owing to the impacts of the

 Russia-Ukraine conflict and the ensuing sanctions, international financial markets

13


-----

###### experienced greater volatility. International institutions trimmed down the global

 economic growth forecast for this year and revised up their projections for global

 inflation.

 Looking ahead, risks such as geopolitical tensions, surging international raw

 material prices, recurring outbreaks caused by new coronavirus variants, and

 aggravating threat from climate change could contribute to more persistently high

 global inflation, negative impacts on economic activity, and heightened financial

 market volatility, posing greater downside risks to the global economy.

 II. Domestic economic and financial conditions

 1. From the beginning of 2022, despite Omicron-driven disruptions to the domestic

 economy, consumers largely remained willing to spend, and the retail and

 food/beverage sectors registered growing sales. In addition, bolstered by thriving

 global economic activity, solid demand for emerging technology applications and

 digital transformation-related products, growth momentum for exports remained

 strong and capital equipment imports continued to increase, leading to a robust

 expansion in the domestic economy. Going forward, private consumption growth is

 likely to gather pace, and exports and private investment will continue picking up.

 Nevertheless, given the higher comparison base and the impact of the Russia
 Ukraine conflict, the domestic economy is likely to register moderate growth. The

 Bank forecasts that Taiwan's economy would expand by 4.05% in 2022 (Appendix

 Table 1).

 In the labor market, the unemployment rate continued to fall and the number of

 employed persons increased further, both close to the level before the massive

 coronavirus outbreak in mid-2021. The average regular nominal earnings of all

 payroll employees in the industrial and services sectors recorded mild annual growth,

 with those of all payroll employees in the pandemic-distressed services sector also

 on the rise as the coronavirus wave receded. This indicates a more even recovery

 across sectors. 

 2. For the first two months of 2022, the consumer price index (CPI) posted an average

 annual growth rate of 2.60%, a still fast pace mainly because of domestic fuel price

 hikes following international oil rallies and cost-pushed price increases for food

 away from home, as well as rising prices for fruit, durable consumer goods, and

14


-----

###### flight tickets. For the same period, the core CPI (excluding fruit, vegetables, and

 energy items) rose by 2.03% year on year.

 The global supply chain bottleneck was expected to persist for some time, while

 international commodity prices such as oil, grains, and base metals soared as a result

 of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These could drive up domestic prices for energy,

 food, and durable consumer goods, thereby stoking inflationary pressures. The

 estimates show that the CPI annual growth rates would remain above 2% in the first

 three quarters of the year, before slowing to below 2% in the fourth quarter. For the

 year as a whole, the Bank projects the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to be

 2.37% and 1.93%, respectively (Appendix Table 2). 

 3. In recent months, banks' excess reserves stayed somewhat above NT$60 billion. The

 annual growth rate of M2 (on a daily average basis) slowed from 8.24% of the fourth

 quarter of 2021 to 7.87% of January 2022. Loans and investments by the banking

 sector continued to expand, posting an annual growth rate of 8.75% in January;

 among them, SME loans increased by 11.52% year on year. Meanwhile, short- and

 long-term market interest rates fluctuated within a tight range. Overall, financial

 conditions were accommodative.

 III. Interest rate decision: Raising the policy rates by 25 basis points

 The Board considered the economic and financial conditions at home and abroad in

 today's meeting. Myriad uncertainties facing the global economic outlook could

 dampen the domestic growth momentum. For the domestic inflation outlook, however,

 the recent Russia-Ukraine conflict and the consequent price surges in global energy

 items and other commodities impose considerable imported inflation pressures. The

 annual growth rate of the CPI has stayed over 2% for consecutive months and will

 likely remain so towards the third quarter of the year, while that of the core CPI has

 also increased, both pointing to a persistent trend of elevated inflation. Furthermore,

 the domestically-oriented services sector that took a greater hit from the pandemic has

 gradually rebounded and the labor market conditions have continued to improve.

 Meanwhile, some economies, including the United States, have begun to raise policy

 rates. In this view, the Board judged that a rate hike would help contain domestic

 inflation expectations and achieve the policy objectives of price stability and sound

 financial and economic development.

15


-----

###### The Board decided unanimously at the meeting today to raise the discount rate, the

 rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations to

 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively, effective March 18, 2022.

 Given that global inflation still faces conspicuous upside risk, the Bank will keep close

 watch on developments related to international raw material prices, monetary policy

 actions by major economies, and geopolitical risks, and how these factors affect

 domestic prices and economic and financial conditions. Based on the assessments

 thereof, the Bank may adjust its monetary policy timely and appropriately to fulfill

 the statutory duties of maintaining price stability, safeguarding financial stability, and

 fostering economic development.

 IV. The Special Accommodation Facility's interest rate on re-accommodations to banks:

 Maintained at the current level of 0.1% until June 30, 2022 to ensure funding ease

 for SMEs after the policy rate hike

 Under the Bank's Special Accommodation Facility to Support Bank Credit to Small

 and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) launched in April 2020, financial institutions

 have approved preferential loans to more than 300 thousand borrowers with the total

 amount exceeding NT$500 billion. While the Facility has been productive in helping

 the pandemic-hit SMEs obtain essential funds, the need for financial relief diminished

 as firms gradually resumed normal operations amid successful containment of the

 domestic coronavirus situation. In this light, the Facility was closed for new SME loan

 applications after December 31, 2021, but the preferential rates would remain

 applicable until June 30, 2022 as previously announced. Likewise, the Facility's

 accommodations to the banking sector were also rolled over to the same date, before

 which a total amount of around NT$400 billion would be repaid to the Bank. 

 In line with this policy rate hike, which could have affected the funding costs of the

 SMEs utilizing the Facility, the Bank would therefore amend the relevant regulations

 so that the rate on the special accommodations to banks would remain at 0.1%,

 allowing the SME borrowers to continue enjoying preferential loan rates supported

 by the Facility.

 been adjusted as needed with three more amendments, representing sustained

 efforts to achieve effective allocation and reasonable utilization of credit resources

 they have successfully held down the expansions in construction loans and housing

 loans and reined in real estate loan concentration, conducive to reducing credit risk

 and promoting sound banking operations. The Bank will stay attentive to the

 developments in real estate lending and in the housing market, continue to review

 the implementation of the selective credit controls, and make adjustments as needed

 in order to promote financial stability. 

 VI. The NT dollar exchange rate is in principle determined by market forces.

 Nonetheless, when seasonal or irregular factors (such as massive inflows or

 outflows of short-term capital) lead to excess volatility and disorderly movements

 in the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial

 stability, the Bank, in line with its statutory mandates, will step in to maintain an

 orderly market.
