##### AGENDA: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND

 MONETARY POLICY DECISION

 I. Staff Review of Economic and Financial Conditions 

###### 1. International Economic and Financial Conditions

 Since the Board last met in September 2022, the effects from the ongoing Russia
 Ukraine war, elevated inflation, and monetary policy tightening by major economies

 have markedly dampened global goods consumption demand and caused firms to

 receive fewer orders and inventories to pile up, putting a drag on global economic

 growth. With tepid demand for goods, world trade expansion weakened, while supply

 chain snags continued to ease and shipping rates dropped considerably. As major

 economies (such as the US and Europe) still recorded high inflation and many central

 banks significantly tightened monetary policy, global economic growth is expected to

 slow further in 2023, with the US and Europe likely entering mild recessions. 

 Regarding price trends of international commodities, from October onwards, oil

 prices dropped to levels last seen prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine as

 international institutions downgraded their projections for global crude oil demand

 growth and the US crude oil production increased. For 2023, oil prices are forecasted to

 be lower than 2022. Grain prices had fallen since November after Russia rejoined the

 Black Sea grain export deal. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB (RJ/CRB) Index, the global

 commodities benchmark, moved downwards before hovering at low levels. 

 In spite of oil and grain price declines in recent months, inflation was still high in

 major economies for the year. Global inflation is expected to soften next year thanks to

 reduced consumption demand and eased supply bottlenecks, as well as a higher base

 effect. Regarding monetary policy in recent months, most economies, including the US

 and Europe, continued to raise policy rates to rein in high inflation, whereas Japan and

 China kept an accommodative monetary policy stance. 

 In the foreign exchange markets, the US Dollar Index (DXY) had traded

 significantly lower since November against a background of the US inflation posting

 lower than expected numbers for two months in a row and the Federal Reserve (Fed)

2


-----

###### thought to slow the pace of rate hikes, and major currencies broadly strengthened against

 the US dollar. Meanwhile, amid hopes of smaller Fed rate increases and concerns about

 a looming European recession, the US and German 10-year government bond yields fell

 and global stock markets rallied 

 Looking ahead, the global economy faces multiple downside risks: (1)

 Synchronized monetary policy tightening could deepen the global economic slowdown

 and undermine financial stability; (2) implications from the US-China disputes could

 hamper the process of globalization; (3) geopolitical risks could shake up supply chain

 networks; (4) the Russia-Ukraine war and the ensuing energy crisis in Europe could add

 to global economic headwinds; (5) extreme weather events and energy transition efforts

 could both be inflationary. 

 2. Domestic Economic and Financial Conditions

 (1) Economic situation

 The leading and coincident indicators both extended their downtrends recently.

 Manufacturing and non-manufacturing sentiment for the outlook for the next six months

 also remained cautious. 

 In terms of external demand since August 2022, exports were sapped by cooling

 global final demand and inventory adjustments by foreign firms with annual growth

 slumping towards a year-on-year contraction of 13.1% in November, marking the third

 consecutive month of negative growth. For next year, as global economic and trade

 activity is expected to be remarkably sluggish, final demand could remain weak, and

 inventory adjustment would likely go on, all of which could dampen Taiwan’s export

 growth. Overall, the Bank projected exports to expand at a slower pace next year. 

 Benefiting from investment in advanced equipment by major semiconductor and

 related supply chain firms, growth momentum for private investment held steady.

 However, goods exports were expected to slow down next year, business sentiment

 showed caution and lasting inventory overhang concerns might cause firms to delay

 investments or dial down capital outlays. The Bank expected private investment growth

3


-----

###### to drastically moderate next year. 

 Private consumption would likely gain traction as the easing of pandemic-related

 restrictions and border reopening are set to encourage in-store and overseas spending; a

 minimum wage rise and a hike in income tax-free allowance – both to be enacted next

 year – would also give a boost to consumption. The Bank expected private consumption

 to grow faster next year than this year. 

 In the labor market, with the pandemic's impact waning, the unemployment rate

 dropped and the number of employed persons slightly increased. However, overtime

 hours worked in the manufacturing sector had posted year-on-year decreases for four

 months in a row. 

 Overall, in view of a significant export slowdown this year, the Bank expected the

 economy to moderate markedly in the fourth quarter and hence downgraded the 2022

 GDP growth rate forecast to 2.91%. For 2023, the Bank forecasted the GDP growth rate

 to slow to 2.53% with the increasing risk of a global economic downturn restraining

 Taiwan’s export and investment growth. Major institutions at home and abroad

 projected Taiwan’s economy to expand at a pace between 2.63% - 3.45%in 2022 and

 1.58% - 2.91% in 2023.

 (2) Financial conditions 

 After the policy rates were raised in September and the RRR increase took effect

 in October, bank deposit and loan rates both trended up and money market interest rates

 also climbed. Banks’ excess reserves averaged around NT$60 billion in recent months. 

 Short-term market interest rates and bank deposit rates both went up in October, in

 line with the Bank’s hike in the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points. In particular,

 interest rates of commercial paper rose far more steeply than the policy rate hike,

 showing a direct transmission effect from the interest rate channel of monetary policy. 

 In terms of money and credit conditions, the annual growth rate of bank loans and

 investments had risen steadily since August because private sector demand for working

 capital continued to strengthen and government enterprises increased their working

 capital funds and capital expenditures. The annual growth rate of bank loans and

4


-----

###### investments stood at 6.75% as of the end of October and averaged 7.55% for the first

 ten months of the year. 

 Regarding money supply since August, the RRR increase beginning in July had

 caused banks to set aside more reserves. The resultant reduction in banks’ disposable

 funds and a net foreign capital outflow slowed down M2 growth, with the year-on-year

 increase reaching 6.83% in September. Then, despite another RRR increase, the M2

 annual growth rate rose to 7.32% in October mainly because the principal of foreign

 investor portfolio investment turned into a net inflow and bank loans and investments

 recorded faster growth. For the first ten months of the year, the annual growth rate of

 M2 averaged 7.54%, higher than the upper threshold of the Bank’s reference range, set

 at 6.5%. This was mainly because bank loans and investment had been growing fast year

 on year; however, M2 growth during these ten months was partly restrained because of

 a surge in net foreign capital outflows.  

 Considering a slowdown in the inflation rate next year, the moderation in economic

 growth, and the already high levels of bank loans and investments this year, the Bank

 expected that the M2 annual growth rate would likely come down to within the 2.5%
 6.5% reference range in the second half of 2023. Based on the estimations of the money

 demand function, the annual growth rate of M2 demand will remain between 2.5% and

 6.5% next year. Therefore, the Bank maintains the M2 growth reference range at the

 current 2.5%-6.5% for the year 2023. 

 In the housing market, trading had moderated in the year so far. For the first ten

 months of the year, the total number of building ownership transfers nationwide

 decreased by 4.5% year on year, while that number also dropped by 7% for the six

 Special Municipalities during the first eleven months of year. Construction costs for

 newly-built homes continued climbing but at a slower pace. Prices of new housing units

 and existing homes were both trending up, reflecting the rise in national Urban Land

 Price Index (compiled by the Ministry of the Interior). In the third quarter of the year,

 the price indices for existing homes rose by 15.64%; new housing projects saw a price

 gain of 33.73%, which might mostly represent the views of builders as the price index

 for new housing projects uses estimated prospective sale prices instead of actual

5


-----

###### transaction prices. 

 Meanwhile, reflecting the Bank’s monetary tightening and the government’s

 housing market measures, outlook sentiment of builders and real estate businesses

 significantly cooled down, while banks were cautious about the outlook of residential

 housing in major cities.

 As of the end of October 2022, the annual growth rates of real estate lending,

 housing loans, and construction loans edged down to 8.6%, 7.6%, and 12.18%,

 respectively. Real estate loans as a share of total loans slightly shrank to 36.7% from the

 37.16% registered at the end of 2021. Meanwhile, the construction loan ratio of domestic

 banks was 26.63%, still below the 30% cap prescribed in Article 72-2 of the Banking

 Act.[2] The ratio of non-performing housing loans extended by domestic banks remained

 low at 0.07%. 

 Since the Bank deployed selective credit control measures by making four

 amendments to relevant regulations from December 2020 onwards, banks’ loan

 portfolio concentration in the real estate sector had kept steady, which was conducive to

 bank credit risk management. The Bank’s tightening stance since March 2022 was also

 judged to amplify the effectiveness of selective credit controls. In addition, housing

 market trading had gradually slackened off since the beginning of the year as a result of

 the concerted efforts under the government’s Healthy Real Estate Market Plan as well

 as the pandemic’s impact. The results of the cross-agency policy efforts towards a sound

 housing market have begun to show. 

 (3) Price trends 

 The annual growth rate of the consumer price index (CPI) rose to 3.59% in June.

 Afterwards, domestic inflation slowed down gradually, reflecting price declines in

 international raw materials and domestic food items such as fruit and vegetables. The

 annual CPI growth rate stood at 2.35% in November. Excluding fruit, vegetables, and

 energy items, the core CPI annual growth rate remained high, reaching 2.86% in

2 According to Article 72-2 of the Banking Act, the total amount of loans extended for residential construction

and construction for business purposes by a Commercial Bank shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the
aggregate of such Commercial Bank's deposits and Bank Debentures issued at the time such loans is extended.

6


-----

###### November. 

 For the first eleven months, the inflation rate averaged 2.97%, mainly owing to

 rises in food, fuel and lubricants, rent, and durable goods. The core inflation rate

 averaged 2.6%. As there was a more marked increase in prices of staples with a higher

 purchase frequency, consumers tended to be more conscious of the price uptrends.

 Since the middle of the year, the annual growth rates of import and producer price

 indices had moderated on the softening of international raw material prices, relieving

 some pressures from imported inflation. The Bank forecasted the inflation and core

 inflation rates to register 2.93% and 2.59% for 2022. For next year, as global supply

 bottlenecks ease, international freight rates trend lower, and crude oil and other raw

 material prices are expected by international institutions to drop lower than this year,

 the Bank forecasted the inflation and core inflation rates to come down to 1.88% and

 1.87%. Projections for Taiwan’s annual CPI growth rate made by major domestic and

 foreign forecasting institutions ranged between 2.9% and 3.1% for 2022 and between

 1.21% and 2.5% for 2023 with the forecast average below 2% for next year. 

 Looking at next year’s domestic price trends, upside pressures could arise from (1)

 overseas travel encouraged by the reopening of borders, pushing up travel group fees,

 and sustained domestic travel boom, driving up travel and accommodation spending; (2)

 the scheduled hike of minimum wages; (3) possible hikes in electricity tariffs and gas

 rates to reflect rising costs. On the other hand, downside pressures could come from (1)

 lower international freight rates as supply chain bottlenecks ease, and a decline in

 international raw material prices including crude oil; (2) reductions in domestic prices

 of mobile phones and other communication devices. 

 3. Considerations for Monetary Policy

 Major considerations: 

 (1) The domestic inflation rate had come down in the second half of the year, but could

 still register above 2% for the year as a whole before declining to below 2% next year. 

 (2) Export expansion had significantly moderated this year, and the Bank revised down

7


-----

###### the economic growth rate forecast to 2.91% in 2022 (0.6 percentage points lower than

 the September forecast). For the year 2023, in view of a rising risk of a global

 economic slowdown and its impact on domestic export and investment growth, the

 Bank also revised down the economic growth rate forecast (by 0.37 percentage points)

 to 2.53%.  

 II. Proposition and Decision about Monetary Policy 

**1.** **Policy Proposition: To raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured**

###### loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points to

 1.75%, 2.125%, and 4%, respectively. 

 2. Board members decided to raise the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points. Related

 discussions are summarized as follows.

 (1) Discussions on domestic price trends and future outlook

 One board director noted that Taiwan’s inflation was not as high as the US and

 Europe mainly because Taipower and CPC Corp. Taiwan, both state-owned enterprises,

 absorbed some of the rising costs of electricity and oil to the detriment of running huge

 losses, but this brought forth better outcomes in preventing prices from spiraling up.

 While international oil prices were expected to decline, liquefied natural gas prices

 remained elevated and steam coal saw spot prices far exceeding contract prices. Going

 forward, the extent to which the domestic electricity and gas pricing reflect true costs

 and its impact on domestic inflation will have important implications for monetary

 policymaking. 

 One board director also stated that Taiwan’s supply-side measures of price

 stabilization were better and more effective than those taken in Europe and the US. By

 freezing the electricity rates and mitigating oil price hikes, Taiwan’s price rises were

 contained from the source before spilling over to other goods, whereas European and

 US responses were mostly subsidies supported by government budgets after the price

 spillover effects already emerged. While both types of policies used taxpayers’ money,

 Taiwan’s price control differed from the subsidy policy implemented in Europe and the

8


-----

###### US. Furthermore, the aggressive rate hikes by Western countries to combat inflation not

 only dampened economic growth but also impacted economically vulnerable

 households. As for the Bank’s forecasts that the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates

 would drop below 2% in 2023, it had already taken into account power tariff rises based

 on the government’s electricity price stabilization mechanism. 

 (2) Discussions on the monetary policy proposition 

 One board director stated that the 0.125 percentage point increase in the policy

 rates would be appropriate given that the annual CPI growth rate was forecasted to rise

 above 2% this year before dropping to slightly below 2%. While the Fed raised the fed

 funds rate by 0.5 percentage points yesterday (December 14), the Board Meeting’s

 proposition of a moderate policy rate hike absent a reserve requirement ratio (RRR)

 increase was a comparatively mild approach. Taiwan’s year-on-year export growth

 plunged from expansion in August to double-digit contraction in November, showing a

 sharply weaker growth momentum at a time when big undue rate hikes could bring

 hardship to firms. Nonetheless, inflation remained an indispensable part of the

 consideration. On balance, 0.125 percentage points seemed the appropriate size for

 today’s rate hike. 

 One board director supported the proposed rate hike, citing the interest rate

 differential as the reason with the Fed and the ECB delivering aggressive and steep rate

 hikes to fight inflation amid ongoing rate hike cycles. By hiking the policy rates, the

 Bank would be able to signal determination for tightening, but a big hike would not be

 appropriate if considering domestic inflation trends and economic strains. Inflation and

 inflation expectations in Taiwan were not as worrying as in many other countries.

 Taiwan’s exports had contracted for three consecutive months owing to foreign

 economic slowdown, soft demand, and inventory adjustment. The Bank also revised

 down the domestic GDP growth rate forecasts for 2022 and 2023. Therefore, it would

 be advisable not to overdo the rate hike so as to avoid eroding the momentum of

 economic growth. 

 Another board director pointed out that the domestic inflation rate would register

9


-----

###### around 3% this year and was expected to drop below, but close to, the level of 2%,

 indicating inflationary pressures had not entirely ebbed. In addition, the domestic

 economic expansion weakened on account of export slowdown and most major

 economies continued to raise policy rates. Based on an overall assessment of domestic

 economic growth, financial market conditions at home and abroad, and, particularly and

 primarily, domestic inflation trends, it would be the sensible decision to raise the policy

 rates by 0.125 percentage points. On the other hand, the RRR adjustment and its

 cumulative effects were both significant. Considering that the Bank had made two RRR

 adjustments in the previous two Board Meetings, further deployment of this tool would

 not be advisable unless warranted by extraordinary circumstances. 

 One board director stated that the domestic economic growth had held steady;

 while the Bank revised down the GDP growth rate forecasts for 2022 and 2023, it should

 be noted that financial and price stability take priority in the Bank’s mandate whereas

 economic development is not the foremost objective. In terms of price trends, though

 both inflation and core inflation slowed somewhat in November, the core inflation rate

 was still higher than 2%. Also at issue was persistent inflation; the core inflation rate

 had registered above 2% since March and whether the slowdown in November was a

 one-off remained to be seen. Moreover, inflation expectation plays a vital role and offers

 great help in monetary policymaking. The longer inflation lingers, the more likely for

 inflation expectations to build up, highlighting the importance to tackle the issue of

 domestic inflation proactively. Therefore, while these warranted a rate hike, they

 seemed to give stronger grounds for hiking by 0.25 percentage points. 

 Another board director shared the view that a rate hike in the size of 0.125

 percentage points was the balanced approach after weighing up the incessant inflation

 pressures against an economy facing downside risks. In particular in the US, where an

 economic recession was already looming large, further aggressive rate hikes by the Fed

 in view of stubbornly high inflation could raise the specter of a hard landing. The outlook

 seemed bleaker in Europe as energy price surges and the ECB’s tightening stance pushed

 the economy to the brink of recession. In addition, China’s COVID-19 case surge and

 inventory destocking by domestic firms had sharply hit corporate sales. The director

10


-----

###### therefore supported a 0.125 percentage point rate hike. 

 One board director stated support for raising the policy rates by 0.125 percentage

 points and leaving the RRR unchanged, adding that the move matched market

 expectation. The director also suggested that the Bank should pay attention to the fact

 that the annual growth rate of the monetary aggregate M2 continued to exceed 6.5%,

 namely the upper threshold of the Bank’s M2 growth reference range, and the situation

 that the interest rate differential between Taiwan and the US continued widening. 

 One board director expressed the view regarding policy rates that it is important to

 ponder the influence of monetary policy adjustments on inflation expectation. In

 addition, it is possible that the forces behind and their effects on inflation expectation

 might not be captured, as elaborated in the following. First, nominal earnings posted

 marked rises this year, indicating further pressures on inflation and possibly reflecting

 high inflation expectations. Given that a higher inflation rate this year led to a slight

 contraction in real earnings, which hurt household disposable income and could then

 restrain consumption and investment, it is crucial to prevent inflation from accelerating.

 Second, goods purchased at least once per month and the top 17 staple goods posted

 much larger price gains than the broad basket, and the situation had lasted for some time

 now, which tended to intensify consumer sentiment about price rises and could then

 push inflation expectations further upwards. Third, one of the contributors to higher

 inflation rate this year was rent increases, and the continuous housing price rises could

 feed into rental costs and hamper price stability. Fourth, for 27 months in a row, the

 annual growth rate of M2 had exceeded the upper limit (6.5%) of the reference range, a

 reference set by the Bank in view of M2 growth’s influence on longer-term price trends.

 That reference range might need to be reviewed to explore the case for an adjustment;

 it was also advisable to communicate with the public about the Bank’s monetary policy

 conduct, and let the public know that the Bank takes the issue of inflation seriously.

 Furthermore, the previous two RRR increases actually ran counter to the Bank’s long
 standing policy direction to gradually decrease the RRR. It would be more desirable to

 employ other policies to achieve more effective interest rate transmission, such as

 issuing certificates of deposits or raising the policy rates. In a committed effort to rein

11


-----

###### in inflation and inflation expectations, it would be advisable to adopt a rate hike by 0.25

 percentage points. 

 One board director pointed out that corporate sector survey results showed that the

 pay-rise decision was chiefly predicated on employee work performance and company

 profits, rather than on price trend changes. In addition, this year’s domestic price rises

 were mostly due to the peculiar case of supply-side shocks; nonetheless, Taiwan’s

 inflation was milder than in the US or Europe thanks to government’s supply-side

 responses and the drastic tightening by major central banks exerting a spillover effect

 that eased inflationary pressures in many economies including Taiwan. 

 The board director also commented on the issue of M2 growth. While the M2

 annual growth rate began to exceed the upper threshold (6.5%) of the reference range in

 August 2020, it should be noted that there existed pandemic’s impacts and inflationary

 pressures were rather modest, with a negative 0.23% inflation rate in 2020; to help

 cushion the downturn and buttress the economy, it was actually necessary to maintain

 higher M2 growth. That growth had started to decelerate in the second half of 2021,

 during which it remained above 6.5% mainly because bank loans and investments stayed

 high as the government continued with stimulus efforts, exports and investments both

 expanded, and the real estate market also saw demand booming. More recently, the NT

 dollar depreciation caused the value of troves of foreign currency deposits to seemingly

 increase when denominated in NTD terms, resulting in a rise in M2 growth; accounting

 for that exchange rate factor, the average annual growth rate of M2 for the first ten

 months of 2022 would be only marginally above 6.5%. Considering that M2 is a mid
 to long-term reference indicator, it would be more appropriate to look at longer-term

 trends when reviewing inflation anchoring in the mid- to long-term, allowing for some

 time before forming a decision around a reference range adjustment. 

 One board director approved of the proposition of a 0.125 percentage rate hike but

 also stated support for a rate hike in a larger size. The previous concern of imported

 inflation was mainly because the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed up prices of oil,

 natural gas, soybean, wheat, and corn. China, which remains the key player in global

 supply chains, recently began to lift pandemic-related restrictions; although this would

12


-----

###### likely boost its consumption and investment and help bring global supply chains back

 to normal, post-pandemic consumption boom in a country where the population is large

 and monetary policy still accommodative could drive up inflation and wage growth. As

 such, it could increase supply chain costs and trigger renewed woes of inflation. While

 the Bank downgraded the domestic economic growth forecasts, it also projected the

 inflation rate would turn lower. Nonetheless, the Bank still needs to continue monitoring

 new developments in global supply chains and other international economic situations

 and to keep watch on the effects therefrom on domestic price trends. 

 Another board director pointed to economic fundamentals: Export growth

 momentum had slowed amid a streak of growth contraction for three consecutive

 months. Despite a still steady economic expansion, the official business climate monitor

 had barely stayed within the “yellow-blue light” that suggested a possible transition

 towards a slowdown, and the leading indicator also declined, both implying high

 uncertainties over the business outlook. The headline inflation rate recently trended

 downwards, but annual growth rates of key staple goods and core inflation remained

 elevated, necessitating close monitoring of inflation expectations. Compared to the US

 and Europe, Taiwan’s inflation was still mild and the inflation rate was expected to come

 down to below, but still close to, 2%. With the latest Fed rate hike by 0.5 percentage

 points yesterday, today’s proposition of a 0.125 percentage rate hike was an appropriate

 move that would keep the US-Taiwan interest rate differentials from widening

 significantly. As for the RRR, considering that next year’s outlook is shrouded in many

 uncertainties, it would be appropriate to put a hold on the RRR policy. 

 One board director was in favor of the proposed rate hike by 0.125 percentage

 points and commented on inflation. Regarding the Bank’s projection that the inflation

 and core inflation rate would come down to below 2% next year, the director noted that

 the forecasted downtrend would be mostly due to a higher base effect. The key

 components of core inflation, including food away from home, rent, durable consumer

 goods, meat, and apparel, had all recorded large price gains for quite some time, making

 it hard for core inflation to slow down in the near future. Moreover, if prices of

 agricultural products and energy items climb back next year, the inflation rate could

13


-----

###### continue to trend up. Surveyed data on inflation expectations also revealed public

 concern on future inflationary pressures, which warranted the Bank’s close attention. 

 One board director stated that several previous inflation forecasts by the Bank

 seemed to err on the optimistic side, which might need to be revisited. In addition, the

 seemingly milder inflation compared to other economies was mainly attributable to

 government policy controls and underestimated rent costs in the CPI; given the colossal

 costs, it would be better to avoid a premature verdict of Taiwan’s inflation being

 relatively mild. At present, core inflation remained elevated and would not weaken

 rapidly as the price gains had taken root in many items. Meanwhile, the overnight

 interbank call loan rate was only higher than the history trough by less than 0.5

 percentage points, a level far lower than before the 2008 global financial crisis, leaving

 limited maneuver for future policy rate cuts. Monetary policy tightening involves

 difficult tradeoffs; historical lessons from the 1970s showed that insufficient monetary

 tightening and premature easing would result in protracted inflation and thus leave the

 economy prone to a stagflation trap. As the Bank has still kept the policy rates

 persistently low, slow rate hikes in the size of 0.125 percentage points will not bring

 about meaningful results in containing inflation and mitigating inflation expectations. 

 One board director remarked that the Bank had taken a gradual, mild approach to

 monetary tightening as domestic inflation had been mild compared to Western

 economies this year so far. It is important to calibrate the right amount of tightening;

 gradual and steady tightening would help attain a soft economic landing whereas too

 much tightening could risk triggering a recession and exacerbate the pain inflicted on

 the economically-vulnerable. The proposed size of today’s rate hike was based on

 readings of domestic inflation and impacts from global factors on economic growth. In

 view of abated domestic inflation pressures in recent months, the Bank expected the

 inflation rate to come down to below 2%, a forecast similar to those made by external

 research institutions, albeit still subject to uncertainties surround inflation (for example,

 no one could have predicted the breakout of a war in Ukraine this year). In addition, a

 mild tightening stance also took into account a considerable downgrade of the domestic

 economic growth forecast. In view of a myriad of uncertainties over the global economic

14


-----

###### outlook, the Bank will closely monitor the domestic and foreign economic and financial

 conditions and adjust monetary policy in a timely fashion as warranted. As for the

 overnight call loan rate, given ample market liquidity conditions at home after 2009, the

 call loan market has mainly served as a pool for bank reserves management and hence

 played an increasingly less central role. This is different from the US, where capital

 market holds a dominant position in the financial system and the Federal Reserve uses

 the fed funds rate (the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans) as its operational

 target for monetary policy. 

 (3) Discussions on housing prices

 One board director noted that housing prices had surged dramatically this year,

 during which the Bank, echoing the industry, indicated that this reflected price-inelastic

 housing demand (e.g., owner-occupied housing) and rising construction costs; however,

 although the price index for construction works had significantly decreased since the

 beginning of the year, housing prices continued soaring. Currently, bank loan portfolio

 concentration in real estate lending ticked down only modestly, while no new selective

 credit controls were introduced after December 2021. Elevated property prices not only

 cause housing affordability to deteriorate but will feed into rental costs and push up

 inflation; this is also an issue greatly pertinent to financial stability. It would be wrong

 to think that high housing prices has nothing to do with monetary policy. Research

 shows that, in Taiwan, the housing price cycle runs ahead of the credit cycle. This

 indicates that Taiwan’s housing price rises are not mainly driven by bank credit

 increases, which also helps explain why the Bank’s selective credit controls have not

 been distinctly effective in taming housing price gains. A lot of studies also show that

 Taiwan’s housing price rises have in large part been driven by short-term speculation

 expecting price gains. The Bank has a responsibility to address the issue of high housing

 prices and needs to make committed efforts rather than relying on other competent

 authorities. 

 Another board director expressed the view that in accordance with Bank’s mandate

 to safeguard financial stability, the concern is about whether housing price trends could

15


-----

###### become a source of financial instability. The selective credit controls were not aimed at

 housing prices but rather the impact of housing credit on financial stability; in the

 meantime, the Bank will continue to keep watch on the housing market issue. As for

 recent property price surges, the construction cost indices showed that supply-side cost

 uptrends owing to labor and materials shortage were part of the reasons. Housing

 demand and upside expectations of future price gains driven by big new corporate

 investment projects had also stirred up speculative transactions. That was why the

 government launched the Healthy Real Estate Market Plan that involved cross-agency

 efforts to address the issue from the demand, supply, and institutional aspects. On the

 Bank’s part, it rolled out selective credit controls via four statutory amendments, the

 effectiveness of which was also reinforced by the monetary tightening policies this year.

 Similarly, other major economies have raised the policy rates to combat high inflation

 first and foremost, with a collateral dampening effect on housing prices. It is the Bank’s

 hope that the housing market will achieve a soft landing given that a hard landing would

 cause severe damage and would then require even more policy measures to mend. A

 case in point was China’s recent property market debacle. Another example was the

 Bank of Japan’s sizeable rate hikes during 1989-1990 that intended to tackle the real

 estate headache but ended up causing a housing market crash and plunged the economy

 into secular stagnation. The Bank will close monitor the implications of the domestic

 real estate market on financial stability and conduct a rolling review on its selective

 credit control measures. 

 3. Monetary Policy Decision: 

 The board directors decided to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of

 secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points

 to 1.75%, 2.125%, and 4%, respectively.

##### Press Release  December 15, 2022

 Monetary Policy Decision of the Board Meeting (2022Q4)

###### I. Global economic and financial conditions

 Since the Board met in September this year major economies have continued to

 tighten monetary policy, and the global economy has experienced significantly

 slower growth. International prices of commodities such as crude oil have mostly

 exhibited a downtrend, and upside pressures for global inflation have become

 mildly relieved. As the US and the European economies continued with policy rate

 hikes, leading to tighter global financial conditions, international institutions

 forecasted global economic and trade volume growth to decelerate drastically in

 2023. With global demand weakening markedly, supply chain bottlenecks easing,

 and international raw material prices declining, global inflationary pressures are

 expected to drop next year. Meanwhile, recent developments in US inflation and

 the Fed's monetary tightening actions have triggered continuous turmoil in

 international financial markets.

 Looking ahead, largely synchronized policy rate hikes by major central banks such

 as the Fed and the ECB may cause the global economy to register a sharper

 slowdown, undermine global financial stability, and increase downside risks to the

 world economy. In addition, a string of factors, including the US-China conflict

 affecting the development of globalization, extreme weather events, the ongoing

 war between Russia and Ukraine, and the European energy crisis, could weigh on

 commodity prices, adding to uncertainties surrounding global inflation trends. 

 II. Domestic economic and financial conditions

 1. Against a background of diminished impact from the domestic pandemic waves

 and a gradual lifting of lockdown restrictions in recent months, the unemployment

 rate decreased further, the number of employed persons edged up, and private

 consumption steadily recovered. However, sapped by weaker global final demand

 and ongoing inventory destocking, Taiwan's exports contracted for the third

 consecutive month, which in turn dampened business sentiment and constrained

 private investment. The Bank expects the pace of economic growth to slow notably

 in the fourth quarter this year and downgrades its forecast of Taiwan's GDP growth

 rate to 2.91% for the year as a whole (Appendix Table 1). 

18


-----

###### Looking ahead to next year, loosened social restrictions and border controls are

 likely to boost private consumption. Nonetheless, significant slowdown in global

 economic and trade activities would hamper export growth for Taiwan, while a

 cautious business outlook and inventory overhangs might prompt firms to defer

 investment plans or shrink capital expenditure, weighing on private investment.

 The Bank expects the economic expansion to moderate to a pace of 2.53% in 2023. . 

 2. Since the middle of the year, international prices of raw materials such as crude oil

 and grains have softened and domestic prices of food such as vegetables and fruit

 have posted smaller gains; as a result, the annual growth rate of consumer price

 index (CPI) trended downwards and registered 2.35% in November. However, the

 core CPI (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items) annual growth rate

 remained elevated, reaching 2.86% in November. For the first eleven months of

 the year, the annual growth rates of CPI and core CPI averaged 2.97% and 2.60%,

 respectively. For the year as a whole, the Bank forecasts the inflation rate and the

 core inflation rate to be 2.93% and 2.59%, respectively (Appendix Table 2).

 Looking ahead to next year, global supply chain gridlocks would likely be resolved

 and markets expect crude oil and other raw material prices to trend lower than this

 year. The Bank forecasts the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to drop to

 1.88% and 1.87%, respectively, in 2023. External forecasts by domestic and

 foreign institutions also project Taiwan's inflation rate to come down next year. 

 3. Banks' excess reserves stayed around NT$60 billion on average in recent months.

 For the first ten months of the year, the annual growth rate of bank loans and

 investments and that of M2 (measured on a daily average basis) were 7.55% and

 7.54%, respectively. Alongside the Bank's monetary tightening, interest rates on

 bank deposits and loans turned higher and money market rates showed an across
 the-board uptrend.

 III. Monetary policy decision: Raising the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points

 In today's meeting, the Board considered the following assessment of economic and

 financial conditions at home and abroad. Although the domestic inflation rate

 declined in recent months, it is expected to remain above 2% this year before

 dropping to below 2% next year. Meanwhile, as domestic exports and investment

 face headwinds from the anticipated global economic downturn compounded by

 rising downside risks, Taiwan's economy is expected to grow at a slower pace next

19

###### year. The Board judged that a policy rate hike and continued monetary policy

 tightening will help rein in domestic inflation expectations, thereby attaining the

 policy objectives of promoting price stability and fostering sound economic and

 financial development on the whole. 

 At the meeting today, the Board decided to raise the discount rate, the rate on

 refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125

 percentage points each to 1.75%, 2.125%, and 4%, respectively, effective December

 16, 2022.

 Looking ahead to next year, with the world to be confronted by intensifying

 downside economic risks and the path of global inflation still shrouded by

 uncertainty despite some signs of pressures subduing, the Bank will closely monitor

 the trajectory of monetary policy moves in major economies, changes in

 international raw material prices, geopolitical risks, and extreme weather events, to

 assess their implications for domestic price trends, and economic and financial

 conditions. Accordingly, the Bank may adjust its monetary policy in a timely

 manner as warranted, so as to fulfill the statutory duties of maintaining financial and

 price stability, and fostering economic development within the scope of the above

 objectives.    

 IV. The Bank's recent round of selective credit control measures, implemented with four

 successive amendments from December 2020, has so far successfully bolstered

 credit risk management of the banking sector. In the year to date, banks' construction

 and housing loans have expanded at a slower pace, real estate loan concentration

 has improved slightly, and the level of non-performing loan ratio for real estate

 lending has stayed low. The effectiveness of the existing credit controls have also

 been amplified by the Bank's monetary policy tightening. Meanwhile, housing

 market transactions have decreased considerably in recent months amid slower

 economic growth and a volatile stock market, as well as the government's cross
 agency efforts under the Healthy Real Estate Market Plan. The Bank will

 continuously monitor the developments in housing credit and market, review the

 implementation of the selective credit control measures, and make adjustments as

 needed in order to promote financial stability and sound banking operations.

 V. The NT dollar exchange rate is in principle determined by market forces.

 Nonetheless, when seasonal or irregular factors (such as massive inflows or

###### outflows of short-term capital) lead to excess volatility and disorderly movements

 in the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial

 stability, the Bank, in line with its statutory mandates, will step in to maintain an

 orderly market.
