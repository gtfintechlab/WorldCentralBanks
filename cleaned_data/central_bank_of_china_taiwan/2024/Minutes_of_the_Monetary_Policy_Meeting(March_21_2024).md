##### AGENDA: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND

 MONETARY POLICY DECISION

 I. Staff Review of Economic and Financial Conditions 

###### 1. International Economic and Financial Conditions

 In the intermeeting period since December 2023, the Global Manufacturing PMI

 (Purchasing Managers’ Index) returned to the expansion territory from January onwards

 while the Services PMI, having bottomed out, was expected to expand at a faster pace.

 For year 2024 as a whole, it was projected that the world would see sector expansion for

 manufacturing and services, and the world trade volume growth would also rebound.

 However, with major central banks such as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the

 European Central Bank (ECB) maintaining high policy rates, the global economy

 continued to experience tepid growth momentum. International institutions forecasted

 that the world economic growth rate would be slightly lower than 2023. 

 In regard to global commodity price trends since entering 2024, international oil

 prices swung upwards amid tensions in the Middle East and extension of the output cut

 by the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies,

 known as OPEC+. For year 2024, crude oil prices were projected to run slightly higher

 than last year according to international institutions. Meanwhile, year-to-date declines

 were recorded for grain prices, but the price of cocoa reached a historical high and

 industrial metal prices turned upwards, leading to an uptrend in the Reuters/Jefferies

 CRB index, a global commodities benchmark. 

 In terms of inflation, though labor market tightness in advanced economies would

 likely ease, services prices were buoyed by continued wage growth in the US, Europe,

 and Japan. Combined with a receding higher base effect, it was expected that global

 inflation would come down slowly this year. 

 In respect of monetary policy moves by major central banks, the US Fed and the

 ECB held policy rates steady in the year to date. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) embarked on

 policy normalization with a rate hike this week, ending the negative interest rate policy

 and abolishing yield curve control while maintaining a loose monetary policy stance.

 The People’s Bank of China, on the other hand, deployed more easing measures. 

2


-----

###### In the financial markets, recent indications by Fed and ECB officials refraining

 from beginning a rate cut soon and slower disinflation in the US and Europe combined

 to send the 10-year US and German government bond yields higher. The year-to-date

 strength in the US dollar index (DXY) was underpinned by strong US employment data

 and the change of market expectations towards a later onset of the Fed’s rate cuts, which

 led to a broad weakening in major currencies against the US dollar. Major stock markets

 across the world mostly gained ground, with particularly strong rallies among

 technology stocks.

 Looking ahead, the global economic outlook is confronted by many uncertainties,

 as these factors, including monetary policy paths of major central banks (such as the

 timing of a Fed or ECB pivot to easing, developments after the BoJ ended negative

 interest rate policy, etc.), spillover effect of China’s economic slowdown, and global

 economic fragmentations and supply chain restructuring, could all affect trade,

 economic, and financial development of the world. In addition, geopolitical risks and

 climate change may further heighten uncertainty surrounding global inflation. 

 2. Domestic Economic and Financial Conditions

 (1) Economic situation

 Recently, the domestic leading and coincident indicators continued rising. While

 Taiwan’s Manufacturing PMI remained in contraction territory, it rose for the third

 month in a row, with the six-month outlook subindex pointing to expansion for the first

 time in 21 months. The Non-Manufacturing Index (NMI) and its six-month outlook

 subindex remained expansionary, pointing to sustained economic recovery and

 manufacturing growth momentum picking up.

 Looking at the components of domestic GDP growth, exports grew at an annual

 rate of 9.7% during the first two months of the year, benefiting from a demand boom for

 AI and other emerging technology applications as ICT/AV (information,

 communication and technology, and audio-visual) products recorded positive growth

 while the other major export product categories all showed contraction. For the year as

 a whole, export growth would continue to receive a boost from the steadily rising

3


-----

###### demand for emerging tech applications, as well as benefiting from an increase in

 inbound travel. Considering also a lower base effect, the Bank forecasted solid real

 export growth in 2024. 

 In respect of private investment, an improving outlook for goods exports would

 likely drive private investment in 2024. In addition, firms continued to step up efforts in

 net-zero energy transition and airlines were looking to further expand their fleets, which

 would also help build up growth momentum for private investment. Nonetheless, major

 companies remained cautious in devising investment strategies given the uncertainties

 about the global economic outlook. On balance, the Bank expected real private

 investment to resume modest positive growth in 2024. 

 Private consumption, on the other hand, was forecasted to continue expanding in

 real terms as the domestic economic recovery bolstered consumer confidence, along

 with brisk trading in the stock market. 

 In the labor market, recent data showed the total number of employed persons

 trended up month by month, the unemployment rate continued falling, and the number

 of furloughed workers also declined. Regarding sector employment, the manufacturing

 payroll employment showed slower declines in January 2024, indicating a gradual

 recovery, whereas the number of employees on services payroll continued rising.

 Regarding monthly earnings, total nominal earnings of workers in the industrial and

 services sectors posted mild growth in January, increasing by 2.32% and 2.21%

 respectively. 

 Overall, the Bank forecasted Taiwan’s economy to expand by 3.22% year on year

 in 2024, higher than 1.31% of 2023, based on the expectation of exports and private

 investment resuming positive growth and private consumption continuing rising.

 Compared to the previous forecast made in December 2023, there was a slight upward

 revision by 0.10 percentage points, reflecting increased contribution from net foreign

 demand and private consumption. 

 In addition, the Bank estimated that Taiwan would have a negative output gap in

 2024. Major institutions at home and abroad expected Taiwan’s economy to grow by

 2.69%-3.70% in 2024.

###### (2) Financial conditions 

 Demand for currency increased prior to the Lunar New Year Holidays, which fell

 in February this year. After the Holidays, though, currency flowed back into the banking

 system and market liquidity tightness eased, with bank interest rates and money market

 rates exhibiting mild fluctuations. For the first two months of the year, excess reserves

 of banks averaged around NT$54.9 billion. 

 In terms of bank credit, as the annual growth rate of housing loans had picked up

 since the second half of 2023 and Taiwan’s export growth stabilized in the fourth

 quarter, bank loans and investments gradually rose to an annual pace of 6.58% by the

 end of 2023. For the first two months of 2024, the average annual growth rate of bank

 loans and investments rose further to 7.19%. 

 Regarding money supply, the daily average annual growth rate of the monetary

 aggregate M2 dropped from 7.48% in 2022 to 6.25% in 2023, returning to the 2.5%
 6.5% reference range. Partly reflecting faster year-on-year growth in bank loans and

 investments so far this year, the M2 annual growth rate edged back up to 5.59% in

 February and averaged 5.51% for the first two months of 2024. 

 In the housing market, several factors drove a rebound in housing transactions in

 the second half of 2023, including the introduction of the government’s updated version

 of the Preferential Housing Loans for the Youth program, an increase in ownership

 transfers of newly-completed presale housing units, and a lower base effect from 2022.

 For housing prices, the annual growth rate broadly trended downwards. Regarding the

 housing market outlook, construction and real estate businesses turned more optimistic

 while the number of banks with cautious sentiment decreased. 

 Since the Bank strengthened its selective credit control measures by amending

 relevant regulations five times beginning December 2020, the annual growth rate of

 construction loans extended by banks had been declining. However, the rebound in

 housing market transactions since the second half of 2023 drove the annual growth rate

 of housing loans upward. The resultant rise in the annual growth rate of real estate

 lending also caused this loan bracket to maintain a high share in banks’ total lending.

5


-----

###### Meanwhile, the non-performing ratios of banks’ housing loans and construction loans

 both remained low, indicating sound credit quality. 

 (3) Price trends 

 The annual growth rate of the consumer price index (CPI) rose from 1.80% in

 January 2024 to 3.08% in February mainly reflecting holiday charges commonly seen

 in some services around the Lunar New Year as well as group travel fee hikes. Similarly,

 the annual growth rate of the core CPI (i.e., excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy

 items) also rose from 1.65% in January to 2.90% in February on account of the Lunar

 New Year Holidays. Overall, the pace of disinflation remained slow. 

 During the first two months of the year, the CPI rose by 2.43% on average over the

 same period last year. Of this increase, 65% was attributed to price rises in food

 (particularly fruit, food away from home, and meat) and entertainment services, as well

 as higher rents, with a combined contribution of 1.59 percentage points.

 By frequency of purchase, the items purchased at least once a month and the 17

 CPI-basket top staple items both recorded higher price rises than the overall CPI rises

 during the first two months of the year. This shaped a more acute sense of price rises in

 staple items among consumers. 

 Meanwhile, the price declines in international raw material prices led to continued

 negative growth in the February import prices and prices of domestic sales excluding

 imports, indicating further easing in imported inflation pressures and supporting a

 stabilization in domestic commodity prices.

 By type of items, the annual growth rate of the commodity CPI registered 2.22%

 for the Jan.-Feb. period, whereas that of the services CPI posted a faster increase at

 2.62%. 

 For the outlook of the entire year, domestic commodity prices would likely rise

 mildly given that international oil prices were forecasted by foreign institutions to go

 modestly higher than 2023. Domestic services prices were expected to show a slower

 increase owing to a high base effect. However, considering the influence of the planned

6


-----

###### hike in domestic electricity tariff in April this year, the Bank revised upward its 2024

 forecasts for the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to 2.16% and 2.03%, albeit with

 both inflation rates slowly coming down quarter by quarter this year. Headline inflation

 forecasts by major domestic and foreign institutions ranged between 1.50% and 2.50%

 for year 2024. 

 Key factors affecting the future path of domestic prices this year include the

 following. Upside pressures could arise from (1) elevated fruit prices, as supply declines

 owing to the lagged effect of last year’s typhoons and torrential rain; (2) a food price

 uptrend, including food away from home and meat; (3) higher rent; (4) hikes in prices

 of hotel stays and group travel fees in response to strong demand among domestic

 consumers for leisure and entertainment services; (5) a universal hike in domestic

 electricity tariffs this year. On the other hand, downside pressures could come from

 reductions in prices of mobile phones and other communication devices. 

 3. Considerations for Monetary Policy Decision-Making

 (1) The inflation rate is expected to gradually come down quarter by quarter this year;

 for the year as a whole, the inflation rate would register lower than last year.

 However, as inflation has been relatively elevated since 2021 and the electricity tariff

 hike is to take effect in April, they could fuel higher inflation expectations. 

 A. The annual growth rate of the CPI was 1.97% in 2021, 2.95% in 2022, and 2.49%

 in 2023 and is projected by the Bank to be 2.16% in 2024. 

 B. The Bank’s 2024 inflation projections were revised upwards on account of the

 planned electricity tariff hike in April. The revised forecasts for the annual CPI and

 core CPI growth rates were 2.16% and 2.03%, lower than the 2.49% and 2.58%

 registered last year. 

 (2) The domestic economic growth is expected to pick up pace this year. The Bank

 slightly revised upward its forecast for the GDP growth rate to 3.22%, higher than

 the 1.31% posted last year.

###### II. Proposition and Decision about Monetary Policy 

**1.** **Policy Propositions: To raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured**

###### loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points to

 2%, 2.375%, and 4.25%, respectively 

 2. Board members decided to raise the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points. Related

 discussions are summarized as follows.

 One board member supported a rate hike by 0.125 percentage points. The member

 noted that inflation expectation is one of the vital considerations in monetary

 policymaking, and strongly entrenched inflation expectations are difficult to contain.

 Given that Taiwan’s CPI annual growth rate has come close to or exceeded 2% for four

 consecutive years, the inflation expectation problem should be heeded. In particular, the

 scheduled April electricity tariff hike could induce a new wave of upward price

 adjustments among businesses and stoke inflation expectations. Since not talking about

 it does not make the problem nonexistent, there needs to be countermeasures to rein it

 in. A 0.125 percentage point rate hike would have an announcement effect that

 demonstrates the Bank takes the inflation issue very seriously. Going forward, if

 inflation is still elevated, there is a possibility of further rate hikes to fulfill the Bank’s

 overarching mission of and unwavering efforts in maintaining price stability. 

 One board member pointed out that Taiwan’s GDP growth was estimated to

 advance at a solid pace this year, whereas price rises in food away from home and

 housing rent remained unabated. Adding in the effect of the coming electricity tariff

 hike, Taiwan’s annual CPI inflation rate could exceed 2% for the third year in a row.

 Against this backdrop, raising the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points would not

 only show the Bank was taking the inflation issue seriously but also demonstrate the

 intention to contain inflation expectations. Therefore, the member concurred with the

 rate hike proposition. Another board member also supported the proposition, stating

 that, given how conscious the general public could be of price increases, a rate hike

 policy would be a good move if it helps tame price upswings.

 One board member noted that Taiwan’s labor market conditions remained stable,

 but the real total earnings of payroll employees posted negative growth last year for the

8


-----

###### first time in seven years, an issue attributable to elevated inflation. In the fight against

 inflation, rent and food-away-from-home prices were still rising. Given the downward

 price stickiness of rent, if housing prices continue climbing and push up rent along the

 way, it would pose an even greater challenge for price stability. Likewise, downward

 price stickiness of food away from home also warrants attention as its annual growth

 rate has stayed elevated, and a faster hike in food-away-from-home prices could make

 it harder for inflation pressures to ease anytime soon. Therefore, raising the policy rates

 by 0.125 percentage points would be a good move because it shows the Bank’s stance

 on mitigating upside pressures on prices. Meanwhile, the Bank still needs to keep close

 watch on the issue of persistent inflation. 

 Another board director stated that Taiwan’s annual CPI growth rate has remained

 above 2% for some time, mainly owing to price rises in food away from home and rent.

 The CPI annual growth rate of food away from home has gone above 4% every month

 since February 2022, except for February 2023. The longer the uptrend persists, the

 worse it is for public inflation expectations. Meanwhile, the CPI annual growth rate of

 rent continued to exceed 2% every month since July 2022, and higher retail store rent

 costs could feed into food-away-from-home prices. However, considering that a larger

 policy rate hike could cause property owners to pass the additional interest burden

 through to tenants and thus push up rent, the proposed hike by 0.125 percentage points

 seemed appropriate. 

 One board director pointed out that Taiwan’s real interest rate would be negative

 when subtracting the CPI inflation rate from the nominal policy rate, indicating that

 there remains room for policy rate hikes. In the past, changes to oil or electricity rates

 were hardly reflected in the CPI readings; it is necessary to start taking them into

 account, with close attention to be paid to their potential effects on inflation expectations

 as they could in turn affect actual inflation. Given that a rate hike would help keep

 inflation expectations anchored, the member showed support to the proposition of hiking

 the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points.

 One board director observed that, with the policy rates kept unchanged since it was

 last raised by 0.125 percentage points in March 2023, the fact that the 2023 annual CPI

 growth rate remained high could somehow indicate insufficient monetary tightening had

9


-----

###### led to persistently elevated inflation. On top of that, the coming electricity tariff hike

 could further fuel public inflation expectations in 2024. Moreover, unlike major

 economies, Taiwan has a negative real interest rate. Therefore, while a policy rate hike

 is the right move amid solid economic growth and stable labor market conditions, a 0.25

 percentage point hike should be the appropriate pace of tightening in line with what is

 commonly adopted among central banks. Still, the member agreed with today’s 0.125

 percentage point rate hike proposition. 

 One board member gave the opinion that while deposit rates at banks usually track

 central bank policy rate changes, the pace of banks’ adjustments varies across countries.

 Given the importance of deposit rates to households, the member suggested looking at

 the real interest rate from the perspective of depositors. Take the average inflation rate

 of the past twelve months (March 2022 to February 2023) and the one-year deposit rate,

 with today’s proposed rate hike dismissed, then a cross-country comparison would show

 that the real interest rates were negative in not only Taiwan, but also the US,

 Switzerland, Hong Kong, the euro area, the UK, Singapore, and Japan, with the level of

 Taiwan’s real interest rate higher than the aforementioned economies. And after today’s

 0.125 percentage point policy rate hike, combined with the projected slowdown in the

 domestic inflation rate, Taiwan’s real interest rate is expected to move toward positive

 territory. 

 One board director stated that Taiwan is currently facing greater price-related

 pressures than many other economies, mainly because of relatively smaller price

 increases in oil and electricity rates in the past. In spite of tax policy actions by the

 Ministry of Finance to help keep prices steady, Taiwan Power Company and the CPC

 Corp. had been struggling with heavy losses. According to several domestic institutions,

 a 10% hike on average in the electricity tariff would push the 2024 CPI annual growth

 rate to 2.2%-2.4%. The member thus supported the 0.125 percentage point rate hike as

 a preemptive move. Although the size of the hike alone may not bring the inflation rate

 back down to below 2%, it would help lower public inflation expectations and

 demonstrate the Bank’s resolution in combating inflation through monetary tightening

 at a time when Taiwan is under inflationary pressures. 

 One board member remarked on recent developments in different economic

10


-----

###### sectors. The services sector grew at a steady pace and exports continued expanding, with

 robust growth in exports of chips and servers in the AI-related supply chain; but this

 was not the case for every industry. For instance, exports of non-AI servers and mobile

 phones were tepid. This indicated a growing polarizing in Taiwan’s manufacturing

 sector. With the looming electricity tariff hike already set to push up production costs,

 a policy rate hike would also increase funding costs and could cause more hardship for

 these companies. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to raise the policy rates in

 today’s meeting. 

 One board member, in support of the rate hike proposition, stated that ICT/AV

 export growth in the Jan.-Feb. period increased twice as fast year on year on the back of

 emerging tech applications such as AI, whereas other products recorded negative

 growth. Furthermore, today’s rate hike was primarily aimed at containing domestic

 inflation expectations, but there is a possibility of creating a dilemma it adversely

 impacts some sectors in the process. 

 Another board director pointed out that the direct and indirect effects of an

 electricity tariff hike might not be sizeable, but inflation expectations could gather steam

 and would not be easy to contain once they take off. Meanwhile, a rate hike increases

 funding costs, likely hindering corporate investment, exports, and private consumption.

 Considering that domestic economic growth picked up pace but was not yet heated to

 the extent of requiring aggressive rate hikes to rein it in, the member viewed that smaller

 rate hikes at the current juncture would probably pack a minor punch while still making

 an announcement effect to show that the Bank is committed to combating inflation if

 the inflation rate cannot meaningfully come down to the low level of around 1% as it

 has been. Therefore, the member supported a rate hike by 0.125 percentage points.

 Furthermore, given the US dollar strength and the resultant NTD-USD depreciation in

 the year to date, a small rate hike would somewhat relieve the pressure on the NTD

 exchange rate. 

 Another board director, also supporting the rate hike proposition, pointed out that

 the Bank’s forecasts for this year’s CPI and core CPI annual growth rates were both

 higher than the previous forecasts when the Board last met in December 2023. In respect

 of the electricity tariff hike, it would not only have a direct impact but also create a chain

11


-----

###### reaction by pushing up costs across business sectors; for example, electricity-intensive

 industries could pass the increased bill costs to consumers. Meanwhile, the domestic

 economy was expected to post steady growth this year as forecasted by the Bank, and

 the unemployment rate continued trending down in January, hitting the lowest monthly

 record in 24 years. Against this backdrop, raising the policy rates would help promote

 price stability without hampering economic growth. 

 Another board director supported the 0.125 percentage point hike and remarked on

 the inflation rate. According to the Bank’s 2024 quarterly forecast values, Taiwan’s

 annual CPI growth rate would exceed 2% during the first two quarters of the year before

 coming down to slightly below 2% in the third and fourth quarters, albeit all close to the

 Bank’s mid-term monitoring range of 0%-2%. The Bank would still need to keep a close

 eye on the outlook and forecasts of inflation. 

 3. Monetary Policy Decision: 

 The board directors decided to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of

 secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage

 points to 2%, 2.375%, and 4.25%, respectively. 

 Voting for the proposition: Chin-Long Yang, Tsui-Yun Chuang, Tzung-Ta

 the post-meeting press conference, together with the Supplementary Materials for the

 Post-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank.

##### Press Release  March 21, 2024

 Monetary Policy Decision of the Board Meeting (2024Q1)

###### I. Global economic and financial conditions

 Since the Board met in December last year, the global manufacturing and services

 sectors have witnessed faster growth, and trade activity has gradually recovered.

 Nevertheless, major central banks in the US and Europe have maintained high policy

 rates, which have continued to restrain global economic growth momentum. Inflation

 rates in major economies have come down at a slower pace as services inflation

 remains elevated. International institutions projected the world economy to

 experience slightly milder growth than last year and the inflation rate to decline

 further this year. 

 While central banks in the US and Europe held policy rates steady from the second

 half of 2023 onwards, the BoJ moved towards monetary policy normalization this

 week with a rate hike and unwinding of its negative interest rate and yield curve

 control policies, yet still maintaining an accommodative monetary policy stance.

 Market investors expect that the US and European central banks would pivot to rate

 cuts, whereas the BoJ would likely raise policy rates again. Market attention to major

 central banks' monetary policy moves has induced greater volatility in international

 financial markets.

 Looking ahead, the global economic and financial outlooks are still shrouded in many

 uncertainties, such as the timing for the US and European central banks to adjust their

 monetary tightening stance, developments in Japan's monetary policy, spillover

 effects of China's economic slowdown, and global economic fragmentation and

 supply chain restructuring. In addition, geopolitical risks and climate change could

 also affect the progress of global disinflation.

 II. Domestic economic and financial conditions

 1. In recent months, Taiwan's exports recorded continuous growth, underpinned

 by stabilizing global final demand and booming business for artificial

 intelligence and other emerging technology applications. In regard to

 domestic demand, private consumption gained momentum from stronger

 consumer confidence amid an economic recovery, whereas investment

 sentiment remained lackluster as reflected by a sustained contraction in

 capital equipment imports. In the labor market, the number of employed

13


-----

###### persons continued increasing in recent months, the unemployment rate

 dropped further, and the number of furloughed workers also decreased. 

 For the year as a whole, the prospects of global goods trade growth firming

 up and emerging tech applications gaining traction would likely fuel export

 growth and bolster private investment. Meanwhile, private consumption is

 expected to continue growing. The Bank therefore slightly upgraded the

 forecast for Taiwan's 2024 GDP growth rate to 3.22% (see Appendix Table 1

 for the forecasts by major institutions), which was higher than 1.31% in 2023. 

 2. For the first two months of the year, the annual growth rate of the consumer

 price index (CPI) averaged 2.43%, mainly reflecting increases in prices of

 food (particularly fruit and food away from home) and entertainment services

 and rising housing rent. The core CPI (excluding vegetables, fruit, and energy

 items) continued slowing down gradually, with an average annual growth rate

 of 2.27% during the same period. 

 For the outlook of this year, the CPI inflation rate would likely slow down

 from last year given a mild rise in commodity prices, as international oil

 prices were projected by international institutions to edge up from the

 previous year, and a smaller increase in services prices owing to a high base

 effect. Taking into account a proposed hike in electricity rates in April this

 year, the Bank revised up the forecasts for the CPI and core CPI inflation

 rates this year to 2.16% and 2.03%, respectively, lower than 2.49% and 2.58%

 last year (see Appendix Table 2 for the forecasts by major institutions).

 3. Domestic market liquidity was ample and short and long-term market rates

 fluctuated within a narrow range in recent months. For the first two months

 of the year, banks' excess reserves averaged around NT$54.9 billion; the

 annual growth rate of M2 (measured on a daily average basis) and that of

 bank loans and investments averaged 5.51% and 7.19% respectively.

 III. The Board decided to raise the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points

 At the meeting today, the Board considered the balance of incoming data on

 economic and financial conditions at home and abroad. The domestic

 inflation rate was expected to slowly come down quarter by quarter this year.

 However, given that inflation has stayed at a relatively higher level since

 2021 and that a proposed electricity rate hike might be implemented in April

14


-----

###### this year, inflation expectations might shift upwards. Meanwhile, the

 economic growth would likely pick up this year. Against this background, in

 order to contain domestic inflation expectations, the Board judged that a rate

 hike would help sustain price stability and foster sound economic and

 financial development on the whole.  

 The Board decided to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of

 secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125

 percentage points to 2%, 2.375%, and 4.25%, respectively, effective March

 22, 2024. 

 Going forward, the Bank will remain watchful of the evolving effects of

 electricity rate adjustments and energy transition for net-zero emissions on

 domestic inflation. The Bank will also stay attentive to incoming information

 regarding monetary policy paths of major central banks, risks from China's

 economic downturn, international raw material prices, geopolitical risks,

 extreme weather, etc. The Bank will assess their implications for domestic

 economic activity and financial conditions and adjust its monetary policy in

 a timely manner as warranted, so as to fulfill the statutory duties of

 maintaining financial and price stability and fostering economic development

 within the scope of the aforementioned objectives.

 IV. The Bank has made five amendments to its selective credit control measures since

 December 2020, which have helped enhance banks' risk management associated

 with real estate lending and curb an excessive flow of credit resources into the real

 estate market. In addition, the Bank's gradual approach to monetary tightening since

 March 2022 has also helped reinforce the effectiveness of the selective credit

 control measures. As a result, data since the introduction of the selective credit

 controls have shown that growth in construction loans of all banks has continued

 slowing and credit quality of real estate lending remains sound as the non
 performing loan ratio stays low. 

 Nevertheless, growth in housing loans as well as loans to the real estate

 sector has picked up as housing market transactions resurged, and the ratio

 of real estate lending to total lending of all banks remains elevated. Therefore,

 the Bank will continue reviewing the status of banks' real estate lending and

 the effectiveness of the selective credit controls, closely monitor potential

 impacts of real estate sector-related policies on the housing market, and

15


-----

###### adjust relevant measures as needed in order to promote financial stability and

 sound banking operations. 

 V. The NT dollar exchange rate is in principle determined by market forces.

 Nonetheless, when irregular factors (such as massive inflows/outflows of short
 term capital) and seasonal factors lead to excess volatility or disorderly movements

 in the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial

 stability, the Bank, in accordance with its statutory duties, will step in to maintain

 an orderly market...
