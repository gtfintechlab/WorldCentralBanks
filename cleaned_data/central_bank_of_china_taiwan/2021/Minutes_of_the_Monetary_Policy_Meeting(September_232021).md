##### AGENDA: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND

 MONETARY POLICY DECISION

 I. Staff Review of Economic and Financial Conditions 

**1.** **International Economic and Financial Conditions**

As advanced economies accelerated vaccination rollout, relaxed pandemic-related

restrictions, and kept fiscal and monetary stimulus measures in place, coupled with a lower base

effect, international institutions forecasted a significant expansion for the global economy this

year before slightly moderating next year. Meanwhile, with the WTO Goods Trade Barometer

recently climbing to a new high, the growth rate of world trade volume was also forecasted to

rebound markedly this year and edge down somewhat next year.

Hurricane disruptions to oil production in the Gulf of Mexico in late August, as well as

market expectations of a demand rebound as the pandemic eased, pushed international oil prices

back upwards. For this year as a whole, major institutions projected oil prices to rise higher

compared to last year, while a modest decline was forecasted for next year. Overall, global

commodity prices had posted an uptrend since July as international oil prices fluctuated at a

relatively high level and industrial metal prices were driven up by great demand.

In view of elevated international goods prices owing to rising global demand and persisting

supply chain bottlenecks, inflation forecasts for major economies this year were broadly higher

than those of the previous year but would turn lower next year. In recent months, these

economies witnessed a more significant inflation upturn but judged it to be transitory.

Looking at policy changes of major economies since the Bank’s last Board Meeting in

June, major central banks continued with monetary easing, maintaining policy rate levels and

keeping asset purchase programs in place, albeit with tapering signals from the US Federal

Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB). Meanwhile, major economies also

remained expansionary in terms of fiscal policy.

In global financial markets, government bond yields of the US and Germany climbed out

of the bottom as the Fed and the ECB signaled they might reduce bond-buying amid worries

about recent elevated inflation. Global equities seesawed at high levels and the US dollar index

rebounded, owing to intensifying financial risks in China and unclear path of the Fed’s tapering

plan.

Looking ahead, downside risks continue to loom over the global economic outlook,

including (1) uneven vaccination progress and a greater impact of the new virus strain, (2)

pressures for some advanced economies to gradually withdraw monetary easing, (3) potential

disasters owing to climate change and heightened geopolitical conflicts. Should these risks

materialize and/or intensify, they could dampen the global economic recovery and hamper

financial stability.

**2.** **Domestic Economic and Financial Conditions**

(1) Economic situation

The six-month outlook subindex under Taiwan’s Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing

Managers’ Index) in recent months pointed to further expansion, and the outlook subindex

under the Non-Manufacturing Index (NMI) rose back from July onwards as the domestic

COVID-19 cases dropped to a steady low. Both readings revealed more positive business

sentiment.

Regarding external demand, rising global demand and raw material prices significantly

boosted export performance of major products in the year so far, with an increase by more than

20% for exports to each major market. In view of greater final demand benefiting from gradual

normalization of economic activity in major economies, the Bank expected Taiwan’s exports

to enjoy solid real growth in the second half of 2021 and to expand significantly for the year as

a whole before moderating next year.

Regarding domestic demand, Taiwanese tech giants and related supply chain firms stepped

up capital expenditure, and investment plans for 5G network technology and for maritime and

air transport equipment continued to move along. The Bank thus projected solid real growth in

private investment for the second half of the year as well as the entire year, and expected mild

real growth next year. In terms of private consumption, the Bank viewed that a partial lift of

restrictions amid an improving pandemic situation, the upcoming implementation of a new

consumption stimulus program, and the effect of pent-up demand would all combine to give

private consumption a firmer footing in the second half of the year. Real private consumption

growth was forecasted to advance at a mild pace this year and gather steam next year.

In the labor market, albeit still high, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.24% in August.

3


-----

The number of employed persons remained below the pre-pandemic level, with the services

sector losing more jobs than the other sectors.

With the solid economic growth already registered in the first half of the year and a 3.43%

expansion expected by the Bank for the second half of the year thanks to increased investment

by tech firms and the government’s private consumption stimulus program, the Bank forecasted

Taiwan’s economy to grow by 5.75% this year and by 3.45% next year. Meanwhile, the growth

projections by major institutions ranged between 5.00% and 6.40% for this year and between

2.50% and 4.50% for the year of 2022.

(2) Financial conditions

Market liquidity was ample in August 2021. Short-term interest rates fluctuated narrowly

as the pandemic eased. Banks’ average excess reserves stayed around a level of over NT$60

billion in recent months.

With respect to bank credit conditions, extended export strength continued to buttress

corporate demand for funds while banks’ policy loans to pandemic-impacted small and

medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) also increased. As a result, total bank lending and SME

lending both registered steady growth. In regard to money supply, the annual growth rate of the

monetary aggregate M2 trended down in August owing to a higher base effect and slower

growth in transaction deposits and averaged 8.91% for the Jan.-Aug. period.

In the housing market, the second quarter price index for new housing projects edged down

from the first quarter while that for existing homes moved upwards. For the first seven months

of the year, the number of ownership transfers for buildings and for land increased by 16.0%

and 15.2% year on year (yoy). More specifically, the six Special Municipalities combined saw

a 10.2% yoy increase in building ownership transfers during the Jan.-Aug. period, albeit with a

22.8% yoy decline in the month of August as the domestic pandemic inhibited property

transactions. Trading in the housing market looked likely to stabilize as the pandemic eased

recently. Banks continued to hold a positive outlook for the residential housing market in major

cities.

Data as of the end of July 2021 showed an annual increase of 11.6% in total real estate

lending. By type of loans, housing loan growth slowed slightly to 10.2% year on year, while

construction loan growth gathered pace to 17.1% owing mainly to a 26.7% increase in land

4


-----

loans. At the end of July 2021, the ratio of total land loans to construction loans also rose to

61.7%, compared to 59.3% at the end of December 2020. In addition, the average loan-to-value

(LTV) ratio for newly-extended land loans of domestic banks rose from 42.6% in December

2020 to 63.6% in July 2021.

Furthermore, the number of natural persons having two outstanding housing loans

continued rising; as of the end of June 2021, that number increased by 9.2% compared to the

end of March 2016, higher than the 5.1% increase in the number of those with three or more

outstanding housing loans. Data as of the end of June also revealed that a disproportionately

large number of housing loans in this group were collateralized against property in a certain

areas, with 82.6% of the collateral locating in the six Special Municipalities, Hsinchu County,

and Hsinchu City.

Given the still fast increase in real estate lending, its share in total bank lending rose lightly

to 36.7% at the end of July this year. At present, risk management associated with real estate

lending was considered somewhat adequate, as the construction loan ratio of domestic banks

stood at 26.89% at the end of July 2021, below the 30% cap prescribed in Article 72-2 of the

Banking Act.[2] Meanwhile, the ratio of non-performing housing loans extended by domestic

banks remained low at 0.11%.

(3) Price trends

As of August 2021, international prices for crude oil and other raw materials remained

elevated, and domestic vegetables prices soared on damage from torrential rain, sending the

annual growth rate of consumer price index (CPI) to 2.36%. However, the rise was attributable

to such transitory forces as weather-induced disruptions. The core CPI posted an annual growth

rate of 1.33%, considered to be mild.

The average annual growth rate of the CPI stood at 1.64% for the first eight months of the

year, mainly because increases in domestic fuel prices amid international oil price surges,

airfares owing to greater demand, and prices of vegetables. In the year so far, raw material price

uptrends and shipping fee surges pushed up import prices and triggered imported inflationary

pressures, albeit with signs of moderating in recent months.

2 According to Article 72-2 of the Banking Act, the total amount of loans extended for residential construction

and construction for business purposes by a commercial bank shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the
aggregate of such commercial bank’s deposits and bank debentures issued at the time such loans is extended.

5


-----

The Bank’s survey for inflation expectations found that expectations of investment trust

companies were broadly steady, while an increased share of businesses expected the CPI annual

growth rate to register between 1.5% and 1.99% in the following 12 months. Both results

showed that 80% of the respondents expected the CPI inflation rate to stay below 2% in the

same period, indicating still mild inflation expectations.

In view of the transitory weather effects, the Bank estimated that the CPI annual growth

rate would edge up in the third quarter, though still on a downtrend in the longer term.

Meanwhile, the core CPI annual growth rate would likely decline further. The Bank forecasted

Taiwan’s CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to be 1.70% and 1.17% this year and to both

drop to 0.92% next year as international oil prices stabilize. Meanwhile, major institutions

projected Taiwan’s inflation to register between 1.50% and 2.03% this year and between 0.89%

and 1.90% next year.

Taiwan’s own five-year inflation expectations were also mild. In addition, 5-year inflation

expectations by international institutions ranged between 1.4% and 1.6% for Taiwan.

**3.** **Considerations for Monetary Policy**

(1) Considerations for the policy rate decision

A. The recent upswing in domestic inflation was considered to be transient. Inflation was

expected to be mild this year and the inflation outlook pointed to a downtrend next year. The

CPI and core CPI annual growth rates were forecasted by the Bank to reach 1.70% and

1.17% this year and to both drop to 0.92% next year.

B. The global economic recovery continued forward, albeit with many uncertainties.

C. With the domestic coronavirus outbreak under control, the gradual recovery of the

domestically-oriented services sector and stabilizing private consumption were expected to

keep the economy on the path of mild growth in the second half of 2021 and in 2022. The

Bank forecasted Taiwan’s economy to expand by 3.43% in the second half of the year and

by 3.45% next year.

(2) Considerations for adjusting the selective credit control measures

A. To facilitate effective allocation and reasonable utilization of credit resources according to

the government’s Healthy Real Estate Market Plan, the Bank amended the _Regulations_

6


-----

_Governing the Extension of Mortgage Loans by Financial Institutions (hereinafter “the_

Regulations” or “Mortgage Loan Regulations”) in December 2020 and March 2021. Since

the enactment, banks have shown good compliance in extending the regulated mortgage

loans, and the LTV ratios also dropped significantly. However, there was still a notable

uptrend in total real estate lending.

B. To preclude a disproportionate surge in mortgage credit, and to reinforce financial

institutions’ management of the credit risk associated with real estate lending, it would be

appropriate to further enhance the Mortgage Loan Regulations in the following direction:

(a) The number of natural persons holding two home loans continued rising, with a majority of

the collateralized property located in specific areas, including Taipei City, New Taipei City,

Taoyuan City, Taichung City, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, Hsinchu County, and Hsinchu

City. Removing the grace period from the loan terms for a natural person’s second home loan

taken out to purchase housing in any of the aforementioned specific areas could help

mortgage borrowers avoid overleveraging and would also prompt banks to reinforce credit

risk management.

(b) Recent data showed that banks’ construction loans continued to post high annual growth

rates mainly owing to a surge in land loans. In addition, higher land prices pushed up by

property developers’ aggressive land acquisition played a key role in the rise in the prices of

newly-builts, which also drove existing housing prices upwards. By lowering the LTV ratio

cap for land loans from 65% to 60% (50% before the construction begins and the remaining

10% after that) is viewed to help prevent land loans from growing excessively.

(c) In line with the LTV tightening (and the precondition of construction commencement for full

loan disbursement) for land loans, the LTV ratio cap on idle industrial land mortgage loans

would also be lowered from 55% to 50%. In addition, the “well-defined period of time”

stated in the provisions of exemptions would be uniformly stipulated as “one year.” The

changes are viewed as helping galvanize meaningful progress in the construction and

development of the idle collateralized industrial land.

##### II. Proposition and Decision about Monetary Policy 

**1.** **Policy Proposition: To keep the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans,**

**and the rate on temporary accommodations unchanged at 1.125%, 1.5%, and 3.375%,**

7


-----

**respectively; to adjust the Bank’s selective credit control measures.**

2. Board members reached a unanimous vote to keep the policy rates unchanged and to adjust

the Bank’s selective credit control measures. Related discussions are summarized as follows.

(1) Discussion on the policy rate proposition

All board directors were in favor of the decision to keep policy rates unchanged at current

levels, citing mild inflation and uncertainties over the economic outlook as the main reasons.

One board director agreed with a rate hold, mainly because Taiwan’s economy outperformed

many other economies but would grow at a slower pace next year according to the Bank on

account of downside risks to the global economy. At present, domestic inflation posted a

temporary upturn but it was projected to trend down next year.

One board director noted that the US policy rates continued to stay unchanged and

uncertainties remained over the containment of the Delta variant of COVID-19 and the future

progress of domestic vaccination rollout, which combined to support a rate hold. Another board

director pointed out that the average annual CPI growth rate in the Jan.-Aug. period was

considered still mild, though the longer term development would need to be monitored;

meanwhile, the recent NT dollar appreciation would not justify a rate liftoff. On balance, a rate

hold would be appropriate.

One board director expressed the view that the central bank’s toolkit is no panacea. A

major factor behind the persistent low interest rates in Taiwan was ample liquidity, shaped by

excessive saving and deficient investment. Given an environment already flush with funds, a

rate hike could prod saving further up and induce capital inflows with some of those funds

potentially flowing into the real estate sector, carrying adverse implications for the sound

development of the housing market. All these were needed to be taken into account in monetary

policymaking. Meanwhile, recent appreciation in the NT dollar was built on solid fundamentals

of Taiwan’s economy, evident in the continued strong growth momentum in external demand.

However, considering that pandemic-hit SMEs, which had been given better funding access

under the Bank’s NT$400 billion-worth low interest facility in response to COVID-19, were

also susceptible to exchange rate pressures, it would not be appropriate to raise the policy rates

at the current juncture.

Several board directors also discussed inflation trends. One board director noted that the

8


-----

September meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) still viewed that

elevated inflation largely reflected transitory factors but did not completely dismiss concerns.

Therefore, the Bank should also continue to closely watch domestic inflation and stay alert.

Another board director stated that despite mild inflation at present, the Bank needs to heed the

future path of domestic inflation and conduct more research on inflation expectations and

survey methodology. The director suggested the Bank give guidance regarding the criteria

necessary to warrant a rate hike so as to bolster public confidence in the Bank’s ability to keep

inflation anchored.

One board director pointed out that structural factors holding down global inflation have

weakened somewhat; though still not radical in the near term, structural changes, once set off,

would have a greater effect in the coming years. Furthermore, it is important to study inflation

expectations. For instance, inflation expectations of households could well overshoot actual

inflation as the day-to-day shopping experience of goods and services tend to dictate public

expectations of inflation; household inflation expectations might be able to capture the tipping

point of structural changes in inflation. When the gap between headline and core inflation

readings widens, which is often discounted as a phenomenon reflecting temporary disruptions,

it could actually be an important sign preceding future structural inflation changes that could

be captured by households’ inflation expectations.

Several board directors gave their views on future monetary policy deliberations. One

board director noted that, despite the impact from the pandemic, Taiwan’s economic

fundamentals were stronger than many other economies. Meanwhile, the recent US FOMC

meeting suggested the Fed may start to reduce asset purchases later this year and possibly to

raise rates as soon as next year. Against this backdrop, Taiwan being a small open economy

should also begin to ponder over the appropriate timing of a rate liftoff so as to prepare itself

for the likely policy changes in advanced economies.

One board director pointed out that the effect from an earlier domestic COVID-19 flare
up had not fully receded, representing a lingering downside risk to the economy. Meanwhile,

inflation rose further, albeit judged to be transitory. While the current circumstances did not

warrant an inflation-fighting rate hike, the Bank would need to weigh up the effect of persisting

low interest rates on the economy and, when the timing is right, consider the possibility to raise

the policy rates.

9


-----

One board director remarked that domestic consumer price trends were relatively steady,

and a rate hike out of step with major economies could amplify the NTD strength. On balance,

it seemed the better approach would be to keep the policy rates unchanged. Perhaps the Bank

could start to mull a gradual rate liftoff next year if the US Fed begins to raise rates.

(2) Discussion on the proposition to adjust the selective credit control measures

All board directors were in favor of the adjustment of the selective credit control measures.

One board director pointed out that banks’ real estate lending had made up an increasingly

larger share in total bank lending. Among the components, the main contributor would be a

growing share in construction loans as a result of rising land loans, whereas the share of housing

loans changed modestly. As real estate developers were keen on buying more land, the ensuing

land price hikes also pushed up housing prices. In this view, it would be appropriate to lower

the LTV ratio ceiling for land loans.

One board director stated that although Taiwan’s often-watched housing price indices

showed a slower rise in the second quarter this year, a broad uptrend persisted, justifying the

adjustment proposition. Another board director noted the so-called “consolidated land and

housing income tax 2.0” entered into force not long ago, but recent data still showed excessively

high annual growth rates of building ownership transfers and land sales. In addition, the

proposed credit control adjustment was moderate. The director thus supported the adjustment

with the aim of cooling down an overheating property market but cautioned that the

effectiveness of such adjustment would need further monitoring. Another board director

remarked that the selective credit controls might not do much to tamp down housing prices. For

instance, the current housing boom in Southern Taiwan was actually due to a favorable outlook

bolstered by major investment projects such as new semiconductor plants.

Two board directors both said that the Bank had adjusted the control measures twice since

December 2020; hopefully this adjustment would also be well received by the market. Another

board director noted that the purpose of selective credit control is to foster a sound housing

market and promote financial stability, but the public might have doubts about the effectiveness

of this additional tightening, which could end up impairing the Bank’s credibility. In the future,

more thoughts will need to be put into how best to ensure a sound housing market.

One board director gave the opinion that, in the case of selective credit control, a

10


-----

progressive approach to brake gently would make the ride steadier. Moderate policy actions

might not reduce housing and land prices, but they could still be productive by markedly

reducing the pace of property price rises. In addition, the current upside pressures on housing

and land prices could have been partially fueled by the low interest rate environment. The Bank

tackled the housing price elevation by increasing the cost and limiting the source of funds for

property buyers via LTV ratio caps. Nevertheless, the most effective solution would be taxation

policies, albeit not an easy path for such policy changes to happen. Another board director noted

that a considerable part of the present housing price strength actually came from surging raw

material prices and wages that fed into the cost of building and construction. Raising the policy

rates while advanced economies stay put could prove futile in dampening housing prices and

even detrimental to the economy.

One board director pointed out that, in addition to the increases seen in housing prices and

housing loans, Taiwan’s household debt to GDP ratio had also gone high, with real estate

purchases the primary use of this debt buildup. Suppose the housing prices keep climbing and

real estate loans keep expanding, mortgage borrowers will face even heavier debt burdens once

the policy rates start rising. Therefore, selective credit control would be the right way to foster

a sound real estate market.

One board director expressed the view that selective credit control is not as potent and

effective as other types of measures in cooling the housing market. And it would need to be

deployed early in order to produce better results in restraining public expectations for housing

price rises. On the other hand, protracted monetary easing including keeping the policy rates

low has significant implications for the housing market. In addition, housing price rises could

impact financial stability, cause resource misallocation, and militate against fair distribution of

wealth. Some research found that the best way to stabilize the housing market is a mix of

macroprudential measures and interest rate policy. Policy rates are a blunt tool to address

housing market concerns; relying solely on interest rate adjustments to tame housing price rises

could create serious problems for other sectors in the economy. Nonetheless, this does not mean

the Bank should write off interest rate policy completely but perhaps it could consider a policy

mix of macroprudential measures and interest rate adjustment when warranted.

One board director noted an excessively high level of saving in Taiwan, some of which

has flowed into the property market. Housing price deviations have concerned the Bank mainly

11


-----

because it could indirectly affect financial stability. However, this issue involves not only

financial stability, but also housing justice, resource allocation, etc. Therefore, it requires

concerted cooperation with strong efforts to fight the battle on the various fronts of supply,

demand, and system. Meanwhile, although it makes sense to introduce a rate hike and selective

credit control at the same time, there are many factors to consider when deciding the right

timing and the appropriate recipe to administer the policy tools. For instance, a rate hike could

add to the current NTD strength; if combined with selective credit control adjustments, such

policy tightening could be packing too hard a punch. The Bank’s policymaking cannot and does

not aim for an all-around solution but seeks to reach the best possible policy balance given the

many factors at play.

3. **Monetary Policy Decision: The board directors reached a unanimous vote to keep the**

discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary

accommodations unchanged at 1.125%, 1.5%, and 3.375%, respectively, and to adjust the

Bank’s selective credit control measures.

##### III. The Press Release 

The board directors and supervisors approved unanimously to issue the following press

release in the post-meeting press conference, together with the Supplementary Materials for the

Post-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank.

12


-----

##### Press Release  September 23, 2021

 Monetary Policy Decision of the Board Meeting

I. Global economic and financial conditions

Since the Board met in June this year, faster vaccination against the coronavirus (COVID
19) in major economies, coupled with monetary and fiscal policy support, have led global

economic and trade activity to expand continuously. Meanwhile, with increasing global

demand and lingering supply chain bottlenecks pushing up international goods prices,

major economies have witnessed a pronounced uptick in inflation, judged by their central

banks to be transitory. Moreover, some economies recently experienced recurring virus

outbreaks and market investors kept a close watch on major central banks’ moves toward

asset purchase tapering, both adding to volatility in international financial markets.

The global economy is expected to register a strong recovery this year. However, uneven

vaccination progress across regions and the spread of new virus variants may lead to

divergent recoveries across economies. In addition, adjustments to the accommodative

monetary policy stance by some central banks in advanced economies, along with

geopolitical conflicts and climate change-related risks, could increase uncertainties over

global economic and financial prospects. International institutions project the world

economy to grow at a slower pace next year and inflation to drop back.

II. Domestic economic and financial conditions

1. From mid-2021, Taiwan's exports continued to record strong expansion thanks to robust

orders for tech products and traditional manufacturing goods. In terms of domestic demand,

as tech firms increased capital outlay, private investment posted steady growth. With

relaxed restrictions following the downgrade of the health alert amid the easing of the

domestic pandemic situation, consumer confidence gradually rebounded. Combined with

the government's forthcoming rollout of consumption stimulus measures, it is expected that

private consumption would show an upturn. The Bank forecasts Taiwan's economy to

expand by 3.43% for the second half of the year and 5.75% for the entire year (Appendix

Table 1). As for labor market conditions, the unemployment rate moved down to 4.24% in

August, still a high level. The number of employed persons remained below the pre
pandemic level, with the services sector in particular witnessing a more significant decrease

in hiring.

Looking ahead to next year, bolstered by continuous recovery in major economies and still

solid demand for emerging technology applications, Taiwan's exports and private

13


-----

investment are likely to see sustained growth momentum, albeit at slower rates owing to the

base effect. Private consumption is anticipated to gather pace as the domestically-oriented

services sector shows signs of recovery, helping to boost employment and wage growth.

Overall, the Bank forecasts that Taiwan's economic growth would advance at a pace of

3.45% in 2022.

2. As torrential rain caused domestic vegetables prices to surge, along with elevated

international oil and other raw material prices, the annual growth rate of the consumer price

index (CPI) rose to 2.36% in August while that of the core CPI (excluding fruit, vegetables,

and energy items) registered 1.33%. For the first eight months of the year, the average

annual growth rates of the CPI and the core CPI were 1.64% and 1.18%, respectively. It is

projected that the annual CPI growth rate would remain high in the third quarter, reflecting

temporary, weather-induced upside pressures, whereas the annual growth rate of the core

CPI would trend down further in the second half of the year. For 2021 as a whole, the Bank

forecasts the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to be 1.70% and 1.17%, respectively

(Appendix Table 2).

For the year of 2022, given a stable outlook for global oil prices forecasted by international

institutions, the Bank projects that the annual growth rates of the CPI and the core CPI

would both drop to 0.92%. The forecasts by international and domestic institutions for

Taiwan's inflation next year average around 1.37%.

3. In recent months, banks' excess reserves stayed around NT$60 billion and above. The

average annual growth rate of the monetary aggregate M2 dropped from the 9.09% of the

second quarter to 8.44% in August. Meanwhile, short- and long-term market interest rates

fluctuated within a tight range. Overall, financial conditions were accommodative.

Since the Bank first introduced the Special Accommodation Facility to Support Bank Credit

to SMEs in April 2020 in response to the pandemic's economic impact, financial institutions

have so far approved approximately 265 thousand applications totaling NT$399.7 billion.

The annual growth rate of SME loans extended by banks stood at 12.27% at the end of July

2021 and the annual growth rate of overall bank lending registered an 8.01% rise.

III. Monetary policy decision

1. Overall, the current inflation upswing is viewed to be transitory and inflation is expected to

be mild for this year as a whole, with next year's inflation outlook tilting to the downside.

In terms of economic growth, the global recovery remains on track, though still facing

multiple uncertainties. Meanwhile, with the pandemic situation under control at home, the

14


-----

domestically-oriented service activity is likely to gradually rebound and private

consumption to pick up. Against this background, Taiwan's economy is expected to

continue with mild expansion in the second half of 2021 and the year of 2022. Taking this

assessment into account, the Board judged that maintaining the current policy rate levels

and monetary easing would help sustain price and financial stability and foster economic

growth.

At the Meeting today, the Board decided unanimously to keep the discount rate, the rate on

refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations unchanged at

1.125%, 1.5%, and 3.375%, respectively.

The Bank will closely monitor the evolution of the coronavirus pandemic, monetary policy

stances of major central banks, geopolitical risks, and changes in global financial markets,

as well as the implications thereof for Taiwan's economy, financial conditions, and price

trends, so as to adopt appropriate monetary policies as warranted to fulfill its statutory duties.

2. To achieve the goals of effective allocation and proper use of credit resources as outlined

in the government's Healthy Real Estate Market Plan, the Bank made two successive

amendments in December 2020 and March 2021 to its selective credit control measures.

Though the amended Regulations Governing the Extension of Mortgage Loans by Financial

Institutions have brought down the loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of those loans regulated,

banks have continued witnessing marked increases in real estate lending. It is thus deemed

necessary for preemptive actions to be taken to curb inordinate flows of credit into the real

estate market and further rein in credit risk associated therewith. In this regard, the Bank

amended the aforementioned Regulations, effective September 24, 2021, as follows (see

Appendix for more details):

(1) Removing the grace period for a second home loan taken out by a natural person for

housing located in the stipulated specific areas, namely Taipei City, New Taipei City,

Taoyuan City, Taichung City, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, Hsinchu County, and

Hsinchu City.

(2) Lowering the LTV ratio cap on land loans to 60%.

(3) Lowering the LTV ratio ceiling on mortgage loans for idle land in industrial districts to

50%; stipulating that the "well-defined period of time" for the relevant exemptions to

apply shall be "one year."

The Bank will pay close attention to developments in the housing market and banks'

management of credit risk associated with real estate lending. We will also conduct a rolling

review on the results of these regulations and measures and make timely adjustments as

warranted to ensure sound banking operations and promote financial stability.

IV. The NT dollar exchange rate is in principle determined by market forces. Nonetheless, when

seasonal or irregular factors (such as massive inflows or outflows of short-term capital) lead

to excess volatility and disorderly movements in the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse

implications for economic and financial stability, the Bank, in line with its statutory

mandates, will step in to maintain an orderly market.

#### Appendix

##### Notes[] on the Amendments to the Regulations Governing the Extension of

 Mortgage Loans by Financial Institutions

**September 23, 2021**

##### 1. In light of a continuous buildup in second home loans taken out by natural
 persons, particularly for housing in certain areas, an amendment is introduced to prohibit grace periods for such loans in the stipulated specific areas, with the aim of helping to contain over-leveraged borrowing and to reinforce banks' credit risk management. 

 2. Considering that the recent uptrend in the annual growth rate of construction
 loans was chiefly due to a surge in land loans, an amendment is introduced to lower the LTV ratio cap on land loans from 65% to 60% (with 10% thereof to be withheld for disbursement until construction commences), in order to tamp down unwarranted growth in such loans. 

 3. In line with the above-mentioned LTV ratio tightening, an amendment is
 introduced to lower the LTV ratio cap on mortgage loans for idle land in industrial districts from 55% to 50%. In addition, the "well-defined period of time" for the relevant exemptions to apply would now be clearly and uniformly stipulated as "one year." This is aimed at galvanizing meaningful progress in the construction and development of those collateralized industrial idle land.

(See comparison table on the following pages.)
