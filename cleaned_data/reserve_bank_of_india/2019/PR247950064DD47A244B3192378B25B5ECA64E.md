**Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting April 2-4, 2019**

**[Under Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934]**

The sixteenth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under

section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from April 2 to 4, 2019 at the
Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai.

2. The meeting was attended by all the members – Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian

Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H.
Dholakia, former Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael
Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the
Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Viral
V. Acharya, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy – and was chaired by Shri
Shaktikanta Das, Governor.

3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank

shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee,
the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely:

(a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee;

(b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member,

on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and

(c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub-section

(11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting.

4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer

confidence, households’ inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit
conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the
projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff’s
macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook.
Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the
MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below.

**Resolution**

5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation,

the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today decided to:

   - reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis

points to 6.0 per cent from 6.25 per cent with immediate effect.


-----

Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 5.75 per cent, and the
marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.25 per cent.


The MPC also decided to maintain the neutral monetary policy stance.


These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for
consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while
supporting growth.


The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.


**Assessment**


_Global Economy_


6. Since the last MPC meeting in February 2019, global economic activity has been

losing pace. In the US, the subdued performance in the final quarter of 2018 appears to have
continued into Q1:2019 as reflected in declining factory activity. The Euro area slowed down
in Q4:2018 on soft domestic demand and contracting manufacturing activity. Of its
constituents, the Italian economy contracted for two consecutive quarters in Q3 and Q4. In the
UK, growth slowed down on Brexit uncertainty, with industrial production contracting during
September-January. The Japanese economy rebounded in Q4 on increased domestic
consumption expenditure and recovering investment spending. However, the latest data on
manufacturing activity and business confidence suggest that growth lost momentum in
Q1:2019. The monetary policy stances of the US Fed and central banks in other major
advanced economies (AEs) have turned dovish.

7. Economic activity also slowed down in some major emerging market economies

(EMEs). The Chinese economy decelerated in Q4:2018 on subdued domestic and global
demand impacting industrial activity. Much of this weakness seems to have continued into
2019 as reflected in low factory output in Q1, though the purchasing managers’ index (PMI)
moved into expansion zone in March after three months of contraction. In Q1, the Russian
economy continued to be impacted by both domestic and external headwinds. The Brazilian
economy ended 2018 on a weak note; going into 2019, available economic indicators for Q1
suggest that economic activity remained restrained by both weak domestic and external
demand. The South African economy slowed down in the final quarter of 2018. Subdued
industrial activity and worsening external demand point to a further loss in momentum in Q1.

8. Crude oil prices have risen on production cuts by OPEC and Russia as well as

disruption in supplies due to US sanctions on exports from Venezuela. Gold prices weakened
on expectations of positive outcomes of the China-US trade deal. Inflation continued to
remain low in major AEs and many key EMEs due to slowing global growth and stable or
falling commodity prices.

9. Financial markets continued to be driven by monetary policy stances of key central

banks and movements in crude oil prices. In the US, the equity market witnessed some
selling pressure in the last week of March on weak economic data. Equity markets in EMEs
gained, benefitting from country-specific factors and easing of global financing conditions.
Bond yields in the US softened, slipped into negative territory in Germany and dipped further
into negative territory in Japan as central banks signalled softer stances. Bond yields in most
EMEs have been falling in tandem with those in AEs and on the improving inflation outlook.
In currency markets, the US dollar has traded with an appreciating bias in recent weeks. EME
currencies have traded with a depreciating bias on country-specific factors and on fears of a
weakening economic outlook in China.

_Domestic Economy_


10. Turning to the domestic economy, the second advance estimates for 2018-19 released

by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in February 2019 revised India’s real gross domestic
product (GDP) growth downwards to 7.0 per cent from 7.2 per cent in the first advance
estimates. Domestic economic activity decelerated for the third consecutive quarter in
Q3:2018-19 due to a slowdown in consumption, both public and private. However, gross
fixed capital formation (GFCF) growth remained in double digits for the fifth consecutive
quarter in Q3, with the GFCF to GDP ratio rising to 33.1 per cent in Q3:2018-19 against 31.8
per cent in Q3:2017-18, supported primarily by the government’s thrust on the road sector and
affordable housing. The drag on aggregate demand from net exports also moderated in Q3 due
to a marginal acceleration in exports and a sharp deceleration in imports led by a decline in
crude oil prices.

11. On the supply side, the second advance estimates of the CSO placed the growth of real

gross value added (GVA) lower at 6.8 per cent in 2018-19 as compared with 6.9 per cent in
2017-18. GVA growth slowed down to 6.3 per cent in Q3 due to a deceleration in agriculture
output from the record level achieved in the previous year. Industrial GVA growth remained
unchanged in Q3, with manufacturing GVA growth slowing somewhat. Services GVA growth
also remained unchanged in Q3; while growth in construction activity accelerated, there was
some loss of momentum in public administration, defence and other services.

12. Beyond Q3, the second advance estimates of foodgrains production for 2018-19 at

281.4 million tonnes were 1.2 per cent lower than the fourth advance estimates of 2017-18,
but 1.4 per cent higher than the second advance estimates of 2017-18. According to the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the US, El Niño conditions
strengthened during February 2019, which may affect the prospects of a normal south west
monsoon.

13. Of the high frequency indicators of industry, the manufacturing component of the

index of industrial production (IIP) growth slowed down to 1.3 per cent in January 2019 due
to automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and machinery and equipment. The growth of eight core
industries remained sluggish in February. Credit flows to micro and small as well as medium
industries remained tepid, though they improved for large industries. Capacity utilisation
(CU) in the manufacturing sector, however, as measured by the Reserve Bank’s order books,
inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS), improved to 75.9 per cent in Q3 from
74.8 per cent in Q2 exceeding its long-term average; the seasonally adjusted CU rose to 76.1
per cent from 75.4 per cent. The business assessment index of the industrial outlook survey
(IOS) points to an improvement in overall sentiments in Q4. The manufacturing purchasing
managers’ index (PMI) remained in expansion zone for 20[th] month in March. The key
indicators of investment activity contracted, viz., production of capital goods in January and
imports of capital goods in February.

14. High frequency indicators of the services sector suggest significant moderation in

activity. Sales of commercial vehicles contracted during February. Other indicators of the
transportation sector, _viz., port freight traffic and international air freight traffic, also_
contracted. However, indicators of the construction sector, viz., consumption of steel and
production of cement, continued to show healthy growth. The hotels sub-segment showed
some improvement in foreign tourist arrivals in January and international air passenger traffic
in February. The services PMI continued to be in expansion zone for the tenth consecutive
month in March 2019.


-----

15. Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in the CPI, rose to 2.6 per cent in February

after four months of continuous decline. The uptick in inflation was driven by an increase in
prices of items excluding food and fuel and weaker momentum of deflation in the food group.
However, inflation in the fuel group collapsed to its lowest print in the new all India CPI
series.

16. Within the food group, deflation in four sub-groups – vegetables, sugar, pulses and

fruits – continued in February. Egg prices moved into inflation after remaining in deflation in
previous three months, while inflation ticked up in all other food sub-groups.

17. Inflation in the fuel and light sub-group collapsed from 4.5 per cent in December to

1.2 per cent in February. Prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) declined sharply, pulled
down by the lagged impact of the softening of international energy prices. The prices of
firewood, with the second largest weight in the fuel group, also declined. Electricity slipped
into deflation in January and February. Inflation in kerosene remained elevated, however,
reflecting the impact of the calibrated increase in its administered price.

18. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel declined to 5.2 per cent in January, but rose to

5.4 per cent in February, driven by a broad-based pick-up in inflation in the personal care and
effects, and recreation and amusement sub-groups. However, inflation in the clothing and
footwear, and transport and communication sub-groups fell, the latter reflecting the reduction
in petrol and diesel prices. Inflation in the health and education sub-groups remained
elevated, even though it moderated markedly during January-February vis-à-vis December.

19. Inflation expectations, measured by the Reserve Bank’s survey of households,

declined in the February round over the previous round by 40 basis points each for the three
months ahead and for the one year ahead horizons. Firms participating in the Reserve Bank’s
industrial outlook survey of manufacturing companies reported reduction in input price
pressures, but they expected an increase in staff expenses in Q1:2019-20. Farm and industrial
input costs increased at a slow pace in January-February 2019. Nominal growth in rural wages
and staff costs in the organised manufacturing and services sectors remained muted in
Q3:2018-19.

20. From a daily net average surplus of ₹27,928 crore (₹279 billion) during February 1-6,

2019, systemic liquidity moved into deficit during February 7 - March 31, reflecting the
build-up of government cash balances. Currency in circulation expanded sharply in FebruaryMarch. The liquidity needs of the system were met through injection of durable liquidity
amounting to ₹37,500 crore (₹375 billion) in February and ₹25,000 crore (₹250 billion) in
March through open market purchase operations (OMOs). Consequently, total durable
liquidity injected by the Reserve Bank through OMOs aggregated ₹2,98,500 crore (₹2,985
billion) for 2018-19. Liquidity injected under the LAF, on an average daily net basis, was
₹95,003 crore (₹950 billion) during February (February 7-28, 2019) and ₹57,043 crore (₹570
billion) in March. The weighted average call rate (WACR) remained broadly aligned with the
policy repo rate in February and March.

21. Anticipating the seasonal tightening of liquidity at end-March, the Reserve Bank

conducted four longer term (tenor ranging between 14-day and 56-day) variable rate repo
auctions during the month in addition to the regular 14-day variable rate term repo auctions.
Furthermore, the Reserve Bank conducted long-term foreign exchange buy/sell swaps of US$
5 billion for a tenor of 3 years on March 26, 2019, thereby injecting durable liquidity of
₹34,561 crore (₹346 billion) into the system.


-----

22. Export growth remained weak in January and February 2019 mainly due to exports of

petroleum products decelerating in response to a fall in international crude oil prices. Among
non-oil exports, engineering goods, chemicals, leather and marine products recorded either
sequentially lower or negative growth. As in the case of exports, lower international crude oil
prices downsized the oil import bill. Non-oil non-gold imports declined sharply, dragged
down by the subdued demand for pearls and precious stones, transport equipment, project
goods and vegetable oils. The trade deficit narrowed in February 2019 – both sequentially and
on a year-on-year basis – to its lowest level in 17 months. This, along with the increase in
services exports and lower outgo of income payments, resulted in narrowing of the current
account deficit sequentially. On the financing side, net FDI inflows were strong in AprilJanuary 2018-19. Foreign portfolio investors turned net buyers in the domestic capital market
in Q4:2018-19. India’s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 412.9 billion on March 31,
2019.


**Outlook**


23. In the sixth bi-monthly monetary policy resolution of February 2019, CPI inflation

was projected at 2.8 per cent for Q4:2018-19, 3.2-3.4 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 3.9 per
cent for Q3:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced around the central trajectory. Actual
inflation outcomes averaged 2.3 per cent in January-February.

24. The inflation path during 2019-20 is likely to be shaped by several factors. First, low

food inflation during January-February will have a bearing on the near-term inflation outlook.
Second, the fall in the fuel group inflation witnessed at the time of the February policy has
become accentuated. Third, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel in February was lower
than expected, which has imparted some downward bias to headline inflation. Fourth,
international crude oil prices have increased by around 10 per cent since the last policy. Fifth,
inflation expectations of households as well as input and output price expectations of
producers polled in the Reserve Bank’s surveys have further moderated. Taking into
consideration these factors and assuming a normal monsoon in 2019, the path of CPI inflation
is revised downwards to 2.4 per cent in Q4:2018-19, 2.9-3.0 per cent in H1:2019-20 and 3.53.8 per cent in H2:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced.

25. GDP growth for 2019-20 in the February policy was projected at 7.4 per cent in the

range of 7.2-7.4 per cent in H1, and 7.5 per cent in Q3 – with risks evenly balanced. Since
then, there are some signs of domestic investment activity weakening as reflected in a
slowdown in production and imports of capital goods. The moderation of growth in the
global economy might impact India’s exports. On the positive side, however, higher financial
flows to the commercial sector augur well for economic activity. Private consumption, which
has remained resilient, is also expected to get a fillip from public spending in rural areas and
an increase in disposable incomes of households due to tax benefits. Business expectations
continue to be optimistic. Taking into consideration the above factors, GDP growth for 201920 is projected at 7.2 per cent – in the range of 6.8-7.1 per cent in H1:2019-20 and 7.3-7.4 per
cent in H2 – with risks evenly balanced.


-----

26. Beyond the near term, several uncertainties cloud the inflation outlook. First, with the

domestic and global demand-supply balance of key food items expected to remain favourable,
the short-term outlook for food inflation remains benign. However, early reports suggest
some probability of _El Niño effects in 2019. There is also the risk of an abrupt reversal in_
vegetable prices, especially during the summer months. Second, inflation in fuel group items,
particularly electricity, firewood and chips saw unprecedented softening in H2:2018-19.
There is, however, uncertainty about the sustainability of this softening in inflation in fuel
items. Third, the outlook for oil prices continues to be hazy, both on the upside and the
downside. On the one hand, continuing OPEC production cuts will reduce supplies. On the
other hand, there is considerable uncertainty about demand conditions. Should there be a swift
resolution of trade tensions, a pick-up in global demand is likely to push up oil prices.
However, should trade tensions linger and demand conditions worsen, crude prices may fall
from current levels, despite production cuts by OPEC. Fourth, inflation excluding food and
fuel has remained elevated over the past twelve months with some pick up in prices in
February. However, should the recent slowdown in domestic economic activity accentuate, it
may have a bearing on the outlook for inflation in this category. Fifth, financial markets
remain volatile reflecting in part global growth and trade uncertainty, which may have an
influence on the inflation outlook. Sixth, the fiscal situation at the general government level
requires careful monitoring.

27. The MPC notes that the output gap remains negative and the domestic economy is

facing headwinds, especially on the global front. The need is to strengthen domestic growth
impulses by spurring private investment which has remained sluggish.

28. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis

points and maintain the neutral stance of monetary policy.

29. Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri

Shaktikanta Das voted in favour of the decision to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis
points. Dr. Chetan Ghate and Dr. Viral V. Acharya voted to keep the policy rate unchanged.

30. Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya

and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted in favour of the decision to maintain the neutral stance of
monetary policy. Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted to change the stance from neutral to
accommodative.


31. The minutes of the MPC’s meeting will be published by April 18, 2019.


32. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during June 3, 4 and 6, 2019.

**Statement by Dr. Chetan Ghate**


33. Since the last review, the continual decline in both 3 month and 1 year ahead

inflationary expectations of households is encouraging. Households’ current inflation
perception is below 7%. The percentage of respondents expecting inflation below 6% for 3
month and 1 year ahead horizons has also been increasing over different survey rounds. It
should be noted that although the 1 year ahead inflationary expectation declined by 40 bps to
8.1% compared to the previous round it is still only 50 bps below the March 2018 value
(8.6%).

34. The elevated level of inflation ex food and fuel continues to be a concern, although I

am more sanguine about its trajectory after the last few prints. My major concern with
inflation ex food and fuel is that sequential gains continue to be strong. Inflation ex food fuel
will only be buttressed by the rise in crude prices (USD 68.3 on April 2 versus USD 62.2 on
February 7, equivalent to a 9.8% increase since the last review). Crude prices have also
remained resilient despite lower projections for global growth. Oil is not a “Hotelling” good
(constraints in different locations prevent supply responses that would otherwise help in
mitigating overall price rises). This makes inflation management challenging.

35. Food prices continue to be subdued although the extent of disinflation is falling. The

unusually low summer uptick in food inflation (3.2%) combined with a sharp decline in
winter prices in FY 19 has kept food prices unexpectedly low. The shift in momentum of
food in the last couple of prints indicates that low food inflation has possibly reached a nadir.
I re-iterate my concern from the last review: RBI’s projections for Q4 2019-2020 headline
inflation continue to be on the lower side because of an assumed low momentum for food. If
vegetable prices rebound in April-August in a stronger way, RBI’s projections will be easily
breached. What compounds problems this time is the rise in the price of crude, although there
has been an off-setting impact because of the nominal appreciation of the rupee (3.3% since
the last review). It wouldn’t hurt to wait for a couple of months to watch the momentum on
food inflation and other variables before taking a call on further rate cuts.

36. The major question in this review is whether there is sufficient accumulation of

downside risks on growth to warrant a monetary policy response. Are the drivers of growth
fading?

37. My sense is that that the business cycle depicts “early cycle” weakness. At this

juncture, I see sub 7% growth rates confined possibly to just two quarters: Q3 and Q4 FY 19.
These will be our “kitchen-sink” quarters (i.e., quarters where the most adverse outcomes to
the economy are realized). Looking at the momentum on GDP growth (Q-o-Q SAAR), there
has also been an uptick in Q3 FY 19.


-----

38. Various RBI surveys don’t depict an economy in collapse. PMIs in Manufacturing and

Services continue to be in expansion zone for several months, capacity utilization in the
manufacturing sector has gone up sequentially in the last four quarters (76.1% seasonally
adjusted in Q3), adjusted non-food credit grew by 14.8% in March 2019 compared with
11.3% in the last fiscal year, and there has been a sharp uptick in consumer confidence (a
positive “sentiment shock”) with the future expectation index at an all-time high.

39. Notwithstanding this, what is worrying is the performance of private final

consumption expenditures (PFCE), about 59% percent of GDP. A variety of high frequency
indicators look fairly weak which nowcast a loss in growth momentum.

40. What confounds this however is the fairly robust numbers for PFCE growth (8.4% Q3

FY 19 and 9.8% Q2 FY 19), (although admittedly, this is partly due to the outsized role that
livestock had in the PFCE numbers for Q3 FY 19). Looking at data from April 2017 –
January 2019 for consumer durables, out of 22 months, only 6 months showed negative
growth. For non-durables, only 2 months out of 22 months showed negative growth.
Consumer durables growth in Q2 was 8.1% in FY 19, and 6.0% in Q3. Consumer nondurables growth was 6.1% in Q2 FY 19 dropping to 4.6% in Q3 FY 19.


41. Various consumption indicators therefore look mixed.


42. In contrast, GFCF (gross fixed capital formation) has risen over the past few quarters

to 33.1% of GDP in Q3: 2018-2019. RBI’s study on “Private Corporate Investment in India:
Slow Recovery Underway” and enterprise surveys depict planned capex showing a turnaround in 2018-2019, with inventory ratios moving down in manufacturing.

43. Somewhat worrying though is that the machine and equipment component of GFCF is

showing signs of stress.

44. In terms of consumption-investment linkages, somewhat more concerning is some

preliminary econometric evidence, using data from 1996: Q2 to 2018: Q4 that PFCE growth
(quarter on quarter, seasonally adjusted) drives GFCF growth with a lag of two quarters.
Simple Granger causality tests also suggest that consumption demand drives investment
demand and not vice versa. This suggests that subdued consumption growth may cause
investment growth to taper, signs of which should be carefully watched.

45. I continue to view the elevated levels of the combined fiscal deficit and the on-going

thrust towards competitive populism as jeopardizing the durability of inflation in the medium
term. This should be carefully watched.

46. On the external front, while India’s overall growth rates have always been somewhat

immune to our export performance, I view the muted performance of exports and imports
over the last four months with concern.

47. Given the above reasons, maintaining status quo on rates at the current juncture would

be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over
the medium-term. Contrary to some of my colleagues in the MPC, I feel that frequent
changes in policy rates and stance runs the risk of introducing uncertainty and volatility
because of our own actions.

48. I will, however, carefully watch the incoming growth-inflation data and am open to a

reassessment of my views.


49. I also vote to retain a neutral stance.


-----

**Statement by Dr. Pami Dua**


50. Headline inflation rose to 2.6% in February 2019 after four months of continuous

decline. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel declined to 5.2% in January but increased to
5.4% in February, driven by an increase in personal care and effects, recreation and
amusement sub-groups. On the basis of quarterly data, headline inflation fell from 4.8% in
Q1: FY18-19 to 3.9% in Q2 and 2.6% in Q3. As per RBI projections, it is expected to decline
to 2.4% in Q4 before rising to 2.9% in Q1: FY 19-20 and 3% in Q2. CPI excluding food and
fuel has declined from 6.3% in Q1: FY 18-19 to 5.9% in Q3: FY 18-19. This softening in
inflation is also exhibited in consumer and producer expectations.

51. Inflation expectations in the March 2019 round of the Reserve Bank’s Survey of

Households softened by 40 basis points each for the three-month ahead and one-year ahead
horizons, vis-à-vis the last round in December 2018. Further, the proportion of respondents
expecting higher inflation declined. The gap between current inflation perceptions and
expectations also narrowed, indicating anchoring of inflation expectations at a lower level.
According to the January-March 2019 round of the Reserve Bank’s Industrial Outlook
Survey, manufacturing firms expect a moderation in pressure in selling prices in Q1: 2019-20
with easing of input cost pressures. Salary costs, however, are expected to firm up. As per the
Business Inflation Expectations Survey conducted by IIM-Ahmedabad in February 2019,
businesses expect moderation in one-year-ahead CPI headline inflation from December 2018.
The Economic Cycle Research Institute’s (ECRI) Indian Future Inflation Gauge, a harbinger
of inflation, remains in a cyclical downswing, indicating that underlying inflation pressures
are still subdued.

52. In the coming months, upside risks to inflation include a potentially weak monsoon;

uncertainty in oil prices and how weaker global demand conditions may weigh against
OPEC’s production decisions; volatility in financial markets; trade tensions; and the
possibility of fiscal slippage. Downside risks include low food prices; moderation in inflation
excluding food and fuel; and slowdown in global growth.

53. On the output side, RBI lowered its projection for GDP growth for 2019-20 from 7.4%

in the February policy to 7.2%. Indicators paint a mixed picture, with weakening investment
activity that is reflected in a slowdown in production and imports of capital goods. On the
other hand, consumer confidence improved in the March 2019 round of RBI’s Consumer
Confidence Survey, with an uptick in both current perceptions as well as future expectations,
which is at an all-time high. This upward trajectory can be attributed to an improvement in
sentiment with respect to general economic situation, employment scenario and price levels.
According to RBI’s Order Books, Inventory and Capacity Utilization Survey (OBICUS),
capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector improved in Q3 from the previous quarter.
The Business Expectations Index of RBI’s Industrial Outlook Survey, however, signals
moderation in optimism in Q1: 2019-20. At the same time, the Purchasing Managers’ Index
(PMI) remained in expansion zone for the twentieth month in March, while the services PMI
continued in expansion zone for the tenth successive month in March 2019. Meanwhile,
ECRI’s Indian Leading Index growth has increased in recent months, indicating an improved
growth outlook. ECRI’s Indian Leading Exports Index growth continues to languish,
however, suggesting that Indian exports growth will ease due to pessimistic prospects for
global growth.

54. On the global front, ECRI’s international long leading indexes, including those for the

U.S., Eurozone and China, are in continued cyclical downswings, pointing to a further
slowdown in global growth. In fact, according to ECRI's 20-Country Long Leading Index, the
global growth outlook is the worst it has been in three years. In the U.S., the Fed has not only
doubled down on its abrupt about-face with regard to policy “normalization,” but also
indicated that no rate hikes are planned this year, and only one rate hike is planned next year.
As a result, the U.S. futures markets see no chance of a rate hike but some chance of a rate cut


-----

later this year, with some risk of recession. As expected, these cyclical prospects have resulted
in an end to monetary policy “normalization” plans not only in the U.S., but also around the
world, while opening up more room for policy easing. Meanwhile, ECRI’s international
future inflation gauges, which are predictors of the direction of inflation, are pointing to the
intensification of worldwide disinflation. Thus, the global prognosis is one of slow growth
accompanied by benign inflation.

55. In view of the global growth slowdown and a benign global and domestic inflation

outlook, I vote for decreasing the policy repo rate by 25 basis points and maintaining the
neutral stance.


**Statement by Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia**


56. In the MPC meeting of February, 2019, I had explicitly stated that a space of 50 to 60

bps policy rate cut had opened up and that I would like to cut the repo rate by 25bps to begin
with. Developments after the February MPC meeting have further opened up additional space
of about 40 to 50 bps. The monthly headline CPI inflation prints of January and February
2019 have continued to undershoot the RBI projections substantially, forcing the RBI for
further downward revision of headline inflation from 2.8 to 2.4 percent for Q4:FY 2018-19.
Other developments on increase of USD 5 per barrel in crude oil prices, exchange rate
appreciation, energy price revisions and monsoon expectations have all together led the RBI
to revise its projections of the headline inflation trajectory downwards by 30-40 bps for the
next 12 months. This is a very positive development on front of price stability in the economy
and has opened up space for correcting the real interest rates in the system decisively. In my
opinion, there are not even remote chances for the headline inflation to breach the medium
term target of 4 percent substantially in foreseeable future for two consecutive quarters or
even one quarter. On the other hand, there are serious concerns about the growth performance
of economy. Global pessimism on growth and developments on domestic front have led the
RBI to revise its growth projections downward for 2019-20. For 3 to 4 quarters in a row, from
Q3:2018-19 to Q2:2019-20, the Indian economy is most likely to register a sub-seven percent
real growth thereby substantially opening up an output gap exerting downward pressure on
wage and price inflation. As per the mandate given to the MPC, under such circumstances, we
need to give a sustained boost to the economy. I, therefore, vote for a change of stance from
neutral to accommodative with a 25 bps cut in the policy repo rate, though I would have
preferred to cut it by 35-40 bps this time. More precise reasons for my vote are as follows:

i) Downward revision of the headline CPI inflation trajectory by RBI considers build up
of substantial excess buffer stock of rice and wheat and prices of other food items like
vegetables and fruits not experiencing the regular expected seasonal spikes reflecting
structural corrections to control inflation in agri-commodities.

ii) While the crude oil prices show volatility and a recent rising tendency, their
sustainability at higher levels is doubtful. Moreover, their pass-through to domestic
inflation has also not occurred to the fullest extent in recent times. In my opinion, it
may not be a major cause of worry for domestic inflation till it breaches the level of
USD 80 – 85 per barrel on a durable basis, which is unlikely.

iii) Thus, oil prices, vegetable prices and fruit prices present volatile elements and any
increase in them can at best be considered only temporary shocks as per our recent
experience. They may not be considered durable shocks needing any policy response
given the recent experience.

iv) The energy prices including electricity which have been subdued of late are likely to
remain so for the next 10-12 months because any substantial price revisions are not on
cards. The inflation ex-food and fuel is also likely to show a sharper decline in coming
months because the inflationary expectations are getting anchored.


-----

v) As per the RBI survey, the household inflationary expectations 3 months and 12
months ahead continued to decline for the fourth consecutive bi-monthly round sharply
and this time by 40 bps each. Moreover, the gap between the household perception and
their expectations about inflation is narrowing over recent rounds. The IIM Ahmedabad
survey of Businesses also show a continuing decline in their headline CPI inflationary
expectations 12 months ahead by 53 bps. Thus, the inflationary expectations are
getting anchored as is usually expected with any inflation targeting policy
implementation. Even the RBI projections of the headline CPI inflation 12 months
ahead have been below the targeted 4 per cent for two consecutive policies. The core
inflation (with whatever definition but theoretically correct concept) will no longer be
sticky at high levels and will show tendency towards the medium term target sooner
than later.

vi) In this context, the concept and measurement of the output gap and more importantly
its relationship with unemployment gap is crucial. On one hand, some economists
argue that there is hardly any output gap (particularly if adjusted for financial factors);
and on the other hand, several economists are emotionally arguing about existence of
serious involuntary unemployment. These two contradictory views cannot be
reconciled theoretically within the same macroeconomic model unless we consider
measurement issues. Potential output and its growth in a rapidly developing emerging
market economy like India needs to be measured differently than in a typical
structurally stable and relatively slow growing advanced economy. Similarly,
involuntary unemployment needs to be measured in such an economy avoiding all
well-known limitations about disguised unemployment and underemployment. I have
been consistently arguing that unless the real growth exceeds 8-8.5 percent per annum,
the output gap reflecting the unemployment gap in the economy is not likely to close.
Till that point, there would be downward pressure on the labour market and market
determined wages and thereby on the so-called ‘core’ inflation.

vii) The downward revision of real growth from 7.4 to 7.2 percent for the coming year
2019-20 by RBI, therefore, opens up the output gap reflecting the unemployment gap
substantially and needs a policy response. This is all the more so, because there are
significant downside risks to the growth projection in my opinion. Due to global
slowdown and US trade actions, our exports are already suffering. Investment has not
revived to reach its earlier peak. The fiscal policy is constrained because of the lack of
fiscal space and impending general elections. It is, therefore, the monetary policy that
needs to provide the boost since, as per the mandate given to MPC, inflation is well
under control. Cutting the policy rate gradually over time would correct the real interest
rate in the economy and encourage investments. In this context, it is also relevant to
note that most of the Central Banks globally have changed their tone to dovish.

57. This is the right time to act decisively. When the pitch is favourable and no possibility

of bouncers or googlies coming in, a well set batsman has to score and not miss the
opportunity to build the total by defending unnecessarily. I would, therefore, continue to cut
the policy rate by 25bps and change the stance to accommodative indicating that any hikes in
the rates are off the table for the time being.


**Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra**


58. As anticipated by the MPC, inflation turned up in February 2019, lifted by food prices

emerging out of five months of deflation. Three features of the upturn are noteworthy.

59. First, the January and February readings of inflation that became available after the

MPC met last in February have undershot the projection made in that meeting. It is reasonable
to expect that the March reading - that will become available on April 12 - may reveal that


-----

food prices are out of deflation, but headline inflation is still softer than the February meeting
projection. I belabour this point because it informs the error correction process that is
concurrently taking place.

60. Second, the entire inflation projection path of the MPC's April 2019 meeting has

shifted downwards by 30-40 basis points from its trajectory in the February meeting. This is
important in a forward-looking sense because as intermediate variables that provide a first
glimpse of monetary policy's unseen and moving targets, the projections are indicating that
the primary mandate assigned to the MPC appears secured at this juncture – inflation will
likely remain at or below target over the 12-month horizon for which forecasts are available.

61. Third, the one year ahead projection of inflation seems to be validated by incoming

data. Survey results indicate that households, businesses and professional forecasters have
become more optimistic on the inflation outlook than before over the same time horizon. In
the case of households, there is also evidence of the anchoring of expectations. Consumer
confidence in the inflation outlook remaining benign over the year ahead is rising. Signals
extracted from all this information would argue that if the primary target for monetary policy
is likely to be achieved on a durable basis, some space opens up for policy attention to the
objective of growth as enjoined by the RBI Act.

62. Given this headroom, the dilemma is two-fold: (1) with growth expected to accelerate

from 7 per cent in 2018-19 to 7.2 per cent in 2019-20, is policy support really needed? (2)
even if the case is admissible, is it the right time to steer monetary policy in defence of
growth? Why not exercise prudence and wait and watch for durable signs of underlying
pressures on inflation other than food or fuel easing, and/or indications that the slowdown in
growth is not a soft patch but a cyclical downswing? This may avoid wasting ammunition.

63. To speak to these questions, the baseline projection of growth is subject to downside

risks. First, we are already living in a world in which India’s real GDP growth averaged 6.5
per cent in the second half of 2018-19, not 7 per cent. Even if the horizon is extended to
incorporate the projections for the first half of 2019-20, real GDP growth is still expected to
be sub-7 per cent. Second, the drivers of growth are fading. Data that have arrived since the
MPC’s February meeting indicate that demand conditions in the manufacturing sector are
slowing down, with the weakening of sales of fast moving consumer goods implying that
consumption spending may be losing steam. Meanwhile, capacity utilisation in manufacturing
is running above trend in the absence of investment in new capacity. This suggests that the
current pace of growth could be difficult to sustain if the capex cycle does not start up
soon. Given the limited fiscal space, the support from government final consumption
expenditure (GFCE) that has held up growth – GDP growth excluding GFCE was 6.3 per cent
in 2017-18 (as against the headline GDP growth of 7.2 per cent) and 6.8 per cent in 2018-19
(7.0 per cent)[1 ]– may not be available going forward. Exports have flattened, with the slowing
down of global growth and trade imparting downside risks. Non-oil non-gold imports have
contracted, indicative of weakening domestic demand.

64. Third, I continue to maintain the view that the biggest risks to growth are global. Some

of these risks are already materialising. Global growth estimates and projections are being
marked down as incoming data confirm the loss of momentum that is underway. Capital flows
to EMEs have returned after a turbulent year gone by, but safe haven demand restrains a fuller
resumption, and uncertainty in financial markets remains high. Crude prices are firming up,
with financialisation of energy stocks adding upside.

1 In 2015-16 and 2016-17, GFCE actually pulled down growth – ex GFCE, GDP growth was 8.1 per cent (8.0
t) d 8 4 t (8 2 t)


-----

65. Monetary policy has a overarchingly domestic orientation. With inflation being

quiescent and growth at risk, I vote for a reduction in the policy rate by 25 basis points while
maintaining a neutral policy stance. I will, however, remain watchful about the upturn in food
prices that usually precedes the onset of the monsoon.


**Statement by Dr. Viral V. Acharya**


66. In the minutes of the February 2019 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, I

had provided several reasons for why I had voted to keep the policy rate at 6.5% and the
stance at neutral.

67. Since then, the headline inflation prints have revealed further softening of inflation in

January, followed by a pick-up in February. Notably, inflation excluding food and fuel
softened unexpectedly in January, while reverting somewhat in February; nevertheless, it
remains uncomfortably close to 5.5%. Food inflation, in contrast, has behaved more in line
with the expectations; fuel inflation has remained unusually weak.

68. As per my assessment, these outcomes combined with a further softening of household

inflation expectations and a marginal opening up of the output gap (traditional measure),
would have justified a rate cut of 25 basis points from 6.5% to 6.25% at the April meeting. In
particular, the softening of inflation excluding food and fuel gives greater durability to the
inflation path remaining around the target rate of 4% in the medium term even if the policy
rate were to be reduced from 6.5% to 6.25%. However, given that the MPC had already cut
the policy rate to 6.25% at its February meeting, the relevant decision now for me was
whether to reduce the policy rate further from 6.25%.

69. I vote for keeping the policy rate unchanged at 6.25% for similar reasons as echoed in

my February meeting statement, with some additional uncertainties that I flag below.

70. First, oil prices have marched upwards by an additional 10% since the February

policy. This rise has taken the Brent Crude price closer to $70 per barrel. Its momentum
cannot be taken lightly given the uncertainty witnessed last year on oil prices and the pressure
it puts on inflation, the external sector and financial markets. While the pass-through to
consumers remains somewhat incomplete at present, it will eventually hit the pump prices and
generalise through transportation fares into non-fuel components of headline inflation.

71. Second, food deflation has attendant fiscal risks, as I explained in detail in my

February meeting statement. Fiscal responses to deal with agrarian distress resulting from
low food prices can impart a significant upside risk to the inflation trajectory, an uncertainty
that may get partly resolved in the coming months.

72. Third, let me reiterate that inflation excluding food and fuel remains uncomfortably

close to 5.5%, _i.e., at elevated levels as through most of the past twelve months. This is_
confirmed also in rising staff costs in the formal sector. Conversely, it is only the benign food
inflation that is allowing the monetary policy to not respond to the discomforting elevated
levels of inflation excluding food and fuel. An important observation on food inflation is in
order; in all of recent years, even as the level of food inflation has trended downward, it has
remained highly volatile within each year; peak-to-trough cycle in food inflation typically
tends to be of around 8 months duration, and the month of February has already shown some
seasonal uptick in prices of several food items. Hence, soft food inflation may not persist for
long, a scenario in which the elevated level of inflation excluding food and fuel would steer
the headline inflation away from the target rate of 4%. This can risk hardening of inflation
expectations of households.


-----

73. Fourth, professional forecasters are pegging inflation trajectory somewhat higher than

that of the Reserve Bank; this is due to their factoring in some fiscal slippage for this year as
well as post-election, as gathered from their qualitative responses. Dissaving induced by such
fiscal slippage also creates a rather weak transmission of monetary policy to the private and
household sectors of the economy as bank deposits compete with small savings and corporate
bonds with government securities.

74. These factors, combined with mixed news regarding the prospects of a normal

monsoon suggest to me that this is a particularly inopportune time to reduce the interest rate.
In 2-4 months, several uncertainties as posed above are likely to be resolved, helping steer
interest rates in a clear direction, upward or downward or simply staying put, depending on
how the risks play out. In the meantime, efforts could be made to improve the financial
system structurally for better transmission of monetary policy to the real economy, especially
as there are headwinds to such transmission from the rise in overall public sector borrowing
requirement.

75. On the growth front, signals from the domestic economy are mixed. Capacity

utilisation continues to improve which augurs well for future investment, and services growth
remains robust; however, consumption demand shows signs of weakness. Global growth is
exhibiting a synchronised slowdown; as I have contended in my past statements, mild
moderation of global growth benefits India through a downward pressure on oil prices; it is
extreme moderation that hurts India and more so through the financial flows channel rather
than the trade channel, the latter having been largely insensitive to external prospects in recent
years.

76. Aggregate flow of financial resources to the commercial sector remains robust with

banks substituting for the weak credit growth of non-banks; bank credit growth continues to
be above nominal GDP growth; equity markets have been buoyant; foreign portfolio flows
have reversed into India following the dovish stance of advanced country central banks;
together, these imply that the finance-neutral output gap, my preferred measure of output gap
which accounts for financial cycles, continues to remain closed.

77. On balance, therefore, notwithstanding signs of weakness in growth evinced in high

frequency economic indicators, I am inclined to wait for some more time for incoming data to
resolve several important uncertainties that will shape the Indian economy in the coming one
or two years. The counter-factual exercises suggest that 6.25% policy repo rate is just “right”
for achieving headline inflation target of 4% on a durable basis in the medium term;
continuing oil price rise or fiscal impulses or seasonal uptick in volatile vegetable prices
would likely require some tightening down the road; only a substantial collapse in global
growth, which seems unlikely at present given proactive responses of central banks in
advanced economies and China, would justify a rate cut at this point. Hence, I am erring on
the side of caution, choosing to be patient, rather than supporting another rate cut on the back
of MPC’s February decision to cut the rate.

**Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das**

78. Since the last policy in February 2019, there has been further weakening of domestic

growth impulses, with global growth slowdown posing major headwinds to India’s exports.
Inflation has continued to surprise on the downside. CPI inflation for January and February
averaged 2.3 per cent as against projection of 2.8 per cent for the January-March quarter of
2019 in the February policy. Accordingly, inflation for Q4:2018-19 in all likelihood is set to
be lower than that projected in the February policy.


-----

79. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated from 5.6 per cent in December to 5.4

per cent in February. The spike in prices in the health and education sub-groups in December
proved to be a one-off phenomenon. The food group continued to be in deflation for the fifth
consecutive month in February. Inflation in the fuel and light sub-group unexpectedly
collapsed from 4.5 per cent in December to 1.2 per cent in February, with electricity prices
remaining in deflation. Inflation expectations of households, measured by the Reserve Bank’s
survey of households, declined in the February round over the previous round by 40 basis
points each for the three-month ahead and the one-year ahead horizons. With this, inflation
expectations have declined cumulatively by as much as 160 basis points for the three-month
ahead and 170 basis points for one-year ahead horizons in the last four survey rounds.

80. In comparison with the February policy, CPI inflation projection is now revised

downwards by 30-40 basis points to 2.4 per cent in Q4:2018-19, 2.9-3.0 per cent in H1:201920 and 3.5-3.8 per cent in H2, with risks broadly balanced. This baseline inflation scenario,
however, is subject to several uncertainties, especially from crude oil and food prices. More
precisely, the uncertainties/risks include: (i) the highly uncertain outlook for oil prices, which
are vulnerable to both upward pressure due to continuing OPEC production cuts, as well as
downward pressure due to further slowing down of the global economy; (ii) the risk of an
abrupt reversal in vegetable prices, which may get accentuated due to deficient monsoon
should there be El Niño conditions; and (iii) inflation excluding food and fuel may soften
further from the present levels if the recent slowdown in domestic economic activity
intensifies. The fiscal situation at the general government level also needs a careful vigil.
Given India’s large dependence on imports of crude oil, stability in international crude oil
prices is critical for domestic macroeconomic stability.

81. Moving on to economic activity, high frequency indicators suggest a further loss of

pace in growth. Private consumption has been weakening as reflected in deceleration in the
growth of passenger car sales and domestic air passenger traffic, weak performance of
consumer durables and non-durables, and continuing contraction in non-oil non-gold imports.
Investment activity has also decelerated due to contraction in production of capital goods in
January and imports of capital goods in February. On the supply side, industrial growth has
weakened as reflected in deceleration in the growth of index of industrial production (IIP) for
January; the growth of core industries for February remained sluggish. However, capacity
utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector has improved and is also above the long-term
average. In the services sector, sales of commercial vehicles, port freight traffic and
international air freight traffic contracted during February. However, indicators of the
construction sector, viz., growth in consumption of steel and production of cement, continued
to show healthy growth.

82. Overall financing conditions have continued to improve as reflected in the total flow

of resources to the commercial sector. However, bank credit flows to micro and small as well
as medium industries remain extremely weak. GDP growth for 2019-20 has been revised
downwards to 7.2 per cent – in the range of 6.8-7.1 per cent in H1:2019-20 and 7.3-7.4 per
cent in H2 – with risks evenly balanced.

83. Investment demand is losing traction and a deceleration in exports may further impact

investment activity. With the inflation outlook looking benign and headline inflation expected
to remain below target in the current year, it becomes necessary to address the challenges to
sustained growth of the Indian economy. Hence, I vote for reducing the policy repo rate by
25 basis points. I would like to state here that there is a need to consider interest rate
adjustments, not necessarily in the conventional way of 25 bps or multiples thereof. This idea
needs further debate and discussion. Further, with several uncertainties facing the economy, it
is appropriate to maintain the neutral stance of monetary policy


-----

84. The RBI will continue to watch the evolving growth and inflation dynamics and shall

act in time and act decisively while ensuring price stability on an enduring basis in pursuance
of its mandate under the RBI Act.
