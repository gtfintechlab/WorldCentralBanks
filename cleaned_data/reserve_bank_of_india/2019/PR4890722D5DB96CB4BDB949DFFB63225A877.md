**Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting August 5-7, 2019**

**[Under Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934]**

The eighteenth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under
section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during August 5-7, 2019 at the
Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai.

2. The meeting was attended by all the members – Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian

Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H.
Dholakia, former Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata
Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under
Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Shri Bibhu Prasad Kanungo, Deputy
Governor in charge of monetary policy – and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor.

3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall

publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes
of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely:

(a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee;
(b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on
the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and

(c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub-section (11)
of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting.

4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer

confidence, households’ inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions,
the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of
professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff’s macroeconomic projections, and
alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive
discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below.

**Resolution**

5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the

Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today decided to:

   - reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 35 basis


points (bps) from 5.75 per cent to 5.40 per cent with immediate effect.

- The MPC also decided to maintain the accommodative stance of monetary policy.


These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for
consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting
growth.


The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.


**Assessment**


_Global Economy_


6. Global economic activity has slowed down since the meeting of the MPC in June 2019,

amidst elevated trade tensions and geo-political uncertainty. Among advanced economies (AEs),
GDP growth in the US decelerated in Q2:2019 on weak business fixed investment. In the Euro
area too, GDP growth moderated in Q2 on worsening external conditions. Economic activity in
the UK was subdued in Q2 with waning consumer confidence on account of Brexit related
uncertainty and weak industrial production. In Japan, available data on industrial production and
consumer confidence suggest that growth is likely to be muted in Q2.

7. Economic activity remained weak in major emerging market economies (EMEs), pulled

down mainly by slowing external demand. The Chinese economy decelerated to a multi-year low
in Q2, while in Russia subdued economic activity in Q1 continued into Q2 on slowing exports and
retail sales. In Brazil, the economy is struggling to gain momentum after contracting in Q1 on
weak service sector activity and declining industrial production. Economic activity in South Africa
appears to be losing pace in Q2 as the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) contracted
for the sixth month in succession in June and business confidence remained weak.

8. Crude oil prices fell sharply in mid-May on excess supplies from an increase in non-OPEC

production, combined with a further weakening of demand. Consequently, extension of OPEC
production cuts in early July did not have much impact on prices. Gold prices have risen sharply
since the last week of May, propelled by increased safe haven demand amidst rising downside
risks to growth and a worsening geo-political situation. Inflation remained benign in major
advanced and emerging market economies.

9. Financial markets were driven by the monetary policy stances of major central banks and

intensifying geo-political tensions. In the US, the equity market recovered most of the losses
suffered in May, boosted by dovish guidance by the US Fed and some transient respite in trade
tensions with China. EM stocks lagged behind their developed market counterparts, mainly
reflecting the weak performance of Chinese and South Korean stocks. Bond yields in the US,
which were already trading with a softening bias on increased probability of policy rate cuts, fell
markedly in early August on escalation of trade tensions. Bond yields in some more member
countries in the Euro area moved into negative territory as expectations of more accommodative
monetary policy by the European Central Bank gained traction. In EMEs, bond yields edged lower
on more accommodative guidance by systemic central banks. In currency markets, the US dollar
weakened against major currencies in June on dovish guidance by the US Fed but appreciated in
July. EME currencies, which traded with an appreciating bias in July, depreciated in early August
on escalation of trade tensions.

_Domestic Economy_
10. On the domestic front, the south-west monsoon gained intensity and spread with the

cumulative rainfall 6 per cent below the long-period average (LPA) up to August 6, 2019. In terms
of its spatial distribution, 25 of the 36 sub-divisions received normal or excess rainfall as against
28 sub-divisions last year. The total area sown under kharif crops was 6.6 per cent lower as on
August 2 than a year ago. The live storage in major reservoirs on August 1 was at 33 per cent of
the full reservoir level as compared with 45 per cent a year ago. Rainfall during the second half of
the season (August-September) has been forecast to be normal by the India Meteorological
Department (IMD).

11. Industrial growth, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), moderated in May

2019, pulled down by manufacturing and mining even as electricity generation picked up on strong
demand. In terms of the use-based classification, the production of capital goods and consumer
durables decelerated. However, consumer non-durables accelerated for the third consecutive
month in May. The growth in the index of eight core industries decelerated in June, dragged down
by a contraction in petroleum refinery products, crude oil, natural gas and cement. Capacity
utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, measured by the order books, inventory and capacity
utilisation survey (OBICUS) of the Reserve Bank rose marginally to 76.1 per cent in Q4:2018-19
from 75.9 per cent in Q3; seasonally adjusted CU, however, fell to 74.5 per cent in Q4 from 75.6
per cent in Q3. The Reserve Bank’s business assessment index (BAI) for Q1:2019-20 improved
marginally, supported by a modest recovery in profit margins of the surveyed firms even as
production and order books slowed. The manufacturing PMI rose to 52.5 in July from 52.1 in June,
underpinned by a pick-up in production, higher new orders and optimism on demand conditions
in the year ahead.

12. High frequency indicators of services sector activity for May-June present a mixed picture.

Tractor and motorcycle sales – indicators of rural demand – continued to contract. Amongst
indicators of urban demand, passenger vehicle sales contracted for the eighth consecutive month
in June; however, domestic air passenger traffic growth turned positive in June after three
consecutive months of contraction. Commercial vehicle sales slowed down even after adjusting
for base effects. Construction activity indicators slackened, with contraction in cement production
and slower growth in finished steel consumption in June. Import of capital goods – a key indicator
of investment activity – contracted in June. The services PMI expanded to 53.8 in July from 49.6
in June on increase in new business activity, new export orders and employment.

13. Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in the CPI, edged up to 3.2 per cent in June

from 3.0 per cent in April-May, driven by food inflation, even as fuel inflation and CPI inflation
excluding food and fuel moderated.

14. Inflation in the food group rose to 2.4 per cent in June from 2.0 per cent in May and 1.4

per cent in April, caused by a sharp pick up in prices of meat and fish, pulses and vegetables.
Inflation also edged up in cereals, milk, spices and prepared meals. However, inflation in eggs
and non-alcoholic beverages softened. Prices of fruits, and sugar and confectionery remained in
deflation in June.

15. Inflation in the fuel and light group moderated in June, with electricity moving into

deflation. Fuels such as firewood and chips, and dung cake have been in deflation from April.
Inflation in liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and subsidised kerosene prices, however, remained
elevated.

16. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel fell by 50 basis points to 4.1 per cent in May from

4.6 per cent in April, and remained unchanged in June. The softness in inflation in this category

last three months. Despite some moderation, inflation in the health sub-group remained elevated.
Inflation in personal care and effects edged up in June due to a resurgence in gold prices.

17. Inflation expectations of households remained unchanged in the July 2019 round of the

Reserve Bank’s survey for the three months ahead horizon as compared with the previous round,
but they moderated by 20 basis points for the one year ahead horizon. Input cost pressures from
prices of agricultural and industrial raw materials continued to ease in May and June. Nominal
growth in rural wages was muted, while growth in staff costs in the manufacturing sector eased in
Q1. Manufacturing firms participating in the Reserve Bank’s industrial outlook survey expect
input cost pressures to soften on account of lower raw material costs in Q2.

18. Liquidity in the system was in large surplus in June-July 2019 due to (i) return of currency

to the banking system; (ii) drawdown of excess cash reserve ratio (CRR) balances by banks; (iii)
open market operation (OMO) purchase auctions; and (iv) the Reserve Bank’s foreign exchange
market operations. The Reserve Bank absorbed liquidity of ₹51,710 crore in June, ₹1,30,931 crore
in July and ₹2,04,921 crore in August (up to August 6, 2019) on a daily net average basis under
the LAF. Two OMO purchase auctions amounting to ₹27,500 crore were conducted in June,
thereby injecting durable liquidity into the system. The weighted average call money rate (WACR)
– the operating target of monetary policy – was aligned with the policy repo rate in June, but it
traded below the policy repo rate on a daily average basis by 14 bps in July and 17 bps in August
(up to August 6, 2019).

19. The transmission of policy repo rate cuts to the weighted average lending rates (WALRs)

on fresh rupee loans of banks has improved marginally since the last meeting of the MPC. Overall,
banks reduced their WALR on fresh rupee loans by 29 bps during the current easing phase so far
(February-June 2019).

20. Merchandise exports contracted in June 2019, weighed down by the subdued performance

of gems and jewellery, petroleum products, rice, engineering goods and cotton. After a modest
increase in May, imports also contracted in June, impacted by falling prices of petroleum products
and reduced imports of pearls and precious stones, transport equipment, machinery, metalliferous
ores, chemicals and fertilisers. As the fall in imports was larger than that of exports, the trade
deficit declined modestly during May-June on a y-o-y basis. Provisional data suggest a sequential
decline in net services exports in May 2019. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment
flows moderated to US$ 6.8 billion in April-May 2019 from US$ 7.9 billion a year ago. Net foreign
portfolio investment (FPI) flows in the domestic capital market amounted to US$ 2.3 billion during
the current financial year so far (up to August 5, 2019) as against net outflows of US$ 8.5 billion
in the same period last year. India’s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 429.0 billion on August
2, 2019 – an increase of US$ 16.1 billion over end-March 2019.

**Outlook**
21. In the second bi-monthly monetary policy resolution of June 2019, CPI inflation was

projected at 3.0-3.1 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 3.4-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20, with risks
broadly balanced. The actual headline inflation outcome for Q1:2019-20 at 3.1 per cent was in
alignment with these projections.

22. The baseline inflation trajectory for the next four quarters will be shaped by several factors.

First, the uptick in food inflation may be sustained by price pressures in vegetables and pulses as
more recent data suggest. Uneven spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon could exert some
upward pressure on food items, though this risk is likely to be mitigated by the recent catch up in

4

and fuel remains soft. Manufacturing firms participating in the industrial outlook survey expect
output prices to ease in Q2. Fourth, one year ahead inflation expectations of households polled by
the Reserve Bank have moderated. Taking into consideration these factors and the impact of recent
policy rate cuts, the path of CPI inflation is projected at 3.1 per cent for Q2:2019-20 and 3.5-3.7
per cent for H2:2019-20, with risks evenly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2020-21 is projected at
3.6 per cent (Chart 1).

23. In the MPC’s June resolution, real GDP growth for 2019-20 was projected at 7.0 per cent

– in the range of 6.4-6.7 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 7.2-7.5 per cent for H2 – with risks evenly
balanced. Various high frequency indicators suggest weakening of both domestic and external
demand conditions. The Business Expectations Index of the Reserve Bank’s industrial outlook
survey shows muted expansion in demand conditions in Q2, although a decline in input costs
augurs well for growth. The impact of monetary policy easing since February 2019 is also expected
to support economic activity, going forward. Moreover, base effects will turn favourable in
H2:2019-20. Taking into consideration the above factors, real GDP growth for 2019-20 is revised
downwards from 7.0 per cent in the June policy to 6.9 per cent – in the range of 5.8-6.6 per cent
for H1:2019-20 and 7.3-7.5 per cent for H2 – with risks somewhat tilted to the downside; GDP
growth for Q1:2020-21 is projected at 7.4 per cent (Chart 2).

24. The MPC notes that inflation is currently projected to remain within the target over a 12
month ahead horizon. Since the last policy, domestic economic activity continues to be weak, with
the global slowdown and escalating trade tensions posing downside risks. Private consumption,
the mainstay of aggregate demand, and investment activity remain sluggish. Even as past rate cuts
are being gradually transmitted to the real economy, the benign inflation outlook provides
headroom for policy action to close the negative output gap. Addressing growth concerns by
boosting aggregate demand, especially private investment, assumes the highest priority at this
juncture while remaining consistent with the inflation mandate.

25. All members of the MPC unanimously voted to reduce the policy repo rate and to maintain

the accommodative stance of monetary policy.

**Statement by Dr. Chetan Ghate**


28. Since the last review, while there has been no change in the three month ahead inflation

expectations of households (7.6%), there has been a decline of 20 bps in the level of one year ahead
inflationary expectations (to 7.9%). Households’ current perception of inflation also shows no
change at (6.6%). What is noteworthy is that the proportion of respondents (both in the three month
and one year buckets) expecting inflation to be less than 6% remains high. The moderation in the
one year ahead level of inflationary expectations has happened in spite of rising food inflation in
the past couple of months suggesting better anchoring of inflationary expectations.

29. Benign inflation conditions continue to be manifested in CPI-headline (3.2% in June)

although it edged up marginally from 3.0% in May. Average inflation in Q1 FY 19-20 (3.1%) is
more or less in line with RBI projections made in June (3 percent).

30. Food inflation however has inched up for the seventh consecutive month in June, and food

momentum has picked up in April-June. As mentioned in the last Statement, I will remain watchful
of how strong the spillovers are from a cyclical seasonal movement (in certain food sub-groups
such as vegetables). The realization of such risks could eliminate the “inflation shortfall” currently
being projected relative to the medium run target of 4%.

31. In contrast to food inflation, there has been a moderation in inflation ex food and fuel,

which continues to be flat at 4.1% in June. The sequential momentum in inflation excluding food
and fuel also remains weak. I expect the pick up in economic growth however to put a “floor” on
inflation ex food and fuel.

32. Reflecting benign current and one year ahead inflation conditions in the last several

months, the MPC has cut the policy rate by 75 bps (between February 2019 – June 2019) to close
the output gap. I will call this our level policy. Because of previous downward revisions in our
inflation and growth projections, our change in stance (in June to accommodative from neutral),

6


-----

bond yield on July 22, 2019 was 6.42 per cent compared to 7.29 per cent on May 20, 2019.
Likewise, the 91-day T-Bill rate on July 22 was 5.72% per cent compared to 6.33% per cent on
May 20, 2019. Yield spreads on 5 year AAA rated corporate bonds over the 5 year G-Sec yield
however increased during mid June and have remained high since then reflecting liquidity
problems faced by a few players in the NBFC sector. Taken in unison, our level policy and slope
policy already reflect substantial financial accommodation to address the sharp decline in
economic growth (from 8.0% in Q1 to 5.8% in Q4) witnessed through FY 2019.

33. I should add that the MPC has enacted both “insurance-cuts” (to address current and future

downside risks to growth) and “data-dependent” cuts (reflecting the evolving growth-inflation risk
picture) in the February-June window.

34. The question then is: what incremental information since the last review warrants a need

for further accommodation?


35. There are a few considerations here.


36. On the external front, growth in the global economy remains tepid. Trade tensions have

worsened leading to some loss in our net export growth.


37. Domestically, a variety of growth indicators have weakened further.


38. Based on a sample of 843 manufacturing companies, the seasonally adjusted capacity

utilization has weakened to 74.5%, which is marginally lower than the long term average and the
last few readings. Demand conditions in the manufacturing sector – based on the Reserve Bank’s
analysis of early corporate results of listed companies – weakened in nominal terms in Q1: 20192020 relative to Q4: 2018-2019. Consumer driven industries also exhibit sluggish demand, with a
piling up of inventories.

39. After the March 2019 surge in consumer confidence, this index has declined thereafter with

the current situation index back in pessimistic territory. The Reserve Bank’s Business Expectation
Index (BEI) expects to lose traction in Q2 2019:2020. IIP growth moderated to 3.1% in May
compared to 4.3%. On a positive side though, consumer durable growth moved into positive
territory (0.1%); capital goods also moved into positive territory (2.3%); while non durables
increased by 7.7%. The output gap has also opened further up since the last review.

40. What is telling is that large swings in the Indian business cycle are still not a thing of the

past, despite the adoption of inflation targeting in India.

41. I continue to worry that fiscal imbalances embodied in our large public sector borrowing

requirement (roughly 8-9% of GDP) will lead to detrimental outcomes for the economy. While a
fiscal glide path should be seen as a limit, once in place, it becomes a target. Convergence to the
limit happens, and a form of “creative accounting” kicks in. Going forward, policy coordination
between monetary and fiscal policy will be crucial for a healthier and more durable growthinflation mix in the economy. For instance, if agents in the economy expect that the government
will disregard the level of debt but the central bank follows the Taylor principle (i.e., insists that
inflation is not allowed to rise), then the economy can go through a spiral of lower output, higher
inflation, and higher debt.

42. I will carefully watch the evolving growth-inflation risk picture. Estimates of economic

growth in India have unfortunately been subject to a fair degree of floccinaucinihilipilification.
Notwithstanding this, growth is likely to pick up from Q2-Q3: 2019-2020.

down by only 29 bps despite the MPC cutting rates by 75 bps in the February-June window. By a
large cut (35 bps) I feel we will be burning through monetary policy space without much to show
for it. While the real economy needs some support, we should wait for more transmission to
happen.

44. Given the evolving growth-inflation risk picture, monetary policy should be used

judiciously.

45. I vote to reduce the policy rate by 25 bps. I also vote to retain the stance as accommodative.


**Statement by Dr. Pami Dua**


46. Headline inflation, measured by CPI inflation, rose to 3.2% in June 2019 from 3% in May.

Food inflation also increased to 2.4% in June from 2% in the previous month, while CPI inflation
excluding food and fuel moderated to 4.1%. Results from surveys provide mixed signals. Inflation
expectations of households, as captured through RBI’s Inflation Expectations Survey of
Households, remained unchanged from the last round in May for the three-month-ahead horizon
but fell by 20 basis points for the one-year-ahead horizon. At the same time, the Industrial Outlook
Survey (IOS) showed an expectation of easing of input cost pressures for Q2:2019-20. Upside
risks to inflation include continuation of the uptick in food price inflation, uncertainties relating to
monsoon, and volatility in international oil prices.

47. Industrial growth, as measured by the index of industrial production, moderated in May to

3.1%, down from 4.3% in the previous month, with manufacturing dropping to 2.5% from 4% and
mining slowing to 3.2% from 5.1%. Electricity production, however, grew by 7.4%, up from 6%
in April. On the basis of the use-based classification, growth in capital goods, intermediate and
primary goods, and infrastructure/construction slowed in the month of May. Consumer durables
also decelerated while consumer non-durables accelerated for the third consecutive month. High
frequency indicators of rural demand – tractor and motorcycle sales – and of urban demand –
passenger vehicle sales – continued to contract. Growth in the index of eight core industries fell to
0.2% in June due to a contraction in crude oil, cement, natural gas and petroleum refinery products.

48. Meanwhile, the manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index increased marginally in July

due to an expansion in output, new orders and optimism on demand conditions. The services PMI
also grew in July. RBI’s Business Expectations Index of the Industrial Outlook Survey for
manufacturing showed modest softening in Q2:2019-20. The Order Books, Inventory and Capacity
Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) conducted by RBI suggests a rise in capacity utilisation to 76.1% in
Q4:2018-19, but a fall in the seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation to 74.5% in Q4 from 75.6%
in Q3. RBI’s Consumer Confidence Indices – Current Situation Index and Future Expectations
Index – reflect a drop in the July round compared to the previous May round, implying lower
current activity and a less optimistic outlook. On the trade front, there was a broad based fall in
exports (-9.7%) and imports (-9.1%) in June 2019, with import of capital goods dropping by 7.7%.

49. Looking forward, Indian exports growth prospects are fading, according to the Indian

Leading Exports Index of the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI). This is consistent with
the worsening global industrial outlook underscored by ECRI’s Global Leading Manufacturing
Index. Further, growth in ECRI’s U.S. Leading Manufacturing Index has dropped back to
December’s seven year low. Growth prospects for U.S. consumer spending are also weakening.
Further, ECRI’s U.S. Future Inflation Gauge remains in a cyclical downswing, indicating that the
inflation cycle downturn that began in mid-2018 is poised to persist.

dovish, tending towards easing of rates. On the domestic front, economic activity has softened due
to muted consumption and investment activity, and inflation is benign. While considerable
liquidity easing has already occurred and cumulative rate cuts of 75 basis points have been
undertaken in the last three MPC meetings (between February and June 2019), along with a change
in stance in June from neutral to accommodative, there is still policy space for a further cut in the
policy rate, given the weak global and domestic economic scenario and a benign inflation outlook.

51. The weighted average call money rate (WACR) has remained broadly aligned with the

policy rate, indicating transmission of the reduction in the policy rate. Policy rate reductions of 75
basis points to other money market rates and G-sec yield have also transmitted fully.

52. At the same time, though the transmission of the policy rate cuts to the weighted average

lending rate (WALR) on fresh loans of banks has improved from 21 basis points in February and
March to 29 basis points during February to June, it was partial, possibly due to transmission lags
associated with monetary policy. Nevertheless, the significant monetary policy easing since
February 2019, along with surplus liquidity, are likely to enable more transmission to lending rates,
and eventually to the real economy. Further, in view of the shadow banking stress, the importance
of surplus liquidity has increased. In this regard, measures taken by the government and the RBI
to encourage flow of credit to shadow banks are important confidence building steps.

53. It is also important to recognize that, while monetary policy can impact cyclical factors, it

has its limitations with respect to significantly impacting structural factors. Therefore, investmentfocused fiscal policy and active continuation of structural reforms are imperative at this juncture
to complement the already substantial easing that has been delivered since February 2019. In this
context, the directional shift in the Budget towards a lower fiscal deficit target may also contribute
towards lowering the cost of capital and boosting investment driven growth.

54. Overall, given that the headline inflation is projected to remain below target in 2019-20, I

vote for a pre-emptive rate cut of 25 basis points to enhance consumer confidence and improve
investor sentiment. On a cumulative basis, this denotes a policy rate cut of 100 basis points since
February 2019, which is sufficient at this point in time. I also vote to keep the stance as
accommodative.


**Statement by Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia**


55. After the last meeting of MPC in June 2019, several important events have occurred.

Inflation readings for May and June 2019 were almost as per the RBI projections. While the
Economic Survey 2018-19 provided a growth assessment very similar to the one by RBI, the Union
Budget 2019-20 assumed a substantially higher growth rate for the current fiscal year. Monsoon
is likely to be normal. Tariff war tensions have further escalated. Oil prices have continued
fluctuating within the range I had mentioned in my earlier statements. Growth impulses are,
however, weak on the whole and not significantly picking up for substantial revival. It is well
recognized in the literature and reiterated by the Economic Survey 2018-19 that investment is a
primary driver for economic growth and employment creation. In order to boost investment
activities, positive sentiments and business-conducive environment need to be enhanced. It
requires carrying out several economic reform measures in the land and labour markets, tariffs of
electricity and other resources, and taxation of income and goods and services, besides urgently
correcting prevailing high real interest rates in India. While most of these measures are not within
the purview of the monetary policy, correction of high real interest rates to a certain extent is. Since
I do not see any major threat to inflation in the foreseeable future, I would like to vote for a 35 bps

i) RBI surveys have found that the corporates are now investing more in the financial assets
than in the physical assets. Thus, they are turning savers rather than investors. This provides
indirect evidence of the adverse impact of high real interest rates prevailing in the economy.
Economic reform measures would be more effective if the necessary incentives in terms of
costs are there.

ii) Fiscal slippage is not a matter of serious concern for the rest of the year, because the Union
Budget has maintained the target given in the fiscal consolidation path and the state budgets
put together are also not likely to show any serious divergence from the path.

iii) The fiscal policy as indicated by the Union Budget 2019-20 on the contrary is on a tighter
side rather than expansionary side. The budgeted fiscal deficit this year and projected for
the next two years in the medium term strategy paper are very much on the fiscal
consolidation path notwithstanding current slowdown and emergence of substantial
negative output gap. As I had argued in my statement in the previous MPC meeting,
adhering to the fiscal deficit target during a downturn of the business cycle amounts to a
tight fiscal policy. It is also corroborated by the increased taxation and maintaining
expenditure relative to GDP in the budget. The monetary policy has to, therefore, do its bit
to provide the boost to the economy however short-lived it may be, because currently
inflation does not appear to be a concern in the next 3-4 quarters at least.

iv) Globally, central banks have not only been dovish in their stance but have also cut their
policy rates.

v) Inflationary expectations one year ahead by households have been declining and the latest
round shows about a 20 bps fall over the previous round. If one outlier city is excluded, the
fall is much larger. Similarly the business expectations about headline CPI inflation one
year ahead by the IIMA survey shows the expectation of about 3.7 percent, which is very
close to the RBI prediction as well.

vi) Thus, there is enough policy space to cut the policy repo rate to correct the high real interest
rate in the economy. The transmission of the policy rate cuts in the current cycle is likely to
take some time because of the lags involved on account of the nature of the banking
business. However, under prevailing circumstances, the immediate transmission should be
considered not so much in terms of the bank deposit and lending rates but more specific
rates influencing new investments such as housing loans, vehicle loans and long term bonds.

56. Given that there is a significant policy space to correct the real rate of interest and thereby

helping the economic activities to recover, it is prudent in my opinion to cut the policy rate
somewhat aggressively but cautiously keeping some space for future exigencies. As far as the
general practice of taking 25 bps as a unit for cutting or raising the policy rate is concerned, there
is no logic or scientific basis for it, particularly when we measure inflation rate, GDP growth rate,
fiscal deficit percentage, etc. in single decimal. Ideally, there is a case for considering the unit to
be 10 bps for cutting or raising the policy rate. I would, therefore, like to cut the policy rate by 40
bps, but I do not mind going with majority opinion of cutting the rate by 35 bps this time, and
maintaining the accommodative stance.

57. Since the MPC met in June, the macroeconomic outlook appears to have darkened, denting

business and consumer confidence. This deterioration is getting reflected in inflation outcomes:

(a) a pre-monsoon food price build-up was anticipated and it is tracking the seven-year average

_i.e., the history of the index, in spite of unfavourable base effects – this suggests that food_
prices are actually stabilising;

(b) pressure points have opened up – pulses; dairy products; proteins; oils and fats – but there

have been no unruly spikes; moreover, they fall in the remit of supply management policies,
since they either reflect sectoral imbalances or cost push factors and nimble steps assume
priority in order to prevent price pressures from accumulating;


(c) the dynamics of inflation excluding food and fuel warrant concern, especially its broad

based and persisting softness because it seems to be mirroring the weakening of domestic
demand.

58. In terms of the technology of monetary policy, the intrinsic link between underlying

inflation and the output gap is stark – the Phillips curve is alive and well in India, notwithstanding
some recent loss of faith. This validates the policy actions and a shift in the stance since February
2019.

59. Turning to the state of the economy, virtually every indicator of activity is turning down.

Global growth flattered in Q1 of 2019 only to deceive in Q2. Global trade is in contraction. In
India, high frequency indicators have focused the narrative on the slowdown in investment, the
silence of the animal spirits embodied in the flattening of capital goods production, the absolute
decline in capital goods imports and the deceleration in construction activity. What is worrisome
though is that other components of aggregate demand could be joining investment in the loss of
speed. Private consumption, the bedrock of domestic demand (57 per cent of GDP), is losing
momentum in both urban and rural areas. Meanwhile, the deceleration in external demand on
account of trade and geopolitical tensions has muted exports and sunk imports into contraction.
The fiscal stimulus from the 7[th] Pay Commission award and one rank one pension (OROP) is
fading (0.9 per cent of GDP in 2017-18 and 0.3 per cent in 2018-19); this was expected as the
stimulus was in the form of revenue expenditure and the revenue multiplier in India is less than
unity.

60. The key issue is: what is the extent of the downturn? This is hard to decipher at this stage

– indicators of global economic activity are flashing amber or red, but there is no recession. Yet,
projections of growth are being repeatedly marked down. The number of central banks that have
either eased monetary policy or are getting ready to do so has increased, and ‘insurance’ cuts are
becoming visible.

61. In India, negative gaps have opened up in respect of both output and inflation, warranting

an appropriate policy response. The issue is: how is the policy headroom to be used? Monetary
policy has been proactive and front-loaded as the first line of defence. From here on, the space for
monetary policy action has to be calibrated to the evolving situation, especially as the nature and
depth of the slowdown is still unravelling and elbow room may be needed if it deepens. A more
broad-sided response involving all levers of policy acquires the highest priority now. The
overarching goal is to reinvigorate domestic demand and the time to do it is now.

62. On these considerations, I vote for a 35 basis points reduction in the policy rate while

persevering with the accommodative stance of monetary policy.

63. The inflation trajectory has evolved since the June 2019 policy on the expected lines.

Among the components, food inflation has turned up, while inflation excluding food and fuel has
shown distinct moderation. Reflecting the weak demand conditions as well as lower input costs,
the CPI inflation, excluding food and fuel, has seen a moderation of around 100 bps since March
2019. This moderation is broad based. Food inflation on the other hand registered a sharp increase
to 2.4 per cent in June from 0.7 per cent in March largely due to a pick-up in prices of vegetables
and pulses. Significant inflation pressures continued in meat and fish. Headline CPI inflation in
Q1:2019-20 averaged 3.1 per cent, which was close to RBI’s projection of 3.0 per cent made in
the June 2019 policy. The three-month ahead inflation expectations of households based on the
Reserve Bank’s survey have remained unchanged vis-à-vis the previous round, while one-year
ahead inflation expectations have moderated by 20 bps.

64. Global growth has weakened, and several central banks have adopted more accommodative

stance of monetary policy. Domestic growth is also slowing down. A worrisome aspect of the
recent growth slowdown is the moderation in private consumption which constitutes the largest
segment of aggregate demand. Rural demand indicators like tractor and motorcycle sales continued
to contract in May-June. Urban demand indicators, like passenger vehicle sales, contracted for the
eighth consecutive month in June. Commercial vehicle sales also contracted during June.
Construction activity indicators weakened with contraction in cement production and slower
growth in finished steel consumption in June. Import of capital goods – a key indicator of
investment activity – contracted in June. Q1 growth has been projected to slow down to 5.8 per
cent – the second consecutive quarter of less than six per cent growth. The Business Expectations
Index of the Reserve Bank’s industrial outlook survey, however, shows some moderation in
demand conditions in Q2.

65. Cumulative repo rate reduction of 75 bps effected since February 2019 has so far resulted

in 29 bps reduction in weighted average lending rate (WALR) of banks on fresh rupee loans. This
is considered inadequate even though the transmission is expected to improve, going forward.

66. The projected inflation path suggests that headline inflation is expected to remain below 4

per cent for the next four quarters up to Q1:2020-21. GDP growth projection for 2019-20 has been
successively revised down from 7.4 per cent (in February 2019) to 7.2 per cent (in April 2019),
7.0 per cent (in June 2019) and to 6.9 per cent in the 3rd bi-monthly policy of August 2019.

67. Given the benign inflation outlook that is expected to continue for the rest of the year and

up to Q1:2020-21, I am of the view that there is a need for monetary policy action to support
economic activity and close the output gap. I, therefore, vote for a reduction in the policy repo
rate by 35 bps and also keep the stance of monetary policy as accommodative.

**Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das**

68. Economic activity has shown signs of further weakening since the last MPC meeting in

June 2019. Several high frequency indicators have either slowed down or contracted in recent
months. Headline CPI inflation has evolved broadly along the projected lines; CPI inflation
excluding food and fuel continued to soften, while food inflation has edged up. Global economic
activity has been losing pace, weighed down by intensifying trade tensions and geo-political
uncertainty. GDP numbers for Q2:2019 in respect of some major advanced and emerging market
economies have been subdued. Central banks in both advanced and emerging market economies
have been increasingly resorting to more accommodative stances of monetary policy.

pulses and vegetables. On the other hand, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated for the
fourth consecutive month to 4.1 per cent in June, caused by a broad-based softening across groups,
particularly clothing and footwear; household goods and services; and transport and
communication. This reflects subdued input cost pressures relating to both agriculture and
industrial raw materials and further weakening of domestic demand conditions. Inflation in the
fuel and light group also decelerated in May-June, despite the uptick in liquified petroleum gas
(LPG) prices. Inflation expectations of households in the July 2019 round of the Reserve Bank’s
survey moderated further by 20 basis points for the 1-year ahead horizon, though they remained
unchanged for the 3-month ahead horizon. Cumulatively, inflation expectations of households
have declined significantly by 180 basis points for the 3-month horizon and 190 basis points for
the 1-year horizon in last five survey rounds. This suggests that inflation expectations of
households are gradually getting better anchored. Overall, the inflation situation remains benign.
CPI inflation has been projected at 3.1 per cent for Q2:2019-20 and 3.5-3.7 per cent for H2:201920, with risks evenly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2020-21 has been projected at 3.6 per cent.

70. Turning to economic activity, total area sown under kharif crops was 6.6 per cent lower as

on August 2 than a year ago, with significant catching up taking place in recent weeks. Industrial
activity continued to be weak in May 2019, impacted mainly by manufacturing and mining. In
terms of use-based classification, growth of capital goods and consumer durables decelerated.
However, growth of non-durables accelerated in May. The index of eight core industries
decelerated in June. Merchandise exports and imports contracted in June. Seasonally adjusted
capacity utilisation moderated to 74.5 per cent in Q4:2018-19 from 75.6 per cent in Q3. Based on
early results of listed companies, demand conditions in the manufacturing sector remained weak
in Q1:2019-20, with sales of manufacturing companies contracting by 2.4 per cent (y-o-y), caused
mainly by petroleum, automobile and iron and steel companies. On the positive side, the Reserve
Bank’s business assessment index (BAI) for Q1:2019-20 improved marginally. The manufacturing
PMI rose in July, supported by a pick-up in production, higher new orders and optimism on
demand conditions in the year ahead.

71. Several high frequency indicators for May-June also suggest weakening of services sector

activity. Two key indicators of rural demand, _viz., tractor and motorcycle sales, continued to_
contract. Among indicators of urban demand, while passenger vehicle sales contracted in June,
domestic air passenger traffic growth turned positive in June after three consecutive months of
contraction. Two key indicators of construction activity, _viz., cement production and steel_
consumption, also contracted/slowed down. Import of capital goods contracted in June, suggesting
weakening of investment activity. The services PMI moved into expansion zone in July on increase
in new business activity, new export orders and employment.

72. GDP growth for 2019-20 has been revised downwards from 7.0 per cent in the June policy

to 6.9 per cent – in the range of 5.8-6.6 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 7.3-7.5 per cent for H2 – with
some downside risks. GDP growth for Q1:2020-21 is projected at 7.4 per cent. The impact of
monetary policy easing since February 2019 and favourable base effects are expected to support
GDP growth, especially in the second half of the year.

73. Liquidity in the system has been in surplus since June 2019 with the surplus absorbed under

the reverse repo window of the Reserve Bank being almost `2.0 lakh crore on August 6, 2019. The
past policy rate cuts have been fully transmitted to financial markets. The weighted average
lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans of banks has declined by 29 bps during the current
easing phase so far (February-June 2019). The transmission to bank lending rates has been
inadequate, though it is expected to improve in the coming weeks and months. Credit growth has

74. Overall, there is clear evidence of domestic demand slowing down further. Investment

activity has been losing traction. The weakening of the global economy in the face of intensifying
trade and geo-political tensions has severely impacted India’s exports, which may further impact
investment activity, going forward. Private consumption, which has been the mainstay of domestic
demand, has also decelerated. The slowing down of domestic demand is also reflected in
significant moderation in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel; and contraction in merchandise
imports.

75. In view of weakening of domestic growth impulses and unsettled global macroeconomic

environment, there is a need to bolster dwindling domestic demand and support investment
activity, even as the impact of past three rate cuts is gradually working its way to the real economy.
With headline inflation projected to remain within the target over the next one-year horizon,
supporting domestic growth by further reducing interest rates needs to be given the utmost priority.
Given the current and evolving inflation and growth scenario at this juncture, it can no longer be
a business as usual approach. The economy needs a larger push. I am, therefore, of the view that a
reduction in the policy repo rate by conventional 25 bps will be inadequate. On the other hand, a
50 bps rate cut might be excessive and indicate a knee jerk reaction. A policy rate adjustment of
25 bps or multiples thereof may not always be consistent with the evolving macroeconomic
situation. Hence, at times it is apposite to calibrate the size of the conventional rate adjustment.
Considering these aspects, I vote for reducing the policy repo rate by 35 basis points and for
continuing with the accommodative stance of monetary policy. The calibration of the size of the
rate cut is expected to reinforce and quicken the impact of (i) the past cumulative rate reduction of
75 basis points; (ii) change in the stance from neutral to accommodative; and (iii) injection of large
surplus liquidity in the system.
