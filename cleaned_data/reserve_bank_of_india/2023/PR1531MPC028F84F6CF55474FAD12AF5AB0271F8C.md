**Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting, December 6 to 8, 2023**

**[Under Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934]**

The forty sixth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under
Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during December 6 to 8,
2023.

2. The meeting was attended by all the members – Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary

Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima
Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai;
Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr.
Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the
Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr.
Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy – and was
chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor.

3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve

Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy
Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the
following, namely:

(a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee;
(b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such
member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and

(c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under subsection (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting.

4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge

consumer confidence, households’ inflation expectations, corporate sector performance,
credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and
the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff’s
macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the
outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of
monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below.

**Resolution**

5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic

situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (December 8,
2023) decided to:

   - Keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged

at 6.50 per cent.


-----

The standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25 per cent and

the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent.

   - The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to

ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth.


These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term
target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per
cent, while supporting growth.


**Assessment and Outlook**


6. Global growth is slowing at a divergent pace across economies. Inflation

continues to ebb though it remains above target with underlying inflationary pressures
staying relatively stubborn. Market sentiments have improved since the last MPC
meeting – sovereign bond yields have declined, the US dollar has depreciated, and
global equity markets have strengthened. Emerging market economies (EMEs) continue
to face volatile capital flows.

7. Domestic economic activity is exhibiting resilience. Real gross domestic product

(GDP) grew year-on-year (y-o-y) by 7.6 per cent in Q2:2023-24, underpinned by robust
investment and government consumption, which cushioned the drag from net external
demand. On the supply side, gross value added (GVA) rose by 7.4 per cent in Q2, driven
by buoyant manufacturing and construction activities.

8. Continued strengthening of manufacturing activity, buoyancy in construction, and

gradual recovery in the rural sector are expected to brighten the prospects of household
consumption. Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates, supply chain
normalisation, improving business optimism, and rise in public and private capex should
bolster investment going forward. With improvement in exports, the drag from external
demand is expected to moderate. Headwinds from the geopolitical turmoil, volatility in
international financial markets and geoeconomic fragmentation pose risks to the outlook.
Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2023-24 is projected at
7.0 per cent with Q3 at 6.5 per cent; and Q4 at 6.0 per cent. Real GDP growth for
Q1:2024-25 is projected at 6.7 per cent; Q2 at 6.5 per cent; and Q3 at 6.4 per cent
(Chart 1). The risks are evenly balanced.

9. CPI headline inflation fell by about 2 percentage points since the last meeting of

the MPC to 4.9 per cent in October 2023 on sharp correction in prices of certain
vegetables, deflation in fuel and a broad-based moderation in core inflation (CPI inflation
excluding food and fuel).

10. Uncertainties in food prices along with unfavourable base effects are likely to lead

to a pick-up in headline inflation in November-December. _Kharif harvest arrivals and_
progress in rabi sowing together with El Niño weather conditions need to be monitored.
Adequate buffer stocks for cereals and a sharp moderation in international food prices,
along with pro-active supply side interventions by the Government may keep these food
price pressures under check. Crude oil prices may remain volatile. Early results from the
firms polled in the Reserve Bank’s enterprise surveys indicate softer growth in input
costs and selling prices for the manufacturing firms in Q4 relative to the previous quarter,
while price pressures persist for services and infrastructure firms. Taking into account
these factors, CPI inflation is projected at 5.4 per cent for 2023-24, with Q3 at 5.6 per

t d Q4 t 5 2 t A i l t CPI i fl ti f


-----

Q1:2024-25 is projected at 5.2 per cent; Q2 at 4.0 per cent; and Q3 at 4.7 per cent
(Chart 2). The risks are evenly balanced.

11. The MPC observed that recurring food price shocks are impeding the ongoing

disinflation process. Core disinflation has been steady, indicative of the impact of past
monetary policy actions. Headline inflation, however, remains volatile, with possible
implications for the anchoring of expectations. Domestic food inflation unpredictability,
and volatility in crude oil prices and financial markets in an uncertain international
environment pose risks to the inflation outlook. The path of disinflation needs to be
sustained. The MPC will carefully monitor any signs of generalisation of food price
pressures which can fritter away the gains in easing of core inflation. On the growth front,
improved momentum in investment demand along with business and consumer
optimism, would support domestic economic activity and ease supply constraints. As the
cumulative policy repo rate hike is still working its way through the economy, the MPC
decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent in this meeting, but with
preparedness to undertake appropriate and timely policy actions, should the situation so
warrant. Monetary policy must continue to be actively disinflationary to ensure anchoring
of inflation expectations and fuller transmission. The MPC will remain resolute in its
commitment to aligning inflation to the target. The MPC also decided to remain focused
on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the
target, while supporting growth.

12. All members of the MPC – Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth

R. Varma, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das –
unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent.

13. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata

Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of
accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while
supporting growth. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the
resolution.


14. The minutes of the MPC’s meeting will be published on December 22, 2023.


15. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during February 6-8, 2024.

**Statement by Dr. Shashanka Bhide**


16. The official GDP growth estimate for Q2: 2023-24, YOY basis, turned out to be

surprisingly strong at 7.6%, following the growth of 7.8 per cent in Q1. The projected
GDP growth for Q2 in the October 2023 MPC meeting was 6.5 per cent, well below the
NSO estimates. Manufacturing and construction sectors recorded double digit growth
rates of GVA in Q2 offsetting the weak growth in agriculture & allied sectors and
services. The QOQ momentum in Q2 in the manufacturing and construction sectors, two
drivers of GVA growth, was above their decadal average (2011-12 to 2019-20) for the
quarter, pointing to the significant growth momentum in these sectors.

17. Although greater optimism in terms of output demand conditions or business

turnover for Q2 by the manufacturing firms relative to the service sector firms was
reflected in the RBI’s sample surveys of firms conducted during July-September, the
actual growth in GVA in manufacturing has exceeded the expectations. At the aggregate
level, GDP growth was in sync with some of the indicators of broader economic activity,
such as PMI, non-food credit, GST collections and toll collections. Financial performance
of the corporate sector for Q2 indicates improved profit earnings and spending on fixed
assets in line with the overall GVA growth and the rise in gross fixed capital formation.
We may also note that sharp increase in GVA in manufacturing in Q2 is in contrast to the
stable overall capacity utilisation rates for the sector indicating the likely significant
improvements in revenue realisations and cost efficiency in the present context.

18. The growth momentum while strong, it points to a few concerns as we go forward.

Uneven performance, both on the production and demand fronts is evident. On the
production side, the agriculture & allied sector and services registered low and modest
rates of growth in Q2. The IIP for consumer durables has shown weak growth. On the
demand side, real Private Final Consumption Expenditure registered modest 3.1% YOY
growth as compared to 11% growth in real Gross Fixed Capital Formation. The
November 2023 round of RBI’s Consumer Confidence Survey shows improvement in
total consumer expenditure over the previous round, both on current period and one-year
ahead basis. In the recent few rounds of the survey, the year ahead outlook has been
marked by consistently positive net response rates on non-essential spending. On the
external demand, the recent projections for global output growth in 2024 by IMF (October
2023) are slightly lower than in 2023 but expect world trade volumes to improve
significantly. Sustained growth in fixed capital formation may also require maintaining the
pace of government capital outlay.


-----

19. Taking into account both the positive drivers of growth and vulnerabilities, the

GDP growth projections for the remaining two quarters of 2023-24 are at 6.5 for Q3 and
6.0 per cent for Q4, taking the projections for FY 2023-24 to 7.0 per cent over the
previous year. The projected growth for H2: 2023-24 is 6.3 per cent compared to 5.9 per
cent for the same period in our October 2023 assessment. The projected GDP growth
rates for the first three quarters of 2024-25 are 6.7, 6.5 and 6.4 per cent.

20. The headline inflation dropped to 5 per cent or lower in September (5%) and

October (4.9%). Among the three major constituents – food, fuel and core – only food
inflation remained above 6% in September and October. CPI Food inflation has
remained above 6% since July this year, although pace of the increase has declined.
Within the food & beverages category of consumption, cereals, pulses and spices
registered double digit percentage price rise YOY basis in October. CPI for Eggs, milk
and fruits rose by more than 6 per cent in October. Impact of the unfavourable rainfall
conditions during the monsoon season this year has meant likelihood of weak _kharif_
harvest for some of the main crops with implications to food inflation.

21. The weak global demand conditions have kept the commodity and energy prices

in the international markets in check. However, continued geopolitical conflicts cast a
shadow on supply chains with potential to disrupt global energy and commodity markets
and inflation trends. The increased pace of economic activity in the last two quarters,
driven mainly by investment spending has not led to rise in core inflation. Supply side
policy measures by the government, particularly in the case of food commodities have
also helped in reducing the price impact of supply shocks.

22. Inflation expectations survey of urban households conducted by RBI points to the

sustained decline in 3 month-ahead inflation expectation since September 2022 up to
November 2023, barring a spike in January 2023. The one year-ahead expected inflation
rate has moved up marginally in the November round of the survey after following a
declining trajectory since September 2022.

23. While the core CPI inflation rate (excluding food and fuel components) fell below

5% in Q2: 2023-24 and dropped to 4.3% in October, price pressures in the non-farm
sectors are vulnerable to shocks to input costs. Early results of RBI’s enterprise surveys
conducted during the latter part of October and November point to some divergence in
the expectations of cost pressures and selling prices between manufacturing and other
firms. Larger proportion of sampled manufacturing firms indicate expectations of
softening of selling prices in Q4 relative to this proportion in Q3 but larger proportion of
firms in the services and infrastructure sectors expect the selling prices to rise in the
same period. The inflation expectations survey of business sector conducted by the IIMA
in October 2023 points to a slight increase in one year-ahead ‘unit cost based inflation’
from 4.39% in September 2023 to 4.44% in October 2023[1].

24. The most recent RBI’s Survey of Professional Forecasters projects headline

inflation rate for Q3: 2023-24 till Q1: 2024-25 declining from 5.4 per cent to 5.2 per cent
and dropping to 3.9 per cent in Q2: 2024-25. The core inflation (CPI excluding items of
Food, Pan, Tobacco and Intoxicants and Fuel & Light) is projected to drop from 4.3 per
cent in Q3: 2023-24 to 4.1 per cent in Q1: 2024-25 but increase to 4.4 per cent in Q2:
2024-25.

25. Considering a range of factors influencing the inflation pattern in the short-term,

the headline inflation is projected at 5.6% and 5.2% in Q3 and Q4: 2023-24, respectively,
and 5.2% in Q1: 2024-25 followed by 4% in Q2 and 4.7% in Q3.

26. Overall, the economy presently reflects the impact of strong drivers for growth

despite the unfavourable conditions in some respects. As noted earlier, adverse
monsoon rainfall conditions, especially distribution of rainfall over the monsoon period
and across the regions, have meant slower growth of agricultural output and rural
demand. The weak external demand conditions have affected the export sector. The
uneven feature of growth points to vulnerabilities. While investment has fuelled growth in
demand, private consumption demand has grown much more slowly. One reason for the
slower growth in consumption relates to the ‘base effects’ in H1 given the on-going ‘catch
up’ overcoming the pandemic shock. But the uneven sectoral growth patterns also point
to other factors influencing output noted earlier with respect to agriculture and external
demand.

27. Inflation has moderated in the context of the continued pressure the cumulative

monetary policy actions as well as supply side measures by the government in crucial
consumption sectors have exerted. The weak external demand conditions have also
meant favourable input prices in the international markets. However, food inflation is a
concern in the short term. There remain significant risks of the impact of the on-going
geopolitical conflicts on particularly fuel prices and consequently on both fuel and core
inflation rates.

28. Given that inflation remains well above the target over the short term, with the

projected headline CPI rate of above 5% up to Q1: 2024-25, there is a need to continue
the policy support for sustaining the trajectory to the target.


29. Therefore, I vote:


i)  to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent, and


ii) to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation

progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth.


**Statement by Dr. Ashima Goyal**


30. There are more signs that global interest rates may have peaked. Fears that rates

may be higher for longer have also faded as the US Fed has recognized that rates are
restrictive already and becoming more so as inflation falls. Pointing to the 1970s to justify
higher rates is not valid since inflation has not been high for as long as it was then and
expectations remain anchored. International oil prices have also softened despite cartel
action. But geopolitics continues to remain a threat.

31. Moreover, recent experience has underlined the freedom Indian rate setters have

from international rates. Debt and equity inflows returned as rate differentials narrowed.

32. Indian growth has exceeded expectations again. Manufacturing performance is

strong. There are more indications of the expected turnaround in private investment.
While cement and steel production have been robust for long, IIP and imports of capital
goods, banks’ project finance, firms’ investment intentions and fixed assets have also
risen. Rising cash and reserves makes firms less dependent on household savings for
financing.


-----

33. The recent state election results reduce uncertainty around national elections and

policy so more investment plans should be fast-tracked. But areas of weakness remain
in consumption, IT and merchandise exports. Employment offers have slowed in IITs.

34. The centre has demonstrated commitment to fiscal consolidation in terms of

sticking to the announced path of deficit reduction, higher share of spending on
investment and discipline on off-budget items. Buoyant revenues are able to absorb a
large post-pandemic subsidy burden. As countercyclical macroeconomic policy smooth’s
shocks and delivers a real interest rate less than the real growth rate, the denominator
rises, reducing debt and deficit ratios[2].

35. Headline inflation is expected to be within the tolerance band at 5.4% in FY24 and

to fall to 4% in Q2 FY25 but rise to 4.7 in Q3. Core inflation shows a broad based
moderation falling from 6.1 in 2022-23 to 4.8 in Q2 FY24. Professional forecaster’s figure
for core inflation in Q3 is at 4.4%.

36. There is a view that stronger growth will raise core inflation. But even with real

GDP growth at 7% it does not necessarily imply potential output is reached implying
excess demand and pressures on core inflation if reforms are raising structural growth.

37. Some research defines potential output in terms of expected inflation, and this is a

forward-looking way to estimate it given India’s large underemployed population and
rising investment—output is below potential if core inflation is below acceptable upper
limits[3.] Time series methods of estimating potential output are backward-looking, with too
much weight on recent growth.

38. Why has core inflation come in lower than expectations even as growth

recovered?

39. There were no second round effects raising wages from the earlier commodity

price shocks since Indian labour markets are slack.


40. Currently, falling costs and healthy sales have raised profits, despite factors that

are restraining demand in India. Some firms have reversed earlier price increases that
passed on higher costs. Higher sales help spread costs. Many firms had restructured
during the pandemic to reduce costs. There is evidence that the mark-up on costs is
countercyclical[4]. Lower price and higher volumes is a strategy that delivers profits in
India. Moreover, FMCG majors face competition in 2 and 3 tier markets from many new
regional entrants.

41. Investment is expanding capacity so that utilization has not increased despite

good output growth.

42. There is evidence that firm’s inflation expectations are well-anchored around 4%[5].

43. The government continues to take supply-side action to moderate short term price

spikes as well as improve capacities in the long-run.

44. Indian oil majors are profitable again despite recent volatility in oil prices and will

be able to pass on benefits to consumers if international oil prices fall sustainably below
USD 80 per barrel. Current trends are towards this.

45. All this continues to reduce costs for firms. In these circumstances, core inflation

should continue to converge towards 4% and headline should converge to a stable core
despite any further transient supply shocks. New data affects outcomes within a
structure. It is necessary to pay attention to the structure and context.

46. If inflation sustainably approaches 4% by the middle of 2024 real rates can easily

become too high if nothing is done. A repo of 6.5% in 2018 and tight liquidity with a
headline inflation of around 4%, even though core inflation was around 6%, proved
severely deflationary. Both headline and core inflation fell steeply over the next year.

47. In this meeting, however, I vote for keeping the repo rate and the stance

unchanged, in order to watch the impact of an expected rise in food inflation over the
next couple of months, since repeated supply shocks are a concern. Even so, as yet
they have not been able to raise inflation expectations or reverse the decline in core
inflation.

48. Despite the stance, I expect the weighted average call rate (WACR) to ease away

from the upper end of the LAF corridor towards the repo rate as government cash
balances are drawn down and measures are taken to reduce liquidity hoarding by banks.
Under inflation targeting, liquidity is endogenous and is expected to adjust to keep short
rates near the repo rate set by the MPC. The RBI had clarified[6] post inflation targeting
that its ‘operating procedure aims at modulating liquidity conditions so as to achieve the
operating target, i.e., to anchor the WACR around the policy rate’ and ‘MSF rate and the
fixed overnight reverse repo rate define an informal corridor for limiting intra-day
variations in the call rate.’ Understanding this should alleviate the markets concern that
liquidity can suddenly dry up. While under the current stance WACR may stay largely in
the upper half of the LAF corridor, it cannot persistently exceed it.

49. Pass-through continues as old deposits and loans are re-priced, but the stance,

as well as credit growth continuing to exceed deposit growth, should persuade banks of
the virtues of passing through more of the 250bps repo rate rise to increase their primary
liquidity.


**Statement by Prof. Jayanth R. Varma**


50. Current indications are that, after many difficult quarters, the economic

environment is turning more benign in terms of both inflation and growth. The challenge
for monetary policy is to facilitate this benign outcome where inflation trends down and
growth remains robust.

51. This requires two things. First, a restrictive monetary policy must be maintained

long enough to glide inflation to its target of 4%. Second, as inflation drops well below
the upper tolerance band, it is necessary to prevent the real interest rate from becoming
excessive. At present, projected inflation two to four quarters ahead averages below
4.75%. The prevailing money market interest rates of 6.75% (close to the MSF rate)
therefore represent a real interest rate of more than 2%. Three years of high inflation do

on Monetary Policy Framework between the Government of India and the RBI, available at

justify a strong anti-inflationary monetary policy, but in my view a real rate of 2% clearly
exceeds the optimal rate. In coming months, as we become more confident about the
downward trajectory of inflation (apart from transient food price spikes), there would be a
compelling case for continually calibrating the nominal policy rate so as to keep the real
interest rate slightly below 1.5% (on the basis of projected inflation 3-5 quarters ahead).

52. For these reasons, I vote for maintaining the repo rate at 6.50%, but express my

reservations on the stance. I believe that a stance is not needed at all at this stage. If at
all there is a stance, it should be neutral.


**Statement by Dr. Rajiv Ranjan**


53. I began my October statement with three global trends to be closely watched –

crude oil prices, US yields and US dollar, all of which were rising then. Oil prices have
decreased, yields have softened, and the US dollar has weakened since the last policy.
Thus, we draw comfort from the reversal of these trends in this December policy. In
addition, global commodity prices have eased further. The impact of these dynamics is
seen globally in terms of faster than expected decline in inflation of advanced countries
and the conjecture that the apprehension of ‘higher for longer’ may not last long.
Domestically, improvement in manufacturing profit with easing of input cost pressures
and decline in core inflation is clearly observed. Thus, despite continuing overall global
uncertainty, the macroeconomic environment in advance and emerging market
economies has not been adversely impacted to the same extent as it was expected, not
a long time ago. In fact, the global economy seems to have dodged a hard landing,
though it continues to remain vulnerable to slow down risks.

54. Since the last policy, we are in a relatively firmer footing on our domestic macros

in terms of inflation and growth. The moderation in CPI to 4.9 per cent in October 2023
was driven by the fall in food and core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation along with
deflation in the fuel group. Since September, core disinflation also gathered pace,
softening by about 60 basis point in a span of two months to 4.3 per cent in October or
by about 2 percentage points from a peak value of 6.2 per cent in January.[7] Even within
core, services inflation at 3.6 per cent was at the lowest level since the start of the
2012=100 series. Core goods inflation, from a peak of 7.1 per cent in February 2023 has
since then sequentially moderated to 5.0 per cent in October. Various exclusion based
and statistical trimmed mean measures of core inflation also softened in the range of 60120 bps between August and October. Going forward, core inflation pressure could
remain muted, as our monetary policy actions play out and softer growth in input costs
and selling prices of the manufacturing sector keep price pressures contained. Concerns
on elevated food inflation, however, is a major source of uncertainty for the inflation
outlook.

55. On the growth front, the economy is running at full steam. Growth has been

resilient and continuously surprising us on the upside over last two releases. The
seasonally adjusted momentum in Q2 at 4.3 per cent was stronger than Q2 last year (3.2
per cent) and the pre-COVID average for Q2 (1.6 per cent). This momentum is likely to
continue in Q3 and Q4 of 2023-24. It is important to note that for the first time in
Q2:2023-24, the fault lines in India’s growth story since the pandemic – tepid private
investment and rural demand – seem to be gaining traction. This augurs well for the

long-term growth trend, particularly, investment plays a larger role in terms of supply
augmentation and improving potential growth in the medium to long-term. India has
successfully accumulated capital stock over the past decades and continues to invest in
capital formation, led by Government capital expenditure, as reflected in the recent GDP
data release. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), a proxy for investments, increased
by 11 per cent in Q2. We are also in an advantageous position in terms of contribution to
potential output through labour and total factor productivity (TFP) channels. India is in the
forefront of technology-aided digitalisation with increasing internet penetration and
mobile phone usage.[8] Greater formalisation and digitalisation of our economy is giving a
boost to TFP growth. With respect to human capital, India has a perceptible advantage in
terms of demographic dividend and the economy could benefit from it.[9] Taken together,
capital and TFP, along with favourable demographic dividends, could have led to a
sustainable increase in the potential level of output of the economy. This change in
structural features of the economy could explain to a large extent the observed dynamics
of robust growth numbers along with falling core inflation.

56. The best way monetary policy can support this high growth trajectory is by

maintaining its commitment to price stability. While monetary policy has succeeded in
getting headline inflation into the tolerance band, it is still above the target[10] and
continues to remain vulnerable to supply shocks. The below 5 per cent print in October
2023 may reverse as early as next month. In essence, while a durable growth path
backed by consumption and investment is visible from here on, the same cannot be said
about disinflation yet. Hence, monetary policy must continue treading a cautious path
and remain prudent in its approach. We need to continue with the pause on the policy
rate in this meeting while observing every incoming information impacting growthinflation dynamics. Given that inflation remains above target, our stance of withdrawal of
accommodation also has to continue to aid fuller transmission. Having taken a pause
during the last few policies, there could be an argument for a change in stance to neutral.
I feel this is not the right time. Apart from being premature, a change to neutral stance
may have to bear the brunt of the collateral damage caused by wrong signalling,
particularly with looming uncertainties on the horizon and when market expectations are
running ahead of policy intent. We need to consolidate the gains achieved so far.
Accordingly, I vote for a pause on rate and continue with the stance.


**Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra**


57. Inflation remains highly vulnerable to food price spikes, as the spurt in momentum

in daily data on key food items for the month of November and early December reveal.
This repetitive incidence is causing the accumulation of price pressures in the system
and could impart persistence, reflected in a left-tailed skew in the distribution of inflation.
Households are already wary: although they expect inflation to remain unchanged three
months ahead, they are more unsure about this prognosis than they were two months
ago. Over the year ahead, however, they are more sure than in the past that inflation will
likely rise. Consumers too reveal more pessimism about inflation a year ahead than
when they were surveyed in September. Consequently, monetary policy has to remain
on high alert with a restrictive stance.

58. In my view, food prices in India are the true underlying component of inflation.

They also generate non-trivial external effects that affect other components of inflation as
well as expectations. When these spillovers occur and are significant, monetary policy
has to pre-emptively act to prevent generalization, irrespective of the fact that the initial
shocks emanate from outside the realm of its influence. Hence the stance of withdrawing
accommodation and a readiness to take appropriate action must continue until their
impact is seen off without second order effects.

59. The recent GDP data release reinforces the view that the output gap in India has

turned positive since the beginning of the year and remains so. This points to the
likelihood of demand pull shaping the course of inflation outcomes in the period ahead,
amplifying future supply shocks. Over the rest of the year, rising momentum of activity
will drive growth offset by waning of favourable base effects. Rural demand is gradually
improving while urban demand remains ebullient. Investment has emerged as the
mainstay of aggregate demand. It remains to be seen if the recent upturn in exports of
merchandise sustains. The strength of underlying domestic demand is also being
reflected in the pick-up in non-oil non-gold imports after a prolonged contraction.

60. Against this backdrop, the monetary policy reaction function needs to assign a

higher weight to inflation relative to growth in a forward-looking sense. Accordingly, I vote
to maintain status quo on the policy rate and continue with the stance of withdrawal of
accommodation.

61. The years 2020 to 2023 will perhaps go down in history as a period of ‘Great

Volatility’. In this environment, the Indian economy presents a picture of resilience and
momentum as reflected in the higher than anticipated GDP growth in Q2:2023-24,
surprising everyone on the upside. Reflecting this, our growth projection for the current
year has been revised upward to 7 per cent. We expect this growth momentum to
continue next year also.

62. The softening of headline inflation to 4.9 per cent in October 2023 gives further

credence to the fact that the heightened and generalised inflation pressures seen in the
summer of 2022 is behind us. This disinflation is underpinned by steady moderation in
CPI core inflation, caused by easing of price momentum across core goods and
services. Core inflation in October was the lowest since early 2020 and would show that
our monetary policy actions are working.

63. Moving forward, while food inflation has receded from the highs seen in July, it

remains elevated. The overall inflation outlook is expected to be clouded by volatile and
uncertain food prices and intermittent weather shocks. In the immediate months of
November and December, a resurgence of vegetable price inflation is likely to push up
food and headline inflation. We have to remain highly alert to any signs of generalisation
of price impulses that may derail the ongoing process of disinflation.

64. GDP growth is expected to remain resilient. Financial conditions are stable.

Inflation is moderating, but we are still quite a distance away from our goal of reaching 4
per cent CPI on a durable basis. The projected inflation (4.7 per cent) in Q3 of next year,
i.e., one year from now, is perilously close to 5 per cent. In these circumstances,
monetary policy has to be actively disinflationary. Any shift in policy stance now would
be premature and risky. Further, with past rate hikes still working through the economy,
it would be desirable to closely monitor their full play out The conditions ahead could be

fickle and call for prudent evaluation of the emerging situation. Considering all the above
factors, a pause in rate action and remaining focused on withdrawal of accommodation is
considered necessary in this meeting of the MPC. Accordingly, I vote for keeping the
policy repo rate unchanged and continuing with the focus on withdrawal of
accommodation. We have to remain vigilant and ready to act effectively in our journey
towards 4 per cent inflation target.
