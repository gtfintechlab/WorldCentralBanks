**Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting, December 5-7, 2022**

**[Under Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934]**

The fortieth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under
section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during December 5-7,
2022.

2. The meeting was attended by all the members – Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary

Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima
Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai;
Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr.
Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the
Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr.
Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy – and was
chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor.

3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve

Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy
Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the
following, namely:

(a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee;
(b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such
member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and

(c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under subsection (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting.

4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge

consumer confidence, households’ inflation expectations, corporate sector performance,
credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and
the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff’s
macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the
outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary
policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below.

**Resolution**

5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic

situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (December 7, 2022)
decided to:

  - Increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 35

basis points to 6.25 per cent with immediate effect.


-----

Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 6.00 per cent
and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.50 per cent.

  - The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to

ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting
growth.

These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term
target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per
cent, while supporting growth.

The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.


**Assessment**


_Global Economy_

6. The global economic outlook is skewed to the downside. Global growth is set to

lose momentum as monetary policy actions tighten financial conditions and as consumer
confidence weakens with the rising cost of livelihood. Inflation remains elevated and
persistent across countries as they grapple with food and energy price shocks and
shortages. More recently, however, there are some signs of moderation in price
pressures, which have raised expectations of an easing in the pace of monetary
tightening. Alongside easing in sovereign bond yields, the US dollar has come off its
highs. Capital flows to emerging market economies (EMEs) remain volatile and global
spillovers pose risks to growth prospects.

_Domestic Economy_

7. On the domestic front, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 6.3 per

cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q2:2022-23 after an increase of 13.5 per cent in Q1. On the
supply side, gross value added (GVA) rose by 5.6 per cent in Q2.

8. In Q3, economic activity is exhibiting resilience. In the agricultural sector, a pick-up

in rabi sowing (6.4 per cent higher than a year ago on December 2) is supported by the
good progress of the north-east monsoon and above average reservoir levels. Activity in
the industry and services sectors is in expansion mode, as reflected in purchasing
managers’ indices (PMIs) and other high frequency indicators.

9. Aggregate demand conditions have been supported by pent-up spending and

discretionary expenditures during the festival season, although their evolution is
somewhat uneven across sectors. Urban demand has remained buoyant, and rural
demand is recovering. Investment activity is in modest expansion. Merchandise exports
contracted in October after an expansion for 19 consecutive months. Growth in non-oil
non-gold imports decelerated.

10. CPI inflation moderated to 6.8 per cent (y-o-y) in October 2022 from 7.4 per cent in

September, with favourable base effects mitigating the impact of pick-up in price
momentum in October. Food inflation softened, aided by easing inflation in vegetables
and edible oils, despite sustained pressures from prices of cereals, milk and spices. Fuel
inflation registered some easing in October, driven by softening of price inflation in LPG,
kerosene (PDS) and firewood and chips. Core CPI (i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel)
inflation persisted at elevated levels at 6 per cent, with price pressures across most of its


-----

11. The overall liquidity remains in surplus, with average daily absorption under the

liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) at ₹1.4 lakh crore during October-November as
compared with ₹2.2 lakh crore in August-September. On a y-o-y basis, money supply
(M3) expanded by 8.9 per cent as on November 18, 2022 while bank credit rose by 17.2
per cent. India’s foreign exchange reserves were placed at US$ 561.2 billion as on
December 2, 2022.

**Outlook**

12. The inflation trajectory going ahead would be shaped by both global and domestic

factors. In case of food, while vegetable prices are likely to see seasonal winter
correction, prices of cereals and spices may stay elevated in the near-term on supply
concerns. High feed costs could also keep inflation elevated in respect of milk. Adverse
climate events – both domestic and global – are increasingly becoming a significant
source of upside risk to food prices. Global demand is weakening. Unabating geopolitical
tensions continue to impart uncertainty to the food and energy prices outlook. The
correction in industrial input prices and supply chain pressures, if sustained, could help
ease pressures on output prices; but the pending pass-through of input costs could keep
core inflation firm. Imported inflation risks from the US dollar movements need to be
watched closely. Taking into account these factors and assuming an average crude oil
price (Indian basket) of US$ 100 per barrel, inflation is projected at 6.7 per cent in 202223, with Q3 at 6.6 per cent and Q4 at 5.9 per cent, and risks evenly balanced. CPI
inflation for Q1:2023-24 is projected at 5.0 per cent and for Q2 at 5.4 per cent, on the
assumption of a normal monsoon (Chart 1).

13. On growth, the agricultural outlook has brightened, with the prospects of a good

_rabi harvest. The sustained rebound in contact-intensive sectors is supporting urban_
consumption. Robust and broad-based credit growth and government’s thrust on capital
spending and infrastructure should bolster investment activity. According to the RBI’s
survey, consumer confidence is improving. The economy, however, faces accentuated
headwinds from protracted geopolitical tensions, tightening global financial conditions
and slowing external demand. Taking all these factors into consideration, the real GDP
growth for 2022-23 is projected at 6.8 per cent with Q3 at 4.4 per cent and Q4 at 4.2 per
cent, with risks evenly balanced. Real GDP growth is projected at 7.1 per cent for
Q1:2023-24 and at 5.9 per cent for Q2 (Chart 2).


-----

14. Inflation has ruled at or above the upper tolerance band since January 2022 and

core inflation is persisting around 6 per cent. Headline inflation is expected to remain
above or close to the upper threshold in Q3 and Q4:2022-23. It is likely to moderate in
H1:2023-24 but will still remain well above the target. Meanwhile, economic activity has
held up well and is expected to be resilient, supported by domestic demand. Net exports
would remain subdued due to the drag from evolving external demand conditions.
Further, the impact of monetary policy measures undertaken needs to be watched. On
balance, the MPC is of the view that, further calibrated monetary policy action is
warranted to keep inflation expectations anchored, break the core inflation persistence
and contain second round effects, so as to strengthen medium-term growth prospects.
Accordingly, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 35 basis points to 6.25
per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to
ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.

15. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata

Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to increase the policy repo rate by 35 basis points.
Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted against the repo rate hike.

16. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri

Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that
inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. Dr. Ashima
Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted against this part of the resolution.

17. The minutes of the MPC’s meeting will be published on December 21, 2022.


18. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during February 6-8, 2023.

**Statement by Dr. Shashanka Bhide**

19. The official estimate of year-on-year real GDP growth in Q2: FY 2022-23 at 6.3 per

cent equals the September 2022 forecast by RBI. Although the YOY growth in Q2 is well
below 13.5 per cent registered in Q1, it reflects a strong sequential momentum with QOQ
growth at 3.6 per cent. Private Final Consumption Expenditure, Gross Fixed Capital
Expenditure and exports of goods and services have shown sequential expansion over
Q1. However, going forward, the growth scenario would be affected adversely by the
slowing global growth even as growth-supportive policy measures provide new
opportunities in the economy.

20. A review of wide range of indicators of the recent economic activity point to a

mixed outlook for growth. The Index of industrial production (IIP) for September 2022, the
latest month for which data are available, increased by 3.1 per cent YOY basis. However,
the pattern has been uneven across sectors and also over time. In August the growth
was negative after a modest growth of 2 2 per cent in July IIP Consumer Non-durables

declined in July, August and September, while it was negative in August and September
for Consumer Durables. Gross Value Added from manufacturing and industry as a whole
declined in Q2: FY 2022-23 and rose for Services. Value of merchandise exports
declined in October by 12.1 per cent in US$ terms, after a sharp deceleration in Q2.
Services exports have expanded YOY basis in October but declined relative to
September.

21. On the positive note, IIP for Capital Goods and Infrastructure, and Construction

registered acceleration on YOY basis in September. Purchasing Managers’ Index for
manufacturing and services remained in expansion zone in October and November 2022.
Although non-oil non-gold merchandise imports declined in October over September,
they remained above the level in the same period in the previous year. GST collections
registered YOY double digit growth in October and November. Non-food credit growth
was high, averaging 17.6 per cent during September-November.

22. The qualitative indicators from the RBI’s surveys of urban households for

September and November 2022 point to a gradual improvement in sentiments relating to
overall economic conditions, employment and income. Increased consumer spending is
supported by ‘non-essential’ items, with an expected improvement in sentiments for
‘discretionary’ spending only on one-year ahead basis.

23. While the economic activity levels moving into Q3: FY 2022-23 suggest resilience,

outlook is, however, faced with the slowing global growth conditions. The global growth
outlook has deteriorated since the last meeting of the MPC in late September. The IMF in
its October 2022 World Economic Outlook projects a decline of world output growth YOY
basis from 6.0 per cent in 2021 to 3.2 per cent in 2022 and 2.7 per cent in 2023, with
downside risks to projections. The external demand conditions and capital flows to EMEs
may weaken as a consequence. As the causes of the global growth slow down include
the impact of COVID 19 related issues in China and the Ukraine war, besides the
monetary policy tightening measures across countries, the outlook is also affected by the
risk of high energy and food prices as their supply chains get disrupted.

24. Taking into account the trends in key exogenous global and domestic conditions,

the revised real GDP growth rate, YOY basis, for FY 2022-23 is 6.8 per cent with Q3 and
Q4 at 4.4 and 4.2 per cent, respectively. The revised growth rate for FY 2022-23 is lower
by 20 basis points from the projections provided in the September MPC meeting. The
GDP growth rate for FY 2023-24 is projected at 7.1 per cent for Q1 and 5.9 per cent for
Q2.

25. The YOY CPI inflation moderated to 6.8 per cent in October from 7.4 per cent in

September, with decline of 140 basis points in food inflation and 50 bps in fuel & light.
The core inflation, based on CPI components excluding food and fuel remained at 6 per
cent. The MOM momentum of prices, however, remained high. The headline CPI
increased by 0.8 per cent in October over September, contributed by significant monthover-month increase in all the major components of CPI.

26. The general upward pressure on inflation may be attributed to incomplete

transmission of previous input price hikes even as overall demand conditions show
gradual improvement. The successive supply side shocks affecting the costs and prices
beginning with the rising input and energy prices, food prices and strengthening US dollar
may not have been fully offset by the rising selling prices in all sectors. The Wholesale
Price Index (WPI) inflation, a measure of producer level prices, dropped to single digit
(8.4 per cent) in October 2022 for the first time after a run of double-digit annual increase

been in single digits since June 2022 although for many energy items, the inflation rate
remains in double digits. Declining profitability of firms seen in the corporate performance
in Q2: FY 2022-23 in the manufacturing sector is one indication of the inability to recover
all the cost increases fully.

27. The RBI Inflation Expectations Survey of Households in urban areas conducted in

November indicates a drop in the median perceived headline inflation rate in November
2022 compared to September. The expectations of inflation rate three-month ahead and
one-year ahead have also moderated in November compared to the expectations in
September. However, the decline follows an upturn experienced in September and
accordingly, the moderation of CPI inflation in October may have influenced the current
household expectations. The Business Inflation Expectations Survey conducted by the
Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad[1] points to a reduction of one-year ahead
inflation based on unit costs to less than 5 per cent in August and September 2022,
although 45 per cent of the respondents continue to see the one-year ahead inflation rate
at 6 per cent or above. The survey has also reflected a declining pattern of one-year
ahead CPI inflation rate.

28. Taking into account the current trends in both domestic and international

commodity prices and their major determinants, the CPI inflation rate for the full current
financial year has been retained at 6.7 per cent, the same level as in the September
meeting. The projections of CPI inflation rate for Q2 and Q3 are at 6.6 and 5.9 per cent,
respectively. The projected YOY inflation rates for Q1 and Q2 of 2023-24 are also below
6 per cent. The median headline inflation rate projected by the RBI survey of Professional
Forecasters conducted in November 2022 is at 6.6 per cent for Q3: FY 2022-23 and 6.1
per cent for Q4: FY 2022-23, with 6.7 per cent for the financial year as a whole.

29. With overall domestic growth showing signs of resilience, the adverse global

macroeconomic conditions require that domestic inflation rate is at moderate levels,
within the tolerance band of the inflation target on a sustained basis. The persistence of
core inflation at the upper limit of the tolerance band of the inflation target is of particular
concern. Slippage on both growth and inflation objectives together would be a poor
outcome. Keeping in view the need to achieve moderation in the inflationary pressures in
a sustained manner, continuing with the monetary policy tightening measures is
necessary at this stage.

30. Accordingly, (1) I vote to increase the policy repo rate by 35 basis points and also

(2) I vote to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation
remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.

**Statement by Dr. Ashima Goyal**

31. Multiple global risks continue but as a growth slowdown threatens many countries,

inflation and rate actions of major central banks are also slowing. While continuing to talk
tough, even the US Fed has recognized the importance of monetary lags and of
responding to economic and social developments. There is a view that since US longterm inflation expectations remain at 3 per cent, the ex-ante real rate is already
restrictive.

32. Markets have priced in a possible pivot, although communication shocks continue

to create volatility. The dollar is weakening especially as other advanced economy central
banks also raise rates. The worst of the adjustment seems past. India saw a return of


-----

inflows in July, a few months before the reversal in other emerging markets (EMs) in
November—indicating confidence in India’s outperformance. FX reserves are rising
again. Large rupee depreciation is unlikely to add to inflation pressures in the months
ahead.

33. Global commodity prices have softened. The index for Indian supply chain

pressures has been falling since May 2021. It is now below the long-period average. The
impact is visible in the sharp fall in India’s WPI. That this is falling without a substantial
pass through to CPI, suggests that firms have not raised prices to the extent of input cost
pressures. This may be partly due to soft demand and cost-saving measures, and
hopefully the beginnings of the realization that cost shocks are temporary if the inflation
target is working to anchor expectations. The IIM Ahmedabad business inflation
expectation survey shows moderation in cost pressures and in sales, while one year
ahead inflation expectation remains below 5%, although profit margins are expected to
rise with the fall in costs. The gap between PMI input and output prices has almost closed
for manufacturing while it has fallen significantly from its May peak levels for services.
Good sowing despite extended rains is lowering food prices.

34. In core inflation the contribution of transport and communication is reducing, as is

another dominant component, clothing, after cotton prices peaked in August. Persistence
is due to multiple supply shocks more than to second round effects. RBI inflation
forecasts are based on the assumption of the Indian crude oil basket at $100 but India’s
current basket is ruling much below this level. Although domestic pass-through is yet to
happen, downside risks to inflation are high.

35. Indian exports and manufacturing output are slowing with global demand; that

imports are also decelerating, even with only about 60% pass through in fresh loans,
suggests domestic demand is also shrinking. Anecdotal evidence indicates small firms
are finding it too expensive to invest. Their contribution is necessary to reverse the
investment slowdown of the last decade, to prevent future bottlenecks and rise in costs
and to build export and employment capacity. India has excess non-oil imports partly
because this capacity was not built in the last decade.

36. Inflation targeting anchors inflation if policy rates rise one for one with expected

inflation, so the expected real rate is positive and close to the equilibrium rate. Second,
lagged transmission of higher policy rates lowers demand. The MPC has made sure of
the first and the second is in process.

37. The average inflation projection for the next four quarters is 5.7% and in Q2FY24 it

is 5.4%. So the real policy rate is positive and will rise through the year. Since there are
many factors working to chill demand, policy has to be careful in adding to these. Multiple
estimations show that through the demand channel of transmission, Indian interest rates
affect output first and inflation less and only with long lags.

38. Moreover, interest rate spreads in the Indian system are high. While the yield

spread of investment grade G-secs over hard currency sovereign yields averaged
200bps for emerging markets[2]; the Indian 10 year G-sec spread over the US 10 year is
about double this (rates were 7.21% compared to 3.5% on December 1). The 3 month
commercial paper rate is above 7%. Higher spreads imply a larger demand reducing
effect of a rise in the policy repo rate. Pass through to loan rates is also faster with the
external benchmark for loan rates.

-----

39. At present, however, Indian imports are still too high. A sticky terms of trade shock

lowers potential output, requiring demand to fall. In addition, inflation still exceeds the
MPC tolerance band for the 10th consecutive month. So I vote to raise the repo rate by
35bps to 6.25%. I would have preferred a smaller rise of 25bps, but 6.25% works well as
a focal rate.

40. Other instruments are available, apart from a demand contraction, to attain a more

sustainable current account deficit (CAD). These include export promotion, building
domestic capacity and reducing dependence on oil imports. India’s remittances and
software exports remain robust and the transition to a green economy is progressing well.
Rising share of financial savings will also reduce the CAD. There are also multiple
financing options for the CAD.

41. Since India does not have full capital account convertibility, the uncovered interest

parity (UIP) relation that says nominal domestic interest rates must equal US nominal
rates plus expected rupee depreciation does not hold in its pure form. Standard advice
based on the UIP is a way to force other countries to follow US policy. They must either
raise domestic rates with Fed rates to prevent depreciation; or under inflation targeting let
the currency depreciate then raise rates as inflation rises. But this is the way to aggravate
foreign shocks.

42. India has the space to suit policy to domestic needs and has done better because

it has used it. Capital flow management and intervention has successfully prevented
excess depreciation. Reserves are rising again. The interest gap is larger for longer
periods and in real terms[3]. For short rates prudential measures such as reducing banks’
open position limits can be used if necessary, without following US rate hikes.

43. Coming to the stance, withdrawal of accommodation was alright as long as the

large liquidity surpluses and excessive rate cuts of pandemic times persisted. But durable
liquidity seems to have contracted so much that the LAF system has not been able to
compensate for liquidity shocks during the last two months. The call money rate has
exceeded the repo rate for much of the time. It is time to move to a neutral stance, where
movement can be data-based in any required direction, as new information affects
forward projections. Accordingly, I vote against the part of the resolution on remaining
focused on the withdrawal of accommodation.

44. An EM faces large liquidity shocks, especially as major countries go in for

quantitative tightening. The LAF system has made much progress and should be able to
prevent excessive short-term liquidity tightening. If shocks are too large adequate surplus
should be created in durable liquidity. An inflation targeting regime itself provides the
inflation anchor; the anchor is not money or liquidity supply.

45. In response to market volatility after the Truss budget, the Bank of England has

shown how clear communication can separate the market-making from the monetary
policy function of liquidity. While market-making may be required in AEs with high
leverage and under-regulation of the non-bank financial sector, in India it can be used to
ensure financial conditions are able to support the creation of credit even as repo rates
rise. Financial regulation and balance sheets have strengthened, lending is risk-based,
corporates have de-leveraged. It is time for a reversal of the credit drought of the last
decade.

**Statement by Prof. Jayanth R. Varma**

46. Since the September meeting, the balance of risks has shifted decisively away

from inflation to growth both globally and domestically. There are now clear signs that the
global supply side shocks emanating from the pandemic and the Ukraine war are finally
receding. The strongest signal is the sharp fall in crude prices in the second half of
November. Global inflation seems to have peaked and is now probably heading lower.
Added to this is the fact that it is only over the next few quarters that the real economy
will experience the full brunt of the front-loaded tightening by central banks across the
world. All in all, there is much reason to be optimistic about global inflationary pressures
easing.

47. In this context, I would like to point out that the RBI’s inflation projections (as well

as that of some professional forecasters surveyed by the RBI) are still based on the
assumption of an average crude price (Indian basket) of $100. This is about 15-20%
higher than the Brent crude futures curve at the time of this meeting. Perhaps, these
forecasters believe that the Brent futures market is unreliable due to various behavioural
biases. But an assumption so sharply at deviance from liquid market prices needs to be
justified on the basis of economic and geopolitical fundamentals. In mid-November, the
futures market appears to have reassessed the geopolitical pulls and pressures on
OPEC in the light of observed political outcomes. If the forecasters disagree with this
reassessment, they need to articulate and justify their alternative narrative. In the
absence of such articulation, one could be pardoned for suggesting that the $100 Brent
crude assumption reflects the well known behavioural biases of salience and
conservatism.

48. On the domestic front also, there is strong evidence of easing of inflationary

pressures. The pricing power of producers appears to have eroded dramatically as
reflected in the sharp reduction in corporate profitability. Inflation has eased from the 7%+
levels witnessed in the middle of the year, and more importantly inflation expectations of
both households and businesses have trended down.

49. On the other hand, growth concerns have become more troubling in recent months

both globally and domestically. Financial markets are pricing in the likelihood of a
recession in several advanced economies. During the pandemic, exports and
government spending were the two growth engines that counteracted the headwinds
confronting the Indian economy. Of these, the global slowdown has already led to the
export growth engine grinding to a halt. Fiscal constraints limit the ability of government
spending to hold up the economy on its own. Private investment is unlikely to be able to
pick up the slack. Anecdotal evidence suggests that concerns about future growth
prospects are deterring capital investment even by companies that have reached more
than 80% capacity utilization. That leaves only private consumption which has remained
buoyant, but it remains to be seen how much of this is due to pent up demand which
could dissipate over the coming months. All of this means that economic growth is now
extremely fragile and definitely not robust enough to withstand excessive monetary
tightening.

50. I believe that the 35 basis point rate hike approved by the majority of the MPC is

not warranted in this context of reduced inflationary pressures and heightened growth
concerns. I therefore vote against this resolution.

51. Turning to the stance, my views are the same as in September when I argued for

a pause. Because monetary policy acts with lags, it may take 3-4 quarters for the policy

t t b t itt d t th l d th k ff t t k l 5 6

quarters. The MPC has raised the repo rate by 225 basis points in about eight months.
Accounting for the fact that in 2021 money market rates were close to the reverse repo
rate (65 basis points below the repo rate), the full magnitude of monetary tightening
would be 290 basis points. Much of the impact of this large front-loaded monetary policy
action is yet to be felt in the real economy. For these reasons, I believe that 6.25% itself
very likely overshoots the repo rate needed to achieve price stability, and poses an
unwarranted risk to economic growth. The majority of the MPC is saying that they intend
to tighten even more by withdrawing accommodation. This stance would be even more
damaging to the fragile growth outlook and I therefore vote against this resolution also.

**Statement by Dr. Rajiv Ranjan**

52. In these uncertain and difficult times, monetary policy making is a daunting task.

Achieving and maintaining credibility[4] – a valuable asset for any central bank – is still a
bigger challenge. In the quest to rein in inflation while supporting growth, central banks
are, therefore, confronted with an important decision of ‘how fast, how far and how long’[5]
the ongoing tightening phase should continue. While entailing difficult trade-offs, these
choices and its combinations, as would be eventually decided upon by the central banks,
remain vital and would set the tone for the world economy in the ensuing year. Some
central banks have already started considering a pivot towards slower pace and lesser
quantum of rate hikes or taking a pause on the tightening cycle.

53. India is no different. There are several forces at work.  One has to consider not

only evolving domestic growth and inflation dynamics, while also accounting for related
factors like cumulative tightening and its impact, lags in transmission, unexpected global
and domestic shocks, the terminal rate itself, among others. Moving slowly and doing too
little could lead to macroeconomic instability with the unhinging of inflation expectations
which, more importantly, may warrant stronger actions later that could be much more
detrimental than the costs of overtightening.[6] On the contrary, doing too much could hurt
growth. Conventionally, monetary policy credibility varies endogenously with the policy
pursued and a non-gradualist approach leads to enhanced credibility, can bring faster
disinflation that entails lower sacrifice ratio (Sargent, 1986; Ball, 1994).[7 ]These outcomes
are, however, subject to several rigidities and irrationality that may result in larger growth
sacrifice. Therefore, monetary policy needs to be watchful depending upon evolving
macroeconomic signals in balancing between gradualism and acting too fast, too soon.

54. As I had indicated in my statement of September 2022, there was a close call

between increasing the policy repo rate by 35 bps or 50 bps. After frontloaded rate hikes
since May 2022, there is a strong case now to take the foot off the accelerator while
keeping a sharp vigil on the inflation trajectory. Moreover, with inflation trajectory panning
out broadly along anticipated lines and also, considering the ongoing pass-through of
earlier monetary policy actions and the evolving growth-inflation dynamics, monetary
policy response can be calibrated to a lesser order. Thus, an increase of 35 bps is felt
appropriate at the current juncture, while also continuing with the stance of withdrawal of
accommodation, and I vote for the same. Any change in stance at this stage could be
interpreted as weakening of our resolve to fight the inflation menace and will impede

monetary policy transmission. The objective is to ensure a sustained disinflation that
brings inflation down within the tolerance band in the short-run and closer to the target
over the medium term, while supporting growth. These decisions are premised on the
following considerations.

55. Though there has been moderation in inflation by 60 bps in October, certain

underlying trends need to be closely watched. First, price momentum in October was at
the highest level since May 2022 and has also showed a sequential increase since
August 2022. Second, core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation remains sticky at 6 per
cent, with its momentum in October being the highest since April 2022, even on a
seasonally adjusted basis. In fact, deflation in petrol and diesel has masked the full
extent of inflationary pressures in core. Excluding petrol and diesel, transportation and
communication inflation was at 7.7 per cent. Trimmed mean measures of inflation
remained elevated. Third, there is evidence of continuing generalisation of price
pressures, especially in core. Diffusion indices for CPI headline and core continued to
show strong expansion in prices across the CPI basket. These factors suggest persistent
price pressures, which along with geo-political tensions and adverse climate events adds
to uncertainty, warranting a continuation of calibrated monetary policy action.

56. Growth, on the other hand, remains resilient with drag coming mainly from net

exports. Faster reopening of China, signs of deceleration in inflation in US and easing
global commodity prices are tailwinds which may limit the downside to the world demand
in 2023. From our perspective, signs of peaking of US dollar appreciation with lower
crude prices, despite news of early reopening in China, are strong positives. Though
lower crude prices would not help inflation immediately[8] due to unchanged petrol and
diesel pump prices as under-recoveries of Oil Marketing companies (OMCs) continue,
but will help external sector balance with lower imports, which already is showing sign of
tapering. Importantly, the trend in the momentum of the major components of GDP is
assuring. For instance, the momentum of real GDP in Q2:2022-23 has been robust at 3.6
per cent as against pre-pandemic (2012-13 to 2019-20) average of 0.9 per cent; similarly,
the two main drivers of GDP – private consumption and investment – recorded a
momentum of 1.0 per cent and 3.4 per cent, respectively, in Q2, as against negative prepandemic average momentum for Q2 [(-)0.1 per cent and (-)1.4 per cent, respectively,
during 2012-13 to 2019-20)]. On the supply side, a strong rebound in contact-intensive
services (trade, hotels, transportation, communication and others) with a momentum of
16.0 per cent (as against pre-pandemic average momentum of (-)1.6 per cent during
2012-13 to 2019-20) underpinned the growth in real GVA in Q2.

57. The discussion on terminal rate in monetary policy is clouded by the uncertainty on

the strength and direction of growth and inflation impulses. In this scenario, the important
point to note is that the terminal rate is time varying and has to be discovered based on
incoming data and evolving situation. With the rate hikes done so far, and considering the
inflation outlook, it can be said with certainty that real rates have moved decisively
towards positive territory, yet one cannot be sure of the same if one uses the realised
current inflation argument, which is fast gaining ground under uncertain conditions.[9]
Ensuring monetary conditions and stance are appropriately calibrated to current growthinflation dynamics is crucial as bank deposit and lending rates in real terms are much
lower than pre-pandemic levels.

58. Overall, monetary policy geared towards price stability while taking into account

output dynamics is the best guarantee to ensure lasting prosperity. Besides, in all

probability, growth concerns globally and in India may assume primacy in 2023 as the
global economy slows down on the back of tightening financial conditions even as global
supply chains get restored and input cost pressures ease from current levels.

**Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra**

59. Recent data arrivals point to a pick-up in seasonally adjusted momentum of real

GDP growth into positive territory in the second quarter of 2022-23. Notably, this
improvement has occurred on the strength of domestic drivers that overcame the
contraction in net exports. Projections indicate that positive momentum will likely be
sustained through the rest of the year. It remains to be seen if the strength of that
momentum is able to offset strong, pandemic-induced unfavourable base effects. For
2023-24, a tempering of the pace of real GDP growth relative to this year’s rate needs to
be factored in, given warnings of global slowdown and hence a rising drag from net
exports for India; still muted domestic private investment in spite of capacity utilisation
having crossed trend levels in a number of industries; and, tightening financial conditions.

60. On the other hand, inflation in India remains unconscionably elevated, persistent

and generalised, despite a grudging let-up in October solely due to favourable base
effects. The momentum of price increases was, in fact, the highest since May 2022. Core
inflation remains unyielding and diffused, with a rising price momentum as it tests the
upper tolerance band on its own, warranting resolute monetary policy resolve to quell it.
Evolving global inflation movements juxtaposed with our projections would suggest that
India’s headline inflation may ease slightly through the rest of the year. The effects of
monetary policy actions taken so far, supported by improvements in supply responses,
could break the 7 per cent plus drift in average headline inflation and at best contain it in
the range of 5-6 per cent over the year ahead. Thus, inflation can be expected to remain
above target over the next 12 months.

61. The longer inflation stays at current levels, the greater is the danger of

expectations getting unhinged, frittering away the moderation reported in the most recent
surveys of households, businesses and professional forecasters. The risk of inflation
eroding purchasing power and weakening consumer spending, especially on
discretionary items, is becoming significant. Inflation expectations may also be stalling
private investment in capacity creation, as reflected in corporate performance during the
second quarter of 2022-23.

62. Accordingly, further withdrawal of accommodation is warranted to re-balance

aggregate demand against supply conditions and return inflation first into the tolerance
band and then to alignment with the target. This is essential for sustaining the positive
turn in the momentum of growth.

63. The size and pace of further increases in the policy rate should take into account

this inflation objective. It is also necessary to incorporate the effects of cumulative rate
increases undertaken so far, the transmission to longer-term rates achieved so far, the
movements in real interest rates, and the ongoing impact on macroeconomic and
financial conditions as they evolve. Accordingly, a modest reduction in the size of the
policy rate increase in this meeting would provide the opportunity to weigh that
assessment carefully.

64. Should the incoming information indicate that the recent small easing of inflation is

transient rather than the onset of a durable downturn, the MPC should be prepared to
respond appropriately in order to achieve the desired inflation objective. In essence, the


-----

MPC needs to see a decisive decline in inflation over a series of monthly readings before
it shifts stance, which would otherwise be premature.

65. I vote for an increase in the policy rate by 35 basis points and a stance that

remains focused on the withdrawal of accommodation.


**Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das**


66. Amidst headwinds from slowing global growth and trade, the Indian economy is

exhibiting resilience and holding up well. Real GDP growth at 6.3 per cent in Q2:2022-23
was on the lines expected by us. Incoming information for Q3 indicates that economic
activity remains strong. Living as we are in an interconnected world, we cannot remain
entirely decoupled from adverse global spillovers. External demand is weakening and this
is having its negative impact on our exports. Overall, India’s real GDP is expected to
grow by 6.8 per cent in 2022-23 and India will remain amongst the fastest growing major
economies, even as rising recession possibilities characterise the global economy.

67. Headline inflation is moderating, albeit slowly. While the worst of inflation is behind

us, it remains above the upper tolerance level. It is expected to decline in H1:2023-24 but
would still be well above the target. Uncertainties surrounding the inflation trajectory
remain sizeable, given the geopolitical tensions, global financial market volatility, pending
pass-through of input costs to domestic output prices and weather-related disruptions.
Core inflation (CPI excluding food and fuel) is exhibiting persistence around 6 per cent for
the past few months. Hence, there is no room for complacency and the battle against
inflation is not over. This necessitates a constant vigil on prices.

68. Our successive rate actions since May 2022 are working through the system.

Considering the elevated inflation levels, especially the stickiness in core inflation, further
calibrated monetary policy action is warranted to contain build-up in underlying
inflationary pressures, keep inflation expectations anchored, and bring inflation closer to
the target rate of 4 per cent over the medium term. This would strengthen the mediumterm growth prospects of the Indian economy.

69. I am, therefore, of the view that a premature pause in monetary policy action

would be a costly policy error at this juncture. Given the uncertain outlook, it may
engender a situation where we may find ourselves striving to do a catch-up through
stronger policy actions in the subsequent meetings to ward-off accentuated inflationary
pressures. I, therefore, vote for an increase of 35 basis points in the repo rate – a
departure from 50 bps on three previous occasions – which itself conveys the signal of an
improvement in the inflation outlook.

70. Considering the prevailing policy repo rate, liquidity conditions and the expected

trajectory of inflation over the next several months, it is essential to persist with the
stance of withdrawal of accommodation. Hence, I vote for the same.


-----

71. To conclude, let me add that in a tightening cycle, especially in a world of high

uncertainty, giving out explicit forward guidance on the future path of monetary policy
would be counterproductive. This may result in the market and its participants
overshooting the actual play out of real conditions. In such circumstances, it would be
prudent to keep Arjuna’s eye on the evolving inflation dynamics and be ready to act as
may be necessary. Monetary policy has to be nimble to address any emerging risk to the
price stability, while keeping in mind the objective of growth.
