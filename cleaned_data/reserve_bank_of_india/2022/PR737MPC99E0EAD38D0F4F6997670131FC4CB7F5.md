**Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting, August 3 to 5, 2022**

**[Under Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934]**

The thirty seventh meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted
under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during August
3 to 5, 2022.

2. The meeting was attended by all the members – Dr. Shashanka Bhide,

Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi;
Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development
Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of
Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the
Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the
Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in
charge of monetary policy – and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor.

3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the

Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the
Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which
shall include the following, namely:

(a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee;
(b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such
member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and

(c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under subsection (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting.

4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge

consumer confidence, households’ inflation expectations, corporate sector

performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and
infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also
reviewed in detail the staff’s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios
around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive
discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is
set out below.

**Resolution**

5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic

situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (August 5,
2022) decided to:

    - Increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by

50 basis points to 5.40 per cent with immediate effect.


-----

Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 5.15 per
cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 5.65 per
cent.

   - The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of

accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going
forward, while supporting growth.

These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of
+/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.

The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.


**Assessment**


_Global Economy_

6. Since the MPC’s meeting in June 2022, the global economic and financial

environment has deteriorated with the combined impact of monetary policy tightening
across the world and the persisting war in Europe heightening risks of recession.
Gripped by risk aversion, global financial markets have experienced surges of
volatility and large sell-offs. The US dollar index soared to a two-decade high in July.
Both advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) witnessed
weakening of their currencies against the US dollar. EMEs are experiencing capital
outflows and reserve losses which are exacerbating risks to their growth and financial
stability.

_Domestic Economy_


7. Domestic economic activity remains resilient. As on August 4, 2022, the south

west monsoon rainfall was 6 per cent above the long period average (LPA). _Kharif_
sowing is picking up. High frequency indicators of activity in the industrial and
services sectors are holding up. Urban demand is strengthening while rural demand
is gradually catching up. Merchandise exports recorded a growth of 24.5 per cent
during April-June 2022, with some moderation in July. Non-oil non-gold imports were
robust, indicating strengthening domestic demand.

8. CPI inflation eased to 7.0 per cent (year-on-year, y-o-y) during May-June 2022

from 7.8 per cent in April, although it persists above the upper tolerance band. Food
inflation has registered some moderation, especially with the softening of edible oil
prices, and deepening deflation in pulses and eggs. Fuel inflation moved back to
double digits in June primarily due to the rise in LPG and kerosene prices. While core
inflation (i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel) moderated in May-June due to the full
direct impact of the cut in excise duties on petrol and diesel pump prices, effected on
May 22, 2022, it remains at elevated levels.

9. Overall system liquidity continues in surplus, with average daily absorption

under the LAF at ₹3.8 lakh crore during June-July. Money supply (M3) and bank
credit from commercial banks rose (y-o-y) by 7.9 per cent and 14.0 per cent,
respectively, as on July 15, 2022. India’s foreign exchange reserves were placed at
US$ 573.9 billion as on July 29, 2022.


-----

**Outlook**


10. Spillovers from geopolitical shocks are imparting considerable uncertainty to

the inflation trajectory. More recently, food and metal prices have come off their
peaks. International crude oil prices have eased in recent weeks but remain elevated
and volatile on supply concerns even as the global demand outlook is weakening.
The appreciation of the US dollar can feed into imported inflation pressures. Rising
_kharif sowing augurs well for the domestic food price outlook. The shortfall in paddy_
sowing, however, needs to be watched closely, although stocks of rice are well above
the buffer norms. Firms polled in the Reserve Bank’s enterprise surveys expect input
cost pressures to soften across sectors in H2. Cost pressures are, however,
expected to get increasingly transmitted to output prices across manufacturing and
services sectors. Taking into account these factors and on the assumption of a
normal monsoon in 2022 and average crude oil price (Indian basket) of US$ 105 per
barrel, the inflation projection is retained at 6.7 per cent in 2022-23, with Q2 at 7.1
per cent; Q3 at 6.4 per cent; and Q4 at 5.8 per cent, and risks evenly balanced. CPI
inflation for Q1:2023-24 is projected at 5.0 per cent (Chart 1).

11. On the outlook for growth, rural consumption is expected to benefit from the

brightening agricultural prospects. The demand for contact-intensive services and the
improvement in business and consumer sentiment should bolster discretionary
spending and urban consumption. Investment activity is expected to get support from
the government’s capex push, improving bank credit and rising capacity utilisation.
Firms polled in the Reserve Bank’s industrial outlook survey expect sequential
expansion in production volumes and new orders in Q2:2022-23, which is likely to
sustain through Q4. On the other hand, elevated risks emanating from protracted
geopolitical tensions, the upsurge in global financial market volatility and tightening
global financial conditions continue to weigh heavily on the outlook. Taking all these
factors into consideration, the real GDP growth projection for 2022-23 is retained at
7.2 per cent, with Q1 at 16.2 per cent; Q2 at 6.2 per cent; Q3 at 4.1 per cent; and Q4
at 4.0 per cent, and risks broadly balanced. Real GDP growth for Q1:2023-24 is
projected at 6.7 per cent (Chart 2).

12. Headline inflation has recently flattened and the supply outlook is improving,

helped by some easing of global supply constraints. The MPC, however, noted that
inflation is projected to remain above the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent through
the first three quarters of 2022-23, entailing the risk of destabilising inflation


-----

expectations and triggering second round effects. Given the elevated level of inflation
and resilience in domestic economic activity, the MPC took the view that further
calibrated monetary policy action is needed to contain inflationary pressures, pull
back headline inflation within the tolerance band closer to the target, and keep
inflation expectations anchored so as to ensure that growth is sustained. Accordingly,
the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.40 per cent.
The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure
that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.

13. All members of the MPC – Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof.

Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri
Shaktikanta Das – unanimously voted to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis
points to 5.40 per cent.

14. All members - Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr.

Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das, except Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation
remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. Prof. Jayanth R.
Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution.


15. The minutes of the MPC’s meeting will be published on August 19, 2022.


16. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during September 28-30, 2022.

**Statement by Dr. Shashanka Bhide**


17. The sharp increase in inflation rate in March 2022, following two successive

months of CPI inflation rate of 6 per cent or above, changed the policy perspectives
on inflation. The developments in March caused by the Russia-Ukraine war imparted
much uncertainty to global supplies of fuel, food and trade in general. The rise in
global energy prices had clear impact on the domestic prices. In May policy rate was
increased by MPC, which was followed up in June. Although the risks of Covid 19
pandemic remained, there were signs of strengthening economic activities as both
supply and demand conditions improved in many of the sectors. Bringing inflation
rate closer to the target was important to sustain the economic growth momentum
over the medium term.

18. The headline consumer inflation rate for Q1: FY 2022-23 is at 7.3 per cent,

although lower than the level projected in the June MPC meeting. At 7.3 per cent, it is
also higher than any of the previous four quarters of 2021-22. The moderation seen
in the headline inflation rate in May and June, from 7.8 per cent in April to 7.0 per
cent was mainly on account of the decline in food inflation and inflation in the
category of items excluding food and fuel & light. But in each of the three major
components of the headline, the year-on-year (YOY) inflation rate remained at or


-----

above 6 per cent in June, highlighting the continued broad-based inflationary
pressures.

19. Reduction in the excise duty on petrol and diesel by the central government

and some of state governments towards the end of May helped ease price pressures
for the transport sector. Withdrawal of Indonesia’s ban on palm oil exports by the end
of May 2022 helped ease price pressures on food inflation.

20. The commodity prices in the international markets, including metals and crude

oil, softened from the highs that prevailed when the Russia-Ukraine war broke out.
The softening of the international crude oil prices appears to be a consequence of
expected slowing down of global growth as monetary policies across countries
tightened to rein in inflationary pressures. Slowing down of Chinese economy has
also been a factor in the emerging global weak demand conditions as Covid 19
continues to cast a shadow on economic activities there.

21. These have been the positive developments as far as inflation scenario is

concerned. However, uncertainty on inflation pressures in the global environment
remains significant. Prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict and disruptions in supplies,
especially for energy and food commodities are a major source of uncertainty for
price trends. The direct impact of supply disruptions, even if targeted to some
geographies, is quickly transmitted elsewhere to meet the overall demand supply
imbalances. Weakening of many currencies against the US dollar also imparts
inflationary pressures on the domestic economies of the other countries.

22. On the domestic front, inflationary pressures exerted by the rising input prices

are continuing. The impact of recent changes to GST rates, somewhat uneven
distribution of the southwest monsoon rainfall with deficiency in the eastern region of
the country, could be source of upward pressure on prices. The Enterprise Surveys
conducted by the RBI in May-June 2022 find that majority of the firms in all the major
sectors of the economy, manufacturing, services and infrastructure, expect the cost
pressures to continue through the current financial year. As a consequence, product
prices are also expected to increase. The bimonthly survey of consumers conducted
in the first fortnight of July also points to the widely shared perception of the
prevailing high rate of inflation one-year ahead, although the percentage of
respondents who expect the rate to decline has increased compared to the previous
survey in May 2022. The RBI Survey of Inflation Expectations of Households also
conducted in the first fortnight of July shows that the 3 months ahead and one year
ahead median expected inflation rates have declined from the expectations held in
May. However, by a qualitative measure, the percentage of respondents expecting a
decline in inflation rate 3 months ahead or one year ahead is far below the
percentages who expect the rate to increase or stay similar. These sample survey
results show some signs of expectations of decline in future inflation rates but the
optimism is guarded. The RBI Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted in the
second fortnight of July 2022 projects a CPI inflation rate of 6 per cent or above in the
remaining three quarters of FY 2022-23.

23. The present pattern of trends and assessments suggest a gradual decline in

inflation rate during FY 2022-23 but still above the upper level of the tolerance band
around the target of 4 per cent. Going forward, the food inflation scenario would be
affected by the overall rainfall conditions in the remaining period of the present
monsoon and the crop prospects, besides the global price conditions. The easing of
global prices in the case of energy and other raw materials may soften the prices in
the non-food sectors although there may still be pressures from the incomplete pass
through of the higher input prices that prevailed. The upside risks to any declining
inflation trajectory in the short term are significant. Taking into account these trends,


-----

for FY 2022-23, the headline CPI inflation rates have been projected at 7.1 per cent
for Q2, 6.4 per cent for Q3 and 5.8 per cent in Q4. The projected inflation rate for FY
2022-23 is at 6.7 per cent, the same as in the June MPC meeting.

24. The global economic conditions have turned unfavourable for growth from the

combined shocks of the breakout of the Russia-Ukraine war, continued shadow of
Covid 19 across countries and the tightening of monetary policies to rein in inflation in
many countries. The revised projections by the International Monetary Fund for 2022,
released in July, place world GDP growth at 3.2 per cent, sharp drop from 4.4 per
cent projected in January 2022 and 3.6 per cent in April 2022. The world trade
volume of goods and services is now projected to grow by 4.1 per cent in 2022 over
the previous year, a decline from 6 per cent projected in January and 5 per cent in
April 2022. Deceleration in growth, particularly in the major economies of the world
would have an adverse impact on their imports. The spill over effects on imports of
other countries are also adverse. The monetary policy tightening in the advanced
economies has also led to capital outflow from the emerging economies, including
India. The elevated levels of crude oil prices and the rising prices of natural gas in the
international markets has meant rising import costs raising trade deficit.

25. The worsening global economic conditions have come at a time for us when

the domestic economy was beginning to sustain its growth momentum after regaining
the output level in 2021-22 from the shocks of the Covid 19 pandemic. Performance
of a number of sectors showed sustained growth in Q1: FY 2022-23, particularly in
manufacturing. Although IIP for April-May 2022 was only 4.0 per cent above the
same period in 2019, it was 12.9 per cent YOY basis. The PMI for manufacturing has
remained in the expansion zone for April-June and rose further in July. In the case of
services also, PMI rose from April to June but fell in July. Capacity utilisation in
manufacturing rose above the long-term average in Q4: 2021-22 and the RBI
Industrial Outlook Survey reflects expectations of steady improvement through Q4:
2022-23. Although there are concerns over demand conditions in the case of
services and infrastructure sectors in H1, improvement in conditions is expected in
H2: FY 2022-23.

26. On the demand side, the RBI Survey of Consumer Confidence conducted in

the first fortnight of July reflects continued caution by the consumers on non-essential
spending. One year ahead from now, only about 30 per cent of the respondents
expect to increase non-essential spending. The import of capital goods during
January-June 2022 in terms of value in US$ are above the 2019, although IIP for
capital goods is still below 2019 level for the same period. Export performance in
both goods and services in 2021-22 was well above the 2019 levels and in Q1: FY
2022-23, exports exceeded the value, YOY basis as well. However, going forward,
export performance would be affected by the global demand conditions, with
strengthening dollar providing some incentive to exporters despite the higher cost of
imported inputs.


27. The recent data on indicators such as GST collections, E-way bills and non

food credit indicate sustained momentum of economic activities. Although demand
conditions may be restrained, the growth momentum has been sustained. Based on
the overall economic activity conditions, the YOY GDP growth rate of 7.2 per cent for
FY 2022-23 projected in the June 2022 MPC meeting has been retained.

28. The CPI inflation rate is in excess of 6 per cent in Q4: FY 2021-22 and Q1: FY

2022-23 and projected to be well above the target of 4 per cent in Q1: FY 2023-24.
Both the GDP growth rate and inflation rate for FY 2022-23 have been retained at the
same levels as in the June MPC meeting. There are significant uncertainties to both
growth and inflation rates emanating from external and domestic factors. Sustaining


-----

the growth momentum will also require reduction in inflation rate. The prevailing
inflation pressures, therefore, remain a concern and continued monetary policy
measures are needed to ensure that the inflation rate is aligned with the target rate.

29. Accordingly, I vote to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.4

per cent. I also vote to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure
that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.


**Statement by Dr. Ashima Goyal**


30. The last three months show Indian growth sustaining despite continuing global

shocks and rate rises. Indeed, India has done better than expected and in
comparison to many countries under the pandemic and Ukraine war shocks. Among
reasons for this are growing economic diversity that helps to absorb shocks. Large
domestic demand can moderate a global slowdown; if industry suffers from
lockdown, agriculture does well. Services compensate for less contact-based delivery
with digitization, distance work and exports. Even if global growth slows,
diversification from China, India’s digital advantage and government efforts to
promote exports would support Indian exports. A rise in the current very small Indian
share in world exports remains feasible. Another example of the value of diverse
participants comes from the financial markets. Household SIPs in stock markets
have compensated for FPI outflow. Since the share of stocks in their financial assets
is still low (4 per cent compared to 27 per cent for US households) there is room for
this to rise further safely and give households higher returns in a better diversified
portfolio. Other types of diversity in the financial sector are improving stability.

31. The repo rate rise, which is reversing the large pandemic-induced cut of 115

bps in a more calibrated fashion, has not as yet slowed the recovery. Real rates
remain negative and there are lags in pass through. Even so, rising rates may have
prevented over-heating. Coordinated fiscal and monetary policy action to reduce
inflation while maintaining adequate demand has worked well.

32. Inflation has also moderated. FPI are returning because India has better

prospects among emerging markets, and the crash in currency and stock markets
that they were waiting for in order to re-enter is proving unlikely. Commodity inflation
is finally softening, and is likely to continue with a global slowdown and supply-chain
bottlenecks turning into gluts due to excess inventories with firms. In India there is
some rise in industry wages, but corporate margins remain high. Large sales and
softening of other input costs gives space to absorb moderate wage rise. Although
the RBI enterprise survey shows corporates expect prices to rise, if demand falls it
may moderate their ability to raise prices. Rural wage growth is flat at 4.8 per cent.
Household inflation perceptions and expectations have fallen.

33. Inflation, however, is still above the tolerance band, and shows signs of being

so for the first 3 quarters of 2022-23. This can be destabilizing for inflation
expectations. That policy responds strongly to ensure its inflation commitments is
important for the credibility of an inflation targeting regime. Some rise in GST tax
rates, electricity tariffs, energy costs and rupee depreciation, although the rupee is
showing signs of mean reversion towards real equilibrium values, are short-term risks
for inflation.

34. Attempting a soft landing for the economy is important, however. For this,

policy rates should not depart far from equilibrium. Such an outcome also balances
between those who gain from a rise in rates and those who lose from it. In my last
minutes I had suggested (-)1 per cent as the then lower limit for the one year ahead


-----

real repo rate. Shocks affect the steady-state natural interest rate[1]. Policy has to
tighten against negative supply shocks as well as against positive demand shocks
that raise the equilibrium rate. My research showed Indian real rates were required to
be negative in slumps but low positive in booms[2]. The healthy recovery suggests we
are no longer in a slump. Crude oil prices have fallen, but their persistence above
$100, is a negative supply shock, raising the required one-year ahead real rate into
positive territory. One year ahead inflation is expected to be around 5 per cent.
Therefore, I vote for a 50 bps rise raising the repo rate to 5.4 per cent, and delivering
the required low positive real rate.

35. Since the real rate is now near neutral, but uncertainty and global risks to both

growth and inflation remain high, policy has to carefully monitor incoming data and
respond to current developments. Indeed, if the US Fed does that, tapering its rate
rise with signs of a slowdown, it will reduce global risks.

36. One of the first impacts of rising policy repo rates should be on credit demand

as pass through raises loan rates. India is just coming out of a deleveraging cycle
and recovery requires credit growth to rise. Despite rising repo rates in May and June
2022, yearly credit growth over the respective months in 2021 continues to be high
partly due to the base effect. Preliminary sectoral credit data shows sharp rise in
bank loans to the service sector but average of MSME, NBFC and personal bank
loans over May and June was less than in April, and loans to large industry fell in
June. There are pitfalls in monthly comparisons and the picture will be clearer as
more data comes in. The rise in loan rates is still limited but has begun.

37. I also vote for ‘withdrawal of accommodation’ to continue since such a stance

defined in terms of liquidity also indicates that durable liquidity will continue to be in
surplus. This reassurance is important in a period of risk-off and possible outflows as
the Fed continues its quantitative tightening. The LAF system has enough
instruments to sterilize any effect on domestic liquidity.

38. India’s flexible inflation targeting framework is mandated to respond only to

inflation and growth. The repo rate does not respond to the exchange rate. This is
market determined with India’s capital flow and reserve management effectively
reducing exchange rate volatility, which can be too high in emerging markets under
global shocks. Research shows that inflation targeting works better in developing
economies if additional instruments are available to address excess exchange rate
and capital flow volatility[3]. India has many such instruments that can be activated if
necessary.

39. Moreover, the interest differential with the US has only a minor and possibly

perverse effect on capital flows. Debt liabilities in India’s net international investment
position include fixed income flows, as well as ECBs and institutional cross border
borrowing. Of these $14bn left in 2020, and after that, even as the differential
narrowed, have been steady at $100bn. A rise in Indian interest rates will not induce
equity investment, which is the one that is currently volatile, to stay. In 2013 and in
2018 following the Fed rate rise aggravated the Indian slowdown. Today policy has
more degrees of freedom to use. Similarly, multiple instruments are required and are
available to keep the current account deficit at sustainable levels. A competitive
equilibrium REER and demand-reducing positive real interest rates will also help.

**Statement by Prof. Jayanth R. Varma**


40. Inflation is at unacceptably high levels, and the projected trajectory is also

above target during the entire forecast horizon. Economic growth has on the other
hand proved resilient in the face of an adverse global environment. In this situation,
there is clearly a need for front loaded hikes in the policy rate. The choice to my mind
is between 50, 60 and 75 basis points.

41. The logic of front loading argues in favour of a 75 basis point hike: it would

establish the credibility of monetary policy beyond doubt, would help achieve a faster
reduction in the inflation rate, and would hopefully reduce the terminal repo rate
consistent with bringing inflation close to the target. Weighing against that is the fact
that a 75 basis point rate hike is quite unusual (despite a few recent hikes of this
magnitude globally in the recent period). In the context of market expectations of a
35-50 basis point hike, such a large hike risks being misinterpreted as a sign of
panic, and could be unnecessarily disruptive. Also even with a 50 basis point hike
this month, the cumulative tightening in the past few months of 140 basis points
would make the real interest rate positive based on projected inflation 3-4 quarters
ahead. On balance, therefore, I do not favour a 75 basis point hike at this juncture.

42. The choice between 50 and 60 basis points is less clear cut. The latter has the

advantage of bringing the repo rate back to a round multiple of a quarter percent, but
shares some of the disadvantage of a 75 basis point hike to a much lesser extent. As
I have argued in past statements, 10 basis points is not material and I am happy to
go along with the consensus of the rest of the MPC on this issue. Therefore, I vote in
favour of increasing the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.40 per cent.

43. I now turn to the second resolution to remain focused on withdrawal of

accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while
supporting growth. This statement confuses more than it clarifies. Because the rate
hike in this meeting takes the policy rate above the pre-pandemic level, “withdrawal
of accommodation” cannot refer to the withdrawal of the pandemic era
accommodation. It can only mean withdrawal of the pre-pandemic accommodation
that began with the rate cut from 6.50% to 6.25% in February 2019. A plain reading
of this resolution would then be that the MPC is focused on taking the repo rate back
to 6.50%.

44. In my view, such an indication of a terminal repo rate of 6.50% is totally

unwarranted in the situation that we are in. The reality is that the Ukraine war and
monetary tightening in the advanced economies have led to a very serious risk of
recession in the world economy. In the face of this, commodity prices have collapsed
from their April peaks. Crude oil remained elevated for longer, but it too is softening
even as the MPC meeting is in progress. If this trend continues, we could see
significant downward adjustments to the projected inflation trajectory. Moreover,
though the Indian economy has been highly resilient to geopolitical and commodity
price shocks so far, the weakening of exports in July indicates that India would not be
immune to growth shocks emanating from the rest of the world. In short, it is easy to
imagine that a few months from now, the economic data could point to a terminal
repo rate that is well below 6.50%. To focus on one thing implies paying less
attention to other things, and I do not think it would be wise to say that the MPC will
remain “focused” on withdrawal of accommodation ignoring other considerations.

45. I have made several different suggestions to the MPC regarding alternatives to

this resolution. First, in June, I suggested that individual MPC members could start
moving towards providing projections of the future path of the policy rate. Since these
would be projections of individual members and not of the MPC as a whole, these


-----

projections would not tie the hands of the MPC itself in any way. At the same time,
they would provide guidance to the public about the thinking within the MPC. Second,
at this meeting, I suggested that this resolution should simply be dropped. It is better
not to give any guidance than to give confusing guidance. Unfortunately, none of
these proposals found favour with the other members.

46. At the same time, I do not wish to record an outright dissent on this resolution

because clearly further withdrawal of accommodation is warranted. The terminal repo
rate may or may not be 6.50% but it is almost certainly well above 5.40%. So I am
confining myself to expressing my reservations on this resolution. The resolution
should in my view be interpreted only as stating that there is a high likelihood of
further front-loaded tightening without restricting the freedom of the MPC to respond
to the changing environment in a data driven manner.


**Statement by Dr. Rajiv Ranjan**


47. The risks to the global economy which were initially perceived as

stagflationary are now increasingly surfacing to be that of an outright recession for
most economies. This has fuelled a debate of hard[4] versus soft landing for the global
economy. Central banks are thus confronted with trade-offs which are governed by
both the magnitude as well as the timing of their policy tightening. While the need to
rein in inflationary pressures without numbing the growth impulses remains a priority,
central banks are treading a very narrow path and they will need a well-curated policy
design for a safe and soft landing.

48. Domestic inflation after reaching a peak of 7.8 per cent in April 2022

moderated to 7.0 per cent in May-June 2022. A sequential tapering of the month-onmonth prices increases (momentum) along with large favourable base effects in May
brought about this softening. Headline CPI price momentum eased to 0.94 per cent in
May and further to 0.52 per cent in June from an elevated 1.43 per cent in April.
Headline CPI on a seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) basis also slowed
down from 12.8 per cent in April to 2.6 per cent in June. In terms of contributions,
while the deceleration in headline price momentum in May was primarily on account
of core (CPI excluding food and fuel), food also started to contribute to the slowdown
in headline price pressures by June. The deceleration in price momentum was broadbased across items within the food group. On the other hand, the softening in core
momentum was primarily influenced by the one-off petrol and diesel price declines
(reflecting the full direct impact of excise duty cut). Despite some softening, various
trimmed mean measures of CPI inflation[5] for June were elevated, in the range of 5.7
per cent to 6.4 per cent. In spite of some softening, diffusion indices[6] for core CPI
items were also at elevated levels, implying that underlying price pressures remain
broad based.


49. Inflation expectations of households in India, being adaptive and backward

looking and influenced mainly by price expectations of food and fuel items (which
constitute almost 55 per cent of the CPI basket), moderated in the July 2022 round
but remained at elevated levels. Unmooring of inflation expectations, in the context of
the spike in inflation following the conflict in Europe, is the biggest risk which the

4 BIS in its monthly bulletin (July 2022) titled ‘Hard or Soft Landing?’ has referred hard landing as a situation of bringing inflation
back to target but at the cost of a recession.
5 In trimmed mean measures, CPI items which are located in the tails of the inflation distribution for every month (indicating
highly volatile inflation movements) are excluded.
6  The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether
their prices (seasonally adjusted) have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month and aggregates them to show
whether the month-on-month (m-o-m) increase overall has been expansionary or contractionary. The diffusion indices

50. Going forward, though the fall in international commodity prices and the

progress of the monsoon provide room for optimism, there is considerable
uncertainty, particularly from the spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon and its
implication for _kharif paddy production, the depreciation of the INR exchange rate_
and pending pass-through in services. Importantly, the global geo-political scenario –
the source of much of the price shocks – continues to remain unsettled.

51. While WPI inflation rose sharply in line with international commodity price

movements, the full pass-through of high inputs costs reflected in WPI to CPI inflation
was tempered by weak pricing power due to the prevailing slack in the economy. As
the slack wanes and pricing power of firms return, there is a risk that the passthrough of past increases in input costs could continue, partly offsetting the
favourable impact of recent fall in global commodity prices. Crude price uncertainty
persists, though the pass-through of elevated crude oil prices to retail inflation has
been moderate and low in the recent period[7] due to the impact of fiscal interventions,
such as reduction in excise duties. Moreover, the recent depreciation of the INR
exchange rate could also temper the beneficial impact of fall in commodity prices.
These could keep core CPI inflation at elevated levels throughout this
year. Moreover, if high cost of living conditions persists, the household inflation
expectations could edge up feeding into wages in a broad-based manner and
pushing up services inflation, which has been muted so far. Thus, monetary policy
needs to be watchful of the evolving input cost pass-through and wage dynamics and
take pre-emptive action to contain any possibility of the emergence of a wage-price
spiral.

52. As mentioned in my minutes of June policy, we need to factor in quicker and

improved monetary transmission with the introduction of the external benchmark
regime in this tightening cycle while arriving at a terminal rate. In response to the
interest rate cycle turning upwards, banks have swiftly increased their external
benchmark linked lending rates (EBLRs) (by 90 bps) and the 1-year median marginal
cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) (by 40 bps) during April-July, 2022. The
weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans has also increased.
Though pass-through is relatively lower in case of retail term deposit rates, banks
have increased their bulk deposit rates significantly. As credit growth is gathering
momentum, banks can be expected to further increase rates on retail deposits to
fund their lending. Moreover, with upward revisions in interest rates on small savings
schemes (SSSs) in accordance with the formula-based mechanism as and when it
happens, pressure will increase on banks to hike interest rates on retail deposits.

53. On balance, the inflation projection for the financial year 2022-23 is retained at

6.7 per cent, with a gradual moderation in headline inflation over H2:2022-23. As per
the baseline projections, inflation is likely to remain above 6 per cent till Q3:2022-23.
This would require monetary policy to persevere with its exit from accommodation to
ensure that frontloaded policy rate hikes dampen inflation expectations, anchor
second round effects and firmly establish our commitment to price stability. The
frontloading of policy actions is expected to strengthen monetary policy credibility and
temper the need for aggressive rate hikes in future. Greater credibility makes
disinflation less costly, helps hold down inflation once it is low (Blinder, 2000[8]). The
dividends of establishing this credibility are not just in the contemporaneous
transmission into the real economy, but also in lowering the necessary terminal policy

rate to achieve the inflation target in the medium run. Deft macroeconomic
management has insulated the Indian economy from several shocks in the recent
past thereby ensuring that recovery remains on a firm footing. Against this
background, I vote for a 50 bps hike in the repo rate so as to reinforce the MPC’s
commitment to price stability around the target. I also vote to remain focused on
withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going
forward, while supporting growth.

54. The global outlook becomes increasingly uncertain and tilted by downside

risks. With inflation remaining elevated worldwide and a pervasive sense of guilt
about the consequences of the pandemic stimulus having been underestimated[9],
central banks have launched into the most aggressive, front loaded and synchronous
monetary policy tightening in decades. Consequently, the probability of a recession
or hard landing has risen to levels that preceded actual recessions in the past.

55. Each country is on its own - match the Fed or face currency depreciation,

imported inflation, wider current account imbalances, capital outflows and reserve
losses. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine appears to be broadening and it is unlikely to
cease soon. Friend shoring has begun[10].

56. The elephant in the room is the unrelenting strength of the US dollar which has

risen by over 8.3 per cent since March 31, 2022 just to set up a numeraire. In India,
there is a turn in the wind and financial markets are sensing it. The most recent
demonstration of this shift is the strong appreciation of the Indian rupee in the relief
rally that followed the fully priced in monetary policy action of the Fed in its July 2022
meeting. During the financial year 2022-23 so far (up to August 3), the Indian rupee
has fallen by 3.9 per cent, 4.4 percentage points less than the MSCI advanced
economy currency index and by 1.3 percentage points less than the MSCI EME
currency index (5.1 per cent) against the US dollar.

57. This wedge reflects the underlying strength of India’s fundamentals. For

instance, inflation in India is lower than the weighted average of its major trading
partners[11]. High frequency indicators suggest that there is some moderation in
momentum in the first quarter of 2022-23 relative to the previous quarter, but the
momentum is still positive in sharp contrast to the rest of the world. India’s real GDP
growth is tracking the RBI’s projections, in spite of the downside bias imparted by the
highly unsettled global environment. Portfolio investment is making its way back to
India – the month of July has recorded net inflows of US $ 458 million, led by
equities[12]. In a span of around one month since June 17, 2022, the BSE Sensex has
risen by 13.6 per cent - these gains coincide with the corporate earnings season, with
many companies delivering robust first quarter results. The yield on the 10-year Gsec benchmark has softened from its peak of 7.62 per cent on June 16, 2022 and is
trading 30-40 basis points below. Surplus liquidity in the banking system has
moderated as credit growth has surged. Interest rates in the money markets have
aligned with the policy repo rate, reflecting the stance of calibrated withdrawal of
accommodation. Other short-term rates have firmed up. Monetary transmission is
stronger to lending rates currently, but deposit rates have commenced the catch-up.

emphasizing transparency, diversification, supply chain security, sustainability and responsible business conduct.
11 In the 40-country REER, partner countries account for 91 per cent of India’s merchandise trade, 88.4 per cent of world GDP
and 86.4 per cent of world trade. In June 2022, India’s inflation differential vis-à-vis these 40 countries was -0.6 per cent.

All in all, the Indian economy is running a positive growth differential vis-à-vis the rest
of the world.

58. Monetary policy, unseen and unsung, has played a key role in this swivel. The

front-loaded and pre-emptive actions so far are already working into inflation
expectations of households. Their perception of current inflation as well as their
expectations three months and one year ahead have declined appreciably in the
latest round of the RBI’s survey. Furthermore, uncertainty around their perceptions
and expectations (measured by their respective coefficients of variation) has
reduced, indicative of anchoring. Consumer confidence about price pressures easing
across product groups over the year ahead is rising. In a world of global food
shortages and price pangs, steady procurement operations and comfortable buffer
stocks are positives for the growth outlook and positives for the food inflation
trajectory. Undoubtedly, a more even spatial distribution of the south west monsoon
could fortify these cushions further.

59. Although inflation seems to have peaked, it is still unconscionably high. Risks

to the trajectory of inflation in the form of currency depreciation, seasonal pressures
and the monsoon’s uneven progress could upend the moderation in momentum
recently recorded.

60. Monetary policy’s response to supply shocks has to be predicated on

managing expectations and fortifying credibility. Empirically, it can be demonstrated
that when a shock is transitory, inflation returns to equilibrium without the need for
any monetary policy action if credibility is high. On the other hand, repeated supply
shocks trigger second round effects through cost pushes, expectations, exchange
rate and demand channels, warranting pre-emptive monetary policy action. Even with
perfect credibility, monetary policy cannot look through the second-round effects of
repeated supply shocks. The inflation target may be breached for a prolonged period.
This could unsettle expectations and eventually get reflected in higher inflation.
Higher credibility can reduce – not substitute for – the monetary policy response to
second round effects of repeated supply shocks. By frontloading monetary policy
actions, credibility is demonstrated by showing commitment to the inflation target.

61. Another dimension of monetary policy credibility is the timing of its response.

With imperfect credibility, a delay in the monetary policy response to repeated
unfavourable supply shocks leads to a further loss of credibility, unhinging of inflation
expectations and eventually, higher inflation outcomes with a higher sacrifice of
growth. Accordingly, it is essential to (a) assess the life of the shock and (b) react to
any signs of second round effects to avoid the generalisation of inflation.

62. At the current juncture, shocks are large and recurring. Combined with the

rebound in spending liberated from the pandemic, they carry the risk of un-anchoring
inflation expectations. Frontloading of monetary policy actions can keep inflation
expectations firmly anchored, re-align inflation with the target and reduce the
medium-term growth sacrifice as it is timed into the recovery underway. Small steps
over a prolonged period could allow inflation to get entrenched and inflation
expectations unhinged.

63. I vote for increasing the policy rate by 50 basis points and for the stance of

withdrawal of accommodation as articulated in the MPC’s resolution.


**Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das**


64. Since the last MPC meeting in June 2022, there has been considerable

slowdown in the global economy, which is now expected to grow only by 3.2 per cent


-----

in 2022 according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). At the same time, global
inflation has hardened further and is projected to remain elevated and persist for
longer at around 6.6 per cent for advanced economies (AEs) and 9.5 per cent for
emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) (IMF, July 2022). This has
triggered a synchronised and aggressive monetary tightening by central banks
across the world, leading to tighter global financial conditions after almost a decade
of accommodative policies.

65. On the domestic front, though inflation has moderated and plateaued since its

recent peak of April 2022, it remains unacceptably and uncomfortably high. The high
level of inflation continues to be broad-based with 13 out of 23 CPI subgroups/groups, comprising close to 60 per cent of the CPI basket, registering more
than 6 per cent inflation in June 2022. Going forward, though there are early
indications that inflation might have peaked in April, significant uncertainties remain
on account of adverse global spillovers coming from simmering geopolitical tensions,
volatile global commodity prices and financial markets. While the let-up in global food
and industrial metals prices should lower imported inflation, the appreciation of the
US dollar could offset some of the gains. Persistently elevated cost of living
conditions can engender wage-price spirals, especially as firms regain pricing power.

66. Domestic growth, on the other hand, remains resilient and gives us the space

to act. High-frequency indicators for Q1:2022-23 and thereafter are evolving on the
expected trajectory. The southwest monsoon has picked up and is progressing well.
This will boost the prospects of agriculture and help revitalisation of rural
consumption. Contact-intensive services have rebounded and have been driving
consumer demand and growth. Government expenditure, both of Centre and states,
is expected to provide support to aggregate demand.

67. Sustained high inflation, unless addressed effectively, could result in

unanchoring of inflation expectations and their second order effects. This
necessitates appropriate monetary policy response to prevent upward drift in inflation
from the target rate. I am of the view that at this juncture a 50 bps increase in the
repo rate is necessary and, therefore, vote accordingly. I also vote for remaining
focused on withdrawal of accommodation.

68. Our monetary and liquidity actions have been aimed at ensuring continued

macroeconomic and financial stability that could set the foundation for a high growth
trajectory over the medium term. We will continue with ‘whatever it takes’ approach,
given the new set of challenges and very high uncertainties that we are confronted
with.

69. Our actions today are tailored towards first bringing the CPI inflation within the

target band and then taking it close to the target of 4.0 per cent over the medium
term, while supporting growth. The sequence of our policy measures is expected to
strengthen monetary policy credibility and anchor inflation expectations. Our actions
would continue to be calibrated, measured and nimble depending upon the unfolding
dynamics of inflation and economic activity.
