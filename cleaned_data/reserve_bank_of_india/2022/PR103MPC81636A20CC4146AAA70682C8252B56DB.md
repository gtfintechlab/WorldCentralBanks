**Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting, April 6 to 8, 2022**

**[Under Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934]**

The thirty fourth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted
under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from April 6 to
8, 2022.

2. The meeting was attended by all the members – Dr. Shashanka Bhide,

Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr.
Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research,
Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management,
Ahmedabad; Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve
Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank
of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of
monetary policy – and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor.

3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the

Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the
Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which
shall include the following, namely:

(a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee;
(b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such
member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and

(c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under subsection (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting.

4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge

consumer confidence, households’ inflation expectations, corporate sector

performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and
infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also
reviewed in detail staff’s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios
around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive
discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is
set out below.

**Resolution**

5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic

situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (April 8, 2022)
decided to:

  - keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF)

unchanged at 4.0 per cent.


-----

The marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate remain unchanged at
4.25 per cent. The standing deposit facility (SDF) rate, which will now be the floor of
the LAF corridor, will be at 3.75 per cent.

 - The MPC also decided to remain accommodative while focusing on withdrawal
of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going
forward, while supporting growth.

These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of
+/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.

The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below


**Assessment**


_Global Economy_

6. Since the MPC’s meeting in February 2022, the global economic and financial

environment has worsened with the escalation of geopolitical conflict and
accompanying sanctions. Commodity prices have shot up substantially across the
board amidst heightened volatility, with adverse fallouts on net commodity importers.
Financial markets have exhibited increased volatility. Crude oil prices jumped to 14year high in early March; despite some correction, they remain volatile at elevated
levels. Supply chain pressures, which were set to ease, are rising again. The broadbased jump in global commodity prices has exacerbated inflationary pressures
across advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) alike
causing a sharp revision in their inflation projections. The global composite
purchasing managers’ index (PMI) eased to 52.7 in March from 53.5 in February with
output growth slowing in both manufacturing and services sectors. World
merchandise trade momentum has weakened.

7. Several central banks, especially systemic ones, continue to be on the path of

normalisation and tightening of monetary policy stances. Resultantly, sovereign bond
yields in major AEs have been hardening. Bullion prices had buoyed to near 2020
highs on safe haven flows, with some recent correction as bond yields rose. Global
equity markets fell, although more recently they have recovered some ground. In
recent weeks, strong capital outflows from the EMEs have moderated thus curbing
the downward pressures on their currencies, even as the US dollar has strengthened.
Overall, the global economy faces major headwinds from several fronts, including
continuing uncertainty about the pandemic’s trajectory.


_Domestic Economy_


8. The second advance estimates (SAE) for 2021-22 released by the National

Statistical Office (NSO) on February 28, 2022 placed India’s real gross domestic
product (GDP) growth at 8.9 per cent, 1.8 per cent above the pre-pandemic (201920) level. On the supply side, real gross value added (GVA) rose by 8.3 per cent in
2021-22, with its major components, including services, exceeding pre-pandemic
levels. GDP growth in Q3:2021-22 decelerated to 5.4 per cent.

9. In Q4:2021-22, available high frequency indicators exhibit signs of recovery

with the fast ebbing of the third wave but the picture is mixed. Urban demand
reflected in domestic air traffic rebounded in March and the pace of contraction in
passenger vehicle sales moderated in February. On the other hand, rural demand
mirrored in two-wheeler and tractor sales contracted in February. Import of capital
goods increased robustly in February, although domestic production continued to


-----

contract. Merchandise exports remained buoyant and clocked double-digit growth for
the thirteenth successive month in March 2022 and reached US$ 417.8 billion in
2021-22 surpassing the target of US$ 400 billion. All categories of imports, however,
have risen even faster, leading to merchandise trade deficit at a record annual level
of US $ 192 billion in 2021-22 or 6.1 per cent of GDP.

10. On the supply side, foodgrains production touched a new record in 2021-22,

with both kharif and rabi output crossing the final estimates for 2020-21 as well as the
targets set for 2021-22. The manufacturing PMI remained in expansion zone in
March, although it moderated somewhat to 54.0 from 54.9 in February. Services
sector indicators – railway freight; e-way bills; GST collections; toll collections; fuel
consumption; and electricity demand – were in expansion in February-March. The
services PMI continued in expansion mode, inching up to 53.6 in March from 51.8 in
the preceding month.

11. Headline CPI inflation edged up to 6.0 per cent in January 2022 and 6.1 per

cent in February, breaching the upper tolerance threshold. Pick-up in food inflation
contributed the most in headline inflation, with inflation of cereals, vegetables, spices
and protein-based food items like eggs, meat and fish being the key drivers. Fuel
inflation moderated on continuing deflation in electricity and steady LPG prices. Core
inflation, _i.e., CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained elevated, though there_
was some moderation from 6.0 per cent in January to 5.8 per cent in February
primarily due to the easing of inflation in transport and communication; pan, tobacco
and intoxicants; recreation and amusement; and health.

12. Overall system liquidity remained in large surplus, with average daily

absorption (through both the fixed and variable rate reverse repos) under the LAF at
₹7.5 lakh crore in March, marginally lower than ₹7.8 lakh crore in January-February
2022. Reserve money (adjusted for the first-round impact of the change in the cash
reserve ratio) expanded by 10.9 per cent (y-o-y) on April 1, 2022. Money supply (M3)
and bank credit by commercial banks rose (y-o-y) by 8.7 per cent and 9.6 per cent,
respectively, as on March 25, 2022. India’s foreign exchange reserves increased by
US$ 30.3 billion to US$ 607.3 billion in 2021-22.


**Outlook**


13. Looking ahead, the inflation trajectory will depend critically upon the evolving

geopolitical situation and its impact on global commodity prices and logistics. On food
prices, domestic prices of cereals have registered increases in sympathy with
international prices, though record foodgrains production and buffer stock levels
should prevent a major flare up in domestic prices. Elevated global price pressures in
key food items such as edible oils, and in animal and poultry feed due to global
supply shortages impart high uncertainty to the food price outlook, warranting
continuous monitoring.

14. In this scenario, pro-active supply management is critical to contain inflation.

International crude oil prices remain volatile and elevated, with considerable
uncertainties surrounding global supplies. With the broad-based surge in prices of
key industrial inputs and global supply chain disruptions, input cost push pressures
appear likely to persist for longer than expected earlier. Their pass-through to retail
prices, though limited till now given the continuing slack in the economy, needs to be
monitored carefully. Manufacturing sector firms polled in the Reserve Bank’s
industrial outlook survey expect higher input and output price pressures going
forward. Taking into account these factors and on the assumption of a normal


-----

monsoon in 2022 and average crude oil price (Indian basket) of US$ 100 per barrel,
inflation is now projected at 5.7 per cent in 2022-23, with Q1 at 6.3 per cent; Q2 at
5.8 per cent; Q3 at 5.4 per cent; and Q4 at 5.1 per cent (Chart 1).

15. Going forward, good prospects of rabi output augur well for rural demand. With

the ebbing of the third wave and expanding vaccination coverage, the pick-up in
contact-intensive services and urban demand is expected to be sustained. The
government’s thrust on capital expenditure coupled with initiatives such as the
production linked incentive (PLI) scheme should bolster private investment activity,
amidst improving capacity utilisation, deleveraged corporate balance sheets, higher
offtake of bank credit and congenial financial conditions. At the same time, the
escalation of the geopolitical situation and the accompanying surge in international
crude oil and other commodity prices, tightening of global financial conditions,
persistence of supply-side disruptions and significantly weaker external demand pose
downside risks to the outlook. The future course of the pandemic and the
uncertainties about the pace of monetary policy normalisation in major advanced
economies also weigh on the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, the
real GDP growth for 2022-23 is now projected at 7.2 per cent, with Q1 at 16.2 per
cent; Q2 at 6.2 per cent; Q3 at 4.1 per cent; and Q4 at 4.0 per cent, with risks broadly
balanced (Chart 2).

16. The MPC is of the view that since the February meeting, the ratcheting up of

geopolitical tensions, generalised hardening of global commodity prices, the
likelihood of prolonged supply chain disruptions, dislocations in trade and capital
flows, divergent monetary policy responses and volatility in global financial markets
are imparting sizeable upside risks to the inflation trajectory and downside risks to
domestic growth.

17. Given the evolving risks and uncertainties, the MPC has decided to keep the

policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain
accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that
inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.

18. All members of the MPC – Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof.

Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri
Shaktikanta Das – unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate at 4.0 per cent.

accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while

20. The minutes of the MPC’s meeting will be published on April 22, 2022.

**Statement by Dr. Shashanka Bhide**


22. At the beginning of February 2022, a number of indicators reflected an

environment of sustained overall growth for the economy. The economic impact of
the rise in Omicron variant of the coronavirus appeared limited. However, there were
also concerns relating to the global economic outlook with the rise in Covid cases,
supply chain disruptions and rising inflation pressures. For India, with a strong growth
in agricultural output in FY 2021-22, going forward, adequate policy support for
investment and consumer spending was expected to strengthen the growth
momentum. The scenario, however, has been reshaped by the Russia-Ukraine war,
the economic fallout of which has affected the overall global growth and price
conditions sharply.

23. The prolonged duration and scale of destruction in the conflict and the wide

ranging economic sanctions by the Western countries on Russia that followed the
beginning of the conflict have had global implications. The supply chain disruptions
aggravated an already stressed global supply system on account of the Covid
pandemic and led prices of a number of commodities in the international markets to
rise sharply and turn volatile. Energy prices and prices of some of the food
commodities in particular have increased sharply compared to February. Crude oil
prices rose by about 30 per cent in the international markets in February-March 2022.
Prices of edible oils and wheat also increased sharply during the period.

24. Even before the Russia-Ukraine war, the monetary policy response to the

rising inflationary pressures in the advanced countries had begun with the increase in
policy rates and measures to tighten the easy liquidity conditions created to manage
the adverse impact of the Covid pandemic. The monetary policy tightening in the
advanced countries is expected to continue in order to bring down the inflation rates,
but it would also have a significant impact on trade and investment flows for the
developing world.

25. Given the three successive large negative shocks to growth and employment

during the Covid pandemic conditions, the MPC has chosen to maintain conditions
favourable to revival of growth on a sustained basis while maintaining inflation rate
within the tolerance limits of the target. The sustained recovery seen in the growth


-----

conditions in Q3:2021-22 was nevertheless incomplete. On the positive side, there
were indications of moderating pattern of inflation rate in 2022-23 on the basis of the
ongoing recovery, assumption of a normal monsoon and moderation on international
commodity price pressures. The sharp changes in the broader global economic
environment that have now unfolded require a reconsideration of the economic
outlook and the policy responses.

26. As the shocks to the price conditions are essentially on the supply side,

emanating from external sector, unless the potential of the reviving domestic demand
conditions to sustain higher prices is reduced, inflation pressures would rise further.
While finding alternative international supply sources for imports and markets for
exports is necessary, domestic inflationary pressures will not be relieved effectively
unless the external supply constraints in the form of restrictions on movement of
goods and finances are removed. Global coordination in easing these constraints
would have major benefits in minimising the adverse effects of supply disruptions.
Limiting the spill over from the rising energy and food prices in the international
markets to the domestic markets would also reduce pressures on the external and
fiscal imbalances.

27. The Second Advance Estimates of GDP released by the National Statistics

Organisation at the end of February 2022 reflect the substantial gap in output growth
needed to restore the high growth momentum after the setbacks in the last two years.
While the YOY basis real GDP growth of 8.9 per cent in FY 2022 represents a
rebound from its contraction by 6.6 per cent in FY 2021, the incomplete nature of the
growth recovery is reflected in the growth rates of its components, especially when
compared to the pre-pandemic scenario. In comparison to FY 2020, real GDP
increased marginally by 1.8 per cent, the private final consumption expenditure
increased by 1.2 per cent, gross fixed capital formation by 2.6 per cent. Exports and
imports increased by 9.9 and 11.9 per cent in FY 2022 over FY 2020. In terms of
value added, the divergence in performance is reflected in the growth rates of 0.4 per
cent in the case of Services and 9.8 per cent in manufacturing. Real GDP in Q3:FY
2022 increased by 5.4 per cent over the same period in the previous year.

28. The available data on a wide range of indicators of output and demand

conditions for January and February point to an on-going recovery. Year on year
growth in GST collection has maintained its strong growth and Non-food Bank Credit
has maintained its higher pace of YOY growth since December 2021. Exports for the
year have exceeded the record target for $400 billion set by the government. RBI’s
survey of Order Books, Inventories and Capacity utilisation in companies conducted
in January-March 2022, reveals increase in capacity utilisation rate in the
manufacturing sector in Q3:2021-22, moving closer to its long-term average. PMI for
manufacturing in March 2022 shows a drop by 0.9 point from February, while PMI for
services increased by 1.8 points, both remaining in expansion zone. RBI’s enterprise
surveys [Industry Outlook (IOS) and Services and Infrastructure Outlook (SIOS)]
conducted during January-March 2022 indicate that the firms are less optimistic
about overall business conditions. This may reflect the conditions relating to the
abating impact of the Omicron variant on the positive and the apprehensions about
the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war on the negative side of the business
environment. The consumption expenditure indicators show a mixed picture. RBI’s
Consumer Confidence Survey conducted in the early part of March 2022 indicates
that as compared to the findings of the same survey in January 2022, a significantly
larger proportion of respondents report higher spending than a year back but this
increase is mostly driven by ‘essential spending’. The proportion of respondents
reporting reduction in ‘non-essential spending’ has, however, declined. The IIP for


-----

consumer durables and non-durables in January 2022 is below the level seen in
2019-20 in the same period.

29. What has changed clearly for the consumers and producers in March 2022 is

the price rise for fuels and some food items in what appears to be a first round impact
with the full pass through of the rise in the international prices yet to be complete.
The input cost pressures are reported in the RBI’s enterprise surveys, particularly in
the services and infrastructure.

30. The uncertainty on the evolution of both growth and inflation in next 3-4

quarters has increased considerably. The prolonged war and its fall out may have
accentuated the adverse impact of monetary policy tightening that has begun in
several countries, especially on the growth front. The Covid related growth
disruptions in China also have adverse impact on global demand.

31. The upturn of CPI inflation rate in February 2022 at 6.1 per cent is the second

successive monthly reading at or above 6 per cent. Among the major sub-categories
of the headline inflation, ‘fuel & light’ and ‘miscellaneous’ registered rates of increase
above 6 per cent in both these months, with the fuel & light at 9.0 per cent and
Miscellaneous at 6.5 per cent, YOY average for January-February 2022. Although
‘Food & beverages category’ registered an increase of 5.8 per cent, Oils & Fats
registered an increase of 17.6 per cent and within Miscellaneous, CPI inflation for
Household Goods & Services, Health, Transport & Communications, Recreation &
Amusement sub-categories exceeded 6 per cent for the two-month period. The
global supply chain disruptions since late-February as a result of Russia-Ukraine war
and their impact on energy and food commodity prices on domestic prices have now
added to more generalised cost push pressures.

32. Consequent to the above changes in growth and inflation scenarios, the

projected GDP and CPI inflation rates for FY 2023 are as follows: GDP growth rates
(YOY%) - Q1: 16.2, Q2: 6.2, Q3: 4.1 and Q4: 4.0 with the financial year projection at
7.2 per cent. CPI inflation rates (YOY%): Q1: 6.3, Q2: 5.8, Q3: 5.4 and Q4: 5.1 with
the financial year average of 5.7 per cent. The revised projections reflect the impact
of both supply disruptions and moderating demand conditions leading to lower GDP
growth and higher inflation rate. RBI’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF)
carried out during March 2022 provide a median GDP growth forecast of 7.5 per cent
and inflation forecast of 5.5 per cent for FY 2023. The SPF assessment has also
shown downward revision in GDP growth and upward revision in inflation forecasts
for FY 2023.

33. The present situation reflects improving conditions with respect to managing

the Covid threat, with the scaled-up vaccinations and an understanding of measures
to control any further outbreak of infections. However, improved demand conditions
in the face of fresh global supply constraints may lead to increased inflation affecting
the growth recovery itself. Response to the evolving price conditions and broadbased policy measures to effectively bring down inflationary pressures without
disrupting the favourable environment for sustaining growth are now needed.


34. Accordingly, I vote to keep the policy repo rate at 4.0 per cent.


35. I also vote to remain accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of

accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while
supporting growth.

**Statement by Dr. Ashima Goyal**


36. The Ukraine war has lasted more than a month, uncertainties continue, oil

prices are volatile, supply disruptions will raise inflation but also reduce demand; the
continued high impact of Covid-19 in major countries will have similar effects.

37. The typical household response to inflationary supply shocks is to decrease

consumption. Moreover, falling wage share will also decrease their demand.

38. Although household inflation expectations remain high, they have risen only

marginally in the last two months, despite the rise in international oil prices—this
points to the salience of domestic oil prices, of government action that affects these
prices and of RBI guidance for households. Expectations fell when the government
cut fuel excise in November 2021. The absence of any rise in dispersion points to
some anchoring. One-year-ahead business inflation expectations, however, recently
crossed 6%.

39. Capacity utilisation, especially in some sectors and for large firms has reached

pre-Covid-19 levels; unemployment shows signs of falling. The non-oil non-gold
current account is also in deficit, although the rising share of financial savings should
reduce the need for foreign savings. Credit growth is higher and the PMI continues to
be in the expansionary zone. But Q3 shows some softening—the recovery is still not
strong. Firms facing low demand have limited their pass through yet profit margins
have remained largely constant due to falling wage share and interest costs—firms
still have scope to absorb rise in costs. Second round effects have yet to set in. Costpush is still coming from primary but multiple supply shocks.

40. Covid-19 is waning in India. Current trends suggest there is more physical as

well as economic immunity. Signals are mixed, yet clearly crisis level of stimulus is no
longer required.

41. As pressures on oil prices persist, pump prices began rising steeply in end

March. RBI consumer headline inflation estimate for the year is raised to 5.7 per cent,
which implies the real rate has fallen further and is now too negative.

42. With some recovery and high commodity prices it will not be necessary to cut

repo rates further. Future policy will either pause or raise rates. Rebalancing of
liquidity started in 2021, and has now reached a level, with new facilities to absorb
liquidity, that is compatible with raising policy rates. Short rates are set to rise to
make the repo rate the operational policy rate again.

43. Research as well as Indian experience in the 2000s shows an early and

gradual rise works better. Rebalancing of liquidity began early. It is time now to
withdraw crisis time accommodation in terms of moving towards the equilibrium or
neutral real rates consistent with non-inflationary growth. As long as rates remain
below this, it is still not a tightening regime. When rates are below neutral because of
excess crisis related accommodation, the initial rise only takes them towards neutral.

44. Exit should be balanced avoiding the over-stimulus after the global financial

crisis and the consequent over-tightening in the 2010s. A rate rise that responds to
excess demand, as well as to persistent inflation, so that the real rate adjusts
smoothly and does not deviate too far from equilibrium will best be able to anchor
inflation expectations yet sustain the growth recovery while minimising market
volatility and output sacrifice.

45. Supply-side action has a major role in anchoring inflation expectations in order

to sustain consumer confidence and the recovery. In April 2019 domestic petrol
prices exceeded international prices by ₹40 per litre. The gap widened in the Covid

-----

19 years as international prices fell but domestic taxes were not reduced. These were
an essential revenue-source then as other sources had collapsed with activity. In
February 2022 the gap was back to ₹40 as international prices had risen. The
difference now is that direct and indirect taxes are buoyant, 30 to 40% higher than
their levels in 2019. There is room to cut fuel taxes to mitigate the pass through of
international prices to consumers. Excise duty could go back to 2019 levels that were
high enough to limit oil consumption, even as other efforts to substitute towards
renewable sources continue.

46. The extent of nominal rate and borrowing cost rise required will depend on

supply-side action. Even under rising rates, fiscal stress will reduce over time as long
as real rates are kept smoothly below growth rates helping lower deficit and debt
ratios over time. Outflows under US Fed tightening give more room for supporting
government borrowing consistent with the required growth in reserve money. Such
support is the most effective in moderating rise in long-term nominal rates in Indian
conditions[1]. There is room for spreads to fall since the historical spread between the
repo and the 10-year G-sec was only 60 basis points.

47. Excess inflows are accumulated as reserves. Therefore, excess outflows or a

temporary balance of payments deficit requires some of these reserves to be used to
moderate excess rupee volatility. Limiting rupee depreciation will also reduce inflation
and the oil bill. When inflation expectations are well-anchored terms of trade shocks
can be looked through but it is better to avoid adding such shocks at a time of other
multiple supply shocks. The real exchange rate is at competitive levels since exports
are doing well. Moreover, Indian structural reform has reduced the cost of doing
business and this time Indian inflation is less than international.

48. Both fiscal and monetary policy must use the space available to smooth

international shocks, while taking unavoidable hits. In the last decade emerging
markets as a group grew more slowly because such shocks had persistent effects.
Costs of adjusting to the global financial crisis were passed on to them. Countries
that have reformed suitably and built buffers may be able to protect themselves better
this time.

49. In view of these considerations I vote to keep the repo rate unchanged and to

remain accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure
that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. Exit of
accommodation is proceeding but its pace awaits future developments.


**Statement by Prof. Jayanth R. Varma**


50. The geopolitical situation has worsened considerably since the February

meeting, and consequently inflation projections have risen sharply. However, I would
like to point out that the hostilities in Europe have imparted an adverse shock not only
to inflation, but also to growth. While the inflation shock is more clearly and
immediately visible, the growth shock cannot be ignored. There is at least anecdotal
evidence that businesses are becoming reluctant to pass on input cost increases to
the customers because of concerns about demand compression.

51. I refrain from discussing whether, on balance, the changed situation warrants

immediate action on the policy rate for the simple reason that the forward guidance
given in the last meeting effectively precludes such action. It is important to maintain

the credibility of monetary policy communications, and deviation from prior forward
guidance should be made only under truly exceptional circumstances. In this
backdrop, maintaining the policy rate at the current level is the only sensible choice,
and I therefore vote to keep the policy repo rate at 4.0 per cent.

52. I have been arguing for the normalization of the policy corridor for several

months now, and I welcome this action which forms part of the MPC statement.

53. Coming to the “stance”, I think it is wholly appropriate that this word has been

dropped from the resolution. In the extremely uncertain situation that prevails today, it
is very important for the MPC not to issue any forward guidance that would tie its
hands. It is necessary to communicate clearly that in future meetings, the MPC would
consider itself completely free to take any action on the policy rates that may be
warranted by the data that becomes available in the coming weeks. With inflation
projected to breach the upper tolerance limit for several months, it is imperative for
the MPC to communicate its resolve to ensure that inflation remains within the target
going forward. It is also necessary to prepare the markets for the withdrawal of the
post pandemic monetary accommodation. I therefore vote to remain accommodative
while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains
within the target going forward, while supporting growth.


**Statement by Dr. Mridul K. Saggar**


54. The world is changing in many important ways. The anticipated global and

domestic macroeconomic trajectories that were shaping will get reset in slope and
intercept. In my statement in February, I had stated that “the current geopolitical
stress in Europe is a significant risk and if it translates into oil and gas prices spiking,
we will need to adjust macro-economic policies suitably”. The contingent risk has
materialised calling for policy shifts. We are witnessing an entrenched conflict. While
it remains unclear how long it may last, it looks that even on its de-escalation, the
supply chain disruption and elevated prices of energy, agro-products and minerals
and metals may last for at least a year. With some ratchet, it will leave permanent
effects on price levels, making it necessary for the monetary policy to deal with its
second-round effects so that inflation is not elevated as a multi-year phenomenon.
The War will also have significant detrimental effects on growth. In my statement in
December last, I had cautioned on the building global stagflationary impulses. The
Ukraine shock will further slow the global recovery, risks of a global recession are still
small and predicated on war spreading over to the rest of the continent or beyond,
thus remaining a tail risk event.

55. To add to the shock, the Fed kept tryst with the lift off in mid-March and

indicated a quantitative tightening (balance sheet reduction) starting May. The
baseline looks like the Fed will consciously entail a significant growth sacrifice and go
ahead with aggressive rate hikes in the rest of the year in a bid to tame high inflation.
However, global inflation is here to stay for the rest of the year at least. Against their
2% inflation targets, CPI inflation in the U.S., euro area and UK inflation are set to
cross 8% in near term, which is four times their targets. Notwithstanding the
difficulties in measuring potential output amid extreme shocks, wide array of
measures suggests that the output gaps in the U.S. and the U.K. economies have not
just closed but turned positive, though due to shallow cyclical recovery and the war
retrenchment the same cannot be said of the euro area. So, the advanced
economies face a big inflation gap and a closed output gap, thus justifying aggressive
tightening based on the central bank reaction functions. Even in many emerging
markets, inflation is ruling at multi-year highs. In contrast, inflation in India is not yet in


-----

inertial motion. Nevertheless, considering that we face elevated inflation that is
projected, on an average, to be 1.7 percentage point above target and a likely closed
output gap in my assessment later this year, it is important to take measured policy
actions.

56. Let me now cover the growth and inflation assessment and the trade offs

involved. The level of GDP in 2021-22 crossed the pre-pandemic 2019-20 level not
just in aggregate but in all components of aggregate demand. In terms of quarterly
GDP, it has stayed above corresponding pre-pandemic quarter of 2019 since Q2 of
2021-22 and in Q3 it had exceeded pre-pandemic levels for all components. On the
supply-side, the GVA data shows that in 2021-22 the output of all sectors, except the
‘trade, transport, communication and broadcasting services’ had surpassed the 201920 level. In terms of quarterly data, output had exceeded pre-pandemic level in
aggregate since Q2 of 2021-22 and in Q4 is likely to do so for all sectors, including
‘trade, transport, communication and broadcasting services’. High frequency
indicators have shown distinct month-on-month improvements since December 2021.
By February 2022, almost all indicators have moved above pre-pandemic levels,
except a few, mainly automobile related, where activity has relapsed due to semiconductor shortages. So, it is safe to assume that output has recovered now, though
the improvements from hereon may remain moderate given the expected growth
deceleration on account of war.

57. On inflation, it has breached the upper tolerance level and is expected to

remain so in Q1 of 2022-23. There are upside risks that cannot be ignored. Global
crude oil prices have been highly volatile of late and can move in either direction from
here. The uncertainty on this account has large ramifications for projection of any
macroeconomic variable. If the war ends and global recovery sustains, oil prices can
move up again later this year once the effects of release of strategic reserves wane
in 6 months. Gas prices can rise further if Russia cuts supplies to Europe or Europe
implements plans to reduce dependence on Russian gas. However, energy prices
can fall from here if war ends soon and no sanctions are levied by EU in this sector.
The current upsurge in energy prices is masking the potential impact of the likes of
EV hummers that portend a trend shift downwards in oil prices over the mediumterm. Also, if oil prices persist at current high levels, it can trigger ramping up of tight
oil. The expected easing of food prices even if monsoon is normal, runs the risk from
elevated input costs, especially of fertilisers and diesel that can result in jacking up of
floor that is set by minimum support prices (MSPs). Global food prices have already
gone up substantially and supply shortages may persist for more than a year as
sowing in war torn Ukraine will be impacted. More importantly, in my assessment,
core inflation is expected to stay above 6% through 2022-23 as the price shock from
the war in Ukraine will be transmitted through mineral and metals as soaring coal
prices and Palladium group and other metal shortages seep through to retail levels.
They will also bring down growth and the resultant demand destruction may put some
lid on surging commodity prices.

58. The global shock can have large spillovers to India through multiple channels.

First, accentuated supply chain disruptions will result in longer episode of cost-push
inflation. Second, this will erode purchasing power and slow down the economy.
Third, the CAD will rise, especially if negative real rates persist and impact domestic
savings. The median rate on fresh rupee term deposits has a negative carry of about
2% in real terms. Fourth, while fiscal policies have scope to limit the pass-through of
imported inflation, it will need to be balanced off in a manner that twin deficits remain
sustainable. Fifth, the interest rates and exchange rates can have profound effects on
growth and inflation through contesting channels, in which the capital flow channel


-----

could be the most important. Even as these risks amplify, India has strong buffers to
withstand these shocks. There aren’t too many fissures and once markets quickly
price the shifts, the dynamics could turn favourable again.

59. So, what are the policy options in this backdrop? As the slowdown and

inflationary impulses have hit us with monetary policy already being very
accommodative, there is not enough room to pump prime growth. If output levels fall
again, the negative output gap may help soften high inflation as the pass-through to
retail levels may remain contained. However, lack of contestability and collusive
behaviours have been seen in the past and the price rises can follow to protect
margins. It is important to keep a sense of scarring and fall in potential output as
large scarring will also mean an early closing of output gap causing inflationary
pressures to accentuate. Recovering to pre-pandemic trend should not guide
monetary policy at this stage and policy should focus on non-inflationary sustainable
growth in the economy. A close watch on inflation expectations is necessary. If
expectations are rising, especially if they turn unhinged and start rising faster than
even actual inflation, monetary policy would have to reign in expectations to prevent
a self-sustained inflationary spiral. Headline inflation has stayed elevated for long and
has tested our tolerance. Even though the current high inflation is not primarily a
monetary phenomenon it is critical to ensure that economic agents place the use of
flexibility in the context of extra-ordinary circumstances that were prevailing and do
not perceive an implicit upward drift in inflation target. Such a slip can affect inflation
expectations. The best way to support growth on a durable basis is to have a strong
commitment to low and stable inflation. I wish to sign off with this note.

60. Considering the emergence of a different growth-inflation trade-off, it is best to

start withdrawing monetary accommodation through liquidity and rate actions that can
begin with raising the floor and normalising the corridor. The policy will still stay
accommodative as rates, even after lifting nominal rates, will stay below real neutral
rate for foreseeable future. Monetary policy is not a rocket science, but the timing of
the launch of the rocket is nevertheless important as monetary policy transmits to its
final goals with long and variable lags. With a flatter Phillips curve, tackling inflation
becomes that much harder as it may call for larger output sacrifice. So, a deft policymix is needed. We have varied tools and with right cross fertilisation of these tools it
should be possible to bring back inflation closer to the target later without much
growth sacrifice and without a very high terminal rate. It is important to note that the
labour markets in India are yet to heat up and this is reflected in muted wage and
house price pressures, below trend labour force participation rate and flattish
unemployment levels.

61. Considering the above, I vote for leaving policy rate unchanged and for staying

accommodative, while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation as indicated in the
resolution.


**Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra**


62. In a world in which deglobalisation seems imminent, one thing has become

globalised and that is the alarm about inflation. With 60 per cent of developed
countries facing inflation above 5 per cent – unheard of since the 1980s – and more
than half of developing countries experiencing inflation above 7 per cent, the climb in
prices is testing societal tolerance levels.

63. The view that increasingly occupies centre-stage is that irrespective of

whether supply bottlenecks are the driver or pent-up demand, it will become more
difficult to tame inflation the longer the fight is delayed. To quote an influential view, it


-----

will make central banks unpopular, but they have been there before. The rationale
underlying this point of view is that whether the jump in oil and other commodity
prices will be short-lived or not is not known; but if these prices ignite and levitate the
prices of other goods and services sympathetically, the fear will gain ground amongst
the public that inflation is going to stay high for a while, and this can end up becoming
a self-fulfilling prophecy. Hence financial markets race ahead of central banks in
foretelling what they should do, by how much and by when.

64. Supply disruptions, soaring commodity prices and ensuing financial market

turbulence no more tell about fears of the shape of future inflation – the worst fears
are already materialising. Instead they darken the outlook for growth. Macroeconomic
conditions are the toughest for developing countries, with acute shortages of even
essentials showing up alongside spiralling prices. On the one hand, the cost of
foreign currency debt for EMEs is rising and on the other, they are forced to drain
currency reserves in order to shore up exchange rates. Higher commodity prices
could also complicate the situation for governments that have been striving to
mitigate the impact of the pandemic by offering food and energy subsidies to
households.

65. The key question is: will it be a goldilocks moment? Will central banks deliver

the perfect disinflation, the so-called soft landing? Or will they overshoot the runway
and precipitate an unwanted recession on a world weary with pandemic woes, war
and worn and torn supply chains? In fact, the view gaining ground is that inflation is
at heights that have shattered glass ceilings and the only way to excoriate it is to
force a recession - the so called hard landing. The dilemma is even sharper for
central banks with dual mandates – will their remits allow them to kill the economy for
price stability?

66. Geopolitical risks appear overwhelming at this juncture and over the

foreseeable near-term. The RBI has been preparing for tail risks in either direction.
First, out of the pandemic-related liquidity overhang, an amount of ₹2.94 lakh crore
has been withdrawn from the system with the lapse of measures/repayments on due
dates. Second, open market sales and forex operations during the year have
withdrawn liquidity of the order of ₹2.3 lakh crore. Third, market-based auctions with
a menu of maturities have been conducted with a view to get market participants
attuned to the alignment of money market rates with normal liquidity management
procedures.

67. The RBI is in the process of completing the migration to a fully fledged liquidity

management framework that is perfectly symmetrical – standing facilities at the upper
and lower bounds with the policy rate at the centre; access on all days of the week,
throughout the year; and restoration of the corridor to its pre-pandemic width and
operation. During the course of 2022-23 and up to April 2023, all pandemic-related
extraordinary measures will cease.

68. These actions empower the RBI at a moment of reckoning. If, as the

projections show, inflation persists in high reaches, the drainage of liquidity already
achieved and planned for the year ahead will reduce risks of excess liquidity fanning
inflationary pressures and posing threats to financial stability. It will also facilitate the
transmission of policy impulses across market segments and the interest rate
structure. If, on the other hand, risk sentiment improves globally and India receives
large volumes of capital flows, the standing deposit facility expands the capability of
the RBI to undertake full and seamless sterilisation without running out of
instruments. This will help to keep monetary expansion consistent with the outlook on
inflation and growth.


-----

69. Accordingly, I vote for status quo on the policy rate. I also vote for the stance

as formulated in the MPC’s resolution.


**Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das**


70. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets at a time when tectonic shifts in

geopolitical environment are materially affecting the global and domestic outlook on
both inflation and growth. Just as the global economy seemed to be on the cusp of
returning to normalcy from the pandemic, the war in Europe and subsequent
sanctions have further clouded the outlook. The war-induced price spikes in food, oil,
gas, fertiliser and several key industrial inputs, together with continued supply chain
bottlenecks, are posing major upside risks to inflation which has already scaled multidecadal highs in several countries. At the same time, the war poses major downside
risks to global growth in the wake of trade restrictions, sanctions, elevated
uncertainties and the flare up in the prices of food and energy. Global financial
markets are on tenterhooks reacting to the toxic mix of supply and demand shocks
and the varying pace of monetary policy normalisation in advanced countries. Most
emerging market economies are caught in the vortex of risk-off sentiments marked by
capital outflows and rising bond yields. To say that the world is going through
extremely volatile times would be an understatement.

71. These developments are likely to have significant long-term implications for

the global economy caused by supply chain reconfigurations, trade and technology
fragmentation, and defence and energy security considerations. Emerging market
economies find themselves in a much more difficult situation as their economic
recovery from the pandemic remains incomplete even as inflation continues its
ascent. Central banks in these economies face the difficult trade-off between
containing inflation and nurturing growth. The situation is particularly challenging for
net oil importing countries like India.

72. The domestic inflation outlook presented in the February 2022 MPC meeting

has undergone a significant upward shift since the start of the war on February 24,
2022, with the escalation of conflict and subsequent turmoil in global commodity
markets. The increase in crude oil price and its direct and indirect effects on CPI
contributed to around 60 per cent of the upward revision in projections with the other
major contributor being the spillovers coming from the global food price shocks on
wheat, edible oil and feed cost pressures impacting on poultry, milk and dairy product
prices. In the current scenario, continuation and further deepening of supply side
measures would alleviate food price pressures and also mitigate cost-push pressures
across manufacturing and services.

73. Emerging from the Omicron wave, India’s economic recovery remains on

track, although there are weak spots – private consumption and investment are still
subdued and contact-based services, although catching up, are yet to recover fully.
There is also a risk that the ongoing recovery, which is already strained by the
current crisis, may get undermined if there is rapid tightening of financial conditions.
In these circumstances, policy making has to be nuanced and nimble.

74. Consistent with the strategy of focusing on withdrawal of accommodation, the

Reserve Bank intends to gradually withdraw surplus liquidity over a multi-year period,
keeping in mind the evolving macroeconomic and financial developments and the
stance of monetary policy, while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet the productive
requirements of the economy. Signalling this intent, the Liquidity Adjustment Facility
(LAF) corridor is being normalised to a width of 50 bps that was prevailing before the


-----

pandemic. The liquidity rebalancing operations of the RBI have prepared the market
for this normalisation of the LAF corridor.

75. The current geopolitical situation has led to an upward revision of our inflation

projections for 2022-23. The estimates now point to inflation remaining above the
upper tolerance band in the near-term even as growth projections have undergone
downward revisions. These are indicative of the sheer magnitude of the adverse
exogenous supply and price shocks. While the risks to domestic growth call for
continued accommodative monetary policy, inflationary pressures necessitate
monetary policy action. The circumstances warrant prioritising inflation and anchoring
of inflation expectations in the sequence of objectives to safeguard macroeconomic
and financial stability, while being mindful of the ongoing growth recovery. There is
also a need to avoid undue disruptions in the financial markets. Given this delicate
balance between inflation and growth, I vote for retaining the repo rate at 4.0 per cent
and maintaining the accommodative stance while focusing on withdrawal of
accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while
supporting growth. The situation is dynamic and fast changing, and we should
constantly re-assess the situation and tailor our actions accordingly.
