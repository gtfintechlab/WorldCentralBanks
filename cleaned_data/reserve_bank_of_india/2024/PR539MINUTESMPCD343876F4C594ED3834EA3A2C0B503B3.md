**Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting, June 5 to 7, 2024**

**[Under Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934]**

The forty ninth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under
Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during June 5 to 7,
2024.

2. The meeting was attended by all the members – Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary
Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima
Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai;
Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr.
Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the
Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr.
Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy – and was
chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor.

3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve
Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy
Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the
following, namely:

(a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee;
(b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such

member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and

(c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub
section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting.

4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge

consumer confidence, households’ inflation expectations, corporate sector

performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and
infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also
reviewed in detail the staff’s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios
around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive
discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is
set out below.

**Resolution**

5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic

situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (June 7, 2024)
decided to:

  - Keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF)

unchanged at 6 50 per cent


-----

Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25
per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per
cent.

  - The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to

ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth.

These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2
per cent, while supporting growth.


**Assessment and Outlook**


6. Global economic activity is rebalancing and is expected to grow at a stable

pace in 2024. Inflation has been moderating unevenly, with services inflation staying
elevated and slowing progress towards targets. Uncertainty on the pace and timing of
policy pivots by central banks is keeping financial markets volatile. Equity markets
have touched new highs in both advanced and emerging market economies. Nonenergy commodity prices have firmed up, while the US dollar and bond yields are
exhibiting two-way movement with spillovers to emerging market currencies. Gold
prices have surged to record highs on safe haven demand.

7. According to the provisional estimates released by the National Statistical

Office (NSO) on May 31, 2024, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in Q4:202324 stood at 7.8 per cent as against 8.6 per cent in Q3. Real GDP growth for 2023-24
was placed at 8.2 per cent. On the supply side, real gross value added (GVA) rose by
6.3 per cent in Q4:2023-24. Real GVA recorded a growth of 7.2 per cent in 2023-24.

8. Going forward, high frequency indicators of domestic activity are showing

resilience in 2024-25. The south-west monsoon is expected to be above normal, which
augurs well for agriculture and rural demand. Coupled with sustained momentum in
manufacturing and services activity, this should enable a revival in private
consumption. Investment activity is likely to remain on track, with high capacity
utilisation, healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates, government’s continued
thrust on infrastructure spending, and optimism in business sentiments. Improving
world trade prospects could support external demand. Headwinds from geopolitical
tensions, volatility in international commodity prices, and geoeconomic fragmentation,
however, pose risks to the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, real
GDP growth for 2024-25 is projected at 7.2 per cent with Q1 at 7.3 per cent; Q2 at 7.2
per cent; Q3 at 7.3 per cent; and Q4 at 7.2 per cent (Chart 1). The risks are evenly
balanced.

9. Headline inflation has seen sequential moderation since February 2024, _albeit_

in a narrow range from 5.1 per cent in February to 4.8 per cent in April 2024. Food
inflation, however, remains elevated due to persistence of inflation pressures in
vegetables, pulses, cereals, and spices. Deflation in fuel prices deepened during
March-April, reflecting the cut in liquified petroleum gas (LPG) prices. Core (CPI
excluding food and fuel) inflation eased further to 3.2 per cent in April, the lowest in the
current CPI series, with core services inflation also falling to historic lows.

10. Looking ahead, overlapping shocks engendered by rising incidence of adverse

climate events impart considerable uncertainty to the food inflation trajectory. Market
arrivals of key _rabi crops, particularly pulses and vegetables, need to be closely_
monitored in view of the recent sharp upturn in prices. Normal monsoon, however,

ld l d f i f f d i fl i h f h


-----

Pressure from input costs have started to edge up and early results from enterprises
surveyed by the Reserve Bank expect selling prices to remain firm. Volatility in crude
oil prices and financial markets along with firming up of non-energy commodity prices
pose upside risks to inflation. Taking into account these factors, CPI inflation for 202425 is projected at 4.5 per cent with Q1 at 4.9 per cent; Q2 at 3.8 per cent; Q3 at 4.6
per cent; and Q4 at 4.5 per cent (Chart 2). The risks are evenly balanced.

11. The MPC noted that the domestic growth-inflation balance has moved

favourably since its last meeting in April 2024. Economic activity remains resilient
supported by domestic demand. Investment demand is gaining more ground and
private consumption is exhibiting signs of revival. Although headline inflation is
gradually easing, driven by softening in its core component, the path of disinflation is
interrupted by volatile and elevated food inflation due to adverse weather events.
Inflation is expected to temporarily fall below the target during Q2:2024-25 due to
favourable base effect, before reversing subsequently. For the final descent of inflation
to the target and its anchoring, monetary policy has to be watchful of spillovers from
food price pressures to core inflation and inflation expectations. The MPC will remain
resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation to the 4 per cent target on a durable
basis. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50
per cent in this meeting. The MPC reiterates the need to continue with the
disinflationary stance, until a durable alignment of the headline CPI inflation with the
target is achieved. Enduring price stability sets strong foundations for a sustained
period of high growth. Hence, the MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal
of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while
supporting growth.

12. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri

Shaktikanta Das voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. Dr.
Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 25
basis points.

13. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri

Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure
that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. Dr. Ashima
Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted for a change in stance to neutral.


-----

15. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during August 6 to 8, 2024.

**Statement by Dr. Shashanka Bhide**


16. The macroeconomic environment was marked by a high growth rate of the

economy and moderating inflation rate during 2023-24. The Provisional Estimates
(PE) released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on May 31, 2024, reinforce the
previous growth assessment further. Real GDP growth for 2023-24 is now estimated
at 8.2 per cent, following the growth rates of 7 per cent in 2022-23 and 9.7 per cent in
2021-22. While there have been significant fluctuations and differences between the
macro estimates available at the time of April MPC meeting and the recent PE for
sectoral growth rates and in the sources of aggregate demand on account of both
external and domestic factors, the overall growth rate has remained strong, above the
7.6 per cent in the SAE. In the meantime, the headline inflation rate, year-on-year, is
at 5.4 per cent for 2023-24 and 5 per cent in Q4: 2023-24.

17. As per the PE for 2023-24, YOY growth of real gross fixed capital formation,

reflecting investment demand, accelerated to 9 per cent from 6.6 per cent in 2022-23.
Private consumption expenditure growth, however, fell from 6.8 per cent in 2022-23 to
4.0 per cent in 2023-24. Export of goods and services was also marked by
deceleration in 2023-24 due to the weak global demand conditions. Going forward,
improvement in the growth of consumption demand, exports and sustained growth of
investment would be key to maintaining the strong overall growth of the last three
years.

18. In terms of real GVA, YOY growth of agriculture and allied activities dropped

from 4.7 per cent in 2022-23 to 1.4 per cent in 2023-24. Industry GVA rose from (-)0.6
per cent in 2022-23 to 9.3 per cent in 2023-24, led by manufacturing. Although
construction GVA increased by almost 10 per cent in 2023-24, growth of overall
services sector GVA slowed to 7.9 per cent in 2023-24 from 9.9 per cent in the
previous year. In all the three major production sectors, YOY growth rates are the
same or higher in the PE as compared to the SAE for 2023-24.

19. Several indicators reflect continuation of growth momentum into 2024-25. At the

global level, the world trade volume is expected to recover in 2024 with growth also
expected to hold. In its April 2024 assessment, the IMF projected YOY growth in the
world output at 3.2 per cent in 2024, the same as in 2023 and the growth of volume of
world trade in goods and services at 3 per cent in 2024 as compared to 0.3 per cent in
2023. Trends in global PMIs suggest stronger growth prospects in the case of services
as compared to manufacturing, with both in expansion zone from February to April
2024.


-----

20. In the domestic economy, most of the actual data are available only for April

and May for the current financial year. However, surveys of households and
enterprises on their expectations and professional forecasts provide assessments for
next few quarters or the full financial year 2024-25.

21. Indicators such as PMI for manufacturing and services have remained in the

expansion zone during April-May. Non-food bank credit and GST collections expanded
at double digit rates on a YOY basis, during April-May 2024.

22. RBI’s consumer confidence survey of urban households indicates cautious

optimism. The survey conducted in May 2024, reflects expectation of an increase in
both essential and non-essential expenditure one-year ahead. Changes in future
sentiments on household income is modest, however, expectations regarding the
general economic conditions and employment moderated on one-year ahead basis.

23. Pattern of manufacturing output points to improvement in the production of

consumption goods in 2023-24. Consumer goods IIP rose by 3.8% in 2023-24 as
compared to 0.7% in 2022-23. Growth in consumer goods IIP improved on a YOY
basis in H2: 2023-24 to 4.0 per cent as compared to the growth in H1 at 3.7 per cent.
Moreover, consumer non-durables led growth in H1 and consumer durables in H2.
Uptick in consumer expenditure reflected by the IIP growth in 2023-24 may be
sustained into 2024-25 if the underlying drivers of growth continue.

24. Investment demand indicators in the first two months of Q1, reflect a mixed

picture. Steel consumption has increased at a strong growth of 9.6 per cent in April,
while cement production remained muted at 0.6 per cent during the month. Imports of
capital goods improved in April, YOY basis. The capital expenditure in the public
sector is expected to provide support for investment demand as in the previous year.

25. The assessment of the growth prospects for 2024-25 are conditioned by the

momentum that has been set by the performance in 2023-24 and several global and
domestic factors. While positive aspects of the emerging macroeconomic conditions
affecting economic growth in 2024-25 are significant, there are also the risks from
adverse scenarios. The spillover effects of continuing international geopolitical
conflicts, trade limiting policies across the world, extreme weather events affecting
agricultural output pose these adverse conditions.

26. The Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the RBI in May 2024,

provides a median forecast of real GDP growth of 6.8 per cent in 2024-25, revised
upwards from 6.7 per cent in the previous round of the survey in March. Private Final
Consumption Expenditure and Gross Fixed Capital Formation are the growth drivers in
these projections.

27. In the April meeting of the MPC, the YOY real GDP growth for 2024-25 was

projected at 7 per cent. Taking into account a normal monsoon and sustained
momentum of investment, the GDP growth for 2024-25 has now been projected at 7.2
per cent. The quarterly growth rates for GDP are: 7.3 per cent in Q1, 7.2 per cent in
Q2, 7.3 per cent in Q3 and 7.2 per cent in Q4.

28. The pace of decline in YOY headline CPI inflation rate in the recent period has

been steady. It declined from 5.4 per cent in Q3: 2023-24 to 5 per cent in Q4. The rate
declined from 5.1 per cent in January 2024 to 4.8 per cent in April. While the CPI
inflation for fuel & light and the non-food and non-fuel categories remained well below
4 t f d i fl ti b 7 5 t i Q4 2023 24 d 7 9 t i


-----

April in the current year. A favourable monsoon assisting the recovery of agricultural
growth and suitable supply management measures would be a key to moderating food
inflation as the year progresses.

29. There are risks to anticipated decline in CPI inflation rate given the

uncertainties of temporal and spatial distribution of the rainfall, weather conditions
during the crop season and the spillover effects of international geopolitical conflicts.

30. Commodity price trends in the international markets present a mixed pattern. In

the case of agricultural prices, in April and May, wheat prices have advanced, rice
prices have remained firm and sugar and palm oil prices have shown decline. In the
case of other commodities, energy prices have been volatile and metals have
increased. Improving world manufacturing output, divergent weather conditions and
uncertainties over the impact of the on-going geopolitical conflicts will continue to
influence the world commodity prices in the short term.

31. The RBI’s inflation expectations survey of urban households conducted in the

first fortnight of May 2024 reflects the current deceleration in the consumer prices but
also points to moderate increase in expected inflation rate by 20 and 10 basis points
over a short-term horizon of three months and one year, respectively. The early results
from the ongoing enterprise surveys by the RBI for April-June point to rising input price
pressures in 2023-24, particularly in services and infrastructure. Input price pressures
are also followed by expectation of rise in selling prices by majority of the respondents
in manufacturing, services and infrastructure sectors.

32. The Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the RBI, referred earlier,

provides an assessment of headline inflation in 2024-25. The median YOY CPI
inflation rate in 2024-25 estimated from the survey is 4.5 per cent, the same level as
estimated in the previous round of the survey in March. The expected ‘inflation rate’ for
CPI excluding food, fuel and pan, tobacco and intoxicants is below 4 per cent.

33. Taking into account these factors, the headline inflation rate has now been

projected at 4.5 per cent in 2024-25, the same level as in the April MPC meeting. The
quarterly projections are 4.9 per cent in Q1, declining to 3.8 per cent in Q2, rising to
4.6 per cent in Q3 and 4.5 per cent in Q4. The sharp decline in Q2: 2024-25
corresponds to the period when inflation rate was a high 6.4 per cent in 2023-24.

34. The headline inflation rate gradually moving to below 5 per cent mark in March

and April, and projected at less than 4 per cent mark in Q2, marks an important
macroeconomic condition that can support sustained growth. Clearly, the moderate
inflation rate will have to be durable to be an effective condition for sustained growth.
In this context, the policy would have to continue its focus on maintaining the inflation
rate aligned to the target over the medium term. The rise in projected inflation rate
above the 4.5 per cent mark in H2 of the financial year reflects the underlying price
pressures, which if not addressed would not meet the policy goal. As a major part of
these price pressures relate to food inflation, a watchful approach is appropriate to
ensure that there are no spillovers of high food inflation to the prices of the other items
in the consumption basket. As the aggregate output projections for 2024-25 reflect
strong GDP growth, keeping the monetary policy focus on achieving the inflation target
on a durable basis is appropriate at this juncture.


-----

35. With these considerations, I vote
i. to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent, and
ii. to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation

progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth.


**Statement by Dr. Ashima Goyal**


36. Indian growth has outperformed expectations once again, suggesting it has

strong roots. Real policy rates near neutral, along with supply-side action, have been
important in sustaining growth while bringing inflation towards target. As argued in
earlier minutes, the neutral real policy rate (NIR) is around unity in Indian conditions of
high unemployment and an ongoing transition to higher productivity employment[1].

37. Headline inflation has been around 5% since January this year while core

inflation has been below 4% since December 2023. Volatile commodity prices, El Nino
and heat waves have not been able to reverse the approach to target. The headline
inflation projection of 4.5% for 2024-25 gives an average real repo rate of 2% implying
that the real repo rate will be above neutral for too long if the repo rate stays
unchanged. Falling inflation has raised real repo above unity. This will reduce real
growth rate with a lag. Expected growth is around 7% in 2024-25 below the 8%
achieved in 2023-24[2]. Status quoism is praised as being cautious. But if doing nothing
distorts real variables it aggravates shocks instead of smoothing them and raises risk.

38. Again, as argued earlier, in Indian conditions of growth transition, inflation itself

is the best measure of potential growth. If headline inflation is approaching the target
and core inflation is below target, and incoming data supports this[3], it implies growth is
below potential and NIR above neutral; so real policy rates can safely fall. Potential
output and NIR defined by inflation require the repo rate to fall with inflation. It cannot
be correct to allow monetary policy to become more restrictive the nearer inflation gets
to its target.

39. Inflation has come down in the past through supply side action and anchoring of

inflation expectations with the NIR at neutral, without a large growth sacrifice. Why
then would higher real policy rates be required now to fight inflation that is lower? The
sacrifice ratio from NIR above neutral is very high when aggregate supply is elastic as
it is in India.

40. Let us examine some common arguments made against cutting the repo rate.

41. First, the fear of recurrent supply shocks. The volatilities facing policy in April

have moderated. Global uncertainties continue, but the world seems to have learnt to
live with them. Output and trade growth is improving. Conflicts have been contained
and international oil prices that are important for India are softening despite extension
of OPEC oil cuts, pointing to a reduction in OPEC’s monopoly power. Although global
commodity inflation is mixed, palm oil inflation, that affects many consumer goods
costs in India, is softening.

1 KLEMS data shows total factor productivity (TFR) for manufacturing and services increased at a higher pace
during 2015-16 to 2019-20 (5 years) as compared to that during 2010-11 to 2014-15 (5 years). This helps absorb
higher costs without requiring prices to rise and reduces the NIR despite higher growth.
2 The 8% growth was not due to base effects, which had raised Q1 growth after the pandemic year. But in 2023-24
growth rates was even through all the quarters.


-----

42. The good monsoon predicted has already set in and will likely reduce food

inflation. The elections are over. Results suggest political stability but also policy
continuity rather than disruptive changes. India gets a credible opposition, which
strengthens democracy. Even so, a conservative government with a good
implementation record will return and is likely to continue with fiscal consolidation
through a better composition of expenditure and other short and long-term cost
reducing supply-side reforms.

43. In addition to a lower probability of a large supply shock, the experience of the

past year shows supply shocks no longer have persistent effects on inflation or on
inflation expectations. We have waited for one year to watch the impact of these
shocks, now it is time to move on. Household inflation expectations have become
much less volatile in the post-pandemic period, falling slowly along with inflation itself.
Some anchoring seems to have made them immune to transient shocks.

44. Moreover, a durable approach to the inflation target is consistent with a

transient rise in inflation. It is necessary to avoid the mistake of 2015 when
international crude oil prices fell substantially but the fear that they would rise again
prevented an adequate cut in the policy rate. Real interest rates rose substantially and
hurt growth.

45. The second set of arguments is since growth is robust there is no need for a

cut. But growth is below potential and may slow further since consumption remains
weak. Increasing income and employment is the only sustainable way to bolster
consumption, as well as private investment. Transfers from a small percentage cannot
give prosperity to a billion people. Reducing unemployment is important for political
and financial stability. Without a rise in productive employment, aggressive
redistribution becomes more likely and may provoke a flight of wealth taking India
back to the stagnant seventies.

46. But will lower repo rates raise already high personal credit growth too much?

Over the last two years overall credit growth has been around 15% per annum. This
implies a mild rise in credit ratios since nominal GDP growth is about 12%. Indian
private credit ratios have to rise safely and steadily towards levels in peer countries,
avoiding the type of debt explosion that accompanied Chinese growth. Seasonally
adjusted monthly momentum in credit growth is slowing somewhat since January 2024
especially as sectoral prudential regulation moderates building up of excessive
leverages. This regulation is preventive and reduces the need for monetary rate action
that has broad effects[4].

47. Spreads are high in India. Average loan rates are in double digits. While risk
based pricing is required, a cut in repo rates will prevent retail interest rates rising to
unbearable levels. There may be some stress in loans to self-employed. If leverage is
rising, lower interest rates reduce costs and a possible indebtedness trap. Despite
some initial reduction after a repo cut, rising loan demand and slower deposit growth
will tend to raise both loan and deposit rates.

48. Third, is the belief, widespread in financial markets that India cannot cut before

the US Fed. But the US has its own special problems that do not apply elsewhere.
Many other central banks are cutting rates. The fall in India’s current account deficit,
index inclusion and ratings upgrade add to the many reasons that make interest

differentials with the US less important. India’s inflation differential with the US is also
narrowing again.

49. Finally, let us turn to the mechanics of cutting and the communication around it.

At present only small steps are required to align the repo with the fall in inflation so this
should not be seen as the start of a rate cut cycle. Communication should make it
clear that there is no softening path and forward-guidance remains data-determined. A
neutral stance is appropriate since the rate can then move in either direction as
required.

50. In line with the above reasoning, I vote for a 25 basis points cut to the repo rate

and a change in the stance to neutral. Even with these changes, monetary policy
would remain disinflationary towards bringing inflation credibly to the target.

**Statement by Prof. Jayanth R. Varma**

51. In my statement for the last meeting (April 2024), I expressed concern about

the growth sacrifice in 2024-25 induced by restrictive monetary policy. It now appears
that the maintenance of restrictive policy for unwarrantedly long will lead to a growth
sacrifice in 2025-26 as well. Professional forecasters surveyed by the RBI are
projecting growth both in 2025-26 and in 2024-25 to be lower than in 2023-24 by more
than 0.75%, and lower than the potential growth rate (of say 8%) by more than 1%.
This is an unacceptably high growth sacrifice considering that headline inflation is
projected to be only about 0.5% above target, and core inflation is extremely benign.

52. As I have stated in the last several meetings, the current real policy rate of

around 2% (based on projected inflation) is well above the level needed to glide
inflation to its target. I therefore vote to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points, and to
change the stance to neutral.

**Statement by Dr. Rajiv Ranjan**

53. The arguments made in my last statement are still valid. In a transition phase,

the role of the three Cs – **Caution that entails conviction about durable alignment of**
inflation to the target with more incoming information; **Consistency that rules out**
backpedalling; and Credibility that facilitates firm anchoring of expectations – is much
more relevant. On the whole, we are broadly in a similar monetary policy setting as in
the last two bi-monthly reviews. Growth continues to be robust and has surprised
further on the upside. While core inflation has softened further, food inflation risks
have remained elevated.

54. Our growth projection for 2024-25 has been revised upward for the following

reasons. First, GDP recorded a strong momentum (quarter-on-quarter growth) of 7.8
per cent in Q4:2023-24 as against an average of 5.8 per cent during the
corresponding quarters of the pre-COVID period (2012-13 to 2019-20). Even the
momentum of gross value added (GVA) was strong at 5.7 per cent during Q4:2023-24
in comparison with the average momentum of 2.4 per cent during the same preCOVID period. This strong momentum is likely to continue supporting growth in 202425. The available high frequency indicators for April-May exhibits optimism to sustain
momentum. Second, private consumption which was trailing will now get impetus from
rebound in rural demand on the back of expected above normal south-west monsoon
and improving agriculture sector. Third, external demand is witnessing a turn around
with improving outlook for global trade. In April, merchandise exports entered into
positive territory and services exports posted robust double-digit growth. Moreover,
KLEMS database available for 2021-22 shows that total factor productivity has

leading to higher productivity, along with favourable demography, rising labour force
participation and accelerated capital formation seems to have led to higher potential
growth as I have been highlighting in my last four statements. Perhaps lower
pressures from core inflation and the lower current account deficit in a scenario of high
growth could be a pointer to it. Of course, monetary policy along with lower input costs
have been the main driver of core disinflation.

55. On the inflation front, headline and core inflation have moderated on anticipated

lines. There is, however, little comfort in the near-term with inflation projected to
remain sticky at around 4.9 per cent in Q1:2024-25 primarily due to the impact of
unprecedented heat wave conditions on summer crop of vegetables and fruits; lower
agricultural and horticulture production estimates; revision in milk prices across major
cooperatives; and signs of a turnaround in commodity prices along with logistics and
transportation costs. Food, with a weight of 45.9 per cent in CPI, contributed to threefourths of the headline inflation in April 2024 compared to about 40 per cent a year
ago. Discounting the likely one-off drop in inflation to below target rate in Q2:2024-25
due to favourable base effects, the ongoing disinflation process, though gradual, is
expected to continue over the second half of 2024-25, with headline inflation projected
at 4.5 per cent by Q4:2025-26. Realisation of a normal monsoon, particularly in terms
of its spatial and temporal distribution, and the recharge of reservoirs would be critical
for the continued disinflation in food and headline CPI.

56. Against this backdrop, let me elaborate more on why we cannot afford any

misjudgement on our policy action at this stage. First, while we can draw some
comfort from headline inflation running within the tolerance band successively for eight
months in a row, we cannot drop our guard as the headline inflation is still not aligned
to the target. Repeated incidence of food price shocks is delaying the final descent of
inflation to the target. It is, however, encouraging that elevated food inflation over the
last six months have not spilled over into core inflation, reflecting the gains from
credibility of our maturing flexible inflation targeting framework. Nevertheless, given
the large share of food in the household consumption basket, we need to stay vigilant
to resist any such spill over and ensure that such price pressures are clearly
dissipated. Any consideration on policy change has to factor in this aspect to avoid
backpedalling in future.[5]

57. Second, there could be an argument that a pause for eight successive policies

is a long pause. Let me emphasise, the inertia of inaction should not drive us to action.
Rather the driving force should be the macroeconomic setting of growth and inflation.
Clearly, the favourable growth-inflation balance and the outlook is pointing towards
status quo. That said, even though the repo rate has been kept unchanged since
February 2023, several policy actions on liquidity, transmission and communication
have played out to stabilise the economy further. The views and assessment of all
major stakeholders seem to be closely aligned towards no action at this stage. In any
case, we do not face the kind of pressures being faced by some advanced economies
which have gone for very restrictive policy settings in the current rate hike cycle.

58. Third, it is also being argued that with the fisc consolidating, monetary policy

should be more growth supportive by easing policy rates. The counter argument is
two-fold: (a) we need to see what drives fiscal consolidation – if it is largely driven by
higher revenues including dividend, which is the case now, the adverse impact on
growth may be non-existent. On the contrary, fiscal consolidation may actually be
growth enhancing if it leads to improved country ratings, easing the financial
conditions for the private sector and improving the overall sentiment. (b) More

importantly, the best contribution that monetary policy can make to long-term growth is
via price stability.[6] In this context, I stand by what I said in my last minutes that we
need to utilise the space provided by stronger growth to focus on inflation.

59. To sum up, our monetary policy actions should continue to be primarily guided

by domestic macroeconomic conditions and the outlook. The growth-inflation mix at
the current juncture allows us to move more cautiously on the inflation front. Hence,
we should not waver from our focus on price stability which remains so important for
our long term sustained growth outcome. Accordingly, I vote for status quo on rate and
monetary policy stance in this policy.

60. Economic activity in India is evolving broadly in line with the baseline projection.

Prospects of a favourable monsoon should offset the slackening momentum that has
become a typical feature of first quarter GDP outturns in the post-pandemic period.
Domestic demand should continue to drive the economy, with private consumption
receiving a fillip from the revival in rural spending. Corporate balance sheets are
showing rising investments in fixed assets, which should find expression in a fuller
capital spending upturn. With output in broad balance in relation to its potential,
monetary policy can remain neutral to growth at this juncture and stay focused on
aligning inflation to the target. That objective remains incomplete, which can
undermine medium-term growth prospects.

61. The speed of the easing of inflation has been disappointing so far, even from a

cross-country perspective. Food prices are persisting for too long as the principal
impediment to a faster disinflation. The Indian economy remains hostage to
intersecting food price shocks. Their repetitive occurrence calls for intensifying
monetary policy vigil to ward off spillovers to other components of inflation and to
expectations. This also warrants looking through the statistical soft patch in inflation’s
trajectory that is anticipated during July-August 2024, while staying prepared to blunt
the uptick that is expected from September. Food prices are holding back any
consideration of possible changes in the monetary policy stance. Hence, I vote for
keeping the policy rate and the stance of withdrawal of accommodation unchanged.

62. The global economy is resilient but is growing at a lower rate than its historical

trend.[7] Inflation is easing unevenly across major economies. With varying growthinflation dynamics across countries, the importance of domestic factors in policy
making has come to the fore. Accordingly, there are initial signs of divergence on
monetary policy actions across countries.

63. The Indian economy is growing at a healthy rate, averaging 8.3 per cent in the

last three years. During 2023-24, the economy posted an impressive growth of 8.2 per
cent despite continued global headwinds and weather vagaries. This was largely
driven by domestic demand, especially investment activity. On the supply side,
manufacturing and services provided major support to gross value added (GVA).

64. Domestic growth outlook for 2024-25 remains upbeat as economic activity

continues to maintain momentum. South-west monsoon is expected to be above

normal, boosting agricultural activity and supporting rural consumption. Buoyant
services activity should sustain urban consumption. Business confidence remains
strong across manufacturing, services and infrastructure sectors. Healthy balance
sheets of banks and corporates and government’s capex thrust are expected to
support investment activity. Projections of improvement in global trade by agencies,[8]
when they materialise, will spur external demand. Considering these evolving
dynamics, GDP growth projection for 2024-25 has been revised upward by 20 basis
points to 7.2 per cent. When this happens, it will be the fourth consecutive year of 7.0
per cent or higher GDP growth.

65. Headline CPI inflation is moderating, but at a very slow pace. The last mile of

disinflation is turning out to be gradual and protracted. Since the April 2024 MPC
meeting, headline inflation moderated by around 30 basis points from 5.1 per cent in
February 2024 to 4.8 per cent in April 2024. Inflation in CPI core (CPI excluding food
and fuel) and its services sub-component were at historic lows in April 2024. Food
inflation is the main factor behind the grudgingly slow pace of disinflation. Recurring
and overlapping supply-side shocks continue to play an outsized role in food inflation.

66. Going forward, the baseline projections show inflation moderating to an

average 4.5 per cent in 2024-25. In the immediate months, however, the impact of
exceptionally warm summer months on output of certain perishables; a likely _rabi_
production shortfall in some pulses and vegetables – particularly potatoes and onions;
and the upward revisions in milk prices, warrant close monitoring. A normal monsoon
may eventually lead to easing of price pressures in key food items. Large favourable
base effects could lead to a temporary and one-off undershoot of inflation to below the
target rate in Q2, before rising again in Q3 and Q4 of 2024-25.

67. The move towards an active disinflationary stance of monetary policy since the

beginning of 2022-23 has helped to bring down inflation from its highly elevated levels,
break the core inflation persistence and prevent inflation expectations from getting
unanchored. The calibrated tightening by 250 basis points between May 2022 to
February 2023 has achieved disinflation with minimal output sacrifice as growth
remains strong.

68. The growth-inflation balance is moving favourably in line with our projections.

Resilient growth creates space for monetary policy to focus unambiguously on inflation
which remains well above the 4.0 per cent target. With persistently high food inflation,
it would be in order to continue with the disinflationary policy stance that we have
adopted. Any hasty action in a different direction will cause more harm than good. It is
important that inflation is durably aligned to the target of 4.0 per cent. Price stability is
the bedrock for high and sustainable growth. I, therefore, vote to keep the policy repo
rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent and to continue with the stance of withdrawal of
accommodation.
