**Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting May 20 to 22, 2020**

**[Under Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934]**

The twenty third meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted
under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from May 20 to
22, 2020; the meeting was originally scheduled from June 3 to 5, 2020, but was
advanced to May 20-22 in view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

2. The meeting was attended by all the members – Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor,

Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, former Director, Delhi School of Economics;
Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, former Professor, Indian Institute of Management,
Ahmedabad; Dr. Janak Raj, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank
nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of
India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary
policy – and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr.
Pami Dua and Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia joined the meeting through video conference.

3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve

Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy
Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the
following, namely:

(a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee;
(b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such
member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and

(c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under subsection (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting.

4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge

consumer confidence, households’ inflation expectations and the projections of
professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff’s macroeconomic
projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on
the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC
adopted the resolution that is set out below.

**Resolution**

5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic

situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (May 22, 2020)
decided to:

    - reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by


40 bps to 4 0 per cent from 4 40 per cent with immediate effect;


-----

- accordingly, the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate


stand reduced to 4.25 per cent from 4.65 per cent; and



- the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands reduced to 3.35 per cent from


3.75 per cent.



    - The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long

as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on
the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target.

These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term
target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per
cent, while supporting growth.


The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.


**Assessment**


_Global Economy_


6. Since the MPC met in March 2020, global economic activity has remained in

standstill under COVID-19 related lockdowns and social distancing. Among the key
advanced economies (AEs), economic activity contracted in the US, Euro area, Japan
and the UK in Q1:2020. Among emerging market economies (EMEs), the Chinese
economy went into a pronounced decline and data on high frequency indicators
suggest that activity may have also shrunk in other EMEs such as Brazil and South
Africa.

7. Global financial markets calmed after a turbulent period in March, and volatility

ebbed as swift and large fiscal and monetary policy responses helped to soothe
sentiment. Equity markets recovered some lost ground, while government bond yields
remained range-bound, although somewhat elevated in some EMEs due to countryspecific factors. Portfolio flows to EMEs revived in April and the rush to safe havens
eased. With the US dollar weakening, major EME currencies, which had experienced
persistent downward pressure, traded with an appreciating bias. Crude oil prices
firmed up modestly as oil producing countries (OPEC plus) agreed to cut production,
and prospects for revival in demand improved on expectations of imminent easing of
lockdowns. Gold prices remained elevated on hedging demand. CPI inflation remained
subdued across major AEs and EMEs primarily due to a collapse in oil prices and
compression in demand amidst lockdowns, while food inflation picked up due to supply
disruptions.

_Domestic Economy_

8. Domestic economic activity has been impacted severely by the lockdown which

has extended over the past two months. High frequency indicators point to a collapse
in demand beginning March 2020 across both urban and rural segments. Electricity
consumption has plunged, while both investment activity and private consumption
suffered precipitous declines, as reflected in the collapse in capital goods production
and the large retrenchment in the output of consumer durables and non-durables in
March. High frequency indicators of service sector activity such as passenger and
commercial vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic and foreign tourist arrivals
also experienced sizable contractions in March. The only silver lining was provided by
agriculture, with the summer sowing of rice, pulses and oilseeds in the country


-----

progressing well, with total area sown under the current kharif season up by 43.5 per
cent so far, and the _rabi harvest promising to be a bumper as reflected in record_
procurement.

9. Retail inflation, measured by the consumer price index, moderated for the

second consecutive month in March 2020 to 5.8 per cent after peaking in January.
This was mainly due to food inflation easing from double digits in December 2019 –
January 2020. In April, however, supply disruptions took a toll and reversed the
softening of food inflation, which surged to 8.6 per cent from 7.8 per cent in March.
Prices of vegetables, cereals, milk, pulses and edible oils and sugar emerged as
pressure points[1].

10. The Reserve Bank remained in pro-active liquidity management mode,

expanding its array of measures, both conventional and unconventional, to augment
system-level liquidity as also to channel liquidity to specific sectors facing funding
constraints. Systemic liquidity remained in abundance, with average daily net
absorptions under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) increasing to ₹5.66 lakh crore
in May 2020 (up to May 20) from ₹4.75 lakh crore in April. During 2020-21 (up to May
20), ₹1,20,474 crore was injected through open market operation (OMO) purchases
and ₹87,891 crore through three targeted long-term repo operation (TLTRO) auctions
and one TLTRO 2.0 auction. In order to distribute liquidity more evenly across the yield
curve, the Reserve Bank conducted one ‘operation twist’ auction involving the
simultaneous sale and purchase of government securities for ₹10,000 crore each on
April 27, 2020. Furthermore, the Reserve Bank has provided ₹22,334 crore as
refinance to National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Small
Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and National Housing Bank (NHB) so
far (as on May 21, 2020) and ₹2,430 crore to mutual funds through a special liquidity
facility (SLF) with a view to easing liquidity constraints and de-stress financial markets.
Since February 6, 2020 the Reserve Bank has announced liquidity augmenting
measures of ₹9.42 lakh crore (4.6 per cent of GDP).

11. Reflecting the various liquidity management measures, domestic financial

conditions have eased appreciably as reflected in the narrowing of liquidity premia in
various market segments. Yields on government securities, commercial paper (CP),
91-day treasury bills, certificates of deposit (CDs) and corporate bonds have softened.
The weighted average lending rates on fresh rupee loans of commercial banks
declined by 43 bps in March 2020 alone. Though credit growth remains muted,
scheduled commercial banks’ investments in commercial paper, bonds, debentures
and shares of corporate bodies in this year so far (up to May 8) increased sharply by
₹66,757 crore as against a decline of ₹8,822 crore during the same period last year.
There were net inflows into various schemes of mutual funds in April in contrast to
large outflows in March.

12. In the external sector, India’s merchandise trade slumped in April 2020, with

exports shrinking by 60.3 per cent and imports by 58.6 per cent (y-o-y), respectively.
While imports contracted in all 30 commodity groups in April, exports contracted in 28
out of 30 groups. The trade deficit narrowed in April 2020 – both sequentially and on
a year-on-year basis – to its lowest level in 47 months. On the financing side, net
foreign direct investment inflows picked up in March 2020 to US$ 2.9 billion from US$
0.8 billion a year ago. In 2020-21 so far (till May 18), net foreign portfolio investment
(FPI) in equities increased to US$ 1.2 billion from US$ 0.8 billion a year ago. In the
debt segment, however, there were portfolio outflows of US$ 3.8 billion during the
same period as compared with outflows of US$ 1.4 billion a year ago. By contrast, net

1All India headline CPI was not released for April 2020 in view of limited transactions in non-food items due to


-----

investment under the voluntary retention route increased by US$ 0.7 billion during the
same period. India’s foreign exchange reserves have increased by US$ 9.2 billion in
2020-21 so far (up to May 15) to US$ 487.0 billion – equivalent to 12 months of
imports.


**Outlook**


13. The inflation outlook is highly uncertain. As supply lines get restored in the

coming months with gradual relaxations in the lockdown, the unusual spike in food
inflation in April is expected to moderate. The forecast of a normal monsoon also
portends well for food inflation. Given the current global demand-supply balance,
international crude oil prices are likely to remain low although they may firm up from
the recent depressed levels. Soft global prices of metals and other industrial raw
materials are likely to keep input costs low for domestic firms. Deficient demand may
hold down pressures on core inflation (excluding food and fuel), although persisting
supply dislocations impart uncertainty to the near term outlook. However, volatility in
financial markets could have a bearing on inflation. These factors, combined with
favourable base effects, are expected to take effect and pull down headline inflation
below target in Q3 and Q4 of 2020-21.

14. Turning to the growth outlook, economic activity other than agriculture is likely

to remain depressed in Q1:2020-21 in view of the extended lockdown. Even though
the lockdown may be lifted by end-May with some restrictions, economic activity even
in Q2 may remain subdued due to social distancing measures and the temporary
shortage of labour. Recovery in economic activity is expected to begin in Q3 and gain
momentum in Q4 as supply lines are gradually restored to normalcy and demand
gradually revives. For the year as a whole, there is still heightened uncertainty about
the duration of the pandemic and how long social distancing measures are likely to
remain in place and consequently, downside risks to domestic growth remain
significant. On the other hand, upside impulses could be unleashed if the pandemic is
contained, and social distancing measures are phased out faster.

15. The MPC is of the view that the macroeconomic impact of the pandemic is

turning out to be more severe than initially anticipated, and various sectors of the
economy are experiencing acute stress. The impact of the shock has been
compounded by the interaction of supply disruptions and demand compression.
Beyond the destruction of economic and financial activity, livelihood and health are
severely affected. Even as various measures initiated by the Government and the
Reserve Bank work to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic on the economy,
it is necessary to ease financial conditions further. This will facilitate the flow of funds
at affordable rates and revive animal spirits. With the inflation outlook remaining
benign as lockdown-related supply disruptions are mended, the policy space to
address growth concerns needs to be used now rather than later to support the
economy, even while maintaining headroom to back up the revival of activity when it
takes hold.

16. Accordingly, all members voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate and

maintaining the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and
mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains
within the target.

17. Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Janak Raj, Dr. Michael Debabrata

Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate by 40 bps,
while Dr. Chetan Ghate voted for a reduction by 25 bps.

**Statement by Dr. Chetan Ghate**


19. Since the last review, the outlook for the economy has deteriorated further.


20. Several high frequency indicators point to dire growth outcomes in the near

term. On COVID-19, we haven’t achieved the first goal, which is flattening of the curve.
The “tug of war” between economic and health costs has led to some opening up of
the economy. The economy needs to be opened up smartly. The risk of prematurely
opening the economy is that there could be a surge in new cases. It takes time for
local epidemics to grow. The main growth challenge is that the top six industrialized
states produce 62% of India’s GDP. These are also the worst affected states by
COVID.

21. Despite the dire growth outcomes, why have I voted for a 25 bps cut, and not a

larger amount?

22. _First, it is not entirely clear to me that Covid-19 constitutes a large disinflationary_

shock. Inflationary pressures fall with economic slack (the output gap), but rise with
expected future inflation and factors related to production costs.

23. Both 3-month ahead and 1-year ahead inflationary expectations have spiked

sharply (by 190 bps and 120 bps respectively) in the latest round of RBI’s survey. This
spike reverses a relatively flat trajectory for inflationary expectations over the past six
rounds of surveys. It also reflects a sharp rise in food inflation in recent months. In
April, food inflation rose to 8.6% from 7.8% in March, and will likely remain elevated in
the coming months. This is worrisome. I continue to be concerned about declining
market arrivals of food commodities because of COVID related supply side bottlenecks and their inflationary impact.

24. When the economy turns to the upside, the recovery in demand will be swift.

There has already been a severe dislocation in domestic and global supply chains. It
will take some time to for these to get resolved, and it is therefore likely that demand
will recover faster than supply.

25. Currently, core inflation (inflation excluding food and fuel) continues to remain

moderate, with the April readings (not released by the CSO) likely to have been similar
to the March readings, or around 4%. Lower oil prices have not been passed on to
consumers at the pump because of a sharp hike in Central excise duties and increases
in VAT rates on petrol and diesel across States, cancelling out any beneficial effects
of lower oil prices on core inflation.

26. _Second, as I mentioned in the last review, in a demand deficient economy, a_

large rate cut is akin to pushing on a string.


-----

27. For rate cuts to work, banks have to lend. Despite the large number of steps

taken to improve the liquidity and functioning of credit markets, as of April 24 (the most
recent data available), non-food credit growth on a y-o-y basis was at 6.5% on May 8,
2020, lower than 7.2% on April 10, 2020.

28. _Third, rate cuts should be seen as part other measures that have already been_

taken with respect to liquidity policy, social insurance policy, and fiscal policy in dealing
with the crisis.

29. Since the last review, a comprehensive fiscal stimulus has been announced,

amounting to about 10% of GDP. The “Keynesian component” of the stimulus, i.e., the
part that increases discretionary spending via fiscal policy is however around 1% of
GDP.

30. An ambitious Keynesian fiscal stimulus was always going to have to navigate

between Scylla and Charybdis: if the government spent too much on the discretionary
part of the stimulus, the yield curve would have gotten thrashed, banks would have
booked losses, and our credit rating would have gotten a downgrade. It would have
also signalled that the government is giving up on its commitment to controlling
inflation. If it spent too little, it risked a worsening of growth.

31. To navigate the middle path, the government has focussed on much needed

structural reforms. This is prudent. The measured approach to the stimulus recognizes
the government cannot spend its way to prosperity without implications for financial
instability.

32. Despite the small Keynesian component of the stimulus however, taking into

account the relaxation in state government borrowing limits, the combined state-centre
fiscal deficit is still likely to rise to around 10-12% of GDP in FY 21. I doubt if the bond
markets will shrug this off. That means transmission to credit markets will suffer,
making a large rate cut pointless. What compounds this is the rising risk aversion in
the financial system will get exacerbated by a looming spike in NPAs because of the
loan and mortgage holidays announced. This will hinder transmission even more.

33. _Fourth, since the last review, a variety of high frequency indicators have_

declined sharply. There has been a broad based and deep contraction in the March
IIP (Index of Industrial Production) which fell to -16.7% from 4.6% in March. Passenger
vehicle sales have plummeted. Consumer non-durables have fallen by -16%.
Indicators of fixed investment have tanked: finished steel consumption has declined
by -90.9%, and IIP Capital goods (which proxy for machinery and equipment) have
also fallen by -35.6%. PMI manufacturing declined to 27.4 in April from 51.8 in March
due to a sharp contraction in output and new export orders. The services PMI dropped
to 5.4 in April from 49.3 in March due to a sharp fall in business activity. Exports have
also fallen drastically by -60.3%.

34. While these have no doubt resulted in a large negative output gap, it is also true

that potential output has also fallen.

35. The only silver lining is the agriculture sector. The current Rabi crop has done

well. And the current summer sowing of crops (for rice, pulses, coarse cereals, and
oilseeds) is higher by 43.7% over last year.

36. The strongest argument for a big rate cut would therefore be the dire growth

outcomes because of COVID. However, such rate cuts should be saved for when the
economy starts reviving, and not when we are in a lock-down. Rate cuts, assuming
that there is transmission and banks lend, works most effectively when the economy
is on the upside. The MPC should keep some gunpowder dry.


-----

37. _Fifth, the reverse repo rate has been cut thrice in succession to 3.35%. The_

idea behind the asymmetric cuts is to use the LAF corridor as an instrument of
monetary policy. For all practical purposes the reverse repo rate is now the effective
policy rate. I worry that the current quantum of liquidity will be difficult to unwind when
things return back to normal. RBI’s liquidity policy has helped stabilize financial
markets, but lender of last resort policies, as is widely recognised, are not useful
outside a crisis, and thus should not be viewed as part of normal monetary policy.


38. Given the above reasons, I vote to cut the policy rate by 25 bps this time.


39. I will continue to watch the incoming growth-inflation data carefully, and remain

data dependent.


40. I also vote to retain the stance as accommodative.


**Statement by Dr. Pami Dua**


41. The nationwide lockdown over the past two months due to the COVID-19

pandemic has severely impacted domestic economic activity, yielding a grim
prognosis for the economy. This unprecedented and extraordinary economic and
health crisis has also gravely affected the global economy with acute intensity and
spread.

42. On the domestic inflation front, headline CPI inflation fell from 6.6 per cent in

February 2020 to 5.8 per cent in March. For the month of April, only partial information
has been released, providing the numbers for food inflation, which rose from 7.8 per
cent in March to 8.6 per cent in April, with prices of vegetables, pulses, edible oils, milk
and cereals being the prime drivers. However, low crude oil prices, soft global prices
of metals and other industrial raw materials, and weakening aggregate demand are
expected to soften inflation, although supply disruptions may impact inflation
adversely. Overall, headline inflation is expected to ease in the second half of
FY:2020-21 and fall below target. This also conforms with the May 2020 round of the
Inflation Expectations Survey of Households conducted by the Reserve Bank of India
that shows higher inflation expectations for the three-months-ahead forecasts
compared to forecasts for the one-year-ahead horizon.

43. On the domestic output front, the evolving pandemic has had serious

ramifications for domestic growth, which is crippled by a near-standstill in economic
activity due to the lockdown and social distancing, leading to demand compression as
well as supply disruptions. High frequency indicators of urban consumption demand –
passenger vehicle sales, domestic passenger air traffic and consumer durables – fell
dramatically in March 2020. A similar dismal picture emerges in indicators of rural
demand – tractors sales, motorcycle sales and consumer non-durables – that plunged
sharply in the same period. Indicators of fixed investment also fell, with a sharp drop
in finished steel consumption in April and cement production in March, reflecting a
slowdown in construction activity. Moreover, capital goods production (as per the usebased classification of IIP) declined by 36 per cent in March, along with a significant
drop in capital goods imports during March and April. While the data for the March
print of IIP has been compiled with limited sample due to the institution of the lockdown
from March 25, the preliminary data indicates a drop in IIP by almost 17 per cent, with
manufacturing falling by more than 20 per cent, infrastructure/construction goods by
almost 24 per cent and electricity by 6.8 per cent.

44. The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing declined sharply to

its lowest level of 27.4 in April from 51.8 in March, partly due to contraction in output
and new exports orders. The PMI for services dropped dramatically to an
unprecedented level of 5 4 in April from 49 3 in March due mainly to a drop in business


-----

activity, new business orders and new export business. High frequency indicators of
the services sector, in addition to those mentioned above (passenger vehicle sales,
domestic passenger air traffic), and including foreign tourist arrival, railway freight
traffic, and commercial vehicle sales, contracted in March/April.

45. Fortunately, growth in agriculture has held up, with the total area under summer

crops including rice, pulses, coarse cereals and oilseeds up by 43.7 per cent as on
May 10, 2020 over the corresponding period of last year. Further, as per the third
advance estimates of crop production for 2019-20, production of foodgrains (kharif
and rabi) in 2019-20 is 3.7 per cent higher than the final estimates of the previous year.

46. The Consumer Confidence Survey conducted by RBI in May 2020 also paints

a grim picture, showing that the overall Current Situation Index is at a historic low,
while the Future Expectations Index reflects high pessimism for the year ahead. Thus,
consumer sentiment has plunged to abysmally low levels.

47. At the global level, the global manufacturing PMI plunged to an eleven year low

in April 2020, while the global services PMI sharply declined to a record low.
Accordingly, India’s merchandise exports and imports witnessed record contractions,
with exports falling by 60.3 per cent in April 2020, while imports dropped by 58.6 per
cent.

48. The economic situation is thus extremely gloomy. While the COVID-19

pandemic is a humanitarian and health crisis, the related lockdown has precipitated a
collapse in economic activity, which has come to a near standstill. Other than in the
agriculture sector, economic activity may continue to remain sluggish even after the
lifting of the lockdown, due to social distancing and shortage of labour as a result of
the migration of workers to their native places. In fact, GDP growth in FY:2020-21 is
expected to remain in negative territory, with some respite in the second half of the
fiscal year. The way forward in terms of restoration of economic activity thus depends
on the speed with which the pandemic is contained, how quickly the Indian economy
opens up, and how soon supply disruptions are repaired and demand revives. It will
also depend on the impact of the combined stimulus from fiscal, monetary, social and
administrative measures that have been implemented to create conditions conducive
to survival in the crisis, as well as for revival in growth. Over time, some reprioritisation
in government expenditure towards health infrastructure and capital expenditure may
also be desirable for promoting economic revival.

49. The Government has outlined a comprehensive package in five tranches

covering, amongst other measures, rural employment creation, infrastructure creation,
focus on MSME sector and creation of an enabling business environment. The
package also includes relief measures for poorer sections of society and for resource
constrained state governments by increasing their borrowing limits. The measures
also encompass a number of major structural reforms, which are more long-term in
nature.

50. The Reserve Bank of India has used conventional monetary policy measures

as well as unconventional monetary policy tools that supplement the conventional
measures in order to ease financial conditions and stimulate growth in the economy.
It has also undertaken several measures to improve liquidity, monetary transmission
and credit flows to the economy, and provide relief on debt servicing.

51. Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the Indian economy, the policy repo rate

had already been reduced by 135 basis points between February and October 2019
in response to the slowdown in economic activity. Since the advent of the pandemic,
the repo rate was further cut by 75 basis points in the March MPC meeting, amounting
to a total cut of 210 basis points between February 2019 and March 2020. The

t li t i i t l di t f b k h i d ith 90 b i


-----

points decline in the one-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate
(MCLR) between February 2019 and May 15, 2020. The weighted average lending
rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans declined by 114 basis points between February
2019 and March 2020 with a fall of 43 basis points in March itself.

52. Given the severity and depth of the crisis, the macroeconomic impact of the

pandemic is turning out to be more severe than initially anticipated. Thus, in order to
revive growth and mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19, it is important to ease
financial conditions further. Accordingly, I vote for cutting the policy rate by 40 basis
points. This brings the total reduction in the policy rate since the start of the spread of
the COVID-19 pandemic to 115 basis points with the magnitude of cut in the easing
cycle that started in February 2019, (up to May 2020) being 250 basis points. In the
current scenario, with heightened uncertainty and a near-standstill in economic
activity, this may not necessarily lead to an immediate increase in borrowing, but
should raise consumer confidence and investor sentiment, going forward. I also vote
to maintain the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth, while
ensuring that inflation remains within the target.


**Statement by Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia**


53. Continuing lockdown in the geographical areas that contribute a major share in

the Indian economy and worsening global economic situation due to COVID-19 has
now created a distinct possibility of the real GDP growth in India during 2020-21 to be
in the negative zone for the first time in the last 40 years. Even the nominal GDP
growth may slip into the negative zone. There are all symptoms of a recession – fall in
aggregate demand, negative real growth and high unemployment. The government
has provided a major fiscal boost through a series of announcements. The role of the
monetary policy under such circumstances should be to supplement and support the
fiscal efforts to bring the economy out of the unprecedented crisis. Without exhausting
all the space for policy rate cuts, in this meeting I, therefore, vote for a 40 bps cut in
the policy Repo Rate and maintaining the accommodative stance. More specific
reasons for my vote are as follows –

i) Under the lockdown, measurement of consumer inflation and a survey of
household inflationary expectations are likely to quite problematic. The samples
would be truncated and undesirable biases may enter the estimates making
them unreliable and non-representative. Under such circumstances, I feel, the
model based forecasts provide a better guide. A very carefully carried out
forecasting exercise provides an estimate of headline CPI inflation around 2.8
percent for Q4 2020-21. Even accounting for uncertainties, a very conservative
estimate may be taken as 3.1-3.2 percent. Thus, inflation rising above the target
of 4 percent does not seem to be any concern for the policy right now.

ii) Although the real policy rate in most other comparator countries is zero or
negative, in India it is not only positive but relatively very high at around 1.2 to
1.6 percent. I believe that the real policy rate needs to be kept positive but not
so high under the present conditions.

iii) The fiscal boost given by the Central government in several instalments is likely
to result in further slippage of the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio of only 150 bps.
Similarly, all states together may raise their fiscal deficit to GDP ratio by about
150 bps. Thus, the impact on the combined fiscal deficit to GDP ratio may be
confined to about 300 bps, which in my opinion is quite prudent under such
extreme conditions. It may not be inflationary and may result in growth recovery.


-----

iv) Once the situation returns back to normal and the fiscal and monetary boost
measures start generating impacts, the recovering economy in my opinion may
require some further boost. It is prudent to preserve some space for the future.

54. Considering all these factors, I vote for a 40 bps reduction in the policy repo

rate and maintaining the accommodative stance.


**Statement by Dr. Janak Raj**


55. The impact of COVID-19 on economic activity has turned out to be much more

acute than initially expected with the nation-wide lockdown having been extended from
initial 3 weeks to 9 weeks. There is still uncertainty as to when the epidemiological
curve will flatten and this will continue to cloud the macroeconomic outlook for some
more time. Be that as it may, we are staring at a huge negative growth in the current
quarter and overall negative growth for the year as a whole. Both demand and supply
sides of the economy have collapsed. However, I believe that supplies would recover
much faster than demand. This is because capacity to produce goods and services by
and large remains intact, though non-availability of labour may temporarily hamper
production for a few months. On the other hand, however, there has been a substantial
loss of demand. A large number of daily labourers/wage earners have been rendered
jobless because of lockdown. Though a part of the unemployed work force will get
back to work, still there are some sectors which have been hit hard and many people
working in these sectors may have lost their jobs permanently. This will adversely
affect private consumption. Otherwise also, consumer confidence has been dented
and consumers are likely to cut down on discretionary spending.

56. Within aggregate demand, while private consumption is likely to slowdown from

the pre-COVID-19 levels, what worries me more is investment demand, which is likely
to be impacted severely for a variety of reasons. First, given the collapse in demand,
excess capacity is likely to be created in many sectors. This, combined with huge
uncertainty about future demand, both domestic and external, is likely to hamper new
investments in the private sector. Second, financing of investment activity – from own
sources due to a decline in profitability or by borrowing due to weak balance sheets –
will also be a challenge. Third, the focus of government spending, both by the Centre
and the States, will also be on revenue expenditure than on capital expenditure. For
all these reasons, investment activity, which contracted in last two quarters, is
expected to be severely hit, going forward.

57. Moving on to inflation, the NSO has released data only on the food and housing

groups for April 2020. Food inflation rose to 8.6 per cent in April from 7.8 per cent in
March. However, these numbers need to be interpreted with a caution as the rise in
food prices in April was caused by a disruption in supply lines and is transitory. The
wedge between CPI inflation and WPI inflation for food in April widened sharply by
more than 500 bps. While CPI food inflation increased by close to 80 bps in April, WPI
inflation declined by 190 bps from 5.5 per cent to 3.6 per cent, suggesting an increase
in margins at a retail level due to supply bottlenecks. Should monsoon be normal, as
it has been forecast, it should also have a salutary effect on food inflation. I, therefore,
feel that risks to food inflation, other than in pulses, are minimal at this stage and
overall food inflation is expected to resume its downward trajectory from May/June.

58. Though the print of CPI fuel inflation was not available for April, data from oil

market companies suggest that domestic LPG and kerosene plunged in April in line
with a decline in global prices.

59. Finally, we also do not have core inflation (excluding food and fuel) print for

April. The fall in international crude oil prices has not been passed on to domestic


-----

pump prices of petrol and diesel. Though this makes domestic pump prices vulnerable
to any rise in international prices, on the current demand supply balance, oil prices are
likely to remain soft. Given the collapse in domestic demand, core inflation should
soften significantly from the current levels over the medium term. Input cost pressures
are also likely to ease due to a sharp decline in global commodity prices. Housing
inflation at less than 4 per cent during March-April was the lowest in the series. Gold
prices are expected to remain firm due to a flight to safety. On the whole, however,
core inflation is expected to remain benign over the next few quarters. Even though
there is expected to be a V shaped recovery, the economy will still be left with a
considerable slack, which will keep core inflation under check.

60. To sum up, economic activity is expected to contract in 2020-21. While supply

lines are likely to be restored as lockdown is relaxed, demand would take far longer to
revive to pre-COVID levels. Even as some support will be provided by government
expenditure, overall consumption is likely to slow down due to a slump in private
consumption. More than private consumption, however, it is investment demand which
is expected to be hit hard in this uncertain environment and may be a huge drag on
economic activity in the near future with attendant implications for potential growth.
Therefore, concerted efforts need to be made to revive investment demand. Overall,
inflation over the medium term is expected to be benign. Monetary policy has been
eased significantly since February 2019 and the Government has also taken several
measures, which will help mitigate deleterious impact of COVID-19 on aggregate
demand. However, an unprecedented collapse in demand calls for further easing of
financing conditions. With the likely contraction in economic activity and the inflation
outlook remaining soft, the policy space has opened up. I, therefore, vote for reducing
the policy repo rate by 40 basis points and keeping the stance accommodative as long
as it is necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the
target. Given the long transmission lags with which monetary policy operates, it is
important to create enabling financing conditions so that economic activity takes off
swiftly as soon as normalcy is restored. Should the inflation trajectory turn out as
expected, some more policy space may open up, going forward. For monetary policy
actions to transmit fully to the credit market, it is important that banks remain well
capitalised. Only banks with strong balance sheets could be expected to support
lending activity as and when credit demand picks up.


**Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra**


61. In my view, the destruction of economic activity by COVID-19 and ensuing

lockdowns is much more deleterious in terms of loss of basic livelihood, economic
security, health and confidence than the range of estimates/projections of GDP and
other macroeconomic aggregates suggest. In India, as in the rest of the world, external
trade, investment, manufacturing, services involving people – hospitality, tourism,
aviation and construction – and investment have been the worst hit. Private
consumption is tenuously holding on to positive territory, but spending patterns have
altered drastically away from the discretionary and to the essential. The large
monetary stimulus and fiscal effort are striving to put a floor under the aggregate
demand. At the current juncture, the all-out effort is to maintain and sustain, with the
hope that when life is secure, resources, energy and time can be marshalled to rebuild
and revive.

62. In fact, my view is that the damage is so deep and extensive that India’s

potential output has been pushed down, and it will take years to repair.

63. In the deliberations of the MPC, my view is that the threats to growth have to

be addressed frontally and aggressively or risk a more dire outlook


-----

64. Meanwhile, the prolonged lockdown has thrown supply into disarray and

interrupted the easing of inflation that had gotten underway after the January 2020
peaking. Contemporaneous information suggests that the momentum in the prices of
several food items, especially perishables, may be ebbing, with favourable
implications for the evolution of headline inflation going forward. This suggests that the
food price spike has very little persistence and dispersion (except in April 2020 when
the lockdown started producing wider effects), and can be looked through for policy
purposes. The sustained loss of momentum of seasonally adjusted GDP growth over
eight consecutive quarters is depressing the underlying momentum of core inflation,
and this is likely to continue in the near term, as aggregate demand would take time
to return to pre-COVID levels.

65. Relative prices tend to adjust within the budget constraint. For setting monetary

policy, however, it is the absolute level of prices and its prospective movements that
matter. This warrants a careful assessment of aggregate demand. Apart from the
unidirectional loss of speed in real GDP growth, monetary conditions are also
reflecting the fragile state of demand. While reserve money adjusted for the first round
CRR effects is expanding substantially in relation to its pace a year ago, this essentially
reflects the large monetary stimulus and the public’s flight to cash – currency in
circulation expanded year-on-year by 18.4 per cent up to May 22, 2020 as against
14.9 per cent a year ago. In the current milieu in which banks are depositing sizeable
balances with the Reserve Bank rather than lending/investing, the money multiplier at
which this reserve money expansion translates into money supply, has to be adjusted
to include LAF reverse repos, which are essentially (remunerated) excess reserves.
With this adjustment, the money multiplier would have effectively declined from its
normal level of 5.5 to about 4.5. This is showing up in the rate of money supply which
has slowed below its secular trend; in fact, the negative money gap (actual rate of
money supply minus its trend rate) has widened since 2019-20, especially from the
second half. Both bank credit and investments are decelerating to multi-year lows,
pointing to badly dented demand and risk aversion. On the other hand, bank deposits
are growing faster than a year ago, driven by a precautionary savings instinct in these
times of heightened uncertainty. It is important to break this recessionary loop, shore
up the erosion in confidence, incentivise banks to invest and lend, and people to
spend.

66. It is this context that should condition monetary policy actions and stance. The

MPC has decided to remain accommodative as long as it is necessary to revive growth
and mitigate the fallout of COVID-19. In keeping with this stance, the policy rate has
been reduced by 75 basis points since February 2020 when the virus outbreak
assumed pandemic proportions. In the evolving configuration of growth and inflation,
monetary policy can inspire confidence among households and businesses to break
the vortex of public preference for deposits over spending and banks’ aversion to lend
and invest. Ahead of turning to mend broken areas of activity, it is important to nurture
the green shoots that have become visible – as in agriculture and allied activities – so
that they take root and grow. These considerations warrant backing up past actions
and stance with another decisive reduction in the policy rate while persevering with
the accommodative stance. The experience of central banks has been that monetary
policy acts best when it is reinforced by policy actions and stance in the same direction
repetitively till the desired objectives are achieved.

67. The size of the rate reduction needs to be calibrated to the space opened up

by the inflation outlook, after allowing for margins of error in these fluid and uncertain
times, while keeping in mind the ramifications of the size of the rate reduction for
financial stability.


-----

68. Accordingly, I vote for a reduction in the policy rate by 40 basis points while

maintaining the accommodative stance of monetary policy that has been reflected in
the resolutions of the MPC in the recent period.

**Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das**

69. The impact of COVID-19 on the domestic economy has turned out to be far

more severe than initially anticipated. Lockdowns across major economies have also
severely impacted economic activity across the globe. In the April WEO, the IMF
projected the global economy to contract sharply by 3.0 per cent in 2020. GDP data
for Q1:2020 and more recent high frequency indicators emanating from major
advanced and emerging market economies, however, suggest that the contraction in
global growth could be even deeper.

70. Domestic economic activity has been impacted severely by two months of

lockdown which was imposed to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and
save human lives. High frequency indicators for March-April 2020 suggest a collapse
of demand. Industrial output, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP) for
March, which included only seven days of the nation-wide lockdown, contracted by
16.7 per cent. The contraction was spread across sectors, with manufacturing
shrinking by 20.6 per cent and capital goods production by 35.6 per cent. Private
consumption, which has been the bedrock of domestic demand, also plummeted with
the production of consumer durables falling by 33.1 per cent in March 2020 and that
of non-durables by 16.2 per cent.

71. Limited data that are available for April suggest a further shrinkage in demand.

India’s merchandise trade slumped in April 2020, with exports contracting by 60.3 per
cent and imports by 58.6 per cent. While railway freight traffic shrank by 35.3 per cent
in April, steel consumption declined by 90.9 per cent. PMI manufacturing and PMI
services in April slipped to unprecedented levels of 27.4 and 5.4 respectively.

72. Bank credit growth continues to be tepid, suggesting weak demand. Non-food

credit of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) grew by 6.5 per cent (y-o-y) as on May
8, 2020 as compared with 13.0 per cent a year ago. During 2020-21 so far (up to May
8, 2020), however, banks’ investment in commercial paper, shares, bonds and
debentures increased by ₹66,757 crore as against a decline of ₹8,822 crore during
the same period last year, reflecting the impact of targeted long term repo operations
(TLTROs) of the Reserve Bank.

73. The only silver lining has been the agriculture sector – the summer sowing is

progressing well. As on May 10, 2020, summer sowing of all crops in the country was
much higher by 43.7 per cent (37.9 per cent for rice, 74.8 per cent for pulses and 29.3
per cent for oilseeds) over last year’s acreage. The harvest of _rabi crop is almost_
complete. The forecast of normal monsoon by the India Meteorological Department
(IMD) augurs well for agriculture output and farm incomes.

74. On inflation, the headline consumer price index (CPI) for April 2020 was not

available on account of nationwide lockdown. Among the major groups, for which
indices were released, food group inflation edged up in April 2020 (to 8.6 per cent from
7.8 per cent in the previous month) due to a broad-based increase in inflation across
the food sub-groups.

75. The Reserve Bank has been proactively managing liquidity. Since the MPC

statement of February 6, 2020 the Reserve Bank has announced liquidity augmenting
measures of ₹9.42 lakh crore (4.6 per cent of GDP). Monetary transmission has
continued to improve with the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee


-----

loans declining by 43 bps in March; the decrease since February 2019, when the
current cycle of rate cut began, being 114 bps.

76. Looking ahead, the growth outlook has deteriorated sharply. There is still

uncertainty as to when the COVID curve will flatten. Even as the supply side is
expected to ease gradually as the lockdown related restrictions are phased out, it is
the demand side, which will continue to weigh heavily on economic activity for some
time to come. The impact of the fiscal and contingent liability measures announced by
the government on demand creation needs to be carefully watched. Quick
implementation of various reform measures can also inject growth impulses into the
Indian economy in the medium to long term. Economic activity, however, is expected
to contract in the first half of the year before recovering gradually in the second half of
2020-21 on the back of various fiscal, monetary and liquidity measures undertaken in
the recent period. Overall, the GDP growth in 2020-21 is estimated to remain in
negative territory. The pace of recovery will be contingent upon the containment of the
pandemic and how quickly social distancing/lockdown measures are phased out.

77. It has become challenging to assess the inflation outlook in the absence of

complete information on CPI. Food inflation is expected to moderate in the coming
months as transport impediments and supply lines get eased. This is also corroborated
by data on 22 essential commodities released by the Department of Consumer Affairs,
which show that prices of several food items have declined in this month so far from
the April levels. The meltdown in demand is also likely to result in a significant easing
of price pressures in core goods and services. Weak demand conditions in the
presence of strong favourable base effects could result in headline inflation
falling below the target rate during Q3 and Q4 of 2020-21.

78. Since the last off-cycle MPC meeting on March 27, 2020 macro-financial

conditions have deteriorated rapidly. The fast evolving trade-offs between growth and
inflation have underscored the need for intensifying the assessment of the
macroeconomic outlook, and the preparedness to act pre-emptively to address the
swiftly shifting underlying economic and financial conditions and what they portend for
the path going forward. Delaying timely monetary policy response by two weeks,
waiting for the bi-monthly MPC meeting schedule, could be costly and irreversible. In
fact, such a delay in monetary policy action could potentially become a source of risk
itself to the deteriorating growth outlook. Monetary policy is a rapid deployment
instrument of public policy, and monetary authorities, forewarned by prescient
assessment of the prevailing macroeconomic conditions, have to be nimble. It is in this
context that the scheduled second bi-monthly meeting of the MPC was advanced from
June 3 to 5, 2020 to May 20 to 22, 2020.

79. As pointed out in the foregoing paragraphs, the risks to growth have become

far more severe than in our assessment at the end of March 2020. It is expected that
this diagnosis will be validated by hard data over the next few months, even as the
overall outlook continues to be highly uncertain. The key challenge for monetary policy
at this stage is to resuscitate domestic demand to avoid any harmful effect on income
and employment in the short run and potential growth over the medium term. For
strengthening domestic demand, it is important to revive consumer and business
confidence. The Government has already announced a variety of measures to provide
economic support to various sectors of the economy and protect the interests of
vulnerable sections of society. The Reserve Bank has also been proactively managing
liquidity to ensure that funds flow to all productive sectors of the economy. RBI has
also been easing monetary policy to reduce the cost of funds/capital to revive domestic
demand. While all these measures should help support demand as and when the
nation-wide lockdown is lifted, but given the enormity of a collapse in demand, the
need is to move ahead full throttle to ease financing conditions further so as to revive


-----

consumption and revitalize investment. Since banks are the key players in financing
consumption and investment, it is also imperative that they remain adequately
capitalised. The benign inflation outlook that is expected for the second half of 202021, coupled with the rising probability of a sharper loss of growth momentum in the
near-term, has provided us with more policy space to ease financial conditions further
and stimulate growth. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the MPC has voted for frontloading its actions. In view of the deteriorating outlook, it is critical to reinforce these
actions in sync with the space provided by the underlying conditions.

80. In assessing the magnitude of policy space, it is important to take into account

the weak growth momentum, the need for prioritising growth in view of the less risky
inflation outlook, and the need to assure benign financial conditions ahead of the
recovery taking hold so that confidence is sustained. Considering all these factors, a
reduction in the policy rate by 40 basis points would be appropriate. Accordingly, I vote
for reducing the policy repo rate by 40 basis points from 4.4 per cent to 4.0 per cent. I
also vote for persevering with the accommodative stance of monetary policy. The RBI
remains watchful and shall not hesitate to use any conventional and unconventional
tool in its toolkit to revive the macro economy and preserve financial stability while
adhering to the inflation target.
