**Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting October 7 to 9, 2020**

**[Under Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934]**

The twenty fifth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted
under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from
October 7 to 9, 2020.

2. The meeting was attended by all the members – Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Senior

Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal,
Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai;

Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad;
Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated
by the Central Board under Section 45ZB (2) (c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act,
1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy –
and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. Dr. Shashanka Bhide,
Dr. Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma joined the meeting through video
conference.

3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the

Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the
Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which
shall include the following, namely:

(a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee;
(b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such
member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and

(c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under subsection (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting.

4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge

consumer confidence, households’ inflation expectations, corporate sector

performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and
infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also
reviewed in detail staff’s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios
around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive
discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is
set out below.

**Resolution**

5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic

situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (October 9,
2020) decided to:


-----

    - keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF)

unchanged at 4.0 per cent.

Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at
3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25
per cent.

    - The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long

as necessary – at least during the current financial year and into the next
financial year – to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the
impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains
within the target going forward.

These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of
+/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.


The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.


**Assessment**

_Global Economy_

6. Incoming data point to a recovery in global economic activity in Q3 of 2020 in

sequential terms, although downside risks have risen with the renewed surge in
infections in many countries. Global trade is expected to be subdued. The rebound
could turn out to be stronger among advanced economies (AEs) than in emerging
market economies (EMEs). Global financial markets remain supported by highly
accommodative monetary and liquidity conditions. Soft fuel prices and weak
aggregate demand have kept inflation below target in AEs, although in some EMEs,
supply disruptions have imparted upward price pressures.

_Domestic Economy_

7. On the domestic front, high frequency indicators suggest that economic

activity is stabilising in Q2:2020-21 after the 23.9 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y)
decline in real GDP in Q1 (April-June). Cushioned by government spending and rural
demand, manufacturing – especially consumer non-durables – and some categories
of services, such as passenger vehicles and railway freight, have gradually recovered
in Q2. The outlook for agriculture is robust. With merchandise exports slowly catching
up to pre-COVID levels and some moderation in the pace of contraction of imports,
the trade deficit widened marginally sequentially in Q2.

8. Headline CPI inflation increased to 6.7 per cent during July-August 2020 as

pressures accentuated across food, fuel and core constituents on account of supply
disruptions, higher margins and taxes. One year ahead inflation expectations of
households suggest some softening in inflation from three months ahead levels.
Selling prices of firms remain muted, reflecting the weak demand conditions.

9. Domestic financial conditions have eased substantially, with systemic liquidity

remaining in large surplus. Reserve money increased by 13.5 per cent on a year-onyear basis (as on October 2, 2020), driven by a surge in currency demand
(21.5 per cent). Growth in money supply (M3), however, was contained at 12.2 per
cent as on September 25, 2020. Banks’ non-food credit growth remains subdued.
India’s foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 545.6 billion on October 2, 2020.


-----

**Outlook**

10. Turning to the outlook for inflation, kharif sowing portends well for food prices.

Pressures on prices of key vegetables like tomatoes, onions and potatoes should
also ebb by Q3 with kharif arrivals. On the other hand, prices of pulses and oilseeds
are likely to remain firm due to elevated import duties. International crude oil prices
have traded with a softening bias in September on a weak demand outlook, but
domestic pump prices may remain elevated in the absence of any roll back of taxes.
Pricing power of firms remains weak in the face of subdued demand.
COVID-19-related supply disruptions, including labour shortages and high
transportation costs, could continue to impose cost-push pressures, but these risks
are getting mitigated by progressive easing of lockdowns and removal of restrictions
on inter-state movements. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is
projected at 6.8 per cent for Q2:2020-21, at 5.4-4.5 per cent for H2:2020-21 and
4.3 per cent for Q1:2021-22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).

11. Turning to the growth outlook, the recovery in the rural economy is expected to

strengthen further, while the turnaround in urban demand is likely to be lagged in
view of social distancing norms and the elevated number of COVID-19 infections.
While the contact-intensive services sector will take time to regain pre-COVID levels,
manufacturing firms expect capacity utilisation to recover in Q3:2020-21 and activity
to gain some traction from Q4 onwards. Both private investment and exports are
likely to be subdued, especially as external demand is still anaemic. Taking into
consideration the above factors and the uncertain COVID-19 trajectory, real GDP
growth in 2020-21 is expected to be negative at (-)9.5 per cent, with risks tilted to the
downside: (-)9.8 per cent in Q2:2020-21; (-)5.6 per cent in Q3; and 0.5 per cent in
Q4. Real GDP growth for Q1:2021-22 is placed at 20.6 per cent (Chart 2).

12. The MPC is of the view that revival of the economy from an unprecedented

COVID-19 pandemic assumes the highest priority in the conduct of monetary policy.
While inflation has been above the tolerance band for several months, the MPC
judges that the underlying factors are essentially supply shocks which should
dissipate over the ensuing months as the economy unlocks, supply chains are
restored, and activity normalises. Accordingly, they can be looked through at this
juncture while setting the stance of monetary policy. Taking into account all these
factors, the MPC decides to maintain status quo on the policy rate in this meeting and
await the easing of inflationary pressures to use the space available for supporting
growth further.

13. All members of the MPC – Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal,

Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri
Shaktikanta Das – unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged
and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth
on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while
ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. Dr. Shashanka Bhide,
Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri
Shaktikanta Das voted to continue with this accommodative stance at least during the
current financial year and into the next financial year, with Prof. Jayanth R. Varma
voting against this formulation.

14. The minutes of the MPC’s meeting will be published by October 23, 2020.

**Statement by Dr. Shashanka Bhide**

15. Two key goals from the monetary policy perspective at the present juncture, in

which output growth has declined sharply and inflation pressures remain, are
enabling sustained recovery of the economy and moderation in inflation rate.

16. The policy rates were left unchanged in the meeting of the MPC held on

August 4-6, 2020 after a cumulative reduction of 115 basis points in rates between
January and May 2020 in view of the prevailing modest GDP growth rate. The MPC
policy statement of August 2020 reflected the concerns on the economic outlook as
the COVID-19 pandemic began to take its toll.

17. The contraction in GDP in Q1: 2020-21, year-on-year basis, by 23.9 per cent,

is a severe shock to the economy affecting employment and income. The decline in
economic output is reflected in both production and expenditure accounts across
most components. The Gross Value Added declined in all the non-farm sectors and
in the case of demand, contraction in Private Final Consumption Expenditure and
Gross Fixed Capital Formation was sharp. The only major component of demand that
showed growth was Government Final Consumption Expenditure. Both exports and
imports of goods and services declined, with imports declining more than the decline
in exports. In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, the extensive restrictions on the
movement of goods and services barring the essential needs, imposed from the last
week of March-May saw gradual relaxation from June onwards but a full economic
recovery will require adjustments in the production and supply processes to control
the spread of the disease. The recovery process will also be affected by the dynamic
of the pandemic across the country as regional variations would also affect supply
chains.

18. The present status of the impact of the pandemic suggests that there has

been reduction in the daily new cases and mortalities due to COVID-19 towards the

end of September but these numbers are large and the potential for an increase
cannot be ignored. This would mean that relaxation of movement restrictions would
help restore production, but the process would be gradual and subject to the
measures that would be taken by the producers, providers of services and the
consumers to control the spread of the virus.

19. Restoration of the supply side of the economy in a manner that is safe for the

workers and the consumers is necessary for sustained economic recovery. There will
be a need for changes in transportation and work places to mitigate the risks
associated with the transmission of Covid 19.

20. The relative immunity of agriculture from the supply shocks may have been

partly a result of the fact that the virus spread initially in urban areas and there were
immediate efforts to limit the spread. The supply chains for the key food commodities
were also exempted from transport restrictions, leading to sustenance of supply of
these commodities.

21. There are indeed constraints that need to be addressed to restore the health

of the firms that have lost revenues and returns. Access to credit to revive and
expand production and markets is one of the essential factors in this regard. Bank
lending rates to the productive sectors including housing have declined and a robust
revival, however, would depend on the revival of demand. The weak demand
conditions are also reflected in the decline in non-food bank credit upto September in
2020-21 over the previous year. Revival of consumer demand would require
restoration of confidence in the safety in participation in normal economic activities
and availability of health care. Public investment in improving infrastructure to
achieve these goals would help build consumer confidence.

22. The current account balance, foreign capital flows and forex reserves position

indicate relative stability in the external sector under a low demand equilibrium in
both domestic and global markets. The depressed investment demand conditions are
also reflected in the dampened state of demand for capital and weak growth in bank
credit to non-food sector.

23. The fiscal position of the governments - both Centre and the States - is under

pressure as the tax revenues have declined. The governments will be required to
maintain their spending levels to meet the extraordinary demands to support
livelihoods and lives in the present conditions.
24. Continued weakness in demand conditions would put greater stress on fiscal

position and also the financial system.

25. The broad indicators of economic activity in the recent months suggest a

revival from the sharp decline in Q1. Some of this improvement is on account of
relaxation of movement restrictions, opportunities in sectors such as the pharma
industry, and the requirement of critical inputs such as fertilisers. The more general
pickup in activities is reflected in the expectation of improvement in capacity
utilisation and perceptions of improved demand conditions in the recent surveys of
enterprises reported by RBI.

26. The GDP will see sustained revival beginning from the second quarter of the

year, with the rate of contraction from the levels of previous year declining steadily.
As indicated in the MPC Resolution, the GDP growth is expected to be positive in
Q4: 2020-21, although for the year as a whole, the growth rate is projected to be

conducted by RBI in September 2020 yields a median forecast of -9.1 per cent for the
year 2020-21 and an assessment by NCAER’s Quarterly Review of the Economy
places the GDP growth for 2020-21 at -12.6 per cent. Going forward into Q2 to
Q4: 2020-21 these projections imply recovery in the economic activities from the
large initial negative shock in Q1.

27. On the price front, the CPI inflation has stayed above 6.5%, Y-o-Y basis during

July-August 2020. This is above the tolerance band of the inflation target set for the
monetary policy. The food inflation averaged 8.4% during the same period and CPI
based inflation rate for items excluding food and fuel was 5.6%. The food inflation will
remain a concern as it is often driven by the perishable produce like vegetables,
which cannot be controlled in the short term except by removing bottlenecks in the
supply chain upto the retail level or additional fresh supplies. As noted in MPC
Resolution, inflation is expected to moderate in Q3 and Q4: 2020-21. Two of the main
drivers of price inflation on the supply side now are food and fuel. In the case of food,
the favourable monsoon rains support the prospects of good harvest and its
moderating impact on food inflation. The global conditions for crude petroleum prices
appear stable from here onwards till the end of 2020-21.

28. There are clearly uncertainties facing the growth and inflation projections.

There is also uncertainty over the speed with which the Covid-19 pandemic is
brought under control, which also affects growth and inflation scenarios in the next
2-3 quarters. Towards the end of Q2, there are indications of revival of the economy
after the relaxation of restrictions on transportation and businesses across the
country. As supply chains adapt to the new conditions, recovery is expected to be
stronger and sustained. To achieve this outcome, an accommodative monetary policy
is needed at this juncture. Moderation in upward cost pressures on prices and decline
in food inflation rates would require a quick output recovery from the supply side
measures.

29. The outlook for growth and inflation for the next 3-4 quarters suggests the

need for a policy environment enabling recovery of output. The inflationary pressures
are a concern but present assessment reflects moderating inflationary pressures in
the remaining quarters of the year.

30. Therefore, I vote for retaining the current policy rates and continuation of

accommodative stance of monetary policy as long as necessary to revive growth on
a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring
that inflation remains within the target going forward. I also vote to continue with this
accommodative stance at least during the current financial year and into the next
financial year.

**Statement by Dr. Ashima Goyal**

31. The MPC’s objectives are to meet its medium-run inflation target while

supporting growth. Growth has fallen steeply while inflation is also above target. The
question of what can revive growth as well as reduce inflation is best examined in the
context of India’s macroeconomic structure.

32. COVID-19 led to crash in demand as well as disrupted domestic supply

chains. As, under gradual unlocks, the latter revive while infections reduce, the
supply-side is recovering. The heavy rains raised food prices but also promise a
bountiful crop. Over the longer term, structural food surpluses, agricultural reforms
and global changes in oil demand and supply can be expected to keep commodity

prices soft. Reform is also reducing obstacles that raise production costs in India.
Therefore, inflation can be expected to moderate. Research shows commodity price
shocks and credible RBI guidance to be major determinants of inflation expectations.

33. India’s many youthful entrants to the labour force as well as migration to

higher productivity jobs suggest it has an elastic supply curve but it is one that is
subject to upward shocks[1]. Apart from supply-side features that raise costs, shocks
include inflation expectations and changes in exchange rates. Moderating these
shocks is the most effective way to reduce inflation in India.

34. Monetary-financial conditions have a relatively greater impact on aggregate

demand and output growth while the composition of government expenditure and
taxation affects costs. An elastic supply curve implies a demand squeeze has little
impact on inflation but creates a large output loss. Moreover, excessive tightness
hurts financial stability as much as excessive stimulus does. Necessary reforms over
the last decade have improved the credit culture, governance, diversity and
robustness in the financial system and conditions are ripe for a turnaround.
COVID-19 creates an opportunity for a reversal of tight financial conditions[2].

35. COVID-19 also creates uncertainty and precautionary hoarding of liquidity and

savings. Therefore demand is now a greater constraint than supply. That inflation
exceeds the MPC target when demand has crashed much below potential output
suggests lockdown related shocks have pushed up the supply curve. This should
reverse as lockdowns ease. That CPI inflation is much higher than WPI for the same
items points to issues in retail supply. The CPI itself needs to be rebased to more
accurately reflect the lower share of food in the consumption basket. Since the output
gap is already so large, reducing demand and increasing the gap further cannot be
the way to reduce inflation. Firms do tend to raise mark-ups to cover fixed costs when
capacity utilization falls but reducing utilization further will only raise costs more.

36. Although in normal times India’s correctly estimated interest elasticity of

demand is high, during crisis times it is difficult to induce more spending just through
higher liquidity and lower interest rates. Fiscal deficits have risen countercyclically as
tax revenues fell with the lockdowns. Even so, there is scope for further prudent
expansion of government spending to boost demand and trigger private spending to
raise growth. The expenditure should ideally be designed to relieve supply-side
constraints. The ex-post fiscal deficit ratio falls as growth raises the denominator and
rising tax revenues reduce the numerator.

37. Financing short-term rise in deficits requires keeping the cost of government

borrowing low. Central banks worldwide are taking such actions. The monetary policy
resolution committing to benign financial conditions for as long as it takes for revival
will help both public and private borrowing and spending. Active and innovative steps,
including counter-cyclical macro-prudential regulation, can improve incentives for
appropriate action, allay fears, reduce risk aversion, make liquidity more widely
available, improve transmission and bring down interest rate spreads.

38. Mitigating the impact of the unprecedented global health crisis has priority. It is

important, however, there is neither over-reaction nor untimely reversal. Excess

stimulus after the global financial crisis resulted in excess tightening in the decade
that followed. Policy should aim for balance and use available space when it would
be most effective. Forward-looking actions are aiming to be state-contingent,
carefully calibrated to the evolving situation and to incoming data. Early measures
required during the lockdown have been successfully reversed. For example,
moratoria given have ended without major adverse impacts on borrowers or the
financial system. Banks now do risk-based lending and the credit guarantee from the
government allows private banks also to lend to MSMEs. Targeted restructuring and
freer movement of liquidity through the economy will help firms survive, so that
persistent damage is avoided and the economy recovers faster.

39. Inflation is at present above the target band although it is expected to come

down. Therefore no change in the policy rate itself is appropriate while awaiting the
impacts of on-going supply-side improvement, as well as for uncertainty around
COVID-19 to dissipate. I therefore vote to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and
also to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary – at least
during the current financial year and into the next financial year – to revive growth,
mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation
remains within the target going forward. The accommodative stance and the benign
financial conditions it makes possible, together with the assurance it will not be
reversed until the economy recovers, will support growth. The repo rate pause
together with inflation guidance given will contribute to anchoring inflation
expectations.

**Statement by Prof. Jayanth R. Varma**

40. I have agonized a great deal about dissenting (in part) with a resolution on a

narrow technicality when I am in agreement with the spirit of the resolution: am I
making a mountain out of a molehill and creating unnecessary confusion? After
prolonged deliberation, I have come to the conclusion that a dissent may be painful,
but it is more consistent with the obligation of MPC members to express their views
independently and candidly. Even when a disagreement is more philosophical than
operative, it should not always be relegated to the individual statement; I see some
merit in occasionally elevating it to a dissent.

41. My preferred formulation of the forward guidance would have been as follows:

“The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is
necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy,
while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. The MPC
expects to maintain a low policy rate and an accommodative stance during the
current financial year and well into the next financial year.”

42. It differs from the actual MPC resolution in two respects. First, in my

formulation, the date based forward guidance is not a decision but an expectation. In
a world that is full of unpleasant surprises, the MPC must of necessity be data driven.
Covid-19 was an example of a totally unanticipated growth shock that came out of
nowhere. If a similarly unforeseeable inflation shock were to hit the economy, I find it
hard to believe that the MPC will remain accommodative. In practice, I suspect that
the word “decided” only means an intention to remain accommodative as long as
realized outcomes do not diverge drastically from what is currently expected. I am
firmly of the view that the MPC risks a damage to its credibility when it uses words
that do not accurately reflect what it means. I therefore disagree with the choice of
the word “decided” when it comes to the date based forward guidance in the MPC

l ti


-----

43. Second, my formulation is for a somewhat longer period and explicitly refers to

interest rates. In my view, the principal motivation for the forward guidance is the fact
that India has one of the steepest yield curves in the world. The Indian yield curve is
extremely steep beyond a maturity of about a year: in the short term segment (1-2
years), the intermediate term segment (2-5 years) and the long term segment (5-10
years). However, in the money market segment (up to a maturity of nearly one year),
the yield curve is close to the reverse repo rate of 3.35% (which is the effective policy
rate today because of the liquidity support). To have the desired impact, it is
desirable that the forward guidance extend beyond the one year horizon at which the
steepness of the yield curve sets in. Forward guidance of six months in the MPC
resolution is in my view suboptimal. I would also point out that the weakness of
investments in the Indian economy predates the Covid-19 pandemic, and this merits
a longer term response that goes beyond six months.

44. One of the hallmarks of a credible inflation targeting regime is a substantial

compression of the inflation risk premium. If the market expects inflation to average
close to the target rate of inflation, then, by definition, inflation risk is low and
consequently the inflation risk premium should also be very small. What remains is
essentially the liquidity risk premium which cannot explain the extraordinary
steepness of the Indian yield curve.

45. It appears to me that the steep yield curve reflects a lack of credibility of the

MPC’s existing accommodative guidance. The introduction of dated guidance in the
MPC resolution is an attempt to solve this problem, and my only difficulty with this
solution is the word “decided”. Just as the brakes allow the car to travel faster, the
MPC’s guidance will be more effective if it works alongside and not in conflict with its
inflation fighting resolve. I prefer the word “expected” because it would preserve the
commitment of the MPC to respond aggressively to inflation shocks that lie well
above the upper band of the fan chart (Chart 1 of the Monetary Policy Statement).

46. I believe that excessively high long term rates are inflicting damage to the

economy in two ways. First, a significant part of the easing of policy rates is not being
transmitted to longer term rates that form the benchmark for corporate borrowing and
investment decisions. Excessive long term rates exacerbate the collapse of
investments in the economy. Second, high long term rates cause an appreciation of
the real effective exchange rate by stimulating foreign capital inflows into our bond
markets at a time when the collapse of investment has caused the current account to
swing into surplus.

47. A sharp reduction in long term rates is therefore important. On the other hand,

with short term rates already at 3.35%, the incremental benefits of a furthering
lowering of this rate in the current macroeconomic environment are relatively low and
not commensurate with the risks. So I support maintaining the policy rate at its
current level. I also support the accommodative stance and liquidity support that drive
short term rates towards the reverse repo rate rather than the repo rate.

**Statement by Dr. Mridul K. Saggar**

48. At the time of the August MPC, while noting that monetary policy was being

framed under large data and forecast uncertainties, I had also indicated that growth
could fall more and, inflation less, than the consensus estimates that prevailed at that
point. Market consensus has since moved significantly. Survey of Professional

cent in August and headline inflation to fall to 4.2 per cent in Q4:2020-21, up from 3.0
per cent. The baseline projections in the MPC resolution place growth at (-)9.5 per
cent and headline inflation at 5.4-4.5 per cent in H2:2020-21 and 4.3 per cent for
Q1:2021-22. The latest projections reaffirm that inflation will fall in line with the target,
while growth has plummeted, thus decidedly shifting the growth-inflation policy tradeoff in favour of supporting growth within the flexible inflation targeting paradigm.

49. During Q1:2020-21, the economy faced its deepest contraction ever, which

was also the worst amongst G20 countries. Despite marked sequential improvements
in high frequency indicators of real activity, many of them are yet to normalise to their
pre-pandemic levels that were already sub-par as the economy had slowed to a
11-year low in 2019-20. The GDP is likely to contract close to double-digit mark in
Q2:2020-21. A range of model-based exercises, as well as my judgment
superimposed on these, suggest that output gap in terms of levels of GDP will close
only towards the end of 2021-22, even though a technical rebound is likely to push
the economy to above average growth in that year on a low base. Investment, that
typically comprise about a third of real aggregate demand, contracted 47 per cent in
Q1:2020-21. With seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation for surveyed manufacturing
firms dropping to 48 per cent in Q1:2020-21, the large slack already visible in 201920 has deepened further. As such, investment may take time to recover. Moving
ahead, there is tough row to hoe requiring acorns to be fed in the form of
complementary actions to support recovery to trend growth in the coming years.

50. Though inflation is currently above the upper tolerance band, it is not monetary

in nature. Supply disruption in food, increase in taxes on fuel and liquor, and surge in
gold prices catalysed by risk-off has lifted inflation. Ex-food, ‘fuel and light’, gold and
‘pan, tobacco and intoxicants’, inflation stands at 4.4 per cent, _i.e. 2.3 percentage_
points lower than the headline inflation. In my view, headline inflation should start
softening from October. Apart from favourable base effects, the unlocking has picked
speed and would significantly reduce supply chain bottlenecks causing both
agriculture and non-agricultural prices to correct. Monsoon risks to inflation have
dissipated. Cumulative rainfall has been 9 per cent above long period average with
its temporal and spatial distribution satisfactory. Area sown under _Kharif has_
expanded by 4.8 per cent. Reservoir levels are 15 per cent above last 10-year
average, lifting up _Rabi prospects. The First Advance Estimates of_ _Kharif point to_
substantial increase in output of crops like pulses, oilseeds and sugarcane that can
have a salutary effect on food and processed food prices and leave enough margin of
error for possible subsequent downward revisions in data. With marked increase in
area sown under foodgrains, alongside the buffer of food stock at double the norms,
prices should soften. Vegetable prices that have exhibited persistence at elevated
levels due to weather-related disturbances should also correct starting December.
With resumption of businesses by small poultry, high prices in protein items should
witness some correction. As yet, there are no signs of generalisation of relative price
shock from food items and agriculture and rural wage inflation has stayed muted.

51. The current high retail margins have prevailed as consumers avoid scouting

for cheaper prices amidst social distancing. The phenomenon of such less
competitive markets have been observed in past pandemics as well, such as the one
that contributed to the Eisenhower recession in the United States. However, the
unlock intensity now matches the lockdown stringency and with new confirmed
Covid-19 cases starting to decline in recent weeks, unless there is strong second
wave, supply chains should get near normalised as early as end of the current
calendar year, setting off price corrections. However, demand will take time to

corporate pricing power is unlikely to recover, though upside risks to inflation remain
from possible collusive behaviour in less competitive industries, as also further
unforeseen supply disruptions in food. As a baseline, headline should converge to
core inflation, with both softening.

52. Three macro-financial risks currently concern me that have implications for

monetary policy. First, if growth contractions stay for long, the hysteresis or scarring
that has been substantially arrested by nimble-footed policy actions could stage a
comeback creating renewed feedback loops within public, corporate and bank
balance sheets that would impact the stock of debt as well as fiscal and savinginvestment balances. If this happens, recovering potential output, some of which may
be lost to hysteresis, will take longer. It will also push the neutral interest rate lower
than before. Despite front-loaded action, monetary policy should, therefore, stay
accommodative. The fiscal restraint observed so far provides some room for it.
However, with term spreads already widening above historical levels in 2019-20 and
in H1:2020-21 on back of widening fiscal gap that has necessitated larger
government borrowing programmes, the unpleasant arithmetic is evident in supplies
of papers more than doubling in two years. Consequently, the yield curve slope is
hardly a predictor of growth or expected inflation. This is not unique to India and term
spreads have been higher and have widened much more during current pandemic in
many other emerging markets due to pro-cyclical nature of fiscal policies that leave
little counter-cyclical space. As typically fiscal authorities have a first mover
advantage in the game of chickens, monetary policy will naturally have to factor this
in its stance to avert Nash equilibria as a pure strategy. In this milieu, monetary and
liquidity easing in India has effectively kept government market borrowing costs at a
16-year low with attendant benefits for funding costs that are obvious but hard to
quantify precisely in absence of counterfactual.

53. Second, if current real negative interest rates fall further, it may generate

significant distortions that could adversely affect aggregate savings, current account
and medium-term growth in the economy. With retail fixed deposit rates currently
ranging between 4.90-5.50 per cent for tenors of 1-year or more and the headline
inflation prevailing above that for some months now, there has been a negative carry
for savers. While expected future inflation is lower and leaves some policy room, it is
prudent to hold policy rates for now.

54. Third concern relates to interactions between monetary policy and financial

stability, which could intensify further, especially later into next year. Though low for
long interest rates risk build-up of corporate and household leverage, unprecedented
contraction entails policy-trade-offs imparting primacy to rebuilding consumer and
business confidence over the next 2-3 quarters by taking some policy uncertainty out
of their decisions. In this milieu, forward guidance can play an important role.

55. Considering all the above, I vote for leaving the policy rate unchanged. Further

considering that output gap may close only towards the end of 2021-22 and that,
going forward, the demand destruction caused by the pandemic, coupled with
improvements in logistic networks of production and distribution, may exert significant
downward pressure on headline and core inflation, I vote for the accommodative
stance and the forward guidance provided in the resolution.

economy inflicted by COVID-19. If the NSO’s provisional estimates for Q2 that are
expected at the end of November corroborate at least the direction of these
forecasts, India has entered a technical recession in the first half of the year for the
first time in its history. GDP is an aggregative indicator of economic activity and hides
the extent of human misery and the loss of social and human capital caused by the
health crisis. Nonetheless, if the projections hold, the level of GDP would have fallen
approximately 6 per cent below its pre-COVID level by the end of 2020-21 and it may
take years to regain this lost output. There is also an anecdotal sense that the
economy’s potential output has fallen, and the post-COVID growth trajectory will look
very different from what has been recorded so far. Changes in social behaviour and
norms of commercial and workplace engagements may accentuate this structural
change.

57. Progressive unlocking of the economy has brought people out of isolation and

some high frequency indicators into the green. While this has raised optimism about
the much-awaited recovery, perhaps, pragmatic caution is warranted. The COVID
curve is arching inwards, from the cities where infections had hitherto festered, into
interior regions. The fear of a second wave looms over India; already it has forced
lockdowns across Europe, Israel and Indonesia, and India, with the second highest
caseload of infections and over-stretched healthcare infrastructure, cannot be
immune. In the absence of intrinsic drivers, the recovery may last only until pent-up
demand has been satiated and replenishment of inventories has been completed.
Empirical evidence suggests that consumption-led recoveries are shallow and shortlived. Exports could be a driver, but with the WTO’s latest projection of a decline in
world trade volume by 9.2 per cent in 2020, the role of exports in powering a durable
revival is likely to be circumscribed. This underscores the critical role of investment in
engineering the turnaround in the economy and sustaining it over the medium-term.
Depressed capacity utilisation in manufacturing, inventory overhang in residential
housing, impaired balance sheets of corporates and financial institutions, and
pervasive business pessimism are combining to create formidable drags on
investment sentiment. Consequently, an investment-less recovery is doomed to be
ephemeral. Policy intervention accordingly assumes a vital role. Illustratively, public
investment can play both a gap-fill and crowding-in role. Monetary policy can
engender favourable financing conditions by lowering the cost of capital and by
narrowing risk spreads on financial instruments.

58. In the current milieu, however, both monetary policy and fiscal policy in India

face tightening constraints, some idiosyncratic. For fiscal policy, it is the collapse of
tax revenue – by 32 per cent in the first quarter; consequently, the centre’s revenue
deficit during April-August is 121.9 per cent of budget estimates. For monetary policy,
it is the persistence of headline inflation above 6 per cent for the third month in
succession. Structural reforms to unlock growth impulses are needed, but may lack
social traction in an atmosphere of depressed growth and employment, and high
uncertainty.

59. In the context of headline inflation ruling above the upper tolerance limit of the

target since June 2020, the role of monetary policy has come under scrutiny. It has
been argued that while inflationary pressures may emerge from supply bottlenecks
and cost pushes, inflation cannot become generalised and persistent unless it
becomes a monetary phenomenon, _i.e., it is accommodated by an increase in_
aggregate demand as reflected in an expansion of money supply or by a decrease in
policy interest rates. Monetary policy has adopted an ultra-accommodative stance to
revive growth and mitigate the effects of COVID-19. Liquidity operations in support of

expansion of 17.6 per cent adjusted for the first-round effects of cash reserve ratio
changes. This has, however, not translated into a commensurate increase in money
supply because of a money multiplier depressed by a sharp increase in the currencydeposit ratio, and remunerated reserves parked in reverse repo with the RBI over
and above CRR requirements. Consequently, the rate of money supply is averaging
12 per cent in nominal terms and only 6 per cent in real terms. In terms of quarterly
seasonally adjusted annualised rates, a negative money gap has opened up recently.

60. In a quarterly vector auto regression (VAR) framework, money supply and

policy rate reductions together contribute only 4 per cent of the deviation of inflation
from its target. The contribution of supply shocks from food and fuel prices account
for 71 per cent of inflation deviations in the first half of 2020-21, followed by 28 per
cent from unanchored inflation expectations (deviations of trend inflation from target).
Changes in exchange rates and asset prices together contribute a little less than 12
per cent. Inflation is pulled down by 15 per cent by the negative demand shock from
COVID-19.

61. Under these conditions, it is essential for monetary policy to remain

accommodative and opportunistically exploit the headroom that opens up when
inflation recedes, as it is projected in the second half of 2020-21. Three aspects need
to be emphasised. First, it is important to separate false starts from durable growth
drivers. In this context, all efforts need to be trained on the revival of investment.
Second, in the evolving situation in which monetary policy is committed to an
accommodative stance, it is necessary to monitor inflation dynamics closely for signs
of generalization and persistence. For this purpose, all indicators of aggregate
demand, including monetary and credit aggregates, warrant continuous examination
for inflation impulses. Third, with unprecedented contractions in economic activity and
elevated inflation posing a razor’s edge trade-off fraught with uncertainty, forward
guidance has to be clear and decisive. The stance of policy conveys forward
guidance on the future trajectory of short-term interest rates, which is well within the
MPC’s remit. On this, therefore, communication has to be unambiguous and, given
the evolving situation, specific in order to anchor expectations.

62. I vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and for retaining the accommodative

stance of policy as set out in the MPC’s resolution.

**Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das**

63. After the sharpest contraction in economic activity in Q1:2020-21, a number of

high frequency indicators of economic activity for Q2:2020-21 indicate a sequential
improvement. The recovery in all likelihood would be led by rural demand. In urban
areas too, there are indications of an uptick in consumption demand with passenger
vehicles emerging out of contraction in August, rebound in GST e-way bills to prepandemic levels, sequential improvement in GST revenues in September and a
steady improvement in PMI manufacturing and services.

64. Accordingly, the recovery is expected to be multi-speed depending on sectoral

realities. Forward looking surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank are also
indicating a sequential firming up of the recovery. Households expect an
improvement in general economic situation, employment and income over a one year
ahead horizon. Capacity utilisation saw some improvement in Q2:2020-21 and a
further pick-up is expected from Q3 onwards. Manufacturers expect expansion in
production volumes and new orders to continue through Q1:2021-22. Business

65. There are, however, downside uncertainties that could put sand in the wheels

of this nascent recovery. Primary among them is the risk of a second wave of
COVID-19. Private investment activity is likely to be subdued, even as domestic
financial conditions have eased significantly. External demand is expected to remain
anaemic with sharp contraction in global economic activity and trade. Overall, we
expect a likely reduction in the rate of contraction in GDP during Q2:2020-21 and a
return to positive growth by Q4:2020-21. Despite sequential improvement in Q3 and
Q4, the full year GDP is expected to contract by 9.5 per cent with a strong rebound
next year.

66. Inflation remained above the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent since

June, with signs of aggravation of price pressures. The surge in inflation in India in
recent period is in stark contrast with the experience of other major emerging market
economies (EMEs) where inflation moderated relative to pre-lockdown period.
Adverse supply side factors along with increase in retail margins continue to impinge
on food and non-food components of CPI. Food (with a weight of around 46 per cent
in overall CPI) contributed disproportionately at around 60 per cent to the surge in
inflation. In addition, costs of doing business have gone up due to additional
sanitisation related expenditures, social distancing norms and labour shortfalls.

67. On the outlook for inflation, food inflation should moderate going forward on a

combination of good kharif harvest and a favourable rabi season. Households polled
by the Reserve Bank expect 3-month ahead inflation expectations to somewhat
soften. As economic activity further normalises and supplies are restored, cost push
price pressures faced by firms are likely to dissipate. However, should supply side
shocks, especially to food persist, they can destabilise inflation expectations. Overall,
in our assessment, headline inflation would moderate in H2 of the current year and
further in Q1 of next fiscal year.

68. The Reserve Bank’s proactive management of liquidity through both

conventional and unconventional measures, amounting to ₹12.3 lakh crore or 6.1 per
cent of nominal GDP of 2019-20, has helped to keep systemic liquidity in abundance
and easy financial conditions reflected in the narrowing of term and risk premia in
various market segments. During March-August 2020, monetary transmission
improved significantly reflecting the combined impact of surplus liquidity and
enhanced coverage of the external benchmark-based pricing of loans. However,
despite continued guidance of accommodative stance as long as necessary and
ample surplus liquidity, the financial markets remained somewhat nervous and at
variance with our expectations. The market participants were also concerned about
the stance going forward.

69. Monetary policy works through financial markets which serve as the conduit of

transmitting policy signals to the real economy. For seamless propagation of policy
impulses, it is necessary that the monetary authority’s policy intent is clearly
understood by market participants so that there are no expectational mismatches
between the two. Accordingly, MPC should strengthen its forward guidance by
indicating that the accommodative stance would continue as long as necessary - at
least during the current financial year and into the next financial year - to revive
growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy,
while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. This enhanced
guidance should strengthen and quicken the pace of transmission to longer-term
yields and help support consumption and investment demand in the economy. Higher

would help improve supplies and alleviate supply bottlenecks and also contribute to
softening of inflation.

70. Monetary policy at this stage has to provide adequate support to ensure a

robust revival of the economy from the devastating effects of COVID-19, while at the
same time ensuring that any persistence of elevated inflation does not lead to
unanchoring of inflation expectations. With the supply side disruptions that are seen
to drive the current inflationary pressures likely to be transient and wane out in
months ahead as economy normalises, there is merit in looking through the current
high levels of inflation and persevere with the accommodative stance for monetary
policy as long as necessary to revive growth on a durable basis. Moreover, taking
into account the projected moderation in inflation and the large output loss, I vote to
keep the policy rate unchanged at present and continue with the accommodative
stance, during the current financial year and into the next financial year, at the least.
This would help to reduce uncertainty and market volatility. This would also enhance
confidence in the monetary policy resolve to support the growth recovery process
while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. I recognise that there exists
space for future rate cuts if the inflation evolves in line with our expectations. This
space needs to be used judiciously to support recovery in growth. Meanwhile the
ongoing transmission of past monetary policy actions would help ease financial
conditions further.
