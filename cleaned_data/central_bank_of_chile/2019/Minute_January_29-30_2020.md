#### 1. Analysis of the technical teams

**International scenario**

Recent international data had increased the possibility for the world economy
to experience a sharper-than-expected slowdown, in a context of persistent
volatility in the financial markets and where political and financial risks remained
fully in force. In the developed world, economic expectations had deteriorated.
Inflation had moderated in most countries, largely due to the oil price drop of the
last quarter of 2018. In this scenario, some external risks had gained strength.
The uncertainty surrounding the Brexit had intensified, with little time left for
the parties to reach an agreement before the deadline of the actual departure.
In China, there were doubts concerning the magnitude that the slowdown of
activity could achieve and the effectiveness of its stimulus policies, coupled
with medium-term risks that might continue to incubate. Meanwhile, the trade


conflict between the US and China showed no major advances, beyond the fact
that the market was still awaiting the possible results of their bilateral talks.

In terms of activity, the conjunctural data and economic outlook of the Eurozone
were still moderating and posting lower figures than the market expected,
raising doubts going forward. In November, annual growth in manufacturing
output had dwindled across the entire bloc. Purchasing managers’ indexes
(PMI) for manufacturing and services continued to decline towards neutrality
and consumer confidence had weakened somewhat in recent months. In the
US, incoming data remained dynamic, with a still tight labor market that
was sustaining consumption in the short term. However, market investment
prospects for 2019 had declined further.

In the emerging world, China’s GDP had grown 6.4% y-o-y in the fourth
quarter, still on a path of gradual deceleration. December’s exports and imports
had contracted in annual terms and the manufacturing outlook was below the
expansion-indicator pivot. In this context, the Chinese authorities had continued
to announce and implement stimulus measures to stabilize the economy into
the near future. Latin American data was mixed. Brazil showed improvement
in industrial and consumer confidence, while announcements were expected
regarding structural reforms that would sustain the fiscal accounts. In Mexico,
the economic proposal focused on fiscal responsibility had calmed the markets.
Argentina had officially entered a recession in the third quarter of 2018 and
partial figures for the fourth quarter pointed to a new contraction.

In this context, the main central banks had attenuated the restrictive character
of their monetary policy communication. In addition to its direct effect on shortterm interest rates, the change in tone in the communication had had effects on
the prices of different assets, including reductions in long-term interest rates and
partial recoveries in the stock markets, after their poor performance of the latter
months of 2018. This had also driven capital flows towards the emerging world.

Commodity prices had shown mixed movements since the December monetary
policy meeting. Brent and WTI oil prices had risen around 1% each, mainly
because of production cuts being applied by OPEC countries and other
important producers. The copper price had receded nearly 5%, largely because
of concerns about the Chinese economy’s slowdown and a global scenario that
pointed to lower demand. In parallel with this policy meeting, the FOMC’s
meeting was taking place, after which it decided to keep interest rates unchanged
and announced that it would be patient as it determines further adjustments,
while it would revise its plans to adjust its balance sheet.

**Domestic scenario**

Regarding local financial conditions, again the peso/dollar parity had shown
significant ups and downs, but it was not far from its level at the previous
meeting. Among the multilateral measures, the MER posted a depreciation in
the period. The real exchange rate (MER index, 1986=100) had been at 93 in
December 2018 and, using all the available information, it was estimated at
93.4 in January 2019, close to its average of the last 15 and 20 years. This, in
a context in which the local risk indicators had remained contained and the
fixed-income market interest rates had declined slightly, converging with the
global trend. The stock market (IPSA) had increased in every sector, owing
partly to the improvement in global stock markets following the reorientation
of the monetary policy statement in developed countries, but also influenced
by a recovery in the Brazilian economic outlook.

In the credit market, inflation-indexed loans had grown since the previous
meeting, in particular the consumer and commercial segments. Interest rates
were still low from a historical perspective, despite a slight increase recently.
The Banking Credit Survey for the fourth quarter of 2018 showed strengthened
demand for the different credit types, especially to large corporations, real estate
and construction companies. On the supply side, credit constraints had eased
for large companies while mortgage lending conditions had tightened somewhat.

About local activity, in line with the December Monetary Policy Report, partial
fourth-quarter figures showed that the economy had regained dynamism, having
left behind the specific factors that had slowed it down during the third quarter.
Between October and November, the Imacec had averaged 3.6% annually, from
an average y-o-y growth of 2.7% in the third quarter. The non-mining sectors
had improved their performance, where again the greater momentum of those
more related to investment, such as business services and some wholesale trade
lines, was worth noting. Also, construction had recovered recently. Mining,
after several months, had returned to positive annual expansion. With this
information, the markets’ growth expectations, as measured by the Economic
Expectations Survey, were consolidated at 4% for 2018, while for this year and
the next they were at 3.6% and 3.5%, respectively, almost unchanged since the
close of the December Report.

Domestic spending behavior was consistent with that of activity. Investment
continued to be its most dynamic component, with still optimistic prospects.
On the side of machinery and equipment, imports of capital goods were
growing strongly. In construction and other works, among other elements the


upward correction of the CBC’s Project Survey reflected that a greater number
of economic sectors had increased the number of initiatives for this and the
next few years, adding to the high flows that continued to be projected for
mining. Business expectations (IMCE), on aggregate, remained around their
neutral value. About private consumption, annual growth in the second half
of 2018 had been slower than in the first, and below forecasts, especially
regarding durables. Indicators of services consumption, in any case, suggested
that it sustained a more favorable performance. The labor market showed no
change with respect to the evaluation included in the December Monetary
Policy Report. The unemployment rate and the annual expansion of nominal
and real wages continued to be around 7%, 4% and 1%, respectively. Salaried
employment continued to slightly outpace self-employment. Consumer
expectations as measured with the IPEC had moderated. However, alternative
indicators—built on the basis of the IPEC components more highly correlated
with consumption—showed minor movements. Imports of consumer goods
persisted at high levels.

Most of the interviewees for the Business Perceptions Report of February 2019
expected their businesses to perform this year as they did last year. Many of
them responded that 2018 had closed with better results than in previous
years, although less than they initially expected. This, in a context in which,
competition among companies was still strong in general terms, they found it
difficult to adjust prices upwards and their margins were narrow. There was a
more positive perception of investment across the different regions, especially
those related to mining, forestry and salmon farming. In contrast, opinions
about consumption pointed to less dynamism, as was evident from interviews
to retail agents, among others. About the labor market, no big changes were
foreseen in the staffing of the interviewed firms and the vision remained of low
wage pressures. Cost control continued to be an important focus point for the
bulk of the companies consulted. On the credit side, lending conditions were
still seen as favorable.

December’s inflation had been at -0.1%, affected mainly by a fall in the prices of
its most volatile items. With respect to the December Report, inflation had been
somewhat below projections, mainly because of specific factors, such as lower
inflation of some typically highly volatile services. In annual terms, inflation
had fallen to 2.6% in December. By components, the annual growth rate of fuel
prices had decreased to 8% and that of fresh fruits and vegetables, to 7.8%.
Meanwhile, core inflation —CPIEFE— had risen to 2.3% annually, less than
previous projections. By components, the CPIEFE for goods exhibited a slightly
positive annual variation, while the CPIEFE for services had dropped to 3.4%.


-----

In any case, prices more sensitive to the activity-gap, such as non-regulated
utilities in the CPIEFE, continued to rise steadily. The private inflation outlook,
albeit with fluctuations and following the evolution of international fuel prices,
had decreased in the short term, standing at 2.8% annually for December of
this year. Two years ahead, they were still around 3%.

The different market expectations (i.e. from surveys to specialists and implicit
in the prices of financial assets) anticipated an increase of 25 basis points in
the monetary policy rate (MPR) at this meeting. The surveys to specialists
continued to predict that the MPR would stand at 3.5% and 4.0% one and two
years ahead, respectively. Meanwhile, the prices of financial assets remained on
a more stable trajectory with respect to the surveys and somewhat below what
they had anticipated at the December meeting, placing the policy rate in the
neighborhood of 3.25% one year ahead and somewhat above 3.5% in two years.

#### 2. Background analysis and discussion

There was debate about the evolution of the global economy, noting that although
the indicators showed slower growth than expected in Europe —particularly
Germany— and in China, the US economy maintained its growth rate in line
with projections, and a steady strengthening of its labor market. However,
concerns about the evolution of global risks and their impact on growth had
triggered a major adjustment in asset prices late last year, which had affected the
expectations in all these countries significantly and had led monetary authorities
to state that the interest rate hikes would be moderated going forward. This,
coupled with the US and Chinese governments’ willingness to negotiate their
trade issues, had brought a little more calm to the financial markets, with some
recovery in stock prices and declines in interest rates. It was mentioned that,
despite this noisier environment, the situation for emerging countries had not
changed much so far. After the capital outflows at the end of last year, calm
had returned to the markets, risk premiums had fallen and commodity prices
had tended to stabilize.

It was commented that the present economic climate had to be related to the
persistent uncertainty that was accumulating, at least since the beginning of
2017, around important economic policy decisions. All this in a context in
which the markets’ sensitivity to potentially negative news seemed to have risen.
It was concluded that the current global scenario was on a relatively atypical
phase of the global economic cycle, which called for a more thorough analysis
aimed at anticipating its future dynamics and possible transmission channels


to the Chilean economy. A key element in this regard was to elucidate how
the structural factors, the trade conflict and the policy responses that were
operating in parallel would be reflected on the Chinese economy. Summing up,
the assessment of the risks in the more negative external scenarios, associated
with the international political-economic conduct, had increased significantly.

There was discussion about what could be underlying the slowdown in activity
in the Eurozone and why the likelihood of a US recession had increased. This,
in a context in which the reasons that usually hold back growth —for example,
an accelerated monetary contraction as a reaction to inflationary pressures, or
the exposure of important financial vulnerabilities— were not present. Among
the possible causes, some specific issues that had affected activity in Germany
and the slowdown of activity in China were mentioned. The hypothesis was
also raised that it could be due to the prolonged time during which some risks
had been present in the international scenario without being cleared, which
could have led to a worsening of expectations.

There was also discussion regarding the central banks’ reaction to the evolution
of the global economic outlook. It was mentioned that, although the changes
in the external baseline scenario were not big, the generalized reaction of the
central banks had clearly been to signal greater caution. One way of interpreting
this reaction was that the most recent recovery had responded rather to an
expansionary monetary policy than to a more structural upturn. This could
indicate that the international economy was weaker than had been considered
in the baseline scenario, beyond the fact that the data had fairly matched the
forecasts. The risk that emerged in this area was about the growth capacity of
the world economy, because it could hardly be thought that monetary policy,
or other countercyclical measures, had the capacity to continue providing an
impulse of the same magnitude as in the past.

On the domestic front, there was agreement that, for the moment, the information
at hand gave no obvious signs that the evolution of the external scenario was
permeating the local economy. In particular, although inflation had closed
2018 somewhat below projections, it was adjusting in the foreseen direction.
On aggregate, the non-mining GDP had brought no surprise either, although
it did show a divergence between the evolution of the more investment-related
sectors —which showed greater dynamism— relative to those more related
to consumption, which had fallen below estimates. Exports and imports also
evolved somewhat above forecasts. The local financial conditions continued to
be stable and favorable, the credit channel had strengthened, with increased
lending and higher demand for consumer and commercial loans, according to


-----

the Banking Credit Survey. Finally, the faster than expected advancement of the
fiscal consolidation objectives was worth noting as a positive development in
the domestic scenario.

The debate covered the reasons that could explain why inflation had been
somewhat lower than expected, in particular the CPIEFE. It was said that it was
difficult to associate this difference with a change in the business or the credit
cycle, since after the doubts of the third quarter of last year, the fourth quarter had
shown a recovery. It was added that core inflation for goods could be responding
to a delay in the pass-through of the exchange rate rise of the second half of the
year to prices, in which case a reversal should be expected in the short term,
provided that the exchange rate stayed longer at its current levels. Alternatively,
the fact that lower inflation seemed to affect every category of goods, suggested
that it could be reflecting the weaker than expected consumption, in which
case the convergence of inflation could take a little longer. Figuring out the
relevance of these alternatives emerged as a priority task for the analysis of the
upcoming March Report. Also, the possible changes associated to the new CPI
basket had to be considered.

The implications of the evolution of the external scenario for the path of
monetary withdrawal were also discussed. On one hand, the new information
caused no significant change in the external impulse projected in the Report’s
baseline scenario. However, it was obvious that downward biased risks for
activity had increased. The quantification of the effects of these developments
was not evident and it would be a matter of the March Report to gauge its effects
more accurately. At the local level, the outlook was somewhat more positive
for investment, reflecting that, for now, the greater global uncertainty had not
permeated the local economy so much. It was added that, actually, the easing of
external monetary conditions had driven capital flows to emerging economies,
so it could be thought that it was having a rather expansionary effect.

Facing the complete revision of the forecasting exercise —to be included in
the March Report— it was noted that the external scenario depicted in the
December Report was already below the market’s projection. The discussion
turned to the uncertainty surrounding the evaluation of structural parameters
that sustained monetary policy (i.e. trend and potential growth, activity gap
and neutral interest rate). It was noted that this made it especially necessary to
update those estimates over the course of this year.


#### 3. Analysis of monetary policy options

All the Board agreed that, given the information available, it was right to think
that the baseline scenario continued to estimate closing capacity gaps and
inflation converging to the target within the next two years. Therefore, they
agreed that the monetary policy’s orientation should continue to point at a
normalization of the policy rate towards its neutral level, as had been expressed
in the December Report.

Several Board members added that, in any case, it was important to bear in mind
that multiple MPR trajectories were consistent with a given baseline scenario,
and the convenience of signaling to the market one or another path as the
most likely one depended not only on the starting point but also on the risk
scenarios. However, all the Board members agreed that given the distance that
still existed with respect to the neutral interest rate, these considerations were
not an obstacle for the two policy options proposed at this meeting (i.e. holding
the MPR at 2.75% or raising it to 3%) to be fully valid, as was a restrictive bias
going forward.

**Option 1: proceed further with the monetary stimulus withdrawal, by**
**raising the MPR by 25 basis points**

All the Board members agreed that the main argument for this option was that
it was totally consistent with the baseline scenario, which showed no significant
deviations. In addition, it was what the market expected, and the current degree
of monetary stimulus, including its distance with the MPR’s neutral level,
provided room to raise the policy rate without entailing higher costs associated
with the related risks.

One Board member noted that, beyond the decision to raise the MPR and
further withdraw the monetary stimulus, it was important to communicate
that such withdrawal would be done with greater flexibility, consistent with the
commitment to proceed gradually and cautiously. This greater flexibility should
leave no doubt that it was still necessary to continue with the normalization
process, but, in turn, it was possible that this process could be somewhat slower
than was communicated in the last Report.


-----

**Option 2: keep the MPR at 2.75%**

The Board members agreed that the main argument for this option was that
it bought time to await for more information on the evolution of the external
scenario, its fundamentals and its transmission channels to the Chilean economy.
This option, however, would not only take the market by surprise, it could also
signal a change in the baseline scenario or in the need to continue with the
normalization of the MPR, without having any information that could justify this.

One Board member noted that the evolution of the external scenario had led
to a flattening of the MPR curve implicit in the prices of local assets. In his
opinion, there was a quite remarkable divergence, since from the point of view
of market prices, monetary policy would be more expansionary than projected
some time ago without the ingredients that had motivated this movement in
the world occurring at home. This, he concluded, could suggest that monetary
policy was unnecessarily more expansionary than needed. Accordingly, from
the standpoint of aligning the monetary policy with the international scenario,
keeping the MPR and validating a scenario of a much flatter trajectory seemed
very inconsistent with local developments, especially because Chilean economic
indicators did not factor in developments in other countries, particularly in
the developed world, and that was what had led other central banks to react.

#### 4. Monetary policy decision

The Board decided, with the votes of Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and
Board members García, Costa and Naudon, to raise the monetary policy interest
rate by 25 basis points, to 3% annually.
