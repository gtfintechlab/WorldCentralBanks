#### 1. Background analysis and discussion

The background information presented to the Board and the analysis thereof are
contained in June’s Monetary Policy Report. That is, in recent months annual CPI
inflation had remained around 2%, both in its headline and core measures. In
turn, activity had reduced its annual expansion rate in the first quarter, falling
below expectations. This adjustment had concentrated especially on mining,
agriculture and other sectors dominated by supply factors. On the expenditure
side, there had been a significant deceleration of investment, particularly of
machinery and equipment, and of exports. In contrast, consumption had
sustained the expected dynamism. Externally, the main development since the
last Report had been the escalating conflict between the United States and its
main trading partners, which had resulted in increased risk aversion, affecting
the valuation of assets, currencies and commodities, as well as Chile’s terms of
trade, in a context of marked deterioration of global trade figures.

In this Report, the Board had updated the structural parameter estimates that
were used to assess the state of the economy, their prospects and implications
for monetary policy. Most importantly, this had allowed to quantify the effect
of the strong immigration flow of recent years on trend and potential growth,


increasing both. Meanwhile, the neutral MPR had been revised downward by
25 basis points (bp), partly reflecting the fall in neutral rates around the world
and despite the opposing effect that could be expected from the higher trend
growth. The widened gaps that were derived from the updating of the parameters
and the weakness of first-quarter activity and demand were consistent with the
low inflationary pressures observed.

#### 2. Analysis of monetary policy options

All five Board members agreed that the new combination of precedents justified
the need to increase the monetary stimulus. In particular, the updating of the
structural parameters pointed to greater potential and trend growth, which, if
added to the lower dynamism of the economy in the first quarter, resulted in a
wider and more-persistent-than-expected capacity gap. This was compounded
with the worsening of external conditions, especially the risks, and a lower
neutral MPR, which translated into a somewhat weaker-than-expected monetary
stimulus.

In such context, a needed discussion was about how this monetary expansion
would proceed. A first option was to signal that the MPR would remain flat
for longer than had been announced in March. Although this option matched
market expectations, the Board members agreed that it had two important
problems that ruled it out. First, it implied a delayed convergence of inflation
to the target, which was obviously a problem in a context in which risks related
to the external scenario and activity were biased downward. Thus, any shock
entailing a greater delay in the convergence of inflation would make it difficult
to meet the target within the policy horizon and would require sharper cuts
to the MPR in the future. Second, under this option, the more expansionary
monetary policy would rely essentially on signs of future decisions, which
would have more limited effects than would concrete actions now. One Board
member said that this second apprehension also applied to the option of not
changing the rate at this Meeting with an expansionary bias, for which reason
he also ruled it out.

All the Board members also agreed that, at this Meeting, the most relevant
options were those that considered MPR cuts of 50 bp. This could be done in
two ways. One, with a 25 bp reduction and a bias indicating that there would
be another movement of the same magnitude. Or two, with a 50 bp reduction
and a neutral bias stating that the next MPR movement will hinge on how certain
the Board is about the convergence of inflation to the target.


-----

Some Board members noted that, in terms of their macroeconomic effects, both
options were practically identical so, in essence, the decision was tactical. These
Board members opined that the main advantage of lowering the MPR by 25
bp and include a downward bias, was its lower communicational cost, mainly
because it reduced the risk of this action being seen as a more adverse signal
with respect to the macroeconomic scenario, compared with the scenario in the
June Report. One Board member emphasized that this risk could be mitigated
by the fact that the Report was due to be released the following Monday. The
entire Board agreed that, given the surprise that the MPR cut would involve,
on this occasion it was advisable to provide more information in the statement,
including the Bank’s outlook for activity.

Meanwhile, several Board members mentioned that the option to lower the
MPR in two steps was not free of communicational costs. On one hand, it could
convey some conditioning of the second cut, which was inconsistent with the
Report’s baseline scenario. For example, it could be the case that the next 25 bp
occurred with no bad news in the margin, which perhaps would be difficult to
explain. On the other hand, such two-step cut could be construed as a scenario
that required a reduction of more than 50 bp, which was neither consistent
with the Report’s baseline scenario.

About the option to lower the MPR by 50 bp, the Board members emphasized
that although it would come as a surprise, it was important to make it clear
that the combination of factors behind the decision was unusual. In particular,
due to the upward revision of potential and trend growth, which occurred
along with a fall in the neutral rate, in a context of low inflation and economic
slowdown. Furthermore, it had to be made clear that in the new scheme —eight
meetings per year— this kind of MPR movements —50 bp— would be more
frequent, partly because more background information could be accumulated
between meetings. Thus, as the option to lower 50 bp was now relevant, it
could not be ruled out that different scenarios should mean raising the MPR
by the same amount without this being interpreted as fear of an imminent
inflationary outburst.

Summing up, all the Board members agreed that either option would be a
surprise and there was no clear-cut reason indicating the convenience of making
a gradual adjustment instead of doing it in one take, while including more
information in the statement and in the understanding that the Report’s release
would mitigate any possible misinterpretation.


#### 3. Monetary policy decision

The entire Board agreed that the evaluation of the macroeconomic scenario
raised no doubts about the need to lower the MPR by 50 bp altogether. This
was much more consistent with the Report’s baseline scenario and associated
risks, allowing for greater certainty regarding the convergence of inflation to
3% in the policy horizon.

The Board also agreed that reducing the MPR by 50 bp accompanying a neutral
bias would allow focusing the upcoming analysis in the evolution of the economy
and its implications for monetary policy.

The Board decided, with the votes of Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial,
and Board members García, Costa and Naudon, to reduce the MPR by 50 basis
points, to 2.5%.
