#### 1. Background discussion and analysis

The information submitted to the Board and the analysis thereof are contained in
the March Monetary Policy Report. Its contents show that, in line with forecasts,
domestic economic activity recovered its growth pace after taking a pause in the
third quarter of 2018. Activity’s performance was being driven by investment.
On the external scenario, it was noted that growth in the main economies had
decelerated faster than expected, leading their authorities to implement further
economic stimulus measures.

The Report noted that the main difference with respect to December’s baseline
scenario was due to domestic inflation. Measured by the new benchmark CPI
calculated by the INE, inflation was significantly below the forecast. In a context
in which activity and demand had been in line with projections, the lower
inflation figure was consistent with a lower peso depreciation pass-through
coefficient; favorable supply factors in some sectors and greater than expected
gaps in the labor market resulting from massive immigration. In this context,


the convergence of inflation to the target would occur later than foreseen in
December, so the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus would take longer than
had been announced by the Board.

Regarding the external scenario, it was mentioned that the risks of a drastic
correction of asset prices had not vanished, despite announcements of several
countries’ economic authorities. It was said that, in fact, in recent days greater
volatility had been observed and pressures had increased on those economies
perceived as the weaker ones. It was also noted that, although a mild revision
to world growth could be good news for emerging economies, as it would
imply that the main central banks would adopt more expansionary monetary
policies, probably the effect of the interest rate decrease would be lower than in
other circumstances. However, the deflationary effects of potential appreciations
of their currencies would still be present and strong. Summing up, although
more benign scenarios could not be ruled out, a negative bias continued to
predominate in the evolution of the external scenario.

Also in discussing the risks from abroad, it was said that one of the most
important issues had to do with the reaction of emerging economies to a
persistent strengthening of the dollar, while, at the same time, Europe, China
and world trade were gradually weakening. It was mentioned that, unlike 2008,
when the nature of the cyclical deceleration and its potential propagation and
risks were quite evident, this time around the cyclical weakening had many
origins and it was difficult to identify the fundamental forces that were governing
it. Among them, the cycle’s maturing process, which had taken quite long;
political pressures in different places; the risk of a trade war; and financial stress.
Figuring out the relative importance of each element was essential to gauge the
effect of the external cycle on the Chilean economy.

On the domestic front, the annual national accounts had confirmed the direction
and magnitude of the evolution of activity and demand during 2018. In the
profile of activity during the year, a somewhat stronger-than-expected fourth
quarter had been observed, confirming the transitory nature of previous quarter’s
slowdown. This was reinforced by the upward trajectory of investment during
the year and consumption a little above forecasts. It was pointed out that the
fact of consumption growing in tandem with GDP was consistent with the Bank’s
analysis of the labor market, which drew attention to how the economy had
absorbed a significant immigrant flow. It was noted as well that the magnitudes
of this flow had also been confirmed by the population projections published
by the INE last December.

The implications of a possible combination of negative shocks from abroad
with positive supply-side shocks at home associated with immigration and its
labor market effects were discussed. On one hand, the effects on activity and
employment would possibly tend to cancel out but, on the other hand, both
scenarios implied lower inflation in the policy horizon. For the same reason, at
least for now, more attention should be paid to inflation than to the activity gap.
In that sense, a potential risk of inflation being below target for a very long time
due to the intensification of these two scenarios was a possibility that should
be evaluated in future Reports.

#### 2. Analysis of monetary policy options

All five Board members agreed that the background analysis of the last Monetary
Policy Report confirmed that it would be prudent to postpone the withdrawal
of the monetary impulse. In particular, because inflation estimated with the new
CPI was clearly lower than expected—which, among other things, had to do with
the apparently bigger gaps due to the aforementioned supply shocks—and its
convergence to 3% would take almost a year longer than thought in December.
Moreover, there was uncertainty surrounding the structural parameters, such as
potential growth and the neutral interest rate, something that would be resolved
in the June Report.

All the Board members agreed that everything suggested that in the medium
term it would be necessary to normalize the MPR and take it to its neutral level.
However, in the short term the main concern was to understand the present
level of inflation and what it meant for its future trajectory.

They all considered it difficult to justify a different option—in either direction—
than holding the MPR flat at this Meeting. In particular, because as was also
noted in the March Report, this pause in the monetary withdrawal needed to
last for several meetings before resuming its path of normalization toward the
neutral MPR.


#### 3. Monetary policy decision

There was consensus among the Board members that the option to not change
the MPR was the natural one and it was consistent with inflation converging
to the target over the policy horizon. Moreover, it adapted better to the risk
scenarios analyzed.

It was also agreed that not changing the MPR was proof of the coherence between
the Bank’s actions and communications, especially in that the monetary stimulus
would be withdrawn gradually and cautiously. Actually, this caution was evident
in the postponement of the normalization process, in light of new elements in
the evolution of inflation and the interpretation of its fundamentals.

The Board decided, with the votes of Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial
and Board members García, Costa and Naudon, to keep the monetary policy
interest rate at 3%.
