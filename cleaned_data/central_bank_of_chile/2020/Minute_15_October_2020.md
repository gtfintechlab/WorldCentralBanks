#### 1. Background

**The domestic scenario**

August’s Imacec posted an 11.3% annual fall in domestic activity in the month,
contracting somewhat more than expected by the market, although with
increasing speed compared to the previous month: 2.8% month-on-month in
de-seasonalized terms. Sectors such as construction and services continued to
show markedly negative annual variation rates, still affected by the quarantines
that had been in place throughout the month. Mining had also underperformed
in annual comparison, although production levels remained high. In contrast,
retail had made significant progress and had gone positive in annual variation
terms for the first time since February. This, in a context where consumption was
being temporarily boosted by the partial withdrawal of pension savings and, to
a lesser extent, by fiscal transfers. This had resulted in significant purchases of
goods, important inventory depletion, and higher consumption-related imports.
As for investment, various indicators—including wholesale trade, home sales,


construction expectations (IMCE)—had improved in the margin, despite being
still low, in general.

The labor market had continued to show signs of stabilization. Employment
and hours worked had seen an incipient improvement in the moving quarter
ending in August, while wages showed no significant change. Both the Bank’s
online job ad index and hiring expectations (IMCE) had recovered partially.
The above, together with the progress of the deconfinement process and the
government’s employment subsidy measures made it possible to foresee further
progress in this area in the coming months. Business and consumer expectations
had continued to recover, although still on pessimistic territory. The median
of October’s Economic Expectations Survey (EES) yielded an estimated fall in
GDP of 5.5% this year, albeit with a high dispersion of responses.

Preliminary qualitative information, compiled through interviews conducted
for the Business Perceptions Report (IPN), indicated that the outlook for
activity was strongly associated with the temporality of the pandemic’s cycle.
Thus, improved conditions were observed in the North and a more depressed
situation in the South. However, the withdrawal of pension savings and fiscal
measures had caused effects across all regions and in several sectors and in
the repayment of financial obligations. Regarding trade, a large number of
respondents reported inventory shortages, increased demand and price hikes.
However, most perceived this as a transitory effect. Respondents continued
to report a high level of uncertainty, mainly associated with the resurgence of
violence outbursts in the country. Business perceptions regarding the labor
market were not as pessimistic as in previous months. There were reports of
fewer layoffs in recent months and the return of employees covered by the
Suspended Employment Law. In any case, for the following months increases
only in the number of seasonal workers were foreseen because uncertainty held
back new hirings. Moreover, the prevailing vision was that not all the layoffs
due to the pandemic would be reversed.

Generally speaking, the behavior of local financial markets matched those
abroad, with stock market losses and a depreciation of the peso. Special mention
deserved the rise in long-term interest rates, which in the cases of BCPs and
BCUs were up between 25 and 30 basis points from early September. In the
money market, the cost of financing in pesos and dollars remained low, but
with some increase in the latter. In this context, the Bank had announced at
the end of September that it would lift the measures to mitigate the financial
impact of the partial withdrawal of pension funds. Furthermore, on the day of
the Meeting, the country had learned of Chile’s sovereign risk rating downgrade.

Credit growth in the commercial segment showed less dynamism in the margin
(9.5% real annual growth in September; 10.9% in August), while consumer
loans showed a sharper contraction and mortgages posted a minor advance
(-15.3 and 5.3% in real annual terms in September, respectively). In any case,
commercial loans continued to grow above numbers of the beginning of the
year, thanks to the strong impulse provided by the measures in place. Interest
rates had fallen across all credit categories. Banks’ applications for phase II of
the Credit Facility Conditional on Increased Lending (FCIC) amounted to just
over 30% of available funds. According to August data from the Financial Market
Commission, bank delinquencies of 90 days or more had been declining for
several consecutive months, with a recent reduction in portfolios associated
with individuals. Provisions showed no big variations, and remained at their
highest levels of several years.

The Bank Credit Survey of the third quarter reported tighter conditions for
all types of loans, as higher risks were perceived in all segments. Meanwhile,
household demand remained weak —for the consumer and mortgage
segments—, related to the users’ worsened income and/or employment
conditions. Regarding corporate demand, the unrelenting deterioration of
investment-related requirements was compounded with a fall in working capital
requirements. Preliminary qualitative information gathered for the Business
Perceptions Report showed that most of those consulted so far did not foresee
any imminent financing needs. This was explained by their gained access to
credit, their improved financial situation, their reluctancy to increase their
indebtedness in the face of perceived uncertainty, or because their applications
had been turned down and they quit trying.

Since the last Meeting, annual inflation had risen to 3.1% and its core component
(i.e. CPI without volatiles) had risen to 2.9%. This increase was mainly explained
by the rise in the prices of goods and foodstuffs in September, which had brought
the monthly variation in the CPI to 0.6%. This evolution was mainly in line
with the temporary boost in consumption of goods linked to the withdrawal
of pension savings and to some short-term supply constraints to meet this
demand. Into the medium term, inflationary pressures remained contained. As
for inflation expectations, they had been adjusted upward in the short term.
At December 2020, the median of the EES was 2.4% per year. Meanwhile, one
year ahead the median had risen to 2.7% per year and that of the Financial
Traders Survey (FTS) to 2.5%, while two years ahead it remained around 3%.

In this context, expectations for the monetary policy rate (MPR) implicit in
financial asset prices and included in the surveys (EES and FTS) continued to
point to the rate being kept at 0.5% for a prolonged period of time.


**The international scenario**

On the external front, incoming data pointed to some moderation in the pace
of economic recovery, especially in developed countries. This was visible in
indicators such as manufacturing output, services and retail sales, as well as in
the PMIs. The fundamentals of private consumption were still weak, particularly
consumer confidence and labor market indicators. After the previous Meeting,
there had been no major developments in fiscal support programs, and the few
announcements that had been made entailed a reduction in previously adopted
stimulus measures. This, in a context where knowledge had been gained in
handling the pandemic, which allowed pacing the containment measures
despite increases in infections, as a better control of its effects had been gained.

In the emerging world, the dynamism of activity and demand variables in China
were worth noting, including investment in fixed assets —state-owned and
private—, foreign trade, retail sales and business prospects. In Latin America,
economic recovery was lagging, reflecting quite diverse epidemiological, economic
and social realities, which also reflected differences in countries’ policy responses.
Although market projections for global growth this year had not changed
much, their composition did show changes, with better prospects for developed
economies, especially the United States, and a deteriorating outlook for emerging
economies. With respect to commodity prices, copper had remained at around
US$3 per pound and oil had fallen to around US$40 per barrel.

The financial markets had seen more episodes of volatility. With respect to
the previous Meeting, stock markets had shown some falls, currencies had
depreciated across the board with respect to the dollar and risk premiums
had been slightly reduced. Credit had been decelerating in some economies
and corporate risk remained contained. However, the risk of the possible
consequences of high corporate indebtedness had risen. Monetary incentives
from central banks remained high, while many policymakers had reaffirmed
their commitment to keep them in place, scale them up and/or adopt new
measures if necessary.

#### 2. Background analysis and discussion

Commenting the macroeconomic scenario, it was agreed that, in general terms,
the bulk of information indicated that both the global and local economy
had evolved in line with forecasts in the September MP Report. In general,
activity in Chile and many other countries was on a recovery path, thanks to
the momentum provided by the various economic policies implemented and

the sanitary management of the crisis. Still, it was mentioned that clearly the
evolution of the economy was and would continue to be closely linked to steps
forward and backward in the control of the pandemic. This raised a note of
caution, because while some countries had significantly reduced the number
of cases, others were struggling with a significant increase.

There was consensus that the set of risks remained very important, and their
implications were generally negative. On the external side, in recent weeks
uncertainty had resurfaced regarding the evolution of the pandemic, both
because of the increase in infections in Europe, the scars it was leaving on
economic activity, and also regarding the possibility of having a vaccine widely
distributed in a relatively short period of time. There were also several important
political risks, such as the elections in the United States, the Brexit unfolding
in Europe and other sources of recent geo-political conflict.

Locally, the data on activity, demand, employment and inflation had shown
some differences with forecasts, with different signs and uncertain persistencies.
It was noted that the data suggested that the worst of the pandemic had been
left behind, and that the negative surprise of August could be due to a delay in
opening compared to what had been anticipated in the September MP Report.
Incidentally, doubts remained as to when to expect the economy to recover. This
was especially visible when considering that part of the increased dynamism of
demand was associated to transitory effects, such as the impact of the withdrawal
of pension savings and increased fiscal transfers, among others. In fact, these
same factors would explain the unexpected rise in some prices, which suggested
that the medium-term outlook continued to be one where downward inflationary
pressures predominated, along with capacity gaps that would continue to be
substantial in the coming quarters.

The evolution of political risks was another factor of concern both globally and
locally. In many countries, the Covid-19 shock had caused considerable stress on
society and its authorities, whether through advances and setbacks in fighting
the pandemic, the imposition of sanitary measures and the implementation of
compensatory economic policies. In Chile, this phenomenon was accentuated
by the preceding social crisis, the high level of distrust in some institutions
and the tensions between government branches. It could not be ruled out that
these phenomena were affecting the price of some Chilean financial assets.
Although the CDS and EMBI had declined since the last Meeting and long
rates stood at low levels, it was undeniable that, as of the second quarter of
this year, the dollar and longer-term interest rates were on an upward trend.
The important correction of the stock market stood out, as it had fallen more
than that of other comparable economies. In addition, while the Meeting was


taking place, the country had learned of the downgrading if its credit rating by
a risk-rating agency, a correction that was expected by the market and reflected,
in the agency’s statement, the weakening of public finances caused by greater
spending pressures in the wake of the social outbreak and the pandemic. It was
further noted that in the current context it was difficult to discern how much of
the movement of long rates was due to rather transitory phenomena and how
much to more persistent factors, for which the policies of the Central Bank had
little capacity to reverse.

At the opposite side, it was noted that some of the risks had evolved positively.
On the one hand, for the first time in several months, positive numbers had been
achieved in job creation, and at the same time administrative data suggested that
the impact of the crisis on salaried employment had been somewhat less than
estimated. This, coupled with the announcement of the employment subsidy
program, somehow mitigated the risk of a further worsening of the labor market.
Another important element was the fact that the expected inflation measures
had moved away from the levels that could cause concern for the anchoring of
expectations, partly because of the surprise of September, which also reduced
one of the risks considered a while back.

#### 3. Analysis of monetary policy options

All five Board members agreed that, the same as in previous meetings, the
macroeconomic context produced by the pandemic only stressed the message
that monetary policy would continue to be highly expansionary for a prolonged
period of time. This meant keeping the MPR at its technical minimum for several
quarters and the prevailing unconventional measures in place.Towards the
medium term, all the Board members agreed that it would be essential to to be
on the alert for events that could generate instability in the financial markets,
reacting in an effective and timely manner.

#### 4. Monetary policy decision

Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Naudon and
Costa voted for holding the MPR at 0.5%. The also agreed to keep in place the
unconventional measures to support liquidity and credit, furthering the current
asset purchase program. In addition, should the evolution of the economy would
so require, they would continue to explore options to adjust said impulse and
lend support to financial stability.
