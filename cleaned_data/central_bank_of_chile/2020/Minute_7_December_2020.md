#### 1. Background

The local and international economic scenario continued to be determined by
the evolution of the people’ mobility and its relation to the pandemic. In Chile,
although infections had declined and mobility had increased since mid-year,
improvements in activity had been slower than expected in September. This
had been especially true for the sectors most affected by social distancing, such
as construction and a good proportion of services. The withdrawal of pension
savings had resulted in temporary increases in consumption, especially of
imported goods, which had had a positive impact on sectors such as trade but
had also put pressure on the prices of the products most demanded. Investment,
beyond the reactivation of public and private projects, was being affected by the
financial situation of companies and the persistent uncertainty. The labor market
had shown some recovery, with a rise in employment compared to mid-year.

The balance of these elements meant a downward revision of the forecasts
contained in the December MP Report for this year’s growth. The central scenario
foresaw that the economy would keep improving, that mobility restrictions
would not return to mid-2020 levels, and that the fiscal and monetary impulse
would continue. Even so, dismay caused by the sharp drop in activity, plus


the necessary use of public and private strenghts to overcome the emergency,
heightened vulnerability to risk scenarios and posed significant challenges to
recovering near-trend growth rates.

#### 2. Background analysis and discussion

Regarding the external scenario, it was noted that, positive news exceeded the
negative. Along with the news about a vaccine becoming available, there was
good news about GDP in several countries during the third quarter —notably
China—, the copper price hike and the elimination of some risks, such as those
associated with the U.S. elections. Naturally there were also negative elements,
mainly the increase of infections in several European countries and in the United
States and the fact that the scars caused by this the crisis had become more
evident. Both facts suggested that there was the risk of a slower recovery going
forward, even with a readily available vaccine.

Locally, there was consensus that news was not as encouraging. Incoming data
on activity had surprised on the downside, with both regular consumption and
investment being weaker than expected. In addition, the data was difficult to
interpret, particularly because of doubts about how much of it was due to the
measures taken in association with the pandemic; how much was a reflection of
something more persistent resulting from the scars of the crisis; and how much
was simply statistical noise with no macroeconomic content. It was noted that
something similar happened with inflation, which had been particularly volatile
in recent months, making it difficult to read. Most importantly, however, the
evolution of inflation was leaving behind the risk of persistently low inflation
that could affect the evolution of inflation expectations.

It was also noted that another important factor in the macroeconomic scenario
would be the evolution of uncertainty and its potential impact on investment.
This was compounded with sanitary issues—e.g. possible new outbreaks or
progress in vaccination—, the fear of new violence episodes as manifested in
some surveys, together with financial difficulties in some companies. Their
behavior would be decisive for investment to be reactivated beyond large-scale
public and private projects. In any case, there were also favorable aspects, such
as the performance of the stock market, the evolution of business expectations
and the higher price of copper.

Beyond the immediate evolution of the macro scenario, it was remarked that
the ugliest side of the Covid-19 crisis was dissipating, and a worst-case scenario
had been averted. Since June, half of the sharp fall of the previous three months
had been recovered and by 2021 a growth range between 5.5% and 6.5% was
projected. These projections were largely based on a reduction in infections,
the gradual phasing out of sanitary restrictions, the impulse of monetary and
fiscal policy, and the capacity of many companies to adapt. Furthermore,
private consumption was being boosted by two withdrawals of pension savings.
Although the announcement of the Metropolitan Region’s retreat to step 2 of the
deconfinement plan could reduce somewhat the momentum at the margin, to the
extent that it could help articulate a more orderly transition to the application
of a vaccine, it would avoid having to resort to more drastic measures. There
were also newly incorporated exemptions for construction and some services
activities.

#### 3. Analysis of monetary policy options

All the Board members agreed that, given the macroeconomic context caused
by the pandemic, there was no other options than reinforcing the message that
monetary policy would maintain a strong monetary impulse for an extended
period of time, in order to ensure the consolidation of the economic recovery and
achievement of the Bank’s objectives. Accordingly, it was foreseen that the MPR
would remain at its minimum level over a large part of the two-year monetary
policy horizon, and the unconventional measures would remain in application.

The Board agreed on the necessity to assess the situation of commercial credit, in
particular the limited use of Phase 2 of the FCIC facility by the financial system.
In this respect, various doubts arose as to what it meant that it was not being used
with the expected intensity and what the implications for the current monetary
impulse were. They all agreed that it was imperative to address these questions
in order to possibly make adjustments to these measures. Especially important
was to determine whether more structural phenomena were occurring—as
a result, for example, of the scars being left by the crisis—that could affect
economic recovery in a more sustained way. They thought it also necessary to
examine the coherence of a possible extension and redesign of the FCIC with
other existing regulatory, credit and guarantee policies that could be operating.


#### 4. Monetary policy decision

Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Naudon, and
Costa voted for keeping the monetary policy rate at 0.5%. They also agreed
to keep in place the unconventional measures to support liquidity and credit.
In particular, they decided to maintain the total stock of bank bonds acquired
under different programs—in the order of US$8 billion—for at least the next six
months, reinvesting the coupons as they matured. This included the purchases
under the CC-VP program. Regarding the FCIC, the Board decided not to
introduce any changes to the total of resources available and conditions for
utilization. Nonetheless, it agreed to assess a possible extension and changes
in access parameters that would facilitate its use to respond to the needs of the
economy at the present stage
