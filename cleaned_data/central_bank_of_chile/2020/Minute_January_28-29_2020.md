#### 1. Analysis of the technical teams

**The international scenario**

In the external scenario, the advances in trade negotiations between China and
the United States, particularly after signing the first phase of the agreement,
and the positive surprise in incoming activity and demand figures from the
main economies —especially the greater stability of manufacturing-related
indicators— had a positive impact on financial markets and commodity prices.
However, new sources of tension, in particular the coronavirus outbreak, had
increased the global perception of risk, to a great extent because of how it
could affect the performance of the Chinese and other Asian economies. In the
days leading up to the Meeting, this had translated into higher risk premiums,
widespread depreciations of currencies against the dollar, and falls in stock
prices and interest rates. In the case of commodities, prices had fallen to their
lowest of several months, and copper was no exception.


In terms of activity, better numbers could be observed in the US in starts of
new homes and mortgage loans that showed a higher impulse in residential
investment, while the outlook for consumption remained robust, especially
considering the tight labor market according to many indicators, similarly to
other developed countries. The high level of US consumer confidence persisted
and suggested that it would support this part of spending going forward. In
the Eurozone, manufacturing production and several measures of expectations
were showing better performance in the margin. In Germany, in particular,
preliminary information confirmed positive GDP growth in 2019, albeit the
lowest rate since 2013. Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom the latest known
economic data showed a deterioration, in the run-up to the signing of a Brexit
deal with the European Union.

In the emerging economies, China’s GDP had closed 2019 with a 6.1%
expansion, in line with market expectations, while short-term activity data
showed an acceleration in December from the previous month, including figures
from the external sector. The upturn in investment in fixed assets stood out.
The outlook in Latin America continued to be characterized by socio-political
tensions in a significant group of countries, with monthly activity data that had
been weaker at the margin in some countries, such as Mexico and Argentina. In
Brazil, the approval of the pension reform had boosted confidence and several
indicators suggested a gradual rebound there.

In a context where global inflation was still bounded, global monetary policy
continued to be expansionary, with policy rates being held flat or further reduced
in most countries. Meanwhile, in the Eurozone it had been announced that the
monetary policy framework would be revised during 2020, which could result
in an extension of the current mandate of the European Central Bank.

**The domestic scenario**

Since the last meeting, domestic financial markets had shown some volatility that
matched the evolution of internal and external determinants, and in line with the
impact of the measures adopted by the Bank. Thus, since the December Meeting,
the peso had appreciated and had become notably less volatile, reflecting the
effects of the exchange rate intervention carried out by the Bank. The measures
aimed at favoring market liquidity had also been effective, contributing to
reducing money market spreads in both pesos and dollars.


-----

In the credit market, the marked deceleration of consumer loans stood out,
while commercial and mortgage lending showed no major changes in annual
expansion rates. At the same time, corporate bonds had been issued abroad
in significant amount, with favorable financial conditions. Interest rates on
commercial and mortgage loans had increased compared with data available
at the previous Meeting.

Regarding qualitative information, credit conditions had tightened, as reflected
in the Bank Credit Survey of the fourth quarter of 2019, which reported that
credit supply was perceived as more restricted in all portfolios, particularly in
the consumer and large company segments, together with weaker demand,
mainly for consumer credit. Also, in the Business Perceptions Report (IPN)
of February, most of the respondents saw a tightening of financial conditions,
mainly due to some increase in interest rates in certain segments—although they
noted that they were still low by the usual standards— and greater difficulties
in credit granting requirements.

Regarding local activity, fourth-quarter figures available were in line with
assumptions in the baseline scenario of the December Monetary Policy Report,
which ratified that the disruptions caused by the social crisis had significantly
affected the Imacec of October and November 2019 (-3.4 and -3.3% annually),
where the annual fall in some services and trade deserved mention. On the
opposite side of the spectrum, construction had shown positive growth in both
months, and so had the manufacturing industry in November. At the same time,
some indicators suggested that the negative effects had moderated in December.

On the expenditure side, the contraction of private consumption’s tradable
components stood out, as reflected in retail sales (INE) new car sales (ANAC),
consumer goods imports (durable and non-durable), retail inventories that
continued to be seen as high (IMCE) and consumer expectations that persisted
in strong pessimistic territory.

In the labor market, INE data for the moving quarter ending in November
showed the unemployment rate at around 7.0%, while private and public
salaried job creation was increasing in annual terms, concentrated mostly
in public. Meanwhile, Universidad de Chile fourth-quarter 2019 saw the
unemployment rate for Greater Santiago rising up to 8.8% and slightly negative
annual employment growth, influenced mainly by the annual contraction of
salaried employment, in a context where administrative data, such as December’s


contract termination notices, showed an incipient deterioration. Furthermore,
hiring expectations remained pessimistic in several sectors (IMCE). In addition,
most respondents to the IPN of February said they had made no hiring and were
more cautious in making and/or postponing this type of decisions. Some sectors
reported layoffs, as well as fewer recruitments of seasonal summer workers,
especially in the most severely affected sectors.

About investment, capital goods imports had continued to contract in annual
terms and business expectations remained pessimistic. In any case, the
Corporation of Capital Goods (CBC)’s investment project survey for the fourth
quarter of 2019 showed no big changes so far in the amounts committed for
2020 and 2021. On the other hand, fourth-quarter exports had fallen in annual
terms, mainly due to supply-side factors that had affected industrial and mining
shipments, while agricultural shipments had risen. In this scenario, private
expectations as per the January 2020 Economic Expectations Survey (EES) for
total and non-mining GDP growth had dropped in both cases to 1.2% annually
for 2020 and 2.5% annually for 2021.

The IPN of February showed a high level of uncertainty regarding the outlook
for this year, beyond the fact that the immediate impact of the social crisis on
business performance had been uneven across regions and economic sectors.
Regarding fourth-quarter activity, in most regions performance was poor,
especially in activities related to tourism, hotels and retail, where establishments
in central areas had been the most affected, as they were more exposed to
outbreaks of violence. In several regions, construction and real estate were also
among the hardest hit. Still, more respondents reported some improvement in
their activities in December compared to the previous two months. By contrast,
some activities, such as those linked to the mining and salmon sectors, had
continued doing business as usual.

Going forward, most respondents said they were anxious about developments in
March and April, particularly for fear of the return of violence, the outcome of
the constitutional plebiscite and the progress of the measures under discussion.
Given the difficulties in making projections, many had decided to postpone
their investments. However, the large-scale projects under way in the mining,
forestry and salmon sectors had not been modified significantly.


-----

Since the last Meeting, annual inflation had risen to 3% and the core measure
(CPIEFE) had remained at around 2.5%. The evolution of both indicators had
been lower than foreseen in the December Report. Going forward, the evolution
of inflation remained exposed to opposing forces, whose relative impact was
still uncertain. On the one hand, the outlook for activity remained weak and
its recovery continued to depend on the economic agents’ reaction to the
new scenario. On the other hand, the inherent pressures of the idiosyncratic
depreciation that the peso had accumulated since October 2019 were still
present. In this regard, most of respondents to the February IPN reported that
costs had remained stable or increased slightly caused mainly by the higher prices
of imported inputs, which they anticipated might intensify in the future. In some
cases, this had resulted in higher final prices or fewer clearance sales. In others,
respondents pointed out that the highly volatile exchange rate had led them
to postpone adjustments to final prices, and that the pass-through could begin
to occur as the large inventories were used up. Also, the cost outlook that was
reflected in the IMCE business confidence showed increases in recent months.
With respect to private inflation expectations, one-year-ahead measurements
had risen, while two years ahead they had remained around 3%.

In this context, expectations for the MPR implicit in the prices of financial assets
and inferred from surveys to specialists (i.e. the Financial Brokers Survey and
the EES) anticipated that the benchmark rate would remain at 1.75%, at least
until the first half for 2021.

#### 2. Background analysis and discussion

It was noted that the volatility of the domestic macroeconomic scenario had
decreased significantly since the December Meeting, thanks to several factors
combined, in particular the decline of the most violent episodes—and a lower
level of disruptions in productive activities—and the extraordinary measures
taken by the Bank. Plus the more favorable response of the world markets to
the first phase of the US-China trade agreement, coupled with early signs of
stabilization or even improvement in developed economies. Most recently, the
latter had been overshadowed by the Coronavirus crisis.

It was mentioned that now that several weeks had passed since the outburst of
the social crisis, it was clear that local agents had made major adjustments to
their investment portfolios. Exchange rate intervention and liquidity measures


by the Central Bank, as well as the government sales of dollar assets to finance
its deficit, had helped to accommodate this adjustment, thus avoiding excessive
strain on domestic financial markets. In the near future, this situation should
continue to be monitored, as should foreign investors’ perceived risk in Chile.
The data showed that investment flows from non-residents were still on positive
ground and recent bond issues abroad by both the government and companies
had been successful, with no big increases in risk premiums. In this sense, the
evolution of the risks of the external scenario was particularly important, as
although the occurrence of more positive or more negative scenarios could
be just as likely, at this point the impact of the latter could have more severe
consequences on the local economy.

It was noted that overall domestic growth figures had performed in line with
the Monetary Policy Report, but there were still several aspects that needed
resolution. One was the magnitude of the contribution of fiscal expansion to
the cycle, as there could be tensions between short-term needs and mediumterm sustainability of the fiscal accounts. Another was that consumer loans were
decelerating rapidly, suggesting a more cautious behavior of households, together
with credit constraints that were perhaps becoming more stringent on the credit
suppliers’ side. Although the labor market was not showing strong evidence
of weakening in the surveys, consumption was a matter to be monitored very
carefully, because, in the last few years, this component had sustained a good part
of domestic growth. With regard to the situation of companies and investment,
the short-term data also showed nuances. On the one hand, expectations were
very negative, as was the evolution of some investment components and, on
the other, credit creation figures remained fairly reasonable, while investment
components more closely linked to mining maintained an interesting rate of
expansion.

It was stressed that risks of a further weakening of the economy were still
present. It was brought up that the December Report noted that uncertainty was
fundamentally affecting the performance of the economy and that a recovery
would be conditional on this uncertainty being reduced. In the weeks following
the December Report, progress had been made on the legislative agenda, both
on political and economic issues, and even on issues related to the protection of
public order. However, it was yet to show up in economic indicators reflecting
better expectations, and this would continue to hold back economic recovery.


-----

About inflation, it was noted that it had been below the forecast in the December
Report. A first reading led to think that this surprise did not signal a substantial
change in the medium-term outlook, as it originated in the behavior of some
more volatile prices. However, it did raise a red flag, as it could somehow mean
that the transmission of the idiosyncratic peso depreciation was not evolving with
the intensity expected in December, or that disinflationary pressures were more
acute than expected. The March Report, where some more information would
be available, would allow a better assessment of the implications of this surprise.
In any case, in the medium term, inflation expectations remained at around
3%, even though in the shorter term they were below the Bank’s projections.

#### 3. Analysis of monetary policy options

All five Board members agreed that the option of holding the MPR at 1.75%
dominated over any other. In a context where news accumulated since the latest
Report did not alter substantially the macroeconomic scenario, holding the MPR
was consistent with keeping a highly expansionary monetary impulse and the
contents of the Statement from the last Meeting.

All the Board members agreed that beyond the decision of this Meeting, the
recovery of the economy and the achievement of the inflation target required
monetary policy to remain expansionary during the coming quarters, lending
counter-cyclical support to the economy. One Board member stressed that
keeping the MPR unchanged contributed to said expansionary monetary policy,
considering that inflation was somewhat higher than had been projected before
the social crisis. Moreover, he felt that the Bank’s extraordinary measures had
made it possible to maintain this monetary stimulus, because otherwise financial
and monetary conditions would clearly be much tighter than they are today.
He concluded by indicating that the March Report should assess whether the
monetary conditions were indeed contributing to the process of refinancing and
deleveraging of persons and companies unfolding in an environment aligned
with macro projections and the achievement of the inflation target. In his view,
the risk of having an inflation rate below the target could become significant
in the coming quarters.


#### 4. Monetary policy decision

Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Naudon and
Costa voted for keeping the MPR at 1.75%. In the Board’s opinion, the orientation
of monetary policy in the December Report remained fully in force, so the MPR
had to hold on to its strong expansionary stance to cushion the adverse impacts
of the deteriorated internal confidence.

At the same time, the Board considered that the persevering uncertainty limits
the possibility of anticipating now a course of action for the trajectory of
monetary policy over the coming months. All five Board members reiterated
their disposition to calibrate monetary policy to meet the inflation target,
factoring in the responses of the Chilean economy to the effects and evolution
of the ongoing crisis.
