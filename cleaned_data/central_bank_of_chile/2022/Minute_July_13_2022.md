#### 1. Background

**The local scenario**

Headline inflation had continued on an upward path, reaching 12.5% annually in June, while the core
component had risen to 9.9% annually. CPI data for May and June had been largely in line with forecasts
in the June Monetary Policy Report. The surprises were restricted to specific products, mostly volatile ones,
and concentrated in the air transportation item. Inflationary pressures had continued to be reflected in the
different lines of the core basket component. Cost pressures remained strong, amid a growing impact of
labor costs and a more depreciated exchange rate. Business costs expectations as reported in the June IMCE
remained near their historical highs. Inflation expectations derived from the July Economic Expectations
Survey (EES) and the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) prior to the July meeting had been adjusted upward and
remained above 3% over the two-year horizon.

In May, the Imacec had posted annual variation of 6.4%, which included a 0.9% monthly drop in its nonmining component in its seasonally-adjusted series. Despite the positive surprise on the mining side, activity
in all other sectors had continued to fall at a gradual pace, consistent with what was anticipated in the
June Report. Again, the greater resilience of the sectors most closely linked to household consumption —
especially services— stood out. The demand indicators had evolved in line with projections and continued


-----

to reflect a notorious disparity between the performances of private consumption and investment. Business
(IMCE) and consumer (IPEC) confidence remained in pessimistic ground.

In the labor market (INE), job creation had slowed further, with a fall in salaried employment (formal
and informal) and an upturn in self-employment. The unemployment rate remained stable and close to
historical averages, which was partly explained by the still high level of inactivity. Labor demand continued
to lose momentum, as suggested by the online job postings index, which had declined again marginally.
Business expectations for employment had continued to recede (IMCE). Annual real wage growth remained
negative, reflecting the rising inflation.

The domestic financial market had adapted to the deteriorating global financial conditions, in a context
of high local uncertainty. Since the last Meeting, the IPSA had fallen by nearly 5%, the sovereign risk
premium (CDS) had increased and the nominal 10-year interest rates (BTP-10) showed no major variation.
The exchange rate had depreciated sharply (just over +20% since the last meeting), with high volatility.
Up to that moment, the markets had been able to absorb the shocks adequately and the volatility in the
forex market had not been transmitted to other segments of the financial system, which had operated with
adequate liquidity levels.

Bank lending remained subdued in the various segments, with financing conditions perceived to be tighter
and demand for new loans lower, according to the second-quarter Bank Lending Survey. Lending interest
rates had risen further in most portfolios.

Market expectations about how far up the MPR would go in the current cycle of hikes had risen again. Both
the EES and the FTS surveys placed it at 10% at the September meeting. Financial asset prices spoke of a
higher level.

**The international scenario**

As global inflation was still increasing central banks had either continued to raise their benchmark rates or
signaled a faster hike if the rising inflation proved more persistent. At its June meeting, the U.S. Federal
Reserve had made an unannounced 75 basis-point (bp) increase and had anticipated that rate hikes would
continue going forward until inflation was brought under control. The European Central Bank had confirmed
the end of its asset purchase program and announced that the rate hike cycle would begin in July. In this
scenario, financial conditions had tightened around the world. Increased risk aversion had led to declines
in world stock markets, while the dollar had appreciated sharply against other currencies and long-term
interest rates had shown mixed movements.

Since the last Meeting, the market’s outlook for global growth had deteriorated, approaching estimates
in the June Report. In the U.S., concerns about an upcoming recession had increased. Tighter financial
conditions had begun to affect investment, and consumer confidence had fallen further, as high inflation
continued to erode real wages. In the Eurozone, higher inflation continued to show signs of spilling over the


-----

consumer basket. Consumer confidence and business and investor expectations had continued to worsen,
amid Russia’s protracted invasion of Ukraine. In China, activity had seen some recovery after the reopening
of the economy, although consumption fundamentals had remained weak and the risks associated with the
zero-tolerance policy for Covid-19 were still present. Although activity in Latin America had shown positive
surprises and the outlook for 2022 was broadly unchanged, for 2023 the outlook looked more unfavorable
in the face of worsening financial conditions, weaker external momentum, low confidence levels, and the
persistent rise in inflation.

Commodity prices had fallen more than anticipated in the June Report, in large part because of fears of a
global recession, the financial volatility, and the resulting appreciation of the dollar. Food prices posted the
biggest drop, among which wheat stood out (-24% since the last meeting), which was also explained by a
more favorable outlook on the supply side. The price of copper had declined significantly to around US$3.3
per pound (slightly more than -20% since the last meeting), even though inventories remained at historically
low levels. Although the price of an oil barrel remained high, it had been corrected downwards to just over
US$100 at the time of the meeting (-15% since the last meeting, for the WTI-Brent average). However,
several of the factors that had driven commodity prices up were still present, including the Russian invasion
of Ukraine and the constraints present in several markets, which kept prices under pressure, especially for
food and energy. All of the above resulted in the external scenario being worse than expected in the June
Report.

#### 2. Background analysis and discussion

The discussion touched on the evolution of the international scenario, noting the speed and magnitude of
its downturn. The fall in commodity prices was stressed, affecting not only those products most sensitive
to the economic cycle, such as copper, but also foods and energy, whose supply forces had been decisive
in recent months. There were also lower prospects for world growth and tightened financial conditions. All
these movements seemed to be linked to the inflationary cycle in the U.S. and the way the Federal Reserve
should respond, although other negative phenomena linked to the dynamics of the war and the uncertainty
about its repercussions in Europe could not be ruled out, which could also accentuate the downward risks
in our international scenario.

It was pointed out that, under normal circumstances of orderly macroeconomic conditions, it would be
natural to evaluate the recent macro developments and the monetary policy outlook, by placing more
weight on its medium-term effects than on the short-term inflationary impact. This was true both for
what was happening with the sharp depreciation of the peso and the evolution of the external scenario.
It was argued that, unfortunately, the Chilean economy was not in a normal situation; on the contrary, it
continued to show significant imbalances: the activity gap remained wide; inflation was at levels not seen
in many decades; and the current account deficit also showed very significant values. It was added that,
beyond the Bank’s active response to the strong inflationary outbreak, it was evident that inflation was


-----

still high and that its local drivers, particularly consumption, was yet to show clear signs of normalization,
beyond the fact that investment showed a clear weakness. Moreover, inflation expectations at different
terms were also markedly above the inflation target, reflecting a view of greater inflationary persistence.

The discussion focused on the events that were occurring the forex market, and there was agreement that
the situation should be monitored on an ongoing basis, since changes were taking place at unusual speed.
In fact, in recent days a significant increase in exchange rate volatility had been accumulating, which could
introduce a difference with respect to the assessment made early in that week. It was agreed that the
Bank had no limitations to act in the foreign exchange market, but that any action in this matter should be
analyzed on its merits, referring to the functioning of such market and its potential repercussions on other
segments of the financial market. Consistently, the Board agreed that, despite existing communicating
vessels, the monetary policy decision does not relate to a specific exchange rate level, but rather to the
evaluation of the inflationary implications of movements in the currency parity.

#### 3. Analysis of monetary policy options

The information received since the publication of the Report, particularly the short-term inflationary effect
of the peso’s sharp depreciation, indicated that the annual variation of the CPI would be higher than that
estimated in the last Report. In this context, just to ensure the same level of real interest rates as previously
considered, a higher level of nominal rate was required in the horizon in which inflation expectations had
risen. Meanwhile, it was estimated that the deterioration of financial conditions and the greater uncertainty
of the macro scenario would have a negative effect on demand in the coming quarters. Although no
projections were available at this Meeting to assess the medium-term trajectory of the MPR consistent with
these developments, all the Board members agreed that the recent indicators called for higher rates in the
short term, especially when the evolution of inflation expectations was factored in.

All five Board Members agreed that the background information presented suggested that, in order to
ensure the convergence of inflation to 3% over the policy horizon, it would be necessary to have a higher
MPR trajectory than the one estimated in the June Report. Accordingly, three options were analyzed: (i) to
raise the MPR by 50bp; (ii) to raise it by 75bp; and (iii) to raise it by 100bp.

There was agreement that the option of raising the MPR by 50bp did not seem consistent with the current
macro framework. It was pointed out that one way to consider this option valid would be to assume that
the new scenario would be associated with a further contraction in demand whose effects on prices would
offset much of the higher short-term inflation, which was seen as unlikely. One Board member mentioned
that this option could also be valid if less negative effect it would have on the already plummeting investment
was considered. Several Board members dismissed this option. One of them pointed out that, given the
evolution of the macro scenario, this option was not consistent with the monetary policy path required


-----

for inflation to converge to the 3% target within two years. Several Board Members added that a hike of
this magnitude was below expectations inferred from market prices, which could intensify exchange rate
volatility and eventually cause problems in other segments of the financial market.

All the Board Members agreed that the 75bp and 100bp options had the virtue of bringing the MPR closer
to a level that looked more in line with the monetary policy needed for inflation to converge to the target
within the two-year horizon.

In the Board’s opinion, choosing one or the other had to consider conflicting aspects, such as the risks
associated with higher inflationary pressures or medium-term contractionary forces. There was consensus
that beyond this assessment, it was quite likely that the process of raising the MPR should be continued
and that a 75bp hike provided more leeway for the assessment that would be included in the September
Monetary Policy Report.

#### 4. Monetary policy decision

Governor Costa, Vice-Governor García, and Board members Naudon, Céspedes, and Novy voted for raising
the MPR by 75bp, to 9.75%.
