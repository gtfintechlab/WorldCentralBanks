#### 1. Background analysis and discussion

The background information presented to the Board and the analysis thereof
are contained in June’s Monetary Policy Report. Broadly, these showed that the
evolution of the macroeconomy had reduced the risks facing the convergence of
inflation to 3% in the policy horizon. The economic recovery was consolidating,
inflation expectations at two years remained at 3%, while at shorter terms had
risen due to the direct impact of the oil price hike on the more volatile elements
of the CPI basket. In the baseline scenario, the trajectory of core inflation had
not changed much and would reach 3% by the end of 2019, although headline
inflation would do so sooner than expected. This, in a context where activity had
been a little above expectations in the first quarter of the year, due to (probably
transitory) surprises in supply sectors and stronger dynamism in areas relating
to investment and durable consumption. However, beyond some narrowing,


capacity gaps still persisted, as suggested by the evolution of labor market,
core inflation and capacity utilization indicators. In the baseline scenario, the
closing of these gaps would consolidate at a speed not very different from that
expected in March. This also considered that the impulse that the Chilean
economy would receive from abroad would be slightly milder than assumed in
the previous Report, because of somewhat less favorable financial conditions and
some decline in the terms of trade due to the higher oil price. In this context,
the Board had held the MPR at 2.5%, and reaffirmed that it would begin to
withdraw the monetary impulse insofar as macroeconomic conditions continued
to drive inflation to converge to 3%.

In discussing this background, all the participants agreed that the risks to
inflation’s convergence had decreased, as could be observed in the Report’s
baseline scenario projections and conjunctural analysis. In this regard, it was
mentioned that in recent months the process of economic rebound that had
begun in mid-2017, with activity levels that had advanced somewhat faster than
expected, had been established. In this context, it was noted that the gradual
closing of the capacity gaps caused by this acceleration, as had the reversal of
the trajectory of the nominal exchange rate —which, with fluctuations, had
been seen since the closing of the past Report— and the oil price increase, had
significantly reduced the risks that the low current inflation would hinder the
convergence of inflation to the target within the policy horizon.

About the evolution of activity, there was consensus among the participants
that its recent evolution reduced the risks of insufficient traction to ensure the
convergence of inflation to 3% within the policy horizon. However, several
participants acknowledged their concern about how consolidated and selfsustainable this improved economic performance was. It was mentioned, for
example, that some high-frequency data pointed to a good performance of
investment and consumption, such as imports, but at the same time other data,
more closely associated with construction, had a rather mixed nature. It was
also noted that the evolution of the labor market and of core inflation, especially
in its non-tradable component, were rather consistent with a scenario where
significant capacity gaps remained, which was endorsed in one way or another
by more qualitative evidence in the Business Perceptions Report and by largerscale investment plans that had not varied much in recent months.

There was debate around how much certainty there was about the lower risks
for the convergence of inflation, considering that there were still doubts about
the sustainability of the economic recovery. About this, it was mentioned that
although the process of closing gaps was far from over, it had been settling with
increasing clarity, coupled with the fact that the vision of inflationary weakness
that permeated part of the market was clearly retreating, as could be inferred
from the surveys and the different asset prices. It was noted that the effect of the
higher oil price on the short-term inflation projections, without being negligible,
was not a big factor in this risk assessment. It was mentioned that the reduction
of risks could also lean on the inflation acceleration observed lately.

#### 2. Analysis of monetary policy options[2]/

All five Board members agreed that, given the current economic conditions (as
detailed in the Report’s baseline scenario), the convergence of inflation to 3% in
the usual policy horizon was consistent with a monetary stimulus remaining near
its present levels at least for the rest of the year, as indicated in the latest Financial
Brokers Survey, and that would begin to be reduced towards its neutral levels
as macroeconomic conditions continued to drive the convergence of inflation
towards 3%. All the Board members thought that the option of increasing the
monetary impulse had become less relevant. In previous meetings, this option
had been justified mainly under a risk management argument to lower inflation
that could affect its convergence to the goal in the policy horizon. In line with
the Monetary Policy Report, as these risks had decreased significantly, it was
only logical for the option’s importance to follow suit. However, some Board
members considered that the option to lower the rate could still be relevant
to the extent that the risks associated with the external scenario materialized.
One Board member pointed out that the option to lower the MPR should be
included because CPI and CPIEFE inflation were on the edge of or outside the
tolerance range. At the same time, the option to raise it had to be included if
an important increase was anticipated in either, the CPI or the CPIEFE, even if
it responded to movements in the most volatile components of the basket. The
main arguments in favor and against of each of these options were the following:

**Option 1: holding the MPR at 2.5%**

All the Board members agreed that this option was fully consistent with the
baseline scenario in the June Monetary Policy Report and, in particular, with
the monetary policy strategy outlined in it. A further argument was the tight
anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations to the policy target and agents’
expectations for the monetary policy decision on this occasion. In addition, it
provided room for a timely reaction in case some of the risk scenarios came
true. In any case, the risks for inflation were perceived as unbiased, as the costs
of inflation deviating above or below its convergence trajectory were assumed
to be symmetrical.

**Option 2: raising the MPR by 25bp**

Several Board members noted that choosing an option like this one depended
on whether it was considered necessary to start the process of normalizing
the monetary stimulus sooner. In this regard, it was mentioned that it
seemed premature, considering that the Report’s baseline scenario assumed
that investment, while growing more than expected in March, had begun
strengthening only recently, with some mixed signs from construction and
waiting for the process to be consolidated at the level of large-scale projects.
Because of the direct impact on demand and activity, it was necessary to wait
and see the evolution of the cycle before deciding on a monetary policy option
such as this one. It was also pointed out that such an option would be justified
if there was certainty that the economic recovery was to be clearly faster, longer
lasting, more persistent, plus it was pushing inflation upwards. But now it was
still too early to be certain about the form this recovery would take in the coming
quarters, so deciding on how and when to withdraw the monetary stimulus
required one or two more quarters’ worth of information. It was mentioned
that although it was true that the economy was outperforming estimates, it
should also be kept in mind that this occurred in a context where no greater
cost-push or price-pull pressures were discernible, which could be consistent
with greater than estimated gaps in the economy. This, in addition, coincided
with the labor market showing no improvement and with some capacity use
indicators at low levels. Finally, it was also mentioned that a movement in this
direction would be completely unexpected and would give an unwarranted sign
of urgency regarding the concern about upward deviations of inflation, much
less now that CPIEFE inflation had not even reached 2%.

**Option 3: lowering the MPR by 25pb**

It was said that this option was losing strength in a scenario in which, since
the last Meeting, there had been only positive surprises on the activity side,
tinged in part by its transitory components, and a positive price shock in the
shortest term due to the oil price increase. It was said too that this option was
easy to rule out because the recovery was perceived to be more solid, and
although the creation of salaried jobs was yet to pick up, this did not seem to
be an impediment to the recovery. It was pointed out that if the MPR had not
been reduced two or three quarters ago, lowering it now would be inexplicable,
since the risks that justified it had diminished significantly. It was mentioned
that this option could continue to be valid if it was thought that the risks came
from the effects of the external scenario on activity and inflation. For example,
if the international scenario deteriorated further, as had happened in the past,
an additional monetary push could be required, due to its medium-term
disinflationary impact. However, taking an insurance based on such justification
would also be difficult to explain.

#### 3. Agreed policy action

The Board decided, with the votes of Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial
and Board members García, Costa and Naudon, to keep the monetary policy
interest rate at 2.5%.
