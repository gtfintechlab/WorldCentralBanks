#### 1. Background analysis and discussion

The information submitted to the Board and analysis thereof make up the
content of the September Monetary Policy Report. Overall, indicators received
over the year reflected more-than-expected economic growth and showed that
inflation had consolidated its prospects of converging to the target. This, in a
context of positive surprises in several economic sectors, an upward revision
to potential growth and a faster closing of the activity gap. Regarding inflation,
the annual CPI variation had risen to 2.7%, but its CPIEFE —CPI excluding
food and energy prices— counterpart was still below 2%, both in line with
expectations. The risks of the external scenario had become more present. The
US-China trade conflict had intensified, which, coupled with the cyclical state
of the US economy and its difference from that of other developed economies,
had caused a global appreciation of the dollar and a fall in commodity prices.
All this was having a stronger impact on those emerging economies seen as
more vulnerable. However, for the moment, global growth projections had
had limited changes.


About the domestic scenario, there was agreement that for several months there
had been a number of positive surprises in activity, which were already occurring
in more sectors and expenditure components, reflecting a stronger economy.
Also, the increase in potential GDP showed that the higher growth was not only
the effect of a cyclical upturn, but also represented a more structural behavior. It
was also noted that although July's activity data has seen a slowdown, it was fully
consistent with the baseline scenario of the September Report, which assumed
that, in line with the exhaustion of capacity gaps, growth rates would begin to
moderate in the second half of the year. Moreover, y-o-y variation figures would
decrease as the low basis of comparison of last year faded out.

There was debate about the evolution of the labor market, noting that the better
understanding of some key variables had allowed dissipating many doubts
about its strength. Although it had always been argued that the recovery of
employment should follow activity growth with some lag, only recently had
there been incipient increases in private salaried employment that had been
spreading to various sectors, while self-employment decelerated at the same
time. Meanwhile, a more in-depth review of the impact of immigration on the
labor market showed that, in principle, in the last two to three years many
more jobs had been created than was indicated by the surveys, whose designs
did not allow to properly capture demographic changes of such magnitude. In
addition, although compensation indicators pointed to an unusual deceleration
of wages, the Social Security administrative records did not support that vision.

About the evolution of inflation, there was agreement that there had been no
significant surprises, and that the increase in CPI inflation was an anticipated
development that owed mainly to the evolution of the more volatile prices,
since the CPIEFE was still below or near 2%. It was noted that the evolution of
inflation was consistent with the gradual closing of gaps in the economy and that
going forward the gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus needed restructuring
in proper balance with the closing of these capacities. It was also pointed out
that beyond the variations of the CPI in the short term or the temporary boost
that the exchange rate could cause, the focus was rather on the outlook for
inflation within the policy horizon, its relationship with the activity gaps and
the necessary reaction of monetary policy. In this sense, the projections pointed
to a faster convergence of inflation, both headline and core, to the policy target,
which came from a point where core inflation was still below 2%.

On the international economy, although the baseline scenario contained limited
downward revisions to growth in the world economy and our trading partners,
it was agreed that the risks associated with the external situation had increased
significantly, becoming the main source of uncertainty. It was pointed out that
the worsening of the economic outlook was more pronounced for emerging
economies, particularly because the perception of risk had increased and those
countries perceived as most vulnerable had suffered massive capital outflows. In
this context, the peso had depreciated, albeit less than the average of emerging
countries, despite a sharp adjustment in the copper price. The importance not
to downplay the magnitude of external risks was also stressed, especially in
the case of emerging countries. Today they were more significant, concrete and
complementary than they seemed a few months back.

#### 2. Analysis of monetary policy options[2]/

All five Board members agreed that both the analysis contained in the September
Report and incoming data after its statistical cutoff date indicated that the
evolution of macroeconomic conditions, and the convergence of inflation to 3%
in the usual horizon, made it less necessary to maintain the current monetary
stimulus. Given the medium-term implications of this scenario, the Board opined
that the monetary stimulus should begin to be reduced in the coming months
and that by 2020 it would stand around its neutral level, which was estimated
between 4% and 4.5%.

The monetary policy decision was taken in a context where the accumulation
of new data, its analysis and medium-term implications advised starting the
process of monetary normalization as soon as possible. In fact, in the context of
a strengthened economy, as time passed it was becoming more costly to delay
starting said process. On the other hand, although the evolution of the external
scenario caused some concern, it was important to draw a line between the
baseline scenario and its implications for monetary policy decisions and the risk
factors. These were two elements that unfortunately tended to be often confused
in the public discussion and that affected the perceptions of the situation and
economic perspectives. In short, in the presence of a recovering economy that
was growing above trend, with gaps that tended to close, and inflation that
would converge to 3% earlier than expected, it was logical to communicate
that the MPR had to begin an upward path.

2/ In order to preserve the regulatory individual anonymity in the discussion, all five Board members
are herein referred to as males, including female member Ms. Rosanna Costa.


**Option 1: Begin to withdraw the monetary stimulus**

The main argument for this option was that the evolution of macroeconomic
conditions and their immediate prospects were sufficient to push inflation to
3%, which warranted beginning the monetary policy rate normalization shortly.
Moreover, delaying it for too long would force to compress the adjustment
process into a shorter time span, leaving less space for taking pauses in the
process, which could be helpful in decanting information. In addition, the
current scenario —of above trend growth and inflation nearing the target— was
a quite different picture than last year's, when the economy was growing below
the trend and inflation was clearly below 3%. Therefore, the MPR, in one and
the other circumstance, obviously had to be different.

The main argument against this option was that raising the MPR at this Meeting
would be unexpected and, consequently, confusing, opposing the desirable
practices of a duly informed and anticipated policy. Although the market
could always be surprised, this entailed some costs and, therefore, doing so
required good reasons. At the same time, for the adjustment to be effective, it
was important that its foundation and opportunity be clear to the market. In
that sense, there were elements that interfered in that understanding. First, an
important gap between the diagnosis contained in the Report that would be
disclosed the next day and the current market perceptions, which take some
time to be assimilated. Second, a recent exchange rate escalation that could blur
the meaning of an MPR increase and inflation fundamentals to which the Board
assigned greater importance to make its decisions. Third, core inflation still
below 2% that could raise doubts about the immediate need for an adjustment.
Upon the release of the Monetary Policy Report, all the economic agents would
be in a better position to assess the situation and understand the adjustments
that were required in the monetary impulse.

**Option 2: keep the MPR at 2.5%**

The main argument in favor was that holding the MPR and communicating
that the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus would begin in the coming
months avoided upsetting the market, which could convey a sense of haste or
delay in the normalization process that was not consistent with the analysis

presented in the Report. Instead, it was said that the evolution of macroeconomic
conditions pointed clearly to the need for a gradual withdrawal of the monetary
stimulus. This would indicate that, as long as conditions didn’t change, there
was increasing probability that the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus would
begin sooner. It could also be argued that the option to keep the MPR unchanged
would allow collecting additional high-frequency information prior to taking
this first step. However, this argument seemed weaker, beyond certain recent
news that the market had read in an adverse way. The option would always be
present to pause and wait for more background data to enhance the diagnosis.
However, domestic risks were limited today while external risks would remain
there for a longer period of time.

#### 3. Monetary policy decision

The Board decided, with the votes of Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial,
and Board members García, Costa and Naudon, to keep the monetary policy
interest rate at 2.5%.
