#### 1. Background

**The international scenario**

On the external front, world inflation had been declining steadily, although it had moderated its pace due to
the high persistence of services components. In the United States of America, after a succession of upward
inflationary surprises during the first quarter of the year, the April figure had revealed a deceleration of
core inflation. In the Eurozone, inflation continued to subside, favored mostly by goods, and was slowly
converging to the target. In Latin America, both headline and core inflation had generally dropped further,
although its decline had slowed down due to some reversal in energy prices and the stabilization of goods
inflation. All of it in a context of inflation expectations remaining above the target in several economies in
the region, with the exception of Chile.

This was taking place while economic activity and prospects that had remained contained, beyond some
signs of an upturn earlier this year. In China, activity had accelerated in the first quarter 2024, while
investment maintained marked heterogeneity between the deteriorated residential sector and the progress
displayed by the other sectors, while consumption remained weak. Expectations for the rest of the year
for the Chinese economy had not changed much with respect to forecasts in our March Monetary Policy
Report (IPoM). The Eurozone had shown signs of a recovery, aided by services, while the manufacturing

industry continued to linger behind. The U.S. remained the exception, as its economy remained resilient,
favored by dynamic domestic demand due mainly by services consumption. Meanwhile, the labor market
remained strong throughout the first quarter; job creation, after several months posting rises unexpected
by the market, had shown signs of moderation in April.

In this scenario, doubts about when the Fed would begin reducing the interest rates were the main factor
behind the movements of global financial markets. Upward surprises in inflation, activity and the labor
market in the U.S. economy had driven the markets to revisit their predictions about monetary policy,
assuming that the rate cuts this year would be smaller than they considered in March. Compared with the
April Meeting, long-term interest rates and stock markets had increased moderately in several economies.
The global dollar, despite fluctuations, remained at similar levels-.

As for commodities, worth noting was the substantial increase in the copper price, to nearly US$4.9 per
pound (+22% since the April Meeting). This evolution would have been related to news about supply
constraints, which contrasted with still strong demand associated with copper usage for the energetic
transition. Oil was trading at around US$81 per barrel (WTI-Brent average), which represented a fall of
around 6% since the April Meeting, due to a relative stabilization of geopolitical conflicts and weak demand
for gasoline in the United States. The prices of cereals had risen, largely because of weather phenomenon
that affected the supply outlook.

**The domestic scenario**

On aggregate, March and April inflation had been in line with forecasts in the March IPoM. Thus, the annual
CPI variation —spliced benchmark series— was 3.5% for both headline and core inflation—the latter being
the CPI without volatiles. As for inflation expectations two years ahead, both our Economic Expectations
Survey (EEE) and Financial Traders Survey (EOF) stood at 3%.

First-quarter National Accounts showed that, overall, the economy had performed in line with forecasts
in the March IPoM. In deseasonalized terms, GDP had grown 1.9% with respect to the previous quarter,
a result to which mining, trade and some services had contributed significantly. In annual terms, GDP
variation was 2.3%. On the demand side, quarter-on-quarter consumption had risen again. Gross fixed
capital formation variation was almost flat. The labor market behaved consistently with the trajectory of the
cycle, the unemployment rate stood at 8.7% in the moving quarter ending in March, while the labor force
was expanding steadily. Wages were still on a recovery path. The expectations of businesses (IMCE) and
households (IPEC) remained pessimistic, beyond marginal changes in opposite directions.

In the Chilean financial market, movements of both long-term interest rates and stock prices matched those
of its international peers. In turn, the peso had appreciated more than other comparable currencies and had
strengthened around 8% against the dollar. This evolution owed mainly to the higher copper price, among
other reasons.

Regarding credit, our Bank Lending Survey for the first quarter 2024 reported that lending conditions
offered by banks showed no significant change from the previous quarter, while demand for credit was
perceived to be weaker. In that context, real consumer and commercial loans posted changes of –1.3%
and –3.7% in April, respectively. In the housing segment, credit showed limited growth, at 2.6% in real
annual terms in the same month. Lending interest rates, especially short term, continued to reflect the passthrough of the cuts to the monetary policy rate (MPR), although at different paces. Mortgage rates, more
closely related to long-term credit, remained high, while delinquency remained high in every portfolio.

Both the EEE and the EOF surveys, combined with prospects implicit in financial asset prices reflected
expectations that, at this Meeting, the MPR would be reduced by 50 basis points (bp). In turn, while the
EEE anticipated that the MPR would be at 4.5% in one year, the EOF and the forward curve placed such
expectation at 4.75%.

#### 2. Background analysis and discussion

It was mentioned that the world economy had performed relatively in line with assumptions in the latest
IPoM. The biggest news was the sharp increase in the price of copper, which had traded above US$5 per
pound, but had shown some declines in the last few days. It was noted that said copper price hike could
lead to revisions in the external boost to the Chilean economy. This assessment, however, required careful
analysis of the degree of persistence of this shock and also of the pass-through mechanisms to the domestic
economy. In the short term, the lower exchange rate could ease inflationary pressures. Into the medium
term, this could be more than offset by the greater dynamism of activity. Overall, careful evaluation of the
economy’s responses was also needed, as these could be different from what had been the case in the past,
particularly during the commodity super-cycle of the early 2010s.

It was noted that, aside from the potential impact of the copper price increase, there were other elements
to review to yield a correct estimate of the inflationary pressures the economy would encounter with two
years. On one hand, there was the dynamic of investment and credit, both of which were evolving in line
with forecasts, but continued monitoring was required. It was mentioned that the first technical report of
the National Energy Commission, which implemented the law to stabilize electric power rates enacted in
late April, would be known almost simultaneously with this Meeting taking place. Preliminary antecedents
did not rule out the possibility of several increases in rates, which would be greater than those considered
in the current central scenario, so its implications would have to be carefully evaluated in the next IPoM.

The discussion turned to the interest rate structure that prevailed in the market and whether it was
consistent with the monetary impulse that the economy required. At the time of the Meeting, the market
curve signaled a string of limited cuts that would place the MPR at 5% at the end of 2024, to then stay
at 4.75% throughout the policy horizon. In real terms, this involved a rate above the ceiling of the current

neutral MPR estimate range, a situation that needed to be analyzed. Several reasons were brought up to
explain why this could be happening, including a different assessment of the neutral MPR and the expected
monetary policy trajectory of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

#### 3. Analysis of monetary policy options

All five Board members agreed that information received since the last Meeting indicated that further cuts
to the MPR were needed. The macroeconomic scenario was evolving in line with assumptions in the March
IPoM, so the monetary policy strategy communicated at that time remained in effect. In this scenario, all the
Board members considered 50bp and 75bp cuts to be plausible options.

There was consensus among the Board members that both options met the need to continue reducing the
MPR, thus reflecting the economy’s progress in resolving the significant macroeconomic imbalances and the
process of inflationary convergence. Still, given its coherence with the March central scenario, the option of
lowering the MPR by 50bp clearly dominated when the two alternatives were contrasted.

Furthermore, the 50bp-cut option had the great advantage that it was widely expected, so it would cause
no significant changes in market prices. It was emphasized that adopting this decision did not imply that
the Board followed the market to make its decision. Quite the contrary, it had been market expectations
that had adjusted to the Board’s communication in the March IPoM, with an MPR corridor that contained a
reduction of that magnitude in the central scenario. Therefore, lowering the MPR by 50 bp only reinforced
the previous message, which the market had made its own after the publication of the Report.

#### 4. Monetary policy decision

Governor Costa, Vice-Governor Novy and Board members Naudon, Céspedes and Soto voted in favor of
lowering the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points, to 6%.
