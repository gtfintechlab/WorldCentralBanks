#### 1. Background

The local economy had evolved in line with forecasts in the March Monetary Policy Report (IPoM). Activity
was heading to a growth path consistent with its trend, but showing heterogeneity across sectors. It was
worth noting that, as expected, part of the higher growth early in the year had come from supply factors
that had been reversing. At the same time, differences continued to be observed in the performance of the
economic sectors, especially in the dynamism of services, better figures in some trade branches and poor
construction activity.

Domestic demand was outperforming expectations to some extent, particularly in consumption. The
gradual recovery of household spending was taking place in the context of an increase in employment and
real wages, sustaining the growth of the wage bill. As for Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), although
still weak, the deterioration observed in the second half of last year had ceased, reflecting a more stable
behavior of both machinery & equipment and construction & works. In any case, all GFCF components
continued to contract year by year.

Annual growth in the total CPI remained around 3.5%, while core CPI (i.e., without volatile items)
dropped from 4.2% to 3.5% between February and May (spliced series). In cumulative terms, both


-----

measures were in line with forecasts. The annual change of services CPI excluding volatiles had dropped
considerably from late 2023 (from 7% in December to 5.3% in May), reflecting indexation to lower
inflation rates in the period that is most intensive in past-inflation adjustments. Inflation expectations at
two years remained at 3%.

The global economy continued to be dominated by the adjustment of expectations for monetary policy in
the United States. World growth projections showed minor changes, although it was still necessary to bear
in mind that several economies were performing somewhat better than expected.

Regarding projections, local inflation was expected to rebound significantly and that convergence to the
target would occur in the first half of 2026. This reflected the impact of the supply shock associated with
the electricity prices hike and the greater momentum of domestic demand, considering early-year data and
the higher copper price.

About activity, the contractionary effect of energy costs on real household income was counterbalanced by
the greater momentum of domestic spending given its improved fundamentals, and a higher copper price
projection. The metal’s value had risen sharply in recent months and the projection scenario assumed that
more than half of this increase would be permanent.

#### 2. Background analysis and discussion

There was important news in the global scenario. On the one hand, a postponement of the monetary
easing in the United States was foreseen, which had put new pressures on the dollar at the global level.
On the other hand, both the current and the expected copper price had risen. At the same time, longterm interest rates were high and were becoming more sensitive to changes in expectations regarding
the Federal Reserve’s next decisions. The backdrop for this was higher uncertainty regarding several more
structural global factors.

Locally, it had been confirmed that part of the surprises observed at the beginning of this year had proved
transitory, for both activity and inflation. It was also worth noting the appreciation of the peso and marginal
data suggesting that domestic demand could be showing more dynamism. It was mentioned that the analysis
included in the June IPoM indicated that commercial credit was performing in line with its fundamentals.
However, incoming data showed a further weakening that called for close monitoring, as it could be
signaling a less favorable behavior in some demand components in the near future.

Two facts stood out regarding the central scenario projections in the June IPoM. First, the data for the last
few months were in line with expectations, although demand showed a somewhat better performance
than expected in the first quarter, which provided a more dynamic starting point for spending. Second,


-----

there were two factors that would have a significant impact on the evolution of inflation. On the one hand,
the somewhat stronger domestic demand, in a context where the higher copper price boosted up the terms
of trade. On the other, the impact of successive increases in the electric bill over the coming quarters.

Regarding the factor first mentioned above, it was commented in the short term the copper price hike had
generated an appreciation of the currency —with the resulting downward impact on inflationary pressures.
Nonetheless, in the medium term, given the persistent nature of a part of the shock, domestic spending
would strengthen, which would add to inflationary pressures. Thus, part of this effect would be transmitted
to the external sector via imports.

As for the second factor, the rise in the electric bill would be of such a magnitude that, other things being
equal, it would have a significant effect on the CPI, especially in 2025. The most likely scenario considered
that it would have a limited effect on medium-term inflation, as it was a one-time supply shock to the
price level. Nevertheless, it was pointed out that there were scenarios in which the spillover mechanisms of
this shock could make its inflationary effects more persistent than expected assuming the usual historical
patterns. This could occur due to the importance of energy as a production input or due to the indexation
processes to which the economy was subject. Meanwhile, the effects on households’ disposable income
had to be factored in, as they could weaken demand beyond expectations.

It was noted that the central projection scenario considered that, while important, the impact of this shock
was transitory, and therefore contained a monetary policy response that on average did not alter the real
monetary impulse considered in the March Report. It could even be argued that the monetary policy was
somewhat more expansionary if the better scenario of aggregate demand resulting from improved terms
of trade and slightly higher growth of trading partners was taken into account. In any case, there was
agreement on the need for caution, as the evolution of inflation expectations and the impact of the spillover
mechanisms on all other prices called for careful observation.

#### 3. Analysis of monetary policy options

All the Board members agreed that the macroeconomic scenario had evolved as foreseen in March. In this
context, the local economy was returning to a growth path consistent with its trend and inflation continued
to slow, with two-year inflation expectations remaining at 3%. The novelties of the central projection
scenario were the better starting point of domestic demand, supported by the higher copper price, and the
adjustment of electricity prices, which would significantly impact inflation, particularly in 2025.

There was agreement that the two most important developments in the projection scenario suggested a
path for the nominal MPR somewhat above that considered in March, as contained in the June IPoM. The
Board remarked on the effect that the electricity rate hike would have on inflation, but also noted that,


-----

given its characteristics, a transitory supply shock, the monetary policy was capable of accommodating it
without the nominal MPR having an equivalent reaction to the inflation hike. It was stressed that this was
conditional on the second-round effects being in line with the forecast, which would be a matter for the
Board to carefully evaluate.

All five Board members agreed that the current MPR level was still above the neutral values that had been
estimated in late 2023, so monetary policy was still contractionary in nature. For the same reason, as long
as activity gaps remained relatively closed, medium-term inflationary pressures were in line with the target
being achieved and expectations remaining anchored at 3%, the MPR should continue to be reduced over
the monetary policy horizon. In the immediate term, the central scenario of the June IPoM estimated that
the MPR had accumulated during the first half of the year the bulk of this year’s expected cuts. Consistent
with this, all the Board members evaluated the option of lowering the MPR by 25 basis points (bp) to be
plausible. Several Board members evaluated the options of lowering it by 50 bp or keeping it at 6%.

About the decision to cut 25bp off the MPR, it was noted that this option was the most consistent one with
the IPoM’s central scenario. It had the advantage of clearly stating that, despite how important the shock
on inflation was, it was transitory, and monetary policy could accommodate it by further reducing the MPR
in the quarters ahead. Moreover, it was a decision that, if the central scenario proved true, it left room for
a further reduction in the remainder of the year.

As for the options of cutting 50 bp off the MPR or keeping it unchanged, it was said that they were valid
insofar as the sensitivity scenarios defining the MPR corridor were given more weighting. On the one hand,
the option of keeping the rate unchanged was consistent with a scenario where the impact on inflation of
the higher expenditure and the supply shock would exceed the forecast, leading to a more contractionary
than expected monetary policy. It was added that, because most of the MPR adjustments had been made in
the first part of the year, it was possible to monitor the evolution of the scenario. In turn, the option to cut
50bp was based on a less benign reading of recent spending developments, a more negative view on the
weakness of commercial credit according to the latest data, or that the negative effects of the electric utility
rate hike on disposable income would be larger than expected. In contrast to the option of reducing the
MPR by 50bp, it was mentioned that, if the central scenario were to materialize, that decision could force a
prolonged pause in the process of reductions. Regarding the option to maintain the policy rate unchanged
it was mentioned that it could send the wrong signal about the risks that the Board was analyzing.

#### 4. Monetary policy decision

Governor Costa and Board members Naudon, Céspedes and Soto voted for lowering the monetary policy
rate by 25 basis points, to 5.75%. Vice-Governor Novy voted for lowering it by 50 basis points.
