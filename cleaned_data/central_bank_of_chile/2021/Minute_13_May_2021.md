#### 1. Background

##### The domestic scenario

Activity had grown well above estimates. The March Imacec had risen 6.4% annually, having decreased
only 1.6% with respect to February, despite the fact that in that month the number of quarantined
people had soared to more than 80% of the national population. This suggested, in part, that agents had
adapted better to the sanitary context, which was also expected to be reflected in a lower impact of the
quarantines in April and May, which was already evident in the data on mobility, electricity generation
and sales with digital invoices and receipts. By sectors, trade continued to lead as the best performer.
Construction and services, although maintaining their recovery trend, had not yet reached pre-pandemic
levels of activity, while manufacturing and mining had already done so. On the domestic spending side,
incoming data indicated that consumption remained dynamic, supported by the high liquidity resulting
from income support measures, as evidenced by the retail trade activity index (INE) and automobile sales
(ANAC). Regarding investment, the rebound in capital goods imports continued to give signs of recovery.

In this scenario, growth expectations for this year contained in the May Economic Expectations Survey (EES)
had been adjusted upwards to 6.2% annually (5.3% in March).

Additional information compiled in the May Business Perceptions Report (IPN) showed that, despite the
negative effects of the tightening of sanitary restrictions on performance since March, the respondents
were still betting on a better 2021 than 2020, although with heterogeneity among different sectors and
company sizes. In any case, the uncertainty related to the pandemic, particularly regarding sanitary measures
and, to a lesser extent, the political scenario, had increased from a few months before, which had led in
some cases to hiring and investment plans being postponed or cancelled.

The labor market was showing a significant rise from the poor employment levels of mid last year, with
magnitudes varying depending on the occupational category and economic sector. There were also
differences across multiple sources of information. Thus, while the data on the number of dependent
contributors of the pension fund system (AFPs) suggested that formal salaried employment was already
nearing its pre-pandemic level, INE data pointed to a milder rebound. For their part, hours actually worked
had decreased since the previous Meeting, in a context of still constrained labor supply. A large number of
respondents to the May IPN reported difficulties in recruiting personnel, especially lower-skilled workers. This
was related, in their opinion, to fear of contagion, increased income support measures including pension
savings withdrawals. The Internet Job Postings Index and IMCE hiring expectations continued to reflect
higher labor demand, although with some pullback in the latter in April.

Some idiosyncratic elements were gaining relevance in the behavior of the local financial market. In the
fixed-income segment, the 10-year nominal rate had risen by 30 to 40 basis points (bp) more than its
developed-economy counterparts since the beginning of March. Nominal and UF-indexed 2-year bonds
had accumulated significant increases, i.e., more than 70 bp in indexed ones since the previous Meeting,
where the discussion around a possible transitory reduction of the VAT was among the main factors behind
the correction. Meanwhile, the IPSA had fallen, while the exchange rate had appreciated, amid a sustained
copper price increase to near record highs. After the approval of the third withdrawal of pension savings,
the Bank had once again launched extraordinary measures to contain the financial volatility that could result
from the associated adjustments to pension fund portfolios, including reopening the CC-VP.

As for bank credit, the activity of Fogape-Reactiva had continued on the rise, with disbursements close to
US$4.5 billion and operations concentrated in smaller companies according to the latest available data.
This program continued to underpin the performance of commercial loans, whose real annual growth had,
however, turned negative. The high basis of comparison was relevant here, since in the same period last
year many companies had drawn on bank credit lines to ensure liquidity at a time of high uncertainty. The
consumer portfolio had reduced its annual contraction and the housing portfolio maintained a relatively
stable performance (-16% and 4.8%, respectively in real annual terms in April). Interest rates remained low
for all credit users. In terms of risk indicators, the banking system’s delinquency rate remained contained
overall. For consumer loans, in recent months this had played a part in the decline in provisions.

The Bank Lending Survey (BLS) for the first quarter reported a more dynamic supply for smaller companies,
which was partly related to a lower perception of risk in this segment, aided by the continuity of credit support
measures. The survey also reported a rebound in firms’ requests for funds, especially for working capital, as
was also confirmed by May’s IPN. However, the latter also revealed that a fraction of the companies needing
financing did not request it because of capacity issues, financial burden or unfavorable conditions, among
other reasons. For households, the BLS revealed an improvement in both demand and lending standards
in the consumer portfolio. IPN respondents linked to the banking sector added that the requirements for
access to this type of credit were again similar to those in force prior to the pandemic, although a good part
of these operations continued to be for portfolio purchases.

Annual inflation, both headline and core (i.e. CPI without volatiles) had continued to hover at around 3%.
In the latest monthly figures—March and April—price hikes for gasoline and some foodstuffs had stood out
again. This was compounded with an incipient rebound in the prices of non-managed or indexed services,
as well as continued high demand and difficulties in the production and supply of several high-demand
goods. This had been confirmed by interviewees in and respondents to the survey of the May IPN, who
reported cost pressures in a greater number of sectors, which had often translated into price increases.
Business expectations (IMCE) continued to reflect the prospect of cost increases going forward. One- and
two-year-ahead market expectations for inflation were still standing around 3% annually, according to the
May EES and the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) prior to this Meeting.

Regarding the unconventional measures in place, nearly 75% of the total FCIC3 available had been used
up. In turn, since January the asset purchase program had been reinvesting coupons at maturity, a policy
that would be maintained until June. Thereafter, the stock would be gradually reduced as the assets in the
portfolio matured.

In this context, MPR expectations in the surveys (EES and FTS) showed increases of 25 to 50 pb one year
ahead, while the prices of financial assets pointed to a rise of around 100 pb.

##### The international scenario

The international outlook was still evolving favorably, with global growth projections consolidating steadily.
This, in a context in which the improved evolution of the pandemic and speed of vaccination had made
it possible to relax sanitary restrictions, especially in developed economies. In particular, the dynamism of
the United States during the first quarter (6.4 q-o-q annualized) stood out, consolidating a recovery driven
by consumption. The Eurozone, on the other hand, had contracted in the first quarter, as a result of the
extension and intensification of tightening measures during the first months of the year. However, the latest
indicators showed a rebound in confidence and outlook, anticipating a faster recovery in the second half of
the year, supported by progress in the vaccination processes, the high savings accumulated by households,
and the fiscal stimulus plans. In the emerging world, China had seen positive quarterly growth, despite the
reinstated restrictions during the period, with a more dynamic industrial sector, services that continued
to recover and a solid external economy. In Latin America, activity had shown some resilience, although

the worsening sanitary situation in several countries in the region, in the midst of sluggish vaccination
processes, was compounded by some idiosyncratic factors of political and economic nature, which weakened
expectations going forward.

International financial markets maintained a positive tone, encouraged by the sustained improvement in
global growth expectations, mainly in developed countries. Since the March meeting, stock market indexes
had risen and risk premiums in an important group of economies (EMBI and CEMBI) had fallen further,
while most currencies had appreciated against the dollar and capital was flowing into the emerging bloc.
Meanwhile, long-term interest rates remained above those of the beginning of the year, but still low by
historical standards. Commodity prices had risen across the board, particularly for oil and copper, with the
latter hovering around US$4.8 per pound on some days of May. Rising commodity prices, together with
higher effective inflation registers, greater cost pressures and strong incentives to demand had increased
concerns about inflation—specially in the U.S.—which had led to some volatility in the financial markets.
While most monetary authorities had maintained their stimulus policies, some had already announced
or started the withdrawal of some of the unconventional measures, particularly in countries that already
presented better growth prospects or were seeing inflationary risks.

#### 2. Background analysis and discussion

About the international scenario, it was stressed that the Chilean economy would receive a considerable
external impulse this year. Global growth had consolidated with good numbers in the main economies,
while financial conditions continued to be very positive and the main central banks remained committed
towards highly expansionary policies. Last but not least, the prices of copper and other commodities had far
exceeded projections. Although some correction was to be expected, it was clear that on average they would
be well above estimates of just a few weeks before. In any case, it was also pointed out that, particularly in
the United States, the macro policy mix seemed to be incubating inflationary risks that were not negligible.
For the moment, this phenomenon was mostly circumscribed to the US economy, but there were reasonable
doubts as to how widespread it might be across the world. In fact, this heightened concern about inflation
had fueled some recent adjustments in the markets, although expectations remained anchored.

On the domestic front, the favorable evolution of demand and activity indicators was noted, as it had been
outperforming expectations since the end of last year. This occurred in a context in which the evolution
of the external scenario had so far been beneficial for Chile, boosting foreign trade and facilitating the
execution of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. Also noteworthy were the improved capacity of
companies to adapt to the sanitary restrictions, a positive flow of credit oriented to the worst affected
companies, a substantial volume of support to households suffering income losses, and substantial progress
in the Covid-19 vaccination program.

Nonetheless, it was noted that the application of new quarantines, lags in the recovery of the labor market and
political tensions had significantly deteriorated consumer and, though somewhat less, business expectations.
This negative climate had led to significant benefit extensions for households and small businesses, reflected
in a third pension savings withdrawal approved in April and in the ongoing discussion about extensions to
the coverage and amounts of fiscal transfers to households. The combination of these factors had resulted
in increases in long-term interest rates on local bonds in excess of those on U.S. Treasury bonds.

Regarding credit, it was mentioned that the annual variation rate of the stock of commercial loans was
beginning to turn negative in real terms. Although this seemed to be largely explained by the high basis
of comparison, another possibility was that, once the most difficult stage of the sanitary emergency was
over and a sales had recovered, many companies had begun to reduce their future financial burden, either
through amortizations or rescheduling. On the other hand, the fall in the stock of consumer loans was
consistent with the increase in household liquidity provided by pension fund withdrawals and transfers from
the Treasury.

On the labor market, attention was drawn to the fact that the data showed both employment and wages
were improving. However, it was also pointed out that the employment increases were concentrated mostly
in salaried jobs, while self-employment lagged far behind. The data also showed a still very slow recovery in
labor force participation, which was consistent with the difficulties faced by caregivers of children, the sick
and the elderly, in a context of pandemics, on-line schooling and closed medical and elderly care centers.
All in all, it was pointed out that, beyond the differences across multiple indicators, it was clear that the
recovery of the labor market was quite significant with respect to the lowest point associated with the
pandemic.

The changes that had occurred in some of the risks identified in March were also noted. On the one hand,
the risks related to the pandemic had moderated, particularly because the progress made in the vaccination
campaign opened up the prospect of a sooner, albeit partial, return to normal life. This fact, as well as
available first-quarter data, the greater adaptation of the economy and the increases in stimulus measures
made it possible to dispel scenarios of a weaker recovery in consumption or a greater-than-expected effect
of quarantines. On the other hand, idiosyncratic risks had become more prevalent, as could be inferred from
market prices. Accordingly, the exchange rate seemed to have appreciated less than expected considering
the increase in the copper price, and sovereign rates incorporated external developments, but also term
premiums more closely associated with local factors. All this occurred in a context of heightened political
tension and new legislative initiatives that, beyond their short-term benefits, would impose costs that would
have to be assumed in the medium and long term. On top of it, there was the greater concern about global
inflation, which was becoming one of the main medium-term risks in the financial markets.

#### 3. Analysis of monetary policy options

All five Board members agreed that the recent evolution of the external and internal scenarios, the stronger
fiscal impulse and boost to private consumption that the additional stimulus packages would entail, plus
the reduction of some risks, permitted estimating that Chile’s economic outlook was now significantly
improved compared with estimates in the March Monetary Policy Report. This positioned our economy near
the positive sensitivity considered in the scenarios of that MP Report.

In any case, the Board agreed that the moment the normalization process would begin remained highly
uncertain. In particular, because despite the greater expansion of demand and activity, other factors also
had to be considered when assessing medium-term inflationary pressures, including the persistence of the
lags in the sectors most affected by the pandemic, the labor market’s evolution, and possible structural
changes caused by the crisis itself.

All the Board members agreed that the June MP Report would be particularly relevant to elucidate some of
these issues. By that time, April activity data would be available, so it would be possible to verify how much
more resilient the Chilean economy had become to quarantines such as the one initiated in late March
that had involved a major portion of the population. By then, the initial impact on private consumption of
the third pension savings withdrawal, which was preliminarily estimated to be less than for the previous
two, could also be assessed. In the political sphere, by the June MP Report, the election process would
have already been completed and the conversations regarding the adjustment of government support to
households and small businesses would have been advanced or even concluded. With respect to sanitary
matters, progress in the vaccination campaign and its impact on the dynamics of the pandemic could be
evaluated with greater certainty. In addition, the June MP Report would contain an update of the structural
parameters of trend growth and the neutral interest rate, which would allow for a reassessment of the
activity gap and the degree of expansiveness of monetary policy. Consequently, all the Board Members
agreed that it was prudent to hold back any substantive definition on the future evolution of the monetary
policy for that instance, keeping the MPR at its technical minimum at the present Meeting.

#### 4. Monetary policy decision

Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Naudon, and Costa voted for holding
the MPR at 0.5%. They also agreed to effect no changes to the unconventional liquidity and credit support
measures.
