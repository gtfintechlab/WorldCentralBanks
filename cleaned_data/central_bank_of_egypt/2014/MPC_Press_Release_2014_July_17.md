**Press Release**

**July 17, 2014**

**_In its meeting held on July 17, 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to_**
**_raise the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main_**
**_operation by 100 basis points to 9.25 percent, 10.25 percent, and 9.75 percent,_**
**_respectively. The discount rate was also raised by 100 basis points to 9.75 percent._**

Headline CPI increased by 0.84 percent (m/m) in June compared to a decline of 0.73
percent (m/m) in May while the annual rate remained broadly unchanged at 8.20 percent
in June. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.68 percent (m/m) in June compared to
a decline of 0.23 percent in May, while the annual rate decreased to 8.76 percent in June
down from 8.86 percent in May on the back of favorable base effect from last year. The
quarter ending June 2014 has witnessed a notable slowdown in the prices of several food
items which have been reflected in the tame monthly growth rates of both headline and
core inflation. Moreover, as the possibility of a sharp rebound in international food prices
is unlikely in light of recent global developments, upside risks to the inflation outlook from
imported inflation continue to be contained.

Meanwhile, real GDP picked up slightly in 2013/2014 Q3, growing by 2.50 percent
compared to the 1.04 and 1.44 percent recorded in the previous two quarters,
respectively. This brought the annual growth for the first nine months of 2013/2014 to
1.65 percent compared to the growth rate of 2.31 percent during the corresponding
period of 2012/2013. The slight pickup in economic activity during 2013/2014 Q3 came on
the back of the pickup in the growth rates in the two key sectors, namely manufacturing
and construction, despite the contraction witnessed in the tourism and petroleum sectors.
In the meantime, investment levels continue to be low despite the relative improvement
witnessed in the annual growth rate, which registered 2.50 percent after six quarters of
contraction. Looking ahead, downside risks that surround the global recovery on the back
of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could
pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forward.

The government has revised up the prices of several regulated items within the CPI basket
including fuel, electricity, and tobacco as part of the 2014/2015 fiscal consolidation plan.
While the fiscal consolidation will improve the fiscal sustainability over the medium-term,
a relative price increase is inevitable. The direct first round effect of these price
adjustments will lead to a level shift up in the headline CPI for July 2014, while the indirect
and second round effects could be reflected in both the headline and core inflation rates
during the quarter ending September 2014 at varying degrees, which pose an upside risk
to the inflation outlook. Therefore, while the MPC acknowledges the favorable mediumterm effect of the fiscal measures, it is mindful to the importance of anchoring inflation
expectations.


-----

Against this background and given the balance of risks, the MPC judges that a preemptive
rate hike is warranted to anchor inflation expectations and hence limit a generalized price
increase, which is detrimental to the economy over the medium-term.

However, the MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will
not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‚Äêterm.
