Headline CPI accelerated by 3.51 percent (m/m) in July compared to 0.84 percent
(m/m) in June, while the annual rate jumped to register 11.04 percent in July from
8.20 percent in June. In early July, the government launched its fiscal consolidation
program, adjusting upwards the prices of several regulated prices including diesel,
benzene, electricity and tobacco. The direct effect of these price adjustments
explained the bulk of the monthly price developments. Moreover, increases in the
prices of inland transportation, fresh vegetables & fruits and other food items can be
partly attributed to the indirect effects of the regulated price adjustments as well as
the seasonal effect of Ramadan. In the meantime, core CPI increased by 1.79 percent
(m/m) in July compared to 0.68 percent (m/m) in June, while the annual rate
increased to 9.57 percent in July compared to 8.76 percent in June and was partially
limited by a favorable base effect from the previous year.

While the direct first round effect of the price adjustments have led to a level shift
up in the headline CPI in July 2014, higher than anticipated indirect and second
round effects pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook. On the other hand, as the
possibility of a sharp rebound in international food prices is unlikely in light of recent
global developments, upside risks to the inflation outlook from imported inflation
continue to be contained.

Meanwhile, real GDP picked up slightly in 2013/2014 Q3, growing by 2.50 percent
compared to the 1.04 and 1.44 percent recorded in the previous two quarters,
respectively. This brought the annual growth for the first nine months of 2013/2014
to 1.65 percent compared to the growth rate of 2.31 percent during the
corresponding period of 2012/2013. The slight pickup in economic activity during
2013/2014 Q3 came on the back of the pickup in the growth rates in the two key
sectors, namely manufacturing and construction, despite the contraction witnessed
in the tourism and petroleum sectors. In the meantime, investment levels continue
to be low despite the relative improvement witnessed in the annual growth rate,
which registered 2.50 percent after six quarters of contraction.

Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects such as the Suez Canal
are expected to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that surround
the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening
growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GDP going
forward.

At this juncture, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate to
anchor inflation expectations and limit a generalized price increase given the lagged
transmission of the previous rate hike across the economy and the balance of risks
surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not
hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-term.
