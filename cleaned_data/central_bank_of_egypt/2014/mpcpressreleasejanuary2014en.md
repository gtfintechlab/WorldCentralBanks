Headline CPI declined by 1.02 percent (m/m) in December after recording an increase of
0.95 (m/m) in November, bringing the annual rate to 11.66 percent in December down
from 12.97 percent in the previous month. Monthly developments in headline inflation
during 2013 Q4 were largely driven by higher prices of several food items and a number of
non‐food items. Additional upward pressure came on the back of a sharp rise in the prices
of butane gas cylinders in light of bottlenecks in the distribution channels which relatively
eased in December. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.41 percent (m/m) in
December following an increase of 0.46 percent in November on the back of the above
mentioned increases in food and non‐food prices. Despite of the monthly increase, the
annual rate remained broadly unchanged standing at 11.91 percent in December
compared to 11.95 percent in November on the back of favorable base effects from last
year. As upside risks to the inflation outlook continue to moderate as the possibility of a
rebound in international food prices is unlikely in light of recent global developments,
annual inflation is projected to ease from their current levels in the coming months.

Meanwhile, real GDP continued to lose some of its already weak momentum in 2013/2014
Q1, growing by 1.04 percent compared to the feeble growth rate of 2.1 percent recorded
in 2012/2013. Economic activity remained sluggish in 2013/2014 Q1 on the back of
modest growth rates in most of the key sectors, namely manufacturing and construction
in addition to the contraction in the tourism and petroleum sectors. In the meantime,
investment levels remained low given the heightened uncertainty that faced market
participants since early 2011 and the weak credit growth to the private sector. Looking
ahead, downside risks that surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing
the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to
domestic GDP going forward.

The pronounced downside risks to domestic GDP combined with the persistently negative
output gap since 2011 will limit upside risks to the inflation outlook going forward. Given
the mixed balance of risks surrounding the inflation and the GDP outlooks at this juncture,
MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriate.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate
to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐term.
