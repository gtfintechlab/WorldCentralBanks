**Press Release**

**January 28, 2016**

**_In its meeting held on January 28, 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to_**
**_keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main_**
**_operation unchanged at 9.25 percent, 10.25 percent, and 9.75 percent, respectively. The_**
**_discount rate was also kept unchanged at 9.75 percent._**

Annual headline CPI remained largely unchanged at 11.06 percent in December 2015, despite
the slight monthly decline of 0.09 percent (m/m). The monthly outturn was largely subdued on
the back of the seasonal decrease in volatile food prices, in addition to the muted movement in
the prices of other food, supported by recent government measures to control the prices of
basic food items. On the other hand, annual core CPI declined to 7.23 percent in December
from 7.44 percent in November, supported by a favorable base effect from the previous year,
despite the slight monthly inch up of non-food prices. Looking ahead, while the upside risks to
the domestic inflation outlook are mitigated by contained imported inflation, in light of the
broad-based decline in international commodity prices, particularly given the latest global
developments, potential underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain a concern.

The latest data available reveals that real GDP grew robustly by 4.2 percent in 2014/15 after
recording 2.2 percent (y/y) growth in 2013/14. The main contributors to growth were the
manufacturing, construction, real estate and tourism sectors, while the extractions sector
remained weak. In the meantime, strong investment growth more than compensated for the
negative contribution of net exports. Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega
projects are expected to continue to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that
surround the global economy given the latest global market developments could pose
downside risks to domestic GDP.

At this juncture, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate given the
balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks.

The MPC reiterates its price stability mandate and will continue to closely monitor all economic
developments, particularly fiscal policy and its effect on the inflation outlook, and will not
hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-term.
