**Press Release**
**February 1, 2007**

**_The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 8.75_**
**_percent per annum._**

In its meeting held on February 1, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided
to maintain its overnight deposit and overnight lending rates at 8.75 percent and 10.75
percent, respectively.

While the risks to inflation outlook which the MPC drew attention to in previous
statements continue to exist, a detailed assessment of the most recent inflation figures
may suggest a tentative moderation. However, the annual inflation rates are expected to
remain high until the base effect from the previous price increases related to the supply
shocks and administered price adjustments level off. Against this background and in light
of previous monetary policy actions, the MPC decided to keep the key policy rates
unchanged.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the
factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure
price stability over the medium-term.
