**Press Release**
**July 5, 2007**

**_The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 8.75_**
**_percent per annum._**

In its meeting held on July 5, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to
maintain the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates at 8.75 percent and 10.75
percent, respectively.

The annual headline CPI inflation eased further in May 2007, recording 10 percent (y/y)
compared to 12.8 percent (y/y) in March 2007. This trend underpins the MPC’s view that
the annual headline CPI may have reached its peak. This has come about as the base
effect from last year’s administered price adjustments and part of the avian flu shock
continued to level off.

The annual headline inflation rates are expected to maintain this downward trend as the
base effect from the previous price increases related to the supply shocks completely
dissipate. On the other hand, inflationary demand pressures from the current economic
growth remain a concern.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the
factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure
price stability over the medium-term.
