**Press Release**
**March 22, 2007**

**_The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 8.75_**
**_percent per annum._**

In its meeting held on March 22, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided
to maintain the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates at 8.75 percent and 10.75
percent, respectively.

While the risks to inflation outlook which the MPC drew attention to in previous
statements continue to exist, the MPC judges that inflation maybe reaching its peak.
However, the annual inflation rates are expected to remain high until the base effect from
the previous price increases related to the supply shocks and administered price
adjustments level off. Against this background and in light of previous monetary policy
actions, the MPC decided to keep the key policy rates unchanged.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the
factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure
price stability over the medium-term.
