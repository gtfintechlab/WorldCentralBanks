#   Central Bank of Egypt

**Press Release**
**August 16, 2007**

**_The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 8.75_**
**_percent per annum._**

In its meeting held on August 16, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided
to maintain the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates at 8.75 percent and 10.75
percent, respectively.

The annual headline CPI inflation fell for the fourth month in a row, registering 8 percent
(y/y) in July compared to 10 percent and 8.46 percent in May and June, respectively.
This was largely driven by the continued phasing out of last yearâ€™s supply shocks.

Looking forward, inflation is expected to moderate further over the coming months.
Nonetheless, inflationary demand pressures from the current economic growth remain a
concern.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the
factors underlying inflation and the recent developments in international financial
markets, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over
the medium-term.
