**May 10, 2007**

**_The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 8.75_**
**_percent per annum._**

In its meeting held on May 10, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to
maintain the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates at 8.75 percent and 10.75
percent, respectively.

For the first time in more than a year, the annual headline CPI inflation declined in April
2007 to 11.7 percent (y/y) compared to 12.8 percent in March 2007, consistent with the
MPC’s view that the annual headline CPI may have reached its peak. The most recent
development came about as the base effect from last year’s administered price adjustment
and part of the avian flu supply shock started to level off.

The annual headline inflation rates are expected to continue on this declining path as the
base effect from the previous price increases related to the supply shocks fully level off.
However, inflationary demand pressures from the current economic growth continues to
be a concern.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the
factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure
price stability over the medium-term.
