The political landscape in Egypt has undergone significant transformations since
the last MPC meeting with implications on economic activity and financial
markets. On the one hand, market liquidity conditions have come under
pressure, while the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks
has changed.

In order to ensure that the prevailing short‐term market rates are consistent with
the MPCʹs policy rate based on the continuous assessment of macroeconomic
developments and the price stability mandate, the CBE has decided to introduce
repos as part of its monetary policy operational framework.

Headline CPI inched up by 0.12 percent (m/m) in February compared to 1.02
percent in January, while the annual rate declined slightly from 10.79 percent to
10.71 percent on the back of a favorable base effect from last year. While the early
days in February witnessed a marked increase in food prices driven by
disruptions in production lines as well as transportation networks this was
largely reversed in recent weeks. This has been also reflected in core CPI which
inched up by 0.11 percent (m/m) in February compared to 0.74 percent in January
while the annual rate declined to 9.51 percent compared to 9.74 percent. It is
important to underscore that the pick up in international food prices since late
2010 have had limited spillover effects on domestic food prices. Nonetheless, if

the recent increases in international food prices prove to be persistent this would
pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook.

The past six weeks have witnessed interruptions in economic activity triggered
by the domestic political events. The current political uncertainty will continue to
have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions,
adversely weighing on key sectors within the economy. Moreover, there is
heightened uncertainty related to the global recovery on the back of higher
international oil prices given political tensions in the region. These factors,
combined, increase the downside risks to domestic GDP going forward.

Against the above background, the expected slowdown in economic growth
could largely offset the upside risks on inflation from the rising international
food prices. Given the balance of risks on the inflation and GDP outlooks and the
increased uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE
rates are appropriate.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will
not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the
medium‐term.
