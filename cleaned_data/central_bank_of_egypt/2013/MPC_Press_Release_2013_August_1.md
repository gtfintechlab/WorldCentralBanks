**Press Release**

**August 1, 2013**

**_In its mee�ng held on August 1, 2013, the Monetary Policy Commi�ee (MPC) decided to_**
**_cut the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main_**
**_operation by 50 basis points to 9.25 percent, 10.25 percent, and 9.75 percent_**
**_respectively. The discount rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 9.75 percent._**

Headline CPI increased by 0.88 percent (m/m) in June compared to a decline of 0.16
percent in May, pushing the annual rate to 9.75 percent from 8.20 percent in May. On the
other hand, core CPI increased by 0.77 percent (m/m) in June a�er remaining unchanged
in May, bringing the annual rate to 8.56 percent from 8.04 percent in May. It is worth
mentioning that the cumulative monthly increase in headline CPI inched up by only 2.2
percent in 2013Q2, a�er increasing by around 5 percent in 2013Q1. Similarly, the
cumula�ve monthly increase in core CPI registered 1.7 percent in 2013Q2 compared to 4.7
percent in the previous quarter. The latest monthly developments in both headline and
core inflation were largely driven by increases in several food prices. Upside risks to the
inflation outlook have moderated as the possibility of a rebound in international food
prices is unlikely in light of recent global developments.

Meanwhile, real GDP grew by 2.3 percent in the first nine months of 2012/2013, following
a similarly feeble growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2011/2012. This nascent recovery in
economic activity came on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction and
tourism sectors. Nonetheless, GDP growth remains to be partly suppressed by continuing
weaknesses, albeit of lesser extent, in the manufacturing sector. In the meantime,
investment levels remained low given the heightened uncertainty that faced market
par�cipants since early 2011 and the weak credit growth to the private sector. Looking
ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have ramifications on both
consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within
the economy. Moreover, downside risks continue to surround the global recovery on the
back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth emerging markets.
These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forward.

The pronounced downside risks to domestic GDP combined with the persistently negative
output gap since 2011 will limit upside risks to the inflation outlook going forward. Given
that the downside risks to the GDP outlook outweigh the upside risks to the inflation
outlook, the MPC decided to cut the key CBE rates.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate
to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐term.
