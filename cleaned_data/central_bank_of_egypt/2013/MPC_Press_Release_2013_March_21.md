**Press Release**

**March 21, 2013**

**_In its meeting held on March 21, 2013, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to_**
**_raise the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate by 50 basis points to 9.75_**
**_percent and 10.75 percent, respectively, and raise the rate of the CBE's main operation[*] by_**
**_50 basis points to 10.25 percent. The discount rate was raised by 75 basis points to 10.25_**
**_percent._**

Headline CPI increased by 2.50 percent (m/m) in February following an increase of 1.69
percent (m/m) in January. This comes as the highest monthly increase since August
2010, pushing the annual rate to 8.21 percent from 4.66 percent recorded in December
2012. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 2.86 percent (m/m) in February
following an increase of 1.31 percent (m/m) in January. This also comes as the highest
monthly increase since August 2010, pushing the annual rate to jump to 7.68 percent in
February up from 4.44 percent in December 2012. The latest monthly developments in
both headline and core inflation were largely driven by broad based increases in food
and non‐food prices on the back of the recent movements in the exchange rate and
diesel distribution bottlenecks across the country. While the probability of a rebound in
international food prices is less likely in light of recent global developments, the
re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels
pose upside risks to the inflation outlook.

Meanwhile, real GDP grew by 2.4 percent in 2012/2013 H1, following a similarly feeble
growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2011/2012. This nascent recovery in economic activity
came on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction and tourism sectors.
Nonetheless, GDP growth remains to be partly suppressed by continuing weaknesses,
albeit of lesser extent, in the manufacturing sector. In the meantime, given the
heightened uncertainty that faced market participants since early 2011, investment
levels remained low. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue
to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely
weighing on key sectors within the economy. Moreover, downside risks continue to
surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area. These
factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forward.

- The CBEs main operations would be Repos or Deposit Auctions depending on the prevailing market
liquidity conditions.

While the slowdown in economic growth has been limiting upside risks to the inflation
outlook, there is a possible build‐up of upward pressures on inflation going forward for
the previously mentioned reasons. Despite the downside risks to the GDP outlook, the
MPC judges that disanchored inflation expectations are more detrimental to the
economy over the medium term. Hence, a rate hike is warranted.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not
hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐term.
