**Press Release**

**May 9, 2013**

**_In its meeting held on May 9, 2013, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided_**
**_to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 9.75_**
**_percent and 10.75 percent, respectively, and the rate of the CBE's main operation_**
**_at 10.25 percent. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 10.25 percent._**

Headline CPI increased by 1.47 percent (m/m) in April and 0.64 percent (m/m) in
March, pushing the annual rate to 8.11 percent in April from 7.59 percent in March.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.97 percent (m/m) in April compared to
0.51 percent (m/m) in March, bringing the annual rate to 7.47 percent in April from
7.03 percent in March. The monthly developments in both headline and core
inflation since the beginning of the year were largely driven by broad based
increases in food and non‐food prices on the back of the recent movements in the
exchange rate and diesel distribution bottlenecks across the country. While the
probability of a rebound in international food prices is less likely in light of recent
global developments, the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in
the distribution channels pose upside risks to the inflation outlook.

Meanwhile, real GDP grew by 2.4 percent in 2012/2013 H1, following a similarly
feeble growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2011/2012. This nascent recovery in economic
activity came on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction and
tourism sectors. Nonetheless, GDP growth remains to be partly suppressed by
continuing weaknesses, albeit of lesser extent, in the manufacturing sector. In the
meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants since
early 2011, investment levels remained low. Looking ahead, the current political
transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as
investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the economy.
Moreover, downside risks continue to surround the global recovery on the back of
challenges facing the Euro Area. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to
domestic GDP going forward.

While the slowdown in economic growth has been limiting upside risks to the
inflation outlook, there is a possible build‐up of upward pressures on inflation going
forward for the previously mentioned reasons. Nonetheless, the MPC judges that the
current key CBE rates are appropriate given the lagged transmission of the previous
rate hike across the economy combined with the mixed balance of risks surrounding
the inflation and GDP outlooks at this juncture.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not
hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐term.
