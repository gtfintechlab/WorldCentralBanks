Press Release – March 30[th], 2023

**MPC decided to raise key policy rates by 200 bps**

**In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the Central**
**Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the**
**main operation by 200 bps to 18.25 percent, 19.25 percent, and 18.75 percent, respectively.**
**The discount rate was also raised by 200 bps to 18.75 percent.**

On the global front, forecasts for international commodity prices have eased compared to those

underlying the previous MPC meeting, but their outlook remains uncertain. Notable factors include

the outlook for global supply bottlenecks and global economic activity, especially in light of the

reopening in China coupled with the recent financial sector issues in advanced economies. The

latter factor has contributed to large volatility in financial conditions indices in key markets such

as the US and EU, which confirms an increased level of uncertainty regarding the global economic

outlook.

Domestically, growth in real economic activity moderated to 3.9 percent in 2022 Q4 compared to

4.4 percent in 2022 Q3, implying that growth during the first half of FY 2022/23 registered 4.2

percent. Detailed sectoral data for 2022 Q3 show that growth was primarily driven by the

improvement in private sector activity, specifically tourism, agriculture and trade. Additionally,

most leading indicators continue to register positive growth rates in 2023 Q1. Going forward, real

GDP growth is expected to soften in fiscal year 2022/23 compared to the previous fiscal year,

before picking up thereafter. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate recorded 7.2 percent in 2022 Q4

compared to 7.4 percent in the previous quarter.

Annual urban headline inflation continued to increase to record 25.8 percent and 31.9 percent in

January and February 2023, respectively. Similarly, annual core inflation recorded 31.2 percent in

January 2023 and marked a historical high in February 2023 by recording 40.3 percent. The

witnessed strong dynamics reflect the combined effect of several factors. These factors include the

supply chain disruptions domestically, the depreciation of the Egyptian pound, demand side

pressures as evidenced by developments in real economic activity relative to potential capacity

and high broad money growth outturns. In addition, the seasonal impact of Ramadan affected both

Umrah trips and food prices.

The MPC continues to assess the impact of the front-loaded tightening policies in a data-driven

manner, with recent inflation developments showing higher broad-based inflation across CPI

items. These recent developments necessitate additional tightening in the monetary stance, not

only to contain demand side pressures as mentioned above, but also to avoid broad and persistent

inflationary effects that could emanate from the supply shocks, with the aim of anchoring inflation

expectations.

In light of the above, the MPC decided to raise policy rates by 200 bps and reiterates that the path

of future policy rates remains a function of forecasted inflation rather than prevailing inflation

rates. The MPC stresses that achieving a tight monetary stance is a necessary condition to attain

the CBE’s upcoming inflation targets of 7 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2024 Q4

and 5 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2026 Q4. The MPC will continue to monitor

all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance in line with its price stability

mandate.
