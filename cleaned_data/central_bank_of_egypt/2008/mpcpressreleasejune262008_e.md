# Central Bank of Egypt

**Press Release**
**June 26, 2008**

**_The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit by 50 bps to 10.5_**
**_percent per annum._**

**_The discount rate was also raised by 100 bps to 10 percent per annum._**

In its meeting held on June 26, 2008, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to
raise the overnight deposit and lending rates by 50 bps to 10.5 percent and 12.5 percent,
respectively.

The headline CPI inflation maintained its upward trend escalating to 19.7% in May as
domestic food inflation accelerated sharply to 27% and intensified further by the broadbased regulated price adjustments. The spillover to non-food inflation continued to be
strong. Concurrently, there were additional price pressures from the ongoing strong
economic growth.

Despite the recent slight moderation in international food inflation, there are concerns
relating to grain crops in light of adverse weather conditions which might prolong the
international food price shock. Moreover, the impact of the second-round effects on
inflation remains to unfold over the coming months.

Given the clear evidence of underlying inflationary pressures, the MPC judges that the
balance of risks to the inflation outlook continues to be on the upside and todayâ€™s
decision is aimed at containing inflation expectations.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the
factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure
price stability over the medium-term.
