# Central Bank of Egypt

**Press Release**
**September 18, 2008**

**_The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit by 50 bps to 11.5_**
**_percent per annum._**

**_The discount rate was also raised by 50 bps to 11.5 percent per annum._**

In its meeting held on September 18, 2008, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
decided to raise the overnight deposit and lending rates by 50 bps to 11.5 percent and
13.5 percent, respectively.

While the headline CPI inflation reached 23.6% in August compared to 22.1% in July,
the monthly pace of acceleration in food prices excluding fruits and vegetables almost
halved, falling from an average of 3.88% between January and May 2008 to 1.68% over
the last three months. This comes on the backdrop of the decline in international food
prices (particularly wheat), imposing a temporary ban on local rice exports and scrapping
import tariffs on some basic staple food products. Nonetheless, non-food inflation
remains high.

The declining trend in international food prices suggest that the international food price
shock might be waning. Nonetheless, the impact on domestic food inflation might not be
fully reflected given downward price rigidities in domestic markets. Moreover, the MPC
is mindful of the underlying inflationary pressures.

Having weighed both the international and domestic information available, the MPC
judges that an additional rate hike is needed today to contain inflation expectations.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the
factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure
price stability over the medium-term.
