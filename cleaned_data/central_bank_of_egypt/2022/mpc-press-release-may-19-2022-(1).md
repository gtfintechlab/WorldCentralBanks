Press Release – May 19[th], 2022

**MPC decides to raise key policy rates by 200 basis points**

**In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the Central**
**Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the**
**main operation by 200 basis points to 11.25 percent, 12.25 percent, and 11.75 percent,**
**respectively. The discount rate was also raised by 200 basis points to 11.75 percent.**

Global economic activity has slowed down due to ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine.

Trade sanctions imposed on Russia and corresponding supply-chain bottlenecks have elevated

global commodity prices, such as international prices for oil and wheat, with the latter’s global

supply also impacted by adverse weather conditions and poor harvests in select regions.

Meanwhile, global financial conditions have tightened, as major central banks have continued to

both tighten policy rates and reduce asset purchase programs with the aim of containing increased

inflationary concerns in their respective countries. In addition, recently introduced COVID-19

lockdowns in China have raised concerns about exacerbating existing global supply-chain

disruptions.

Prior to the Russo-Ukrainian war, domestic economic activity continued to expand in 2021 Q4,

recording a preliminary year-on-year growth rate of 8.3 percent, the second highest real GDP

growth rate since 2002 Q3. This was partially supported by the robust growth in tourism,

construction and manufacturing, as well as a positive base effect emanating from the low growth

rates in the same period in 2020, resulting from the COVID-19 containment measures.

Recently, most leading indicators for economic activity have started to gradually normalize, and

are expected to continue this trend over the near term, as the strong positive base effect diminishes.

Going forward, economic activity will continue to expand albeit at a slower-than previously

projected pace, partially due to the unfavorable spillovers of international developments emanating

from the Russo-Ukrainian war.

Regarding the labor market, the unemployment rate declined in 2022 Q1, registering 7.2 percent.

The witnessed decline stemmed from the increase in employment figures which more than offset

the increase in the labor force.

Annual headline urban inflation increased to 13.1 percent in April 2022, from 10.5 percent in

March 2022, its highest level since May 2019. In addition, annual core inflation, which excludes

volatile food and regulated items, continued its upward trend to record 11.9 percent in April 2022,

from 10.1 percent in March 2022, its highest level since April 2018. This increase is attributed

mainly to food items and further supported by non-food items. While both were affected by the

depreciation in the Egyptian pound that occurred on the 21st of March 2022 and seasonal patterns,

several other factors contributed to the increase in food prices; namely adverse weather conditions

and high fertilizer prices that caused tomatoes prices to soar. In the meantime, the impact of the

Russo-Ukrainian war on the prices of wheat, wheat derivatives, and other food commodities, in

addition to the continued seasonal inflationary impact of Ramadan, and the occurrence of multiple

holidays during April 2022, increased the prices of the rest of the core food products.

Against this background, the MPC decided that raising policy rates is necessary to contain

inflationary pressures which is consistent with achieving price stability over the medium term.

Monetary policy tools are utilized to anchor inflation expectations, contain demand-side pressures

and second-round effects emanating from supply shocks that may lead to deviations from inflation

targets. Therefore, in accommodation of the first-round effects of supply shocks, the elevated

annual headline inflation rate will be temporarily tolerated relative to the CBE’s pre-announced

target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4, before declining thereafter.

Achieving low and stable inflation over the medium term is a prerequisite condition to achieve

high and sustainable growth rates, as well as supporting real incomes. The MPC reiterates that the

path of future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations, rather than of prevailing

inflation rates. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not

hesitate to utilize all available tools to achieve its price stability mandate over the medium term.
