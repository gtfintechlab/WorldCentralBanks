# Central Bank of Egypt

**Press Release**

November 12, 2020

**The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight**
**deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 50 basis points to 8.25%,**
**9.25%, and 8.75%, respectively. The discount rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 8.75%.**

Annual headline urban inflation recorded 4.5% in October 2020 and 3.7% in September 2020 from
3.4% in August 2020. The increase in annual headline inflation continued to be mainly driven by
higher annual contribution of food items as well as regulated items. This comes as negative annual
food inflation eased for the second consecutive month. In the meantime, annual core inflation
increased to 3.9% in October 2020 up from 3.3% in September 2020. Nevertheless, annual inflation
rates continued to reflect muted inflationary pressures.

Preliminary figures announced show that real GDP growth for FY 2019/20 recorded 3.6% compared
to 5.6% a year earlier. Growth was dragged downwards in 2020 Q2, mainly due to the partial
lockdown measures that were implemented to contain COVID-19, registering negative 1.7%, down
from 5.0% in 2020 Q1. The pickup in consumption in 2020 Q2 was not enough to offset the combined
contraction in investments, and to a lesser extent in net exports. This was also reflected in the
unemployment rate which recorded 9.6% in 2020 Q2 up from 7.7% in 2020 Q1. Meanwhile, leading
indicators for 2020 Q3 continue to show gradual signs of recovery.

Globally, economic activity remained weak despite some recovery, international oil prices broadly
stabilized, and global financial conditions continued to improve, supported mainly by policy measures
despite the ongoing uncertainty.

The outlook for inflation in 2020 Q4 is estimated to be in the low single digits range, with increasing
likelihood of coming under the inflation target floor of 6%, further confirming the muted inflationary
pressures in the medium-term. And because the path for current policy rates remains a function of
medium-term inflation expectations rather than current inflation outturns, the MPC decided to cut
key policy rates by 50 basis points. The reduction in key policy rates in today’s MPC meeting provides
appropriate support to economic activity, while remaining consistent with price stability over the
medium term.

The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools
to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandate.
