**Press Release**

February 4[th], 2021

**The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit**
**rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and**
**8.75 percent, respectively. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 8.75 percent.**

Annual headline urban inflation decelerated to 5.4 percent in December 2020 from 5.7 percent in November
2020. The decline in annual headline inflation was mainly driven by lower prices of fresh vegetables, reflecting
their seasonal pattern as well as the partial reversal of the transitory shock in tomato prices. In the meantime,
annual core inflation decelerated to 3.8 percent in December 2020 from 4.0 percent in November 2020.

Accordingly, annual headline urban inflation registered an average of 5.2 percent during 2020 Q4, coming below
the lower target band of 6 percent previously announced in 2018. The deviation from the target was a result of
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and its resulting government containment measures on
economic activity. Furthermore, the government’s successful implementation of several measures to avoid
supply shortages in the market contributed to lower inflation rates. Nonetheless, given the balance of risks, the
CBE undertook several preemptive measures to support economic activity while remaining consistent with
achieving its price stability objective over the medium term.

Real GDP growth recorded a preliminary figure of 0.7 percent during 2020 Q3, up from -1.7 percent during 2020
Q2. Meanwhile, select demand-side leading indicators continue to display signs of recovery in 2020 Q4.
Moreover, the unemployment rate decreased to 7.3 percent in 2020 Q3, down from 9.6 percent in 2020 Q2.

Globally, economic activity remains subdued despite the accommodative financial conditions, as the second
wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its subsequent containment measures continue to weigh on the nearterm outlook. On the other hand, the path to global economic recovery remains a function of the efficacy,
availability and the rollout speed of vaccines, which could ease the level of uncertainty regarding economic
activity over the medium term. Meanwhile, international oil prices have continued to pick up largely due to
supply side developments.

Against this background, the MPC decided that keeping policy rates unchanged remains consistent with
achieving the inflation target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4 and price stability over
the medium term.

The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to support
the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandate.
