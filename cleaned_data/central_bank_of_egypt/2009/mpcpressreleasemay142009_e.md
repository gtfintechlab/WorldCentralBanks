#      Central Bank of Egypt

**Press Release**
**May 14, 2009**

**The Central Bank of Egypt decided to cut its overnight deposit rate by 50 bps to 9.5**
**percent per annum and its overnight lending rate by 100 bps to 11 percent per**
**annum.**

**The discount rate was also cut by 50 bps to 9.5 percent per annum.**

In its meeting held on May 14, 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to
cut its overnight deposit rate by 50 bps to 9.5 percent and the overnight lending rate by
100 bps to 11 percent. Accordingly, the width of the corridor has been narrowed from 2
percent to 1.5 percent.

Annual headline CPI inflation continued to decline in April 2009, reaching 11.7 percent
down from 13.5 percent and 12.1 percent in February and March, respectively. This
records a cumulative drop of 11.9 percentage points since its peak in August 2008. The
downward trend in headline inflation comes on the back of the decline in domestic food
inflation, which fell from 31 percent (y/y) in August 2008 to 13.7 percent (y/y) in April
2009. However, it is important to emphasize that the sharp retrenchment in international
commodity prices, which had begun in the second half of 2008, has not been fully
reflected in domestic price levels due to the downward price rigidities in domestic
markets.

While annual headline inflation is still elevated, the lower inflationary pressures driven
by lower international food prices and slower domestic economic growth currently
project that annual inflation will fall towards the CBE's comfort zone by mid-2009.

In the meantime, domestic GDP growth softened during the first half of 2008/09, a
consequence of the global economic slowdown. Going forward, the dire prospects for
global growth in 2009 are likely to exert further downward pressures on external demand
with unfavorable repercussions on the domestic growth outlook. Against this background,
the MPC judged that narrowing the width of the corridor is appropriate at this juncture.

The MPC will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of
the global economic turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict
with the price stability objective.
