**Press Release**

**October 29, 2015**

**_In its meeting held on October 29, 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to_**
**_keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main_**
**_operation unchanged at 8.75 percent, 9.75 percent, and 9.25 percent, respectively. The_**
**_discount rate was also kept unchanged at 9.25 percent._**

Headline CPI increased by 2.47 percent (m/m) in September following 0.63 percent in August,
leading the annual rate to jump to 9.21 percent from 7.88 percent. On the other hand, core CPI
increased by 0.79 percent in September compared to a decline of 0.23 percent in August, while
the annual rate remained largely unchanged at 5.55 percent, on the back of a favorable base
effect from the previous year. The continued acceleration in the prices of volatile food items
explain the bulk of monthly headline CPI developments and has widened the divergence
between the headline and core inflation rates. Upside risks to the inflation outlook from
domestic supply shocks are largely mitigated by contained imported inflation, against the
background of broad-based declines in international commodity prices.

Meanwhile, real GDP grew by 3.0 percent (y/y) in 2014/15 Q3 to record 4.6 percent (y/y) in the
first nine months of the fiscal year. This comes after real GDP growth recorded 2.2 percent (y/y)
during 2013/14. The main contributors to growth during 2014/15 Q3 were the internal trade,
construction, building and the real estate sectors, while the extractions sector remained weak.
In the meantime, investment growth more than compensated for the negative contribution of
the widening trade deficit. Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects are
expected to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks and uncertainty that surround
the global economy on the back of softening growth in emerging markets and challenges facing
the Euro Area could pose downside risks to domestic GDP.

At this juncture, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate given the
balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to
adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-term.
