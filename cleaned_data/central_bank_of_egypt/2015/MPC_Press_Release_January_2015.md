**Press Release**

**January 15, 2015**

**_In its meeting held on January 15, 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut_**
**_the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation_**
**_by 50 basis points to 8.75 percent, 9.75 percent, and 9.25 percent, respectively. The discount_**
**_rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 9.25 percent._**

Headline CPI decelerated by 1.53 percent (m/m) and 0.07 percent (m/m) in November and
December, respectively. This brought the annual infla�on rates to 9.09 percent in November
then to 10.13 percent in December due to an unfavorable base effect. The monthly
developments came broadly on the back of the seasonal deceleration in the prices of fruits and
vegetables coupled with the decline in the prices of other food items supported by the
decrease in international prices. On the other hand, core CPI inched up by 0.3 percent (m/m) in
December after declining by 0.15 percent (m/m) in November. The annual rate continued to
ease registering 7.69 percent in December following 7.81 in November. Upside risks from
imported inflation continue to be contained on the back of lower oil prices and the consequent
revision in international food price forecasts.

Meanwhile, real GDP jumped significantly in 2014/15 Q1, registering at 6.8 percent the highest
annual growth rate since 2007/08 Q4. This comes a�er the 2013/14 fiscal year real GDP growth
rate recorded 2.2 percent. Notwithstanding the support stemming from the base effect, the
expansion in economic ac�vity during 2014/2015 Q1 came on the back of the con�nuous
growth in the manufacturing sector and the expansion of tourism activities after several
quarters of contraction. This came despite the continuous weakness in the extraction sector. In
the meantime, investment continued to improve for the third consecutive quarter. Looking
ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects such as the Suez Canal are expected to
contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that surround the global recovery on the
back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could
pose downside risks to domestic GDP.

In light of recent global developments and the reassessment of risks surrounding the inflation
outlook and domestic GDP, the MPC decided to cut the key CBE rates.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to
adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-term.
