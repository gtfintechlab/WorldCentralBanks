# Central Bank of Egypt

**Press Release**
May 17, 2018

**In its meeting on May 17, 2018, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight**
**deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation**
**unchanged at 16.75 percent, 17.75 percent, and 17.25 percent, respectively. The discount rate was**
**also kept at 17.25 percent.**

Annual headline inflation continued to decline in March and April 2018 to record 13.1 percent, while
annual core inflation continued to decline in March to 11.6 percent and remained roughly unchanged in
April. The headline and core annual rates thereby registered in April 2018 the lowest since May and April
2016, respectively.

Real GDP growth continued to improve for the fifth consecutive quarter, to record 5.3 percent in
December 2017 and an average of 5.0 percent during 2017, the highest since 2010. The unemployment
rate registered further improvement in March 2018, declining to 10.6 percent, the lowest since
December 2010.

The increase in international oil prices gained momentum in April and May 2018, leading to the
materialization of an upside risk to the domestic inflation outlook. Nevertheless, the outlook remains
consistent with achieving the inflation target of 13 percent (±3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits
thereafter.

Domestic risks surrounding the inflation outlook continue to include potential fiscal reform measures,
the evolution of inflation expectations, as well as demand-side pressures. In addition to oil price
developments, risks from the external economy continue to include the pace of tightening financial
conditions.

The MPC’s decision to keep the CBE’s key policy rates unchanged is consistent with achieving the
targeted disinflation path. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to
adjust its stance to achieve its mandate of price stability over the medium term.
