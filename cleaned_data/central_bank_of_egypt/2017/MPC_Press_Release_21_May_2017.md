# Central Bank of Egypt

**Press Release**
May 21, 2017

**In its meeting held on May 21, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the**
**overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main**
**operation by 200 basis points to 16.75 percent, 17.75 percent, and 17.25 percent, respectively. The**
**discount rate was also raised by 200 basis points to 17.25 percent.**

Headline inflation registered 1.69 percent (m/m) in April 2017, recording its third consecutive decline
due to fading cost-push pressures after averaging 4.01 percent (m/m) between November 2016 and
January 2017. Meanwhile, annual headline inflation registered 31.46 percent. Monthly inflation during
April was mainly driven by volatile and core food items, while non-food items remained broadly
unchanged. Accordingly, core inflation which excludes volatile food items grew by 1.10 percent (m/m) in
April, recording a slight increase after decelerating in February and March from the average 4.89
percent (m/m) registered between November 2016 and January 2017. Nevertheless, as monthly core
inflation was lower than the respective month of the previous year, the annual rate declined for the
second consecutive month to record 32.06 percent.

While the previous tightening of policy rates and the consistent reduction of short-term excess liquidity
have so far successfully managed to contain underlying inflation excluding supply-shocks, as evident in
the inflation developments above, the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook has tilted more
strongly to the upside with recent economic and monetary data releases pointing to strengthening
demand-side pressures. Furthermore, the MPC envisages risks related to inflation expectations resulting
from elevated annual inflation levels despite the continued moderation of monthly rates. Consequently,
the MPC decided that tightening monetary conditions are warranted in commitment to its price-stability
mandate.

Information received since the MPC met in March show continued improvement of economic activity
and a reduction of unemployment. Annual real GDP grew by 3.9 percent in 2016/17 Q3, strengthening
from the 3.8 and 3.4 percent recorded in the preceding quarters as well as from the 3.6 percent
recorded in 2015/16 Q3. This coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to 12.0 percent in
2016/17 Q3 from 12.4 and 12.6 percent in the preceding quarters.

From the monetary perspective, annual broad money growth has been strongly affected by revaluation
effects of its foreign currency components. However, annual broad money growth has also increased
excluding revaluation effects due to the recovery of net foreign assets, evident by the CBE's
international reserve accumulation, as well as higher loans to the private sector in domestic currency.

Developments in the external environment show that there has been some firming of international
commodity prices primarily due to higher oil prices while food price increases were relatively tame.
Meanwhile global inflation and economic growth continue to maintain weak pressures on domestic
prices, despite their recent recovery.

To further anchor inflation expectations, the MPC decided to increase transparency regarding the
targeted disinflation path in its regular statements as well as in the quarterly series of the monetary
policy report introduced in March 2017. In accommodation of first-round effects of supply-shocks, the
elevated annual headline inflation rate will be temporarily tolerated before it is targeted to decline to
13% (+/- 3%) by 2018 Q4 and to single-digits thereafter. The MPC believes that this target path is
appropriate to minimize undesirable macroeconomic volatility. Achieving low and stable inflation over
the medium-term supports real incomes and sustains achieved competitiveness gains, which represents
a challenge according to Egypt's economic history.

Monetary policy tools are utilized to anchor inflation expectations, contain demand-side pressures and
second-round effects resulting from supply shocks that may lead to deviations from inflation targets, as
well as to achieve reserve money targets that were designed to be consistent with the inflation targets.
The MPC believes that such a flexible monetary targeting framework is appropriate under the liberalized
exchange rate regime.

Against this background, the MPC judges that hiking the CBE's key policy rates is consistent with the
targeted disinflation path, and reiterates that the objective of its tighter stance is not to offset effects of
supply-shocks, rather to contain underlying inflation excluding supply shocks that is affected by inflation
expectations and the build-up of demand-side pressures.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic and monetary developments as well as the
balance of risks, and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to offset anticipated upside or downside
deviations from the inflation target.
