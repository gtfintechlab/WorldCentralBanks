**Press Release**
**February 4, 2010**

**_In its meeting held on February 4, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to_**
**_keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 8.25 percent and_**
**_9.75 percent, respectively. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 8.5 percent._**

Headline CPI declined by 1.3 percent (m/m) in December 2009, to maintain the annual
inflation rate broadly unchanged at 13.24 percent compared to 13.29 percent in November
2009. For the second consecutive month, the negative monthly inflation rate was largely due
to lower prices of fruits and vegetables which have been the key drivers of headline inflation
since February 2009. In the meantime, annual core inflation inched up to 6.85 percent in
December compared to 6.59 percent in November on the back of the unfavorable base effects
from last year and remains within the CBE's comfort zone.

Meanwhile, annual real GDP growth recorded 4.9 percent in 2009/10 Q1 compared to the
four year low of 4.1 percent witnessed in 2008/09 Q2. While this outturn remains below the 7
percent average registered over the past three years, it reflects a steady improvement in
economic activity. There are encouraging signs that the global slowdown has stabilized
somewhat over recent months and the outlook for the international economy appears to have
improved as well. This coupled, with the domestic fiscal and monetary measures undertaken
so far will continue to provide a conducive environment for the domestic economy.

Against this background, the MPC assesses that inflationary pressures remain subdued and
that the current level of policy interest rate is appropriate and supportive of the economic
recovery while consistent with maintaining core inflation within the CBE's comfort zone in
the medium-term.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to
adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-term.
