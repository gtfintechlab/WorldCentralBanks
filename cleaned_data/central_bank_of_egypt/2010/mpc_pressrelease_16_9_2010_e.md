**Press Release**
**September 16, 2010**

**_In its meeting held on September 16, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)_**
**_decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at_**
**_8.25 percent and 9.75 percent, respectively. The discount rate was also kept unchanged_**
**_at 8.5 percent._**

Headline CPI accelerated by 2.85 percent in August following the 2.51 percent in July,
pushing the annual rate to 10.93 percent in August. While these monthly rates are
exceptionally high, they have been mainly driven by higher prices of a number of food
items, which had witnessed seasonal increases of varying degrees in July and August
ahead of and during the month of Ramadan. The Ramadan effect exacerbated the impact
of supply shortages in red meat and poultry witnessed since early 2010, which caused a
surge in their prices during the past two months. The surge in the prices of red meat and
poultry in addition to the acceleration in the prices of fruits and vegetables collectively
explain on average more than sixty percent of annual headline inflation in both July and
August. On the other hand, core CPI accelerated by 2.82 percent in August leading to a
jump in the annual rate to 8.16 percent with more than fifty percent driven by the prices
of red meat and poultry.

Meanwhile, annual real GDP growth recorded 5.9 percent in 2009/10 Q4 compared to the
four year low of 4.1 percent witnessed in 2008/09 Q2, reflecting a steady improvement in
economic activity. Looking ahead, unfolding global economic developments have created
uncertainty about the nascent global recovery, which could potentially weigh on domestic
investment and external demand.

Against the above and despite the sharp increase in food prices, non-food inflation has
remained largely subdued since early 2009, implying that underlying inflation pressures
arising from the ongoing economic recovery remain contained. Nonetheless, the MPC is
mindful of the risk of possible propagation of shocks related to food items to other prices.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not
hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-term.
