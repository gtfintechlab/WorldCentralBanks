# Central Bank of Egypt

**Press Release**
**June 17, 2010**

**_In its meeting held on June 17, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided_**
**_to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 8.25_**
**_percent and 9.75 percent, respectively. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at_**
**_8.5 percent._**

Annual headline CPI declined to 10.59 percent in May from 11.38 percent registered in
April 2010, yet remains elevated reflecting the impact of last year's unfavorable shock
related to fruits and vegetables. In the meantime, annual core CPI increased slightly from
6.62 percent in April to 6.69 percent in May and remains within the CBE's comfort zone.

Meanwhile, annual real GDP growth recorded 5.8 percent in 2009/10 Q3 compared to the
four year low of 4.1 percent witnessed in 2008/09 Q2, reflecting a steady improvement in
economic activity. Looking ahead, unfolding global economic developments in Europe
have created uncertainty about the nascent global recovery, which could potentially
weigh on external demand and investment in Egypt.

Against this background, the MPC assesses that inflationary pressures remain subdued
and that the current level of policy interest rate is appropriate and supportive of the
economic recovery while consistent with maintaining core inflation within the CBE's
comfort zone in the medium-term.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not
hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-term.
