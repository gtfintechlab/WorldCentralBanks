**Press Release**
**March 18, 2010**

**_In its meeting held on March 18, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided_**
**_to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 8.25_**
**_percent and 9.75 percent, respectively. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at_**
**_8.5 percent._**

Annual headline CPI declined to 12.78 percent in February compared to 13.63 percent
registered in January 2010, yet remains elevated reflecting the impact of last year's
unfavorable shock related to fruits and vegetables. In the meantime, annual core CPI
registered 6.9 percent in February down from the 7.39 percent in January and remains
within the CBE's comfort zone.

Meanwhile, annual real GDP growth recorded 5 percent in 2009/10 Q2 compared to the
four year low of 4.1 percent witnessed in 2008/09 Q2, reflecting a steady improvement in
economic activity. Furthermore, the ongoing recovery in the global economy coupled
with the domestic fiscal and monetary measures undertaken so far will continue to
provide a conducive environment for the domestic economy.

Against this background, the MPC assesses that inflationary pressures remain subdued
and that the current level of policy interest rate is appropriate and supportive of the
economic recovery while consistent with maintaining core inflation within the CBE's
comfort zone in the medium-term.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not
hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-term.
