# Central Bank of Egypt

**Press Release**
**May 18, 2006**

**_The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 8_**
**_percent per annum and the lending rate at 10 percent per annum._**

In its meeting held on May 18, 2006, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to
maintain the overnight deposit and the overnight lending rates at 8 percent and 10
percent, respectively.

This decision was based on an assessment of recent domestic and external economic
developments since the last MPC meeting. Domestically, domestic inflation rates
continued to hold at moderate levels. On the other hand, externally, risks to global
inflation are still skewed to the upside and uncertainty surrounds the international interest
rate outlook.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the
factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates in either
direction, if necessary, to ensure price stability over the medium-term.
