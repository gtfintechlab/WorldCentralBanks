#  Central Bank of Egypt

**Press Release**
**October 4, 2006**

**_The Central Bank of Egypt decided not to raise its policy rates._**

In their deliberations during the MPC meeting on October 4, the members decided not to
raise interest rates, however, with the sentiment to review this decision in its next
meeting.

The MPC has witnessed trends exerting pressures on the various price indices which have
been instigated by the continued acceleration in economic growth, particularly in
manufacturing and real estate sectors and second round effects from the July fuel price
hike. The MPC is watching these developments and is weighing the possible effects of
the above on inflation in the near future. The MPC judges that interest rate increases are
highly likely at this juncture.
