Headline CPI increased by 0.79 percent (m/m) in October following 1.2 percent (m/m) in
September, bringing the annual rate to 6.70 percent from 6.22 percent in the previous
month. The latest monthly development in headline inflation was largely driven by the
sharp rise in the prices of butane gas cylinders on the back of bottlenecks in the
distribution channels in addition to the annual adjustment in school tuition fees. On the
other hand, core CPI increased by 1.18 percent (m/m) in October following a decline of
0.31 percent (m/m) in September on the back of sporadic increases in food prices as
well as moderate inch ups in some non‐food prices. While the probability of a rebound
in international food prices is less likely now in light of recent global developments, the
re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels
pose upside risks to the inflation outlook.

Meanwhile, real GDP grew by 2.6 percent in 2012/2013 Q1, following a similarly feeble
growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2011/2012. This nascent recovery in economic ac�vity came
on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction sector. Nonetheless, GDP
growth remains to be partly suppressed by continuing weaknesses, albeit of lesser extent, in
the manufacturing and tourism sectors. In the meantime, given the heightened
uncertainty that faced market par�cipants since early 2011, investment levels remained
low. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have
ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing
on key sectors within the economy. Moreover, downside risks continue to surround the
global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area. These factors, combined,
pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forward.

Given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks and the
uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are
appropriate.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not
hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐term.
