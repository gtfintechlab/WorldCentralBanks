While headline CPI inched up by 0.38 percent (m/m) in July, the annual rate continued
on a downward trend reaching 6.39 percent from 7.26 percent recorded in the previous
month. Similarly, annual core CPI con�nued to decline in July, reaching 6.34 percent
down from 7.04 percent recorded in the previous month despite of the monthly
increase of 0.58 percent (m/m). The latest monthly developments in both headline and
core were largely driven by favorable movements in food prices while non‐food prices
remained broadly tame. It is important to underscore that if the latest pick up in
international food prices prove to be persistent this would pose an upside risk to the
inflation outlook along with the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and
distortions in the distribution channels.

Meanwhile, real GDP grew by 5.2 percent in 2011/2012 Q3, following feeble average
growth rates of 0.35 percent in the first two quarters. This rebound was largely driven
by a significant favorable base effect from the respective quarter of 2010/2011 during
which economic activity was interrupted following the unfolding political events. During
the first three quarters of 2011/2012, real GDP expanded by 1.8 percent on the back of
tentative signs of recovery in the construction sector which was partly suppressed by
continuing weaknesses in the manufacturing and tourism sectors. In the meantime,
given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants over the past
year, investment levels remained low. Looking ahead, the current political
transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well
as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the economy.
Moreover, downside risks continue to surround the global recovery on the back
of challenges facing the Euro Area. These factors, combined, pose downside risks
to domestic GDP going forward.

Given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks and the
uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are
appropriate.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not
hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the
medium‐term.
