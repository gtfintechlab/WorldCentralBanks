Headline CPI increased by 1.22 percent (m/m) in March following 0.67 percent (m/m) in
February, bringing the annual rate to 9.03 percent from 9.19 percent recorded in the previous
month. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 1.12 percent in March following 0.52 percent
in February while the annual rate increased to 8.68 percent in March from 7.30 percent in the
previous month. The bulk of the latest monthly developments continued to be driven by food
price movements while non‐food prices remained broadly tame. The re‐emergence of local
supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels, as well as the probability of a
rebound in international food prices pose upside risks to the inflation outlook.

Meanwhile, real GDP grew by a mere 0.4 percent in 2011/2012 Q2 after a similarly feeble
growth of 0.3 percent in Q1, following the significant contraction of 4.3 percent recorded in
2010/2011 Q3 due to the political events in Egypt and the region. This mainly came on the back
of continued weakening in the tourism, manufacturing, and construction sectors. In the
meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants over the past year,
investment levels remained low in 2011/2012 Q2. Looking ahead, the current political
transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment
decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the economy. Moreover, downside risks
continue to surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area. These
factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forward.

Given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks and the uncertainty at
this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriate.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to
adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐term.
