Headline CPI declined by 0.24 percent (m/m) in December following the 1.0 percent increase in
November. These monthly developments were largely driven by bottlenecks in the distribution
channels of butane gas cylinders, along with tame price increases in some food items that were
outweighed by declines in others. Despite the monthly decline, the annual rate increased to
9.55 percent in December from 9.07 percent in the previous month on the back of unfavorable
base effects from last year. On the other hand, core CPI inched up by 0.21 percent in December
following the 0.17 percent increase in November reflecting sporadic increases in food prices.
Meanwhile, the annual rate declined from 7.6 percent in October to 7.0 percent in November
and December supported by favorable base effects from last year. While the probability of a
rebound in international food prices is less likely now in light of recent global developments,
the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels pose
an upside risk to the inflation outlook.

Meanwhile, real GDP grew by a mere 0.3 percent in 2011/2012 Q1 after a similarly feeble
growth of 0.4 percent in 2010/2011 Q4, following the significant contrac�on of 4.3 percent
recorded in 2010/2011 Q3 due to the political events in Egypt and the region. This mainly came
on the back of continued weakening in the tourism, manufacturing, and construction sectors. In
the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants over the past
year, investment levels continued to deteriorate recording an annual retrenchment of 11.4
percent in 2011/2012 Q1. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to
have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on
key sectors within the economy. Moreover, downside risks surrounding the global recovery
have mounted on the back of fiscal and banking sector challenges facing the Euro Area and
possible spillovers to other regions. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic
GDP going forward.

Given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks and the uncertainty at
this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriate.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to
adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐term.
