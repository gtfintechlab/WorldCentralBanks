**Press Release**
**March 22, 2012**

**_In its meeting held on March 22, 2012, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep_**
**_the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 9.25 percent 10.25_**
**_percent, respectively, and the 7‐day repo at 9.75 percent. The discount rate was also kept_**
**_unchanged at 9.5 percent._**

Headline CPI increased by 0.67 percent (m/m) in February following the 0.15 percent inch up in
January, bringing the annual rate to 9.19 percent from 8.60 percent recorded in the previous
month. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.52 percent in February following the 0.55
percent increase in January while the annual rate inched up to 7.30 percent in February from
6.86 percent in the previous month. The bulk of the latest monthly developments continued to
be driven by food price movements while non‐food prices remained broadly tame. While the
probability of a rebound in international food prices is less likely now in light of recent global
developments, the repercussions of the outbreak of the foot and mouth disease along with the
re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels pose
upside risks to the inflation outlook.

Meanwhile, real GDP grew by a mere 0.3 percent in 2011/2012 Q1 a�er a similarly feeble
growth of 0.4 percent in 2010/2011 Q4, following the significant contraction of 4.3 percent
recorded in 2010/2011 Q3 due to the poli�cal events in Egypt and the region. This mainly came
on the back of continued weakening in the tourism, manufacturing, and construction sectors. In
the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants over the past
year, investment levels con�nued to deteriorate recording an annual retrenchment of 11.4
percent in 2011/2012 Q1. Looking ahead, the current poli�cal transforma�on may con�nue to
have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on
key sectors within the economy. Moreover, downside risks continue to surround the global
recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area. These factors, combined, pose
downside risks to domestic GDP going forward.

Given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks and the uncertainty at
this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriate.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to
adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐term.
