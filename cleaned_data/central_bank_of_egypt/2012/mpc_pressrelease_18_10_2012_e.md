While headline CPI increased by 1.20 percent (m/m) in September, the annual rate
con�nued on a downward trend reaching 6.22 percent from 6.47 percent recorded in
the previous month, supported by base effects from last year. The latest monthly
developments in headline inflation were largely driven by higher prices of fresh
vegetables which overshadowed favorable movements in other food prices. On the
other hand, core CPI declined by 0.31 percent (m/m) in September on the back of lower
prices of selected food items along with broadly tame non‐food prices. This month's
decline in core CPI coincided with significantly favorable base effects from last year
which led the annual rate to drop to 3.84 percent from 5.34 percent in August. It is
important to underscore that if the latest pick up in international food prices proves to
be persistent this would pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook along with the
re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels.

Meanwhile, real GDP growth remained broadly stagnant, registering a growth rate of
2.2 percent in 2011/2012 following a similarly weak expansion of 1.8 percent in
2010/2011. Continued weaknesses in the manufacturing and tourism sectors weighed
heavily on GDP growth during 2011/2012 which suppressed the tenta�ve signs of
recovery in the construction sector. In the meantime, given the heightened
uncertainty that faced market participants since early 2011, investment levels
remained low. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to
have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely
weighing on key sectors within the economy. Moreover, downside risks continue
to surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area.
These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forward.

Given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks and the
uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are
appropriate.

The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not
hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the
medium‐term.
