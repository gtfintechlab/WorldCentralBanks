    "2022": [
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the latest financial market developments, noting that since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 9-10 March 2022 investor risk sentiment had improved considerably.",
        "Euro area equity prices had moved close to the levels recorded prior to the war in Ukraine, sovereign spreads had narrowed, and risk-free yields had increased markedly.",
        "At the same time, market-based measures of inflation compensation had continued to creep higher and stood well above the Governing Council’s 2% target over the entire horizon.",
        "Developments in sovereign yields in the euro area since the previous monetary policy meeting highlighted three facts.",
        "First, the GDP-weighted sovereign yield curve in the euro area had shifted upwards since the March meeting and currently stood considerably above the levels recorded prior to the war across the entire maturity spectrum.",
        "Second, the euro area yield curve had become steeper.",
        "Third, despite the recent rise, both short and long-term euro area nominal bond yields remained low from a historical perspective.",
        "A model-based breakdown of the recent increase in ten-year euro area risk-free rates pointed to two main factors driving the upward shift in sovereign yields since the previous meeting.",
        "First, the improvement in the global and euro area macroeconomic outlook and risk sentiment suggested that investors did not see the war’s effect on growth as being sufficiently strong and long-lasting to derail the recovery.",
        "The second, and related, factor reflected the anticipated monetary policy response.",
        "Consistent with expectations of continued growth and the sharp repricing of the inflation outlook, markets expected a faster pace of monetary policy normalisation in the euro area to bring real yields out of negative territory.",
        "Breaking down long-term yields into real rates and the inflation component showed that the rise in nominal long-term interest rates in the euro area since the Russian invasion of Ukraine mainly reflected a marked reappraisal of the inflation outlook by investors, while real interest rates had fallen slightly since March, despite the recent increase in nominal yields.",
        "The rising inflationary pressures were also evident from the inflation-linked swap forward curve, which had shifted markedly higher from the already elevated levels prevailing at the time of the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "This increase in inflation compensation had stemmed from higher inflation risk premia.",
        "Genuine inflation expectations had increased only moderately.",
        "The sharp rise in inflation risk premia signalled that investors demanded higher compensation for holding inflation risks in their portfolio.",
        "The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, which was a market-based measure of longer-term inflation expectations, stood at around 2.4%.",
        "This suggested that even over the longer term investors attached a higher probability to inflation turning out to be higher than expected, rather than lower than expected.",
        "Compared with March, the shift in market-based indicators of monetary policy expectations had been substantial.",
        "The overnight index swap (OIS) forward curve had become markedly steeper, with market participants pricing in just under a full 25 basis point rate hike in July this year and almost three 25 basis point rate hikes by the end of the year.",
        "Thereafter, markets expected the hiking cycle to continue, with six 25 basis point interest rate hikes expected in 2023.",
        "This suggested that markets saw the need for substantial policy action to secure medium-term price stability, reflecting the current, very negative, real short and long-term yields.",
        "The median participant response to the Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) showed that the first interest rate hike was still expected to take place in the fourth quarter of 2022, but the share of SMA participants expecting an earlier lift-off had now increased to around 40%.",
        "The expected path after lift-off, however, was substantially shallower compared with the path suggested by market pricing.",
        "This possibly indicated that rising term premia, on the back of high remaining uncertainty about the pace of policy normalisation, had contributed to the steeper forward curve, with markets’ genuine expectations probably being somewhat lower than indicated by the forward curve.",
        "Higher uncertainty about expected euro short-term money market rates, as priced in by the market, was in line with the premise of the ECB’s “reaction function” becoming more data-dependent.",
        "Markets were preparing for a substantially more pronounced US hiking cycle, compared with expectations in March, and now expected the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to hike rates by about 250 basis points over the next 12 months, with the federal funds rate expected to level off at a level above 3%.",
        "Moreover, the FOMC had hinted at a rapid reduction in its USD 9 trillion balance sheet, beginning as soon as at its next policy meeting in May.",
        "Limited movements in the exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar since the March monetary policy meeting suggested that the recent reappraisal by markets of the euro area monetary policy outlook was offsetting, at least in part, the downward pressure on the euro from the pronounced reappraisal of US monetary policy expectations.",
        "At the same time, the depreciation of the euro since the beginning of the year in response to the change in relative monetary policy expectations vis-à-vis the United States had been larger than was suggested by cross-country regularities.",
        "Furthermore, the recent strong recovery in equity prices reflected, first and foremost, a reversal of the earlier increase in the equity risk premium, mirroring the improving risk sentiment.",
        "A more fundamental factor explaining the resilience of equity prices, and of risk assets more generally, was that the earnings outlook for euro area firms had remained relatively robust, despite the war.",
        "Earnings expectations over the next 12 months had, so far, not been lowered.",
        "Longer-term earnings expectations had decreased substantially, but had stabilised at very elevated levels.",
        "Analysts continued to expect annual earnings growth of about 20% over the next three to five years, compared with a long-run average of around 8%.",
        "The cautious optimism displayed by market participants did not mean that investors were dismissing downside risks.",
        "As geopolitical risks remained elevated, markets continued to price in heightened tail risks.",
        "For instance, downside risks to equity markets remained elevated in the euro area.",
        "Another risk emanated from high margin calls in commodity futures markets, which had caused a large increase in the liquidity demand of non-financial corporations that were hedging their energy price exposures.",
        "Mr Lane went through the latest economic, monetary and financial developments in the global economy and the euro area.",
        "For global developments, the Spring 2022 World Economic Outlook (WEO) projections from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had significantly downgraded the forecast of world GDP growth for 2022 and also for 2023.",
        "The downward revision was very large for Russia but also significant for countries close to the war zone and reliant on Russia for their imports of energy and metals.",
        "Global supply chain bottlenecks had started to ease after the turn of the year.",
        "However, as a consequence of the war and the new lockdowns in China, that easing was stalling, or even reversing, and forward-looking indicators had started to point to a deterioration in global trade dynamics.",
        "The oil price had declined notably from the peaks observed after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",
        "Compared with the day of the March Governing Council meeting, the shorter-run futures path of oil prices was lower, but it was still higher compared with the cut-off date (28 February) for the March ECB staff projections.",
        "There had been relatively minor movements in the euro effective exchange rate since the March Governing Council meeting.",
        "Taking a longer-term perspective, the euro exchange rate had largely returned to pre-pandemic levels both in effective terms and against the US dollar.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, the Russian invasion of Ukraine had led to a spike in uncertainty, as indicated for example by the European Commission’s uncertainty measure.",
        "The recent evolution of confidence indicators suggested a deterioration in the short-term outlook, owing to the rise in energy prices, the increased uncertainty and the new wave of supply disruptions generated by the war and the lockdowns in China.",
        "However, the outlook for the third quarter was still relatively positive, as a boost from tourism could be expected in the summer.",
        "Similarly, the assessment for the fourth quarter remained positive.",
        "So far, the assessment was that the war would lead to a temporary slowdown in growth, but not a persistent downgrade.",
        "Looking at the components of domestic demand, private consumption was likely to have contracted in the first quarter, with a negative carry-over from the drop in retail sales in December 2021 and the further rise in energy prices hitting incomes.",
        "Pandemic restrictions had been lifted, but households had shown a strong negative reaction to the outbreak of the war, with consumer expectations plunging in March.",
        "In particular, household expectations regarding their own future financial situation – which generally were a good predictor of consumer spending – had deteriorated sharply.",
        "With regard to business investment, the uncertainty shock was expected to be more harmful to investment than consumption.",
        "While investment spending plans would certainly be affected by heightened uncertainty, these plans could also be affected by the rise in energy costs.",
        "Historically, the data showed a negative relationship between production costs and the profit rate, so it should not be expected that higher costs would be fully passed through to consumer prices.",
        "While trade data capturing the outbreak of the war were not yet available, the deficit on the energy and food trade balance had continued to deteriorate since the beginning of the year, as import prices for energy and goods continued to increase.",
        "This deterioration was partly compensated for by an improvement in the non-energy and non-food trade balance.",
        "The Purchasing Managers’ Index for manufacturing export orders had fallen into contractionary territory in March owing to the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China.",
        "Looking at labour market developments, the unemployment rate continued to decline and the labour market participation rate continued to improve.",
        "Across sectors, employment in market services, including tourism, had not yet returned to its pre-pandemic level, while the public sector had been a key driver of job creation, with public sector employment standing about 3% above the pre-pandemic level at the end of 2021.",
        "However, in March 2022 household expectations regarding unemployment had increased visibly, albeit much less than at the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.",
        "One important factor cushioning the impact of the shock was fiscal policies.",
        "The bulk of the euro area measures addressed the hike in energy prices, but part of the new package of measures also increased spending on defence and refugees.",
        "Turning to the latest inflation developments, headline inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had hit a new high of 7.5% in March, up from 5.9% in February.",
        "By far the biggest contribution came from the energy component, with over 4 percentage points.",
        "The recent increase in energy inflation was very large and the reaction of the economy could be subject to non-linearities, as the response of the economy – in terms of both inflation and output dynamics – might not be proportional to its response to the usually much smaller fluctuations in energy prices.",
        "Breaking down energy inflation, the fuel component, which historically accounted for the largest contribution, had been relatively stable.",
        "The recent big increases in energy inflation had instead been due to electricity and gas prices.",
        "Food inflation had also been on an upward trend since last summer and had reached 5.0% in March.",
        "Goods inflation in March had stood about 2.5 percentage points above its longer-term mean.",
        "A significant contribution of about 1 percentage point of this increase was from the pass-through of higher energy costs and from supply bottlenecks.",
        "But there was also a significant part that could not simply be attributed to the broadening of the energy shock and the impact of ongoing bottlenecks.",
        "Indicators of pipeline pressures signalled that goods inflation, which had historically been very low, would remain high not just in 2022 but also well into 2023.",
        "Services inflation had been going up, and a lot of this seemed to be in areas that were reopening.",
        "With the normalisation of travel and tourism, entertainment, restaurants and so on, services that had either cut prices or kept them low during the pandemic were now normalising prices or even increasing them by a larger margin.",
        "A lot of the indicators of underlying inflation in the euro area – both exclusion-based and model-based – had stood well above 2% in February, and HICP inflation excluding energy and food had risen to 3% in March.",
        "However, it remained uncertain how persistent the rise in these indicators would be, given the role of temporary pandemic-related factors and the indirect effects of higher energy prices.",
        "Regarding the wage outlook, growth in negotiated wages in the euro area had been gradually increasing but had remained moderate in recent months at less than 2%.",
        "Forward-looking information from wage agreements, which often spanned more than one year, supported the view that wage pressures would increase only gradually.",
        "Nominal wages were usually expected to be equal to the sum of productivity and consumer prices but could be well below that level in 2022, reflecting a decline in the labour share of income and the negative effects of high import prices on consumer prices.",
        "Looking at inflation expectations, the April 2022 Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) showed that the distribution of individual responses had continued to shift to the right.",
        "The mode of the distribution was still at 2%, after averaging well below 2% in the 2019-21 SPF rounds.",
        "Overall, longer-term inflation expectations (for 2026) reported in the SPF averaged 2.1%, which amounted to an upward revision from 2.0% in the previous round.",
        "In both the SPF and the SMA, inflation was expected to be above 2% in 2022 and was seen as very likely to be above 2% in 2023.",
        "But for 2024 there was basically an even chance that inflation would be above or below target.",
        "This overall scenario reflected a widespread view of inflation dynamics held by experts at a variety of institutions.",
        "Regarding market-based indicators of inflation compensation, these had increased further in the euro area and the increases were particularly large at shorter horizons.",
        "For longer horizons, once these indicators were adjusted for risk premia, expectations were by and large around 2%.",
        "Turning to financial and monetary developments, financial conditions were broadly unchanged.",
        "However, since the March Governing Council meeting the €STR forward curve had shifted up markedly over short and medium-term tenors, with a steep increase seen even when adjusting for risk premia.",
        "Comparing the current forward curve with the situation at the time of the December 2021 Governing Council meeting revealed that there had been a remarkable tightening of market rates that were relevant for pricing bank loans and for sovereign bonds.",
        "Bank funding costs were increasing, driven by the rise in bank bond yields.",
        "However, the upward pressure on overall bank funding costs was limited because banks were relying on other funding sources.",
        "Interest rates on customer deposits, which accounted for almost half of bank liabilities, still hovered at historic lows, and the outstanding central bank funding continued to be at very favourable rates.",
        "Bank lending rates remained low and had so far been overall broadly shielded from the rise in market rates.",
        "According to the latest bank lending survey for the euro area, banks had reported a continued net increase in loan demand from firms in the first quarter of 2022.",
        "Banks also reported a net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms in the same quarter, mainly owing to increased risk perceptions and decreased risk tolerance.",
        "Moreover, banks expected a considerably stronger net tightening in the second quarter.",
        "Banks had reported a net increase in households’ loan demand in the first quarter of 2022.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane stressed that the adverse economic impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine combined several mechanisms.",
        "It was evident that the war and the associated uncertainty were weighing heavily on business and consumer confidence.",
        "In addition, just as the supply disruptions from the acute phase of the pandemic were easing, the war had created new bottlenecks, while a new set of pandemic measures in Asia was also contributing to supply chain problems.",
        "Some sectors faced growing difficulties in sourcing inputs, which was disrupting production.",
        "The further sharp rises in energy and commodity prices were increasing the production costs of firms and reducing the purchasing power of households.",
        "How the economy would develop was crucially dependent on the evolution of the conflict, on the impact of sanctions and on possible further measures.",
        "However, there were also offsetting factors, such as compensatory fiscal measures and the possibility for households to draw on savings accumulated during the pandemic.",
        "Moreover, the reopening of the sectors most affected by the pandemic and a strong labour market would continue to support incomes and spending.",
        "Furthermore, over time, the euro area would find alternative energy suppliers and adapt production technologies to become less dependent on fossil fuels.",
        "Overall, the war in Ukraine had substantially increased the risks to the growth outlook, which were clearly skewed to the downside.",
        "While risks relating to the pandemic had declined, the war might have an even stronger effect on economic sentiment and could further worsen supply-side constraints.",
        "Persistently high energy costs, together with a loss of confidence, could drag down demand and restrain consumption and investment more than expected.",
        "Inflation had increased to 7.5% in March, from an already revised 5.9% in February.",
        "Energy prices, which had been driven higher after the outbreak of the war and stood 45% above their level one year before, continued to be the main reason for the high rate of inflation.",
        "Market-based indicators suggested that energy prices would stay high in the near term but would moderate thereafter.",
        "Food prices had also increased sharply owing to elevated transportation and production costs, notably the higher price of fertilisers, which was also related to the war in Ukraine.",
        "Core inflation, as measured by the HICP excluding energy and food, had risen from 2.7% in February to 3.0% in March, with an increase in the sectoral inflation rate for both the non-energy industrial goods sector and the services sector.",
        "Overall, the recent developments suggested that inflation rates would remain very high in the short term.",
        "The war had aggravated the uncertainty about future energy price developments and would influence the pace at which price pressures from global supply bottlenecks would subside.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation had increased to levels above 2% in recent months.",
        "It was uncertain how persistent the rise in these indicators would be, given the role of temporary pandemic-related factors and the indirect effects of higher energy prices.",
        "Long-lasting impairments to supply potential were also possible if energy prices persisted at elevated levels.",
        "While various measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets and from expert surveys were largely around 2%, initial signs of above-target revisions in a number of indicators of inflation expectations warranted close monitoring.",
        "Upside risks surrounding the inflation outlook had intensified, especially in the near term.",
        "If price pressures fed through into higher inflation expectations and higher than anticipated wage rises, or if supply-side conditions worsened more durably, inflation could turn out to be higher over the medium term.",
        "However, if demand were to weaken over the medium term amid a persistent erosion of real incomes by high energy prices and the high cost of other goods and services, this could also ease pressures on prices.",
        "Financial markets had been highly volatile since Russia invaded Ukraine.",
        "The upward shift in the risk-free curve had so far not triggered a wider repricing of credit risk.",
        "Neither had there been severe strains in money markets or liquidity shortages in the euro area banking system.",
        "However, since the Governing Council’s March meeting market interest rates and bank funding costs had continued to increase.",
        "Bank lending rates for firms and households had so far remained broadly insulated from the increases in market rates, thanks to ample liquidity support, low deposit rates and the overall health of bank balance sheets.",
        "Lending to households was holding up, especially for house purchases, while the flow of loans to firms had stabilised.",
        "The most recent ECB bank lending survey reported that credit standards on loans to firms and on housing loans had tightened in the first quarter of the year, as lenders became more concerned about the risks facing their customers in an uncertain environment.",
        "Participants in the survey expected credit standards to tighten further in the coming months, as banks weighed the adverse economic impact of the war and higher energy prices.",
        "Mr Lane stressed that the Governing Council should be very attentive to the current uncertainties and closely monitor the incoming data in relation to their implications for the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "By the June monetary policy meeting there would be more information about the course of the war and its wider ramifications.",
        "This would allow the Governing council to assess more extensively the net impact on the economy and inflation dynamics.",
        "At the same time, Mr Lane highlighted that the Governing Council could conclude that the data available since the 9-10 March meeting supported the expectation that net asset purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) should be concluded in the third quarter.",
        "Looking ahead, monetary policy would depend on incoming data and on the evolving assessment of the outlook.",
        "In the current conditions of high uncertainty, there was a need to maintain optionality, gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "In particular, Mr Lane stressed that the Governing Council should state its readiness to adjust all of the instruments within its mandate, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflation stabilised at 2% over the medium term.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks to the outlook provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Russia’s aggression towards Ukraine was affecting the economy, both in Europe and beyond.",
        "The conflict and the associated uncertainty were weighing heavily on the confidence of businesses and consumers.",
        "Trade disruptions were leading to new shortages of materials and inputs.",
        "Surging energy and commodity prices were reducing demand and holding back production.",
        "At the same time, economic activity was still being supported by the reopening of the economy after the crisis phase of the pandemic.",
        "Looking ahead, how the economy performed was crucially dependent on the evolution of the conflict, on the impact of sanctions and on possible further measures.",
        "Inflation had increased significantly and would remain high over the coming months, mainly because of the sharp rise in energy costs.",
        "Moreover, inflation pressures had intensified across many sectors.",
        "As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane that Russia’s war in Ukraine and a surge in COVID-19 infections in Asia – with the strict lockdown measures taken by the Chinese government to contain the virus – were clouding the global outlook, amid signs that strains in supply chains had started to increase again.",
        "Concern was also expressed about shortages of inputs produced in Russia and Ukraine leading to further strains.",
        "The impact of the war in Ukraine would depend on economic sanctions against Russia, which might be extended to oil and gas.",
        "This was likely to dampen global growth and raise energy prices further.",
        "Turning to euro area developments, the economy had grown by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2021.",
        "It was estimated that growth had remained weak during the first quarter of 2022, owing largely to pandemic-related restrictions.",
        "Several factors pointed to slow growth also in the period ahead.",
        "The war was already weighing on the confidence of businesses and consumers, including through the uncertainty it brought.",
        "With energy and commodity prices rising sharply and the war creating new bottlenecks, households were facing a higher cost of living and firms were confronted with higher production costs.",
        "Some sectors faced growing difficulties in sourcing their inputs, which was disrupting production.",
        "However, there were also offsetting factors underpinning the ongoing recovery, such as compensatory fiscal measures and the possibility for households to draw on savings they had accumulated during the pandemic.",
        "Moreover, the reopening of those sectors most affected by the pandemic and a strong labour market with more people in jobs would continue to support incomes and spending.",
        "Fiscal and monetary policy support remained critical, especially in the present difficult geopolitical situation.",
        "In addition, the successful implementation of the investment and reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme would accelerate the energy and green transitions.",
        "Members agreed with Mr Lane that heightened uncertainty was affecting the euro area outlook, along with the negative supply shock driven by the surge in energy and other commodity prices.",
        "Uncertainty had reached levels that made any assessment of the future course of the economy subject to very wide confidence bands.",
        "The energy shock was eroding real incomes severely.",
        "The terms-of-trade “tax” from higher energy prices had now risen to 3.5% of euro area GDP.",
        "This was expected to squeeze domestic demand, with fiscal measures mitigating the shock but unlikely to fully offset it.",
        "Forward-looking business confidence indicators had weakened substantially, in part owing to an intensification of supply chain disruptions.",
        "It was therefore argued that a technical recession in the coming quarters could not be ruled out.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that, overall, the incoming data suggested that the war would slow the recovery but not derail it, unless a less likely “tail” scenario materialised.",
        "This was also consistent with financial market developments since the previous Governing Council meeting.",
        "In the ECB’s Corporate Telephone Survey (CTS), for example, many firms reported that the impact of the war was being felt primarily in terms of prices and costs, but not in terms of orders and production.",
        "While there were significant concerns about future activity, reflecting the high uncertainty, surveys suggested that the immediate impact of the war was more moderate.",
        "Recent private sector forecasts continued to predict real GDP growth of around 3% in 2022, with predictions for growth in 2023 largely unchanged from before the war.",
        "At this pace of growth, the economy would continue to absorb remaining slack.",
        "Finally, it was pointed out that high energy prices were already resulting in a drop in energy consumption, suggesting that the price elasticity of energy might be higher than assumed.",
        "The reaction of household spending and saving propensity was considered a key element in the macroeconomic transmission of the Russia-Ukraine war shock.",
        "Indicators related to consumer behaviour were deteriorating and consumer confidence had fallen sharply in March.",
        "The expectation of weaker demand was spilling over into production and investment plans, with the result that business expectations had also declined sharply in March.",
        "The confidence shock to investment could be very substantial and fuelled by an accelerator mechanism, although uncertainty about the ultimate impact on growth remained exceptionally high at this stage.",
        "This effect could be aggravated by the impact of the high degree of uncertainty on household saving rates.",
        "Possibly renewed higher saving by households and reduced business investment could, in turn, weaken demand.",
        "This came at a time when household spending capacity was directly affected by the drop in real incomes owing to higher inflation.",
        "In this context, it was remarked that the perceived drop in purchasing power, in addition to the actual drop owing to higher inflation, was also important in and of itself as a determinant of consumption decisions.",
        "This applied particularly to households in the lowest quintile of the income distribution.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that the hit to real incomes owing to the rise in energy prices was being cushioned to some degree by fiscal measures at the national level, as well as by accumulated savings that still amounted to more than 12% of annual disposable income.",
        "Regarding the fiscal policy response to the Russia-Ukraine war, it was highlighted that government measures could soften the domestic impact of the war on the most affected segments of the population.",
        "Positive news was seen to come from a fast-improving labour market, with unemployment falling to a historical low of 6.8% in February.",
        "The labour market continued to be very strong – even stronger than had been expected earlier – and the unemployment rate and the ratio of unemployed workers to job vacancies had fallen to record lows.",
        "Surveys suggested that firms’ hiring plans remained unaffected by the war.",
        "It was pointed out, however, that while public sector employment stood clearly above its pre-pandemic level, employment in the private sector remained somewhat below, in particular when looking at hours worked.",
        "Together with workers’ concerns about job security, this was likely contributing to moderate wage growth.",
        "Against this background, members assessed the risks to the economic outlook as tilted to the downside.",
        "While risks relating to the pandemic had declined, the war in Ukraine might have a stronger effect on economic sentiment and could worsen supply-side constraints again.",
        "Persistently high energy costs, together with a loss of confidence, could drag down demand more than expected and constrain consumption and investment.",
        "With regard to price developments, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Inflation had increased to a new record high of 7.5% in March, from 5.9% in February.",
        "The rise in energy prices after the start of the war had reached an annual rate of 45%.",
        "Energy prices continued to be the main contributor to the high rate of inflation, with market-based measures suggesting that energy prices would remain high in the near term but then fall slightly.",
        "Nevertheless, price rises had become more widespread.",
        "Food prices had increased sharply.",
        "This was due to rising transportation and production costs, notably the higher price of fertilisers, which were in part related to the war in Ukraine.",
        "Supply bottlenecks, energy costs and the normalisation of demand as the economy reopened after the crisis phase of the pandemic continued to put upward pressure on prices.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation had risen to levels well above 2% in recent months.",
        "It was uncertain how persistent the rise in these indicators would be, given the role of temporary pandemic-related factors and the indirect effects of higher energy prices, but expected faster growth in wages should support underlying inflation as the economy returned to full capacity over time.",
        "While various measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets and from expert surveys largely stood at around 2%, initial signs of above-target revisions to those measures warranted close monitoring.",
        "Members noted that higher energy prices driven by the war in Ukraine had been the main, but not the only, reason why inflation in March had once again been higher than projected.",
        "The war was also putting a lot of upward pressure on global food prices, which was likely to push euro area consumer food prices up further in the future.",
        "In addition, high energy prices were now creeping into all sectors of the economy – affecting both manufacturing and services – and making inflation an increasingly widespread and persistent phenomenon.",
        "As a result, measures of underlying inflation had risen to levels significantly above 2% and it was now considered unlikely that inflation would return to the ECB’s target in the near term.",
        "It was also judged to be relatively unlikely that the drag on private demand from the war would be severe enough to reduce inflation substantially over the medium term.",
        "Even if the economic consequences of the war were greater than currently expected, there were a number of factors that would make inflation more persistent than projected at present.",
        "One was related to pipeline pressures.",
        "Euro area producer prices had increased by more than 30% in January – an all-time high.",
        "The war in Ukraine and the pandemic measures in China suggested that pipeline pressures and bottlenecks were likely to intensify further, affecting consumer prices over a relatively long period of time.",
        "Moreover, given the size of the energy shock, the pass-through to consumer prices was likely to be greater than in the past and, in an environment of higher inflation overall, consumers could be more willing to accept a stronger pass-through from costs to prices.",
        "A second factor related to wages.",
        "So far, only a small number of wage contracts had been renegotiated since inflation started to surge.",
        "But there could be little doubt that workers would eventually ask for compensation for the loss in real income.",
        "And a third factor related to structural upward pressures on inflation.",
        "The war had increased the prospects of a further acceleration in the green transition.",
        "This could exacerbate supply and demand imbalances in many commodity markets where the prices of many metals were already at record highs.",
        "In addition, European governments were trying to actively limit their dependency on global value chains in areas of strategic importance.",
        "This could be expected to accelerate “reshoring” efforts, loosening the brake of globalisation on wages and inflation.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that given the further rise in energy costs owing to the war in Ukraine it was unsurprising that the March inflation figures had been higher than earlier projections.",
        "However, stronger energy price pressures in the short term were not inconsistent with lower inflation in the medium term if the lagged effects of weaker demand outweighed the supply effect of the shock.",
        "The issue was rather how fast inflation, which was still rising, would decline towards 2%.",
        "In addition, it was pointed out that the current increase in inflation was due to global factors: oil and commodity prices, supply bottlenecks and the war in Ukraine.",
        "Unlike in the United States, domestic demand in the euro area was still below its potential.",
        "This meant that drivers of domestic price pressures, such as wages, employment and medium-term inflation expectations, were not inconsistent overall with the ECB’s price stability objective.",
        "With respect to pipeline price pressures, it was argued that these were mostly affecting annual inflation rates one year ahead and were to some extent distorted by the impact of the pandemic and supply chain disruptions, which should in principle be transitory.",
        "What was not clear was the extent to which pipeline pressures could fuel a phase of higher inflation lasting into the medium term.",
        "It was also pointed out that energy prices appeared to be already below their peaks of this year and inflation in the coming months could already reflect substantial negative base effects.",
        "Members pointed out that it was hard to imagine sustained higher inflation without an increase in wage pressures.",
        "While developments in negotiated wages at the euro area level were expected to remain moderate this year, with wage agreements somewhere between 1.5% and 2.5%, evidence from different countries pointed to some heterogeneity.",
        "Furthermore, moderate wage demands were to be expected in the current uncertain environment, with workers increasingly concerned about job security.",
        "However, the usefulness of hard data on wages for gauging future inflation pressures was called into question, given that wages reacted with a substantial lag to price increases.",
        "It was therefore suggested that it was just a matter of time before wage growth caught up, in view of the large and persistent overshoot of the inflation target.",
        "The CTS also suggested that pressures for larger wage increases were building up.",
        "Moreover, the picture for the wage outlook could change very quickly, as unemployment was at record low levels, strengthening the bargaining position of employees.",
        "While only a few euro area countries had formal wage indexation clauses, as one factor explaining higher wage growth than the euro area average, the situation could change over time and there were other mechanisms for restoring lost purchasing power.",
        "Overall, there was broad consensus that stubbornly high, and higher than expected, inflation increased the risk of second-round effects arising through wage costs.",
        "However, views differed on the extent to which such risks were likely to materialise.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that, given the usual time lags, second-round effects would not necessarily result in higher wage growth in the current year.",
        "They were more likely to push wage growth up later in 2023.",
        "Waiting for wage growth to accelerate before forming a view on future inflation developments would therefore be misguided, as the upside risk to inflation would then already be materialising and the resulting wage-price spiral would be hard to stop.",
        "On the other hand, it was argued that second-round effects on wages would require a structural change in the labour market, and specifically in the structural parameters of the wage Phillips curve, which represented the relationship between wage growth and unemployment.",
        "The currently estimated parameters suggested only a very low pass-through from price changes to wages.",
        "As there was so far little evidence of structural changes taking place in the labour market, second-round effects through wages were unlikely at the current juncture.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, members took note of the assessments provided by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane of the latest developments in market-based measures of inflation compensation and survey-based indicators.",
        "It was argued that there were increasing signs that the current high inflation was becoming entrenched in expectations, with a number of indicators of longer-term inflation expectations at least starting to become unanchored from the ECB’s inflation target.",
        "In the financial markets, medium and long-term inflation-linked swap rates were now above 2%, even though this was partly due to the risk premia reflected in the rates.",
        "Moreover, rising premia implied that investors were demanding insurance against the risk of inflation being above 2%.",
        "Private sector forecasts, such as those covered by the SPF, were also moving above 2%.",
        "Preliminary evidence from the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) suggested that inflation expectations had become an important factor in determining companies’ future selling prices.",
        "Early results from the Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) showed that households’ inflation expectations three years ahead had increased significantly.",
        "It was consequently argued that there were some indications of longer-term inflation expectations starting to move away from the target.",
        "However, it was also underlined that, in general, financial market indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were around 2%, which was broadly consistent with the ECB’s 2% medium-term target, given that risk premia had to be subtracted from the market swap rates.",
        "This did not suggest signs of inflation expectations becoming unanchored.",
        "Moreover, against the backdrop of the current large inflation shock, it was regarded as normal that the inflation expectations of households and firms should temporarily rise somewhat.",
        "The fact that inflation expectations had increased so little in response to very high inflation rates, despite the fact that households and firms typically adapt their expectations to recent developments, could actually be seen as a sign of the credibility of the ECB’s policy.",
        "This muted reaction of inflation expectations was very different from what had happened following the oil shock in the 1970s.",
        "Overall, there was wide agreement that while various measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets and from expert surveys largely stood at around 2%, initial signs of above-target revisions to those measures warranted close monitoring.",
        "Against this background, members assessed the upside risks surrounding the inflation outlook to have intensified, especially in the near term.",
        "The risks to the medium-term inflation outlook included above-target moves in inflation expectations, higher than anticipated wage rises and a durable worsening of supply-side conditions.",
        "However, if demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressure on prices.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members widely concurred with the assessments provided by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane in their introductions.",
        "Nominal long-term interest rates had been gradually rising, mainly owing to higher inflation compensation, while real long-term interest rates had remained below the levels observed before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",
        "Short-term nominal interest rates had been rising on expectations of a normalisation of the Governing Council’s monetary policy stance, but also reflected to some extent a tighter monetary policy in the United States.",
        "The question was therefore raised as to whether the anticipation of further rate increases would lead to a shift in the timing of consumption and investment by households and firms.",
        "It was noted that, in view of the Governing Council’s recent decisions, the dynamics observed in financial markets so far had to be considered benign.",
        "The pace of policy normalisation as expected by market participants appeared gradual from a historical perspective, while interest rate spreads between sovereign and risk-free rates had remained contained.",
        "This was in part seen as testimony to the efforts to strengthen the euro area banking and financial system, which was much more robust than it had been a decade ago.",
        "Overall, financing conditions were assessed as favourable, with real rates remaining in negative territory and at historical lows.",
        "It was remarked that the euro exchange rate had stabilised, although its future dynamics would depend on the relative monetary policy stances in the euro area and the United States.",
        "The argument was made that smaller interest rate differentials would strengthen the euro, directly lowering the import cost of commodities priced in US dollars.",
        "This would counter inflationary pressures, while it could also exert a negative effect on economic activity.",
        "According to the most recent euro area bank lending survey, a further tightening of credit standards on loans to firms and on housing loans had to be expected in the coming months.",
        "This was likely to dampen lending growth and could give rise to tensions in credit supply.",
        "It was highlighted that banks’ funding costs were increasing.",
        "If banks also tightened their lending standards as the survey suggested, this could translate into a higher cost of bank borrowing for the private sector.",
        "Indeed, mortgage rates offered by non-bank lenders had risen noticeably in a few jurisdictions, leading to a tightening of financing conditions even before any change in the ECB policy rates.",
        "However, it was also pointed out that bank lending rates for firms and households had so far remained broadly insulated from the increases in market rates, and credit conditions did not currently signal lending constraints for the non-financial sector.",
        "Furthermore, it was cautioned that the more restrictive stance reported in the bank lending survey might in part represent a normalisation after a period of very favourable conditions.",
        "Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members widely expressed concern over the high inflation numbers, which had become a major issue for households and businesses.",
        "Both headline and underlying inflation were at historically high levels, with price pressures extending well beyond energy.",
        "If owner-occupied housing costs had been included in the HICP, underlying inflation would have been even higher, by 0.7 percentage points, in the fourth quarter of 2021.",
        "It was noted that various indicators of longer-term inflation expectations had been creeping up, with an increased risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored from the target.",
        "At the same time, it was also argued that developments in market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations could still generally be interpreted as positive, suggesting it was more likely than a few months earlier that the Governing Council’s 2% inflation target would be met on a sustained basis.",
        "Against this background some members viewed it as important to act without undue delay in order to demonstrate the Governing Council’s determination to achieve price stability in the medium term.",
        "Such action was deemed necessary to prevent the temporary bout of higher inflation from becoming entrenched and to prevent inflation expectations from rising further from the Governing Council’s target, which would make it significantly more costly to bring inflation back to the target.",
        "These members judged that the highly accommodative monetary policy stance, which had been appropriate when inflation expectations risked becoming unanchored to the downside, was no longer consistent with the inflation outlook, which was characterised by high inflation levels and increasing inflation expectations.",
        "At present monetary policy was still contributing to stimulating the economy as real interest rates remained in deep negative territory.",
        "Past projection errors, for both headline and underlying inflation, were contributing to these concerns.",
        "Many of the upside risks to the inflation outlook that the Governing Council had already discussed last summer had materialised even before the war started.",
        "These included more persistent supply and demand imbalances, and the fact that the futures curve on which the energy price assumptions were based might not be a good predictor of future energy price pressures.",
        "Other members argued, however, that adjusting the monetary policy stance too aggressively could prove counterproductive, as it would lower growth while inflation remained elevated because monetary policy was unable to address the immediate causes of high inflation.",
        "The sequence of measures decided by the Governing Council at previous meetings to normalise the monetary policy stance were recalled.",
        "These measures included the decrease in net asset purchases; the phasing-out of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), of the pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) and of the special interest rate on the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs); and the communication of the expected end of the APP in the third quarter of 2022.",
        "It was highlighted that the ongoing normalisation was visible in market interest rates and could be expected to weigh on the economy in the coming quarters.",
        "However, the view was also expressed that real rates remained exceptionally low and the dampening of aggregate demand as a result of higher nominal rates would be insufficient to bring inflation back to 2% in the medium term without a further adjustment of the monetary policy stance.",
        "All in all, members widely shared the view that the gradual normalisation of the monetary policy stance, which the Governing Council had started at its December meeting, should be continued and had to be adjusted to the medium-term inflation outlook, which had changed since that time.",
        "Given the Governing Council’s current assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook and the highly accommodative monetary policy stance, there was broad agreement that the Governing Council should express its judgement that the data received since the last meeting reinforced its expectation that net asset purchases under the APP should be concluded in the third quarter.",
        "The view that net asset purchases should end sooner rather than later in the third quarter was widely expressed.",
        "Looking ahead, members voiced some nuances related to the appropriate pace of the gradual normalisation.",
        "On the one hand, some members viewed the higher than expected inflation figure in March and inflation expectations moving above the 2% target as requiring an adjustment of the monetary policy stance towards a neutral position sooner rather than later and a modification of the Governing Council’s inflation narrative in line with the stated data-dependency of its monetary policy.",
        "This implied that net asset purchases should be ended as soon as possible, opening the possibility for a first interest rate hike shortly after.",
        "It was noted that if the upside risks to the inflation outlook were confirmed in the June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the Governing Council would face the question of whether continuing net purchases beyond June could still be seen as proportionate.",
        "A risk was also seen that, if the Governing Council did not signal a faster policy normalisation process, inflation expectations would continue to rise further from a level which was already above the Governing Council’s target.",
        "It was stressed that the assessment of the outlook had evolved substantially since March and that, if these changes to the outlook were confirmed in June, concrete steps to accelerate the pace of policy normalisation would be required to ensure that inflation stabilised at 2% over the medium term.",
        "Such a path was seen as safeguarding optionality while remaining within the boundaries of the Governing Council’s policy guidance and thereby avoiding an increase in perceived policy uncertainty.",
        "It would also help to demonstrate the Governing Council’s readiness to adjust its tools as appropriate, thereby strengthening its credibility to deliver on its mandate.",
        "In this context, it was also recalled that acting too late could lead to a materialisation of second-round effects and might have high economic, financial stability and credibility costs if the Governing Council were forced to tighten more aggressively at a later stage in order to re-anchor inflation expectations.",
        "It was argued that, while it typically took some time for higher expected inflation to be reflected in wage-setting, the opposite process was also lengthy; if higher inflation expectations became entrenched in wage agreements, lowering inflation would become harder.",
        "In this context, experience from the 1970s was referred to as having demonstrated how essential a commitment to price stability was for the ability of monetary policy to contain inflationary effects of adverse supply shocks.",
        "Other members, however, maintained that the gradual normalisation process embodied in financial market expectations was consistent with longer-term inflation expectations remaining anchored at 2% and did not require a reappraisal of the monetary policy path.",
        "This would not support accelerating the timing of any restrictive measures, including in relation to the end of net asset purchases.",
        "In view of the stability of the longer-term inflation outlook, embodied both in market-based indicators and the March baseline ECB staff projections, a shift in the monetary policy guidance from a gradual normalisation to a more aggressive and accelerated tightening did not seem justified.",
        "Considering the high uncertainty surrounding the medium-term outlook for price stability, it seemed advisable to proceed with further actions very carefully.",
        "It was also noted that being too proactive in the normalisation of the stance could prove costly if it resulted in financial market turbulence or had to be reversed later.",
        "A gradual normalisation was also deemed consistent with the estimated low level of the natural interest rate in the euro area, which implied that even relatively small steps might be sufficient to turn the current accommodative monetary policy stance into a restrictive stance.",
        "Model-based estimates suggested that the natural real interest rate was still negative, although it had to be acknowledged that uncertainty surrounding the estimated values was high.",
        "Moreover, there was a gap between estimates for the US and euro area natural real interest rates, which might be explained partly by differences in productivity, labour supply and demographics as well as the level of excess liquidity.",
        "Notwithstanding the low level of the natural rate, it was recalled that the expected path of the nominal key ECB interest rates would approach a neutral level only at a very late stage of the policy normalisation process.",
        "Overall, the view prevailed that, in the light of the heightened uncertainty resulting from the still ongoing effects of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, optionality, gradualism, and flexibility remained important features of the Governing Council’s monetary policy conduct.",
        "In particular, it was seen as advisable to maintain optionality and defer a decision regarding the precise timing of the end of net asset purchases until the Governing Council’s June meeting, which would allow the Governing Council to benefit from additional data and the new Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "As uncertainty was exceptionally high, different scenarios for future developments in the inflation outlook could be envisaged.",
        "It was also highlighted that Mr Lane’s proposal left all options open for decisions to be taken at the June meeting.",
        "In particular, the proposal was seen as consistent with the possibility of deciding to end net asset purchases already at the end of the second quarter or early in the third quarter.",
        "All in all, members agreed that the monetary policy proposal by Mr Lane in his introduction was in line with keeping all optionality, in the light of the current high uncertainty, and would allow the Governing Council to reassess the inflation outlook on the basis of the incoming information at its June meeting.",
        "This approach implied, on the one hand, that the Governing Council remained on its course of a gradual normalisation of monetary policy, consistent with its forward guidance that interest rates would be raised some time after the end of net asset purchases.",
        "On the other hand, considering that “some time” had been defined as a period between one week and several months at the March press conference, the approach did not prevent a timely rate rise if conditions so warranted.",
        "As regards the forward guidance on interest rates, the view was expressed that the criteria for interest rate hikes were already clearly met.",
        "In this context, it was stressed that the Governing Council should pay the same attention to longer-term inflation expectations moving above target as it had when inflation expectations had fallen below target in the past, in line with the Governing Council’s commitment to “symmetry”.",
        "Otherwise there was a risk of “falling behind the curve”.",
        "Overall, however, it was judged that the forward guidance conditions for an upward adjustment of the key ECB interest rates would become crucial for the policy discussion at the Governing Council’s June meeting.",
        "This pertained both to the two criteria applicable to the projected path of inflation and to the third condition, i.e.",
        "that the realised progress in underlying inflation be sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term.",
        "Although spreads between sovereign bond yields and risk-free rates had remained broadly stable since the last Governing Council meeting, it was deemed important to address a possible resurgence of fragmentation in euro area financial conditions, if necessary, in order to ensure a continuous transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area.",
        "Reference was made to the “separation principle”, i.e.",
        "the idea that the appropriate monetary policy stance could be set independently of the deployment of instruments designed to avoid a sudden disruption of financial markets that could be triggered by a tightening of the stance.",
        "The argument was made that flexibility should be a permanent feature of the Governing Council’s toolbox, and all of the ECB’s instruments could be adjusted within the mandate, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflation stabilised at the Governing Council’s 2% target over the medium term.",
        "In addition, it was recalled that the reinvestment of assets purchased under the PEPP could be used to address possible episodes of financial market tensions related to the pandemic, if needed.",
        "Regarding communication, members broadly agreed that the policy guidance that had been provided in March should be confirmed and the consistency of future action with that guidance should be emphasised, while asserting that the Governing Council would continue to act according to the established principles of flexibility, optionality and gradualism.",
        "Although communication had to acknowledge the increase in inflation and its detrimental effects on households’ cost of living, as well as real wealth and disposable income, the view was expressed that the Governing Council needed to be careful to not create the impression that monetary policy was able to address high energy inflation, which was driving a significant part of current inflation figures.",
        "Instead, the ECB’s communication had to underline the need for monetary policy to address the persistence of inflation that could result from second-round effects, and avoid creating the perception of inaction in the presence of high inflation figures.",
        "Finally, the Governing Council had to emphasise that it was willing to take whatever action was needed to fulfil the ECB’s mandate to pursue price stability and to bring inflation back to 2% over the medium term.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the ECB’s press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the latest financial market developments since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 2-3 February 2022.",
        "Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the shift in the ECB’s communication agreed at the February meeting had contributed to the orderly adjustment in financial markets towards less accommodative financial conditions that were more consistent with a changing medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "The uncertainty triggered by the war had temporarily halted and partly reversed the repricing of monetary policy expectations globally, leading to heightened volatility across market segments.",
        "However, so far, market stress and dislocations appeared less severe than at the peak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic shock.",
        "The largest market impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine to date had been on commodity prices, with oil and gas registering new multi-year highs and futures curves shifting up significantly from already elevated levels.",
        "The resulting energy price rise had contributed to a substantial reappraisal by markets of the euro area inflation outlook.",
        "First, the entire inflation-linked swap-based forward curve had shifted significantly upwards and was now above 2% up to the ten-year horizon.",
        "As these measures contained inflation risk premia, genuine inflation expectations were likely to be somewhat lower.",
        "Moreover, longer-term indicators of market-based inflation expectations had also moved materially higher, going above 2%.",
        "Most of this uptick had come at the beginning of the previous week when markets had started to price in a shallower path for the anticipated tightening of euro area monetary policy.",
        "With inflation continuing to surprise on the upside, a discernible repricing of euro area monetary policy expectations had been observed at the start of the year.",
        "Most of the upward shift in the forward curve for the overnight index swap (OIS) rate observed prior to the war had happened before the Governing Council’s 2-3 February meeting.",
        "The Russian invasion of Ukraine had halted and partly reversed the repricing of ECB policy rate expectations, as markets had priced in around a two-month postponement of a first interest rate hike relative to pre-war expectations.",
        "Investors expected one 25-basis point increase around the turn of the year, while the expected speed of the tightening cycle after “lift-off” remained broadly unchanged.",
        "Uncertainty around policy rate expectations based on information from option prices had also increased.",
        "Since February, the distribution of risks around the expected path of the three-month EURIBOR had widened substantially, reflecting the heightened uncertainty surrounding both the economic and the inflation outlook.",
        "The more pronounced skewness of the distribution suggested that markets had become even more concerned about upside risks to inflation.",
        "Risk-free long-term yields on both sides of the Atlantic had continued to move in close step, even though the drop in German Bund yields had been somewhat more pronounced than for US Treasury yields.",
        "This signalled that investors seemed to see the war driving only a small wedge between the growth outlook in the United States and in the euro area.",
        "The sharp and unprecedented widening of the Bund-OIS spread following the Russian attack suggested that flight to safety had been a more relevant factor than the repricing in monetary policy expectations, which affected Bund and OIS yields to the same extent.",
        "Developments in real interest rates could similarly be characterised as having gone through two phases since the Governing Council’s February monetary policy meeting.",
        "In the first phase, before the Russian invasion, real yields had increased strongly at the short and the long end of the curve in line with a gradual normalisation of financial conditions following the reappraisal of monetary policy expectations globally.",
        "After the Russian attack, real yields had fallen sharply across global risk-free sovereign yield curves driven by safe haven flows, with the decline being more pronounced at the short end, also reflecting a sharp increase in expected inflation.",
        "Spreads of euro area sovereign bond yields over German Bund yields had initially widened after the Governing Council’s February monetary policy meeting, but the speed and magnitude of the adjustment had remained contained.",
        "The relative resilience reflected three factors: first, the continued strong ECB monetary stimulus, including from the substantial stock of acquired assets and the ECB’s announced re-investment policies; second, the combination of a long period of low interest rates and the increase in the weighted average maturity of public debt, which reduced the sensitivity of the cost of debt servicing to rising risk-free rates; and third, the easing of pandemic restrictions as well as sound growth expectations, also in view of structural reforms and investments related to the Next Generation EU programme.",
        "The same factors had played a role in the resilience of spreads in response to the latest geopolitical risk shock.",
        "Developments in equity markets signalled that the uncertainty about the direct implications of the invasion was expected to be greater for the euro area than for other major currency areas.",
        "Most of the recent decline in equity prices likely reflected a rise in the equity risk premium, consistent with the flight to safety in bond markets.",
        "Looking at exchange rates, until the start of the war the EUR/USD exchange rate had co-moved very closely with changes in policy rate expectations.",
        "With the onset of the war, the US dollar had appreciated as investors moved into classic safe-haven currencies, despite broadly unchanged relative monetary policy expectations.",
        "Mr Lane went through the latest economic, monetary and financial developments in the global economy and the euro area.",
        "He started by noting that the economic shock from the Russian invasion of Ukraine came in the context of otherwise solid foundations for a strong recovery in the euro area this year.",
        "It was therefore useful to recall the point at which the economy had been before the start of the war.",
        "The global economy was recovering from the pandemic.",
        "The Omicron wave had had a short-lived negative impact, mainly on services.",
        "This was shown by the change in output Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) by industry – particularly for tourism and recreation – from November 2021 to February 2022.",
        "However, with the Omicron wave fading and economies reopening, it was natural to expect a catch-up.",
        "The latest data also suggested that there had been a slight improvement in supply bottlenecks, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom.",
        "Once supply bottlenecks eased, more production could be expected to take place to satisfy demand.",
        "Trade in goods was already above pre-pandemic levels, but there was still ample scope for catching up in tourism during 2022 and this could be a strong engine of growth for European countries.",
        "Looking at developments in commodities and exchange rates, the picture for oil prices was changing by the day, with the oil price on 7 March clearly above the level assumed in the March 2022 ECB staff projection exercise.",
        "Regarding the exchange rate, a distinction needed to be drawn between what was happening in bilateral movements of the euro exchange rate and the evolution of the euro’s effective (trade-weighted) exchange rate.",
        "The heightened uncertainty from the Russian invasion had led investors to move into safe-haven currencies.",
        "The euro had appreciated strongly against the currencies of central and eastern European countries and had depreciated notably against the US dollar.",
        "When weighting the different developments, in nominal effective terms, the fall in the euro had not been very pronounced.",
        "Turning to the euro area, some improvements had been observed in supply bottlenecks, although they remained acute.",
        "However, there was a risk that the Russia-Ukraine war could lead to further bottlenecks.",
        "Reviewing the demand components of GDP, the recovery in private consumption had been very strong until the third quarter of 2021, i.e.",
        "before the Omicron wave.",
        "The strength of the recovery had reflected higher incomes and a running down of savings.",
        "This had led to more robust consumption even though fiscal support had been reduced from the levels at the height of the pandemic.",
        "This positive trend had been reversed in the fourth quarter of 2021, when private consumption fell, largely on account of higher energy and consumer prices, which translated into a decline in real disposable income.",
        "This mechanism was expected to operate also in the first quarter, despite the expectation that a reduction in savings could partly buffer a decline in consumption.",
        "The energy price shock had been negatively affecting private consumption, as people had experienced an increase in their cost of living and a reduction in purchasing power.",
        "Investment had recovered in the fourth quarter of 2021.",
        "This was largely due to a sharp rebound in the automotive industry, which had been a drag on investment in the previous quarters.",
        "Housing investment continued to be affected by large demand but also supply bottlenecks in production.",
        "Demand for houses or house renovation remained elevated, even though the most recent data showed a slight dip in expectations.",
        "On the production side, although recent surveys indicated some easing in the shortages of materials, equipment and labour, these were still close to their historical peaks.",
        "To appreciate the impact of the energy price shock on real income, it was useful to look at the deterioration in the trade balance and in the terms of trade.",
        "The euro area goods trade balance had progressively worsened, resulting in a deficit at the end of 2021.",
        "The deterioration had been largely driven by an increasing deficit in the energy balance.",
        "A similar deterioration was visible in the terms of trade.",
        "In the final quarter of 2021, the contribution of energy to the deterioration in the terms of trade had been 4 percentage points of GDP.",
        "When accounting for gains from companies charging higher export prices to their global customers, the net loss of income vis-à-vis the previous year due to the energy price shock had amounted to 2 percentage points at the end of 2021.",
        "With regard to labour market developments, the evidence continued to point to a recovery story, with the PMI employment index remaining in expansionary territory (above 50) in all sectors in February.",
        "The unemployment rate had continued to fall and was 6.8% in January.",
        "The job vacancy rate showed that more and more sectors were recording a greater number of vacancies.",
        "The euro area vacancy rate had not reached the level seen in the United States, but it was consistent with strengthening labour demand.",
        "Turning to the March 2022 ECB staff projection exercise, Mr Lane noted that the variables used in the technical assumptions had already changed significantly since the 28 February projection cut-off date, which had already been moved back from 24 February on account of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",
        "The projection exercise foresaw real GDP growing by 3.7% in 2022.",
        "This represented a downward revision of 0.5 percentage points for 2022, which was mainly due to the impact of the Ukraine crisis on energy prices, confidence and trade.",
        "GDP growth in 2023 and 2024 was broadly unrevised from the December 2021 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "On the nominal side, following a series of unprecedented energy price shocks, headline inflation was now expected to average 5.1% and core inflation 2.6% in 2022.",
        "Headline inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) was expected to remain slightly above 2.0% in 2023 and to fall to 1.9% in 2024.",
        "Since the December 2021 projections, headline inflation had been revised up by 1.9 percentage points and core inflation by 0.7 percentage points for 2022.",
        "As regards the saving ratio, some decline was foreseen over the projection horizon, with households expected to reduce savings to cushion the energy price shock in the short term and to boost their consumption spending later in the horizon as the economy reopened.",
        "Owing to the high uncertainty surrounding the consequences of the military conflict for the euro area, the ECB staff had prepared two scenarios: an “adverse” scenario and a “severe” scenario.",
        "Both scenarios entailed a permanent loss of income, with the level of GDP projected to be significantly lower than in the baseline.",
        "The adverse scenario assumed additional sanctions against Russia, with euro area energy market disruptions as well as rising uncertainty and financial repercussions.",
        "On top of these features, the severe scenario included a higher price sensitivity of energy markets to supply cuts, additional financial tightening and stronger second-round effects from higher wages on inflation.",
        "In both scenarios inflation would be significantly higher in the short term, but it would fall back to slightly below target in 2024.",
        "Moving to a model-based analysis of risks to the inflation outlook, two alternative approaches were used in the assessment.",
        "The first approach relied on model simulations, which estimated the probability that annual HICP inflation would be higher than 2% in 2024.",
        "This indicated that risks were broadly balanced, with most model simulations showing that the probability of inflation being above target in 2024 was less than 50%.",
        "The second approach was that of calculating the forecast probability for HICP inflation one year and three years ahead, based on financial and monetary indicators.",
        "With this approach, too, the forecast probability of inflation being above 2% in 2024 was less than 50%.",
        "Overall, the two approaches suggested that there were risks in both directions, but the risks looked broadly balanced.",
        "These analyses therefore confirmed the view that end-point inflation in 2024 would be around the 2% target.",
        "Similarly, according to the March Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA), the median of the distribution of longer-term inflation expectations remained around 2%, meaning there was no significant difference from the February round.",
        "Given the relative stability of the inflation expectations component, it could also be argued that movements in the real rate were being driven by developments in the risk premium.",
        "As regards the balance of risks, SMA respondents saw risks to inflation in 2024 to be balanced around the inflation target.",
        "This fairly even distribution between levels above and below 2% implied that there were both upside and downside risks to inflation.",
        "Turning to the latest inflation developments, HICP headline inflation had been increasing strongly since summer 2021, reaching 5.8% in February 2022.",
        "The most important contribution to the rise in inflation was from energy, which in February accounted for 3.1 percentage points of the 5.8% inflation rate increase, as energy prices rose by 31.7%.",
        "Among the energy components, not only fuel but also gas and electricity had contributed significantly to the increase in energy inflation.",
        "The prices of other HICP components, such as food, goods and services, had also been rising.",
        "Since energy was an input in every sector, whenever there was a very large and persistent energy price shock the pass-through to other components would become stronger.",
        "Indicators of underlying inflation, which traditionally sought to identify the persistent elements of inflation, had been increasing.",
        "Taken at face value, they signalled that headline and core inflation would be higher in the future.",
        "However, while these indicators captured medium-term inflation developments well in normal times, they were currently affected by two shocks: the pandemic shock and the massive energy price shock.",
        "This called for careful analysis of what was behind inflation dynamics in the present environment and behind the developments in the different components of core inflation, i.e.",
        "inflation excluding food and energy.",
        "Starting with goods inflation (non-energy industrial goods), in recent times about 1 percentage point of goods inflation could be attributed to a combination of supply bottlenecks – as captured by PMI supply delivery times – and oil prices.",
        "Historically, goods inflation had been hovering around 0.5%.",
        "Then, more recently, it had risen to around 1.5%, before increasing further to above 2% in the latest data.",
        "However, 1 percentage point of the increase was estimated to be due to factors that were not persistent, namely supply bottlenecks and the energy price shock.",
        "Mr Lane went on to explain that the March HICP staff projection was built around the assumption that the energy price shock was a level effect and would not last.",
        "The same assumption applied to the bottlenecks, which also generated a level effect that would nonetheless not be a permanent source of inflation.",
        "Therefore, for goods inflation, there were temporary reasons why inflation was high.",
        "Once these shocks vanished, inflation was expected to fall.",
        "The second component of core inflation, services inflation, included similar temporary elements.",
        "One key temporary element was the reopening of the economy, which also needed to be interpreted as a level rather than permanent effect on inflation.",
        "When looking at the whole projection horizon and cumulating the impact of the energy price shock on core inflation from the last quarter of 2021, ECB staff analysis showed that around 3 percentage points of the cumulative increase in core inflation had been driven by the indirect effects of energy.",
        "In the short term (until early 2023), the indirect impact was estimated to account for the bulk of the increase in core inflation.",
        "But over time, with the disappearance of slack and the levelling-off of the energy effect, core inflation would return to being mostly determined by the traditional factors and a Phillips curve-type effect would start kicking in.",
        "In short, these analyses showed the very large effect that energy prices, supply bottlenecks and the reopening were having on core inflation.",
        "Turning to wages, the March staff projection was built on the observation that, so far, there had been no signs of strong wage pressures, which was in line with the assessment that the labour market was not very tight.",
        "The projection suggested a gradual pick-up in wages in 2022, on the basis of the evidence collected on new wage settlements.",
        "Since collective bargaining agreements frequently covered one to two years, examining agreements that had already been concluded was informative about increases in negotiated wages in the coming months.",
        "For the euro area as a whole, growth in compensation per employee in 2023 was projected to be 3.4%, with the impact of the minimum wage increase in Germany estimated to be around 0.5 percentage points.",
        "With regard to fiscal policies, the March ECB staff projections showed continued improvement in the euro area fiscal outlook.",
        "The expected path of fiscal correction was gradual and largely due to the improved cyclical component.",
        "Overall, the euro area fiscal deficit was projected to still remain higher than in the pre-pandemic period.",
        "The debt-to-GDP ratio was also expected to improve – by about 10 percentage points between 2020 and 2024 – largely thanks to the strong projected path of growth, which was foreseen to return to its pre-pandemic trajectory.",
        "While fiscal balances were expected to improve, interest payments had been revised upwards since the December projections.",
        "However, it was important to remember with regard to interest payments that a lot of expiring ten-year bonds were still paying rates of interest that were higher than current rates.",
        "Looking at the measures that governments had implemented or announced to cushion the impact of the energy price shock, for the euro area aggregate the baseline incorporated an associated impact of about 0.2% of GDP in 2022.",
        "Additional measures – not yet included in the baseline – had recently been approved in several countries.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane stressed that the Russian invasion of Ukraine would have a material impact on economic activity and inflation through higher energy and commodity prices, the disruption of international commerce and weaker confidence.",
        "The prospects for the economy would depend on how the conflict evolved, on the impact of economic and financial sanctions and on possible further measures.",
        "In any event, the degree of uncertainty would remain extraordinarily high.",
        "At the same time, the underlying conditions in the euro area remained solid, helped by ample policy support.",
        "The labour market continued to improve, with unemployment falling to 6.8% in January.",
        "Previous headwinds to growth were gradually waning.",
        "Measures to contain the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant had had a milder impact than during previous waves and were being lifted, and supply bottlenecks showed some signs of easing.",
        "The impact of the massive energy price shock on people and businesses might be partly cushioned by drawing on savings accumulated during the pandemic and by compensatory fiscal measures.",
        "Barring a materialisation of worse scenarios, in the baseline scenario it was expected that the economy would rebound in the course of 2022.",
        "The March staff projections for output had been revised downwards for the near term owing to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
        "But the baseline projections still foresaw that the economy would grow at a robust pace over the remainder of 2022.",
        "Later in the projection horizon, energy prices were expected to moderate and the foreseen normalisation of the saving ratio, alongside the strong conditions in the labour market, should support household consumption.",
        "Output was expected to rise by 3.7% in 2022, 2.8% in 2023 and 1.6% in 2024.",
        "The risks to the economic outlook had increased substantially with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and were tilted to the downside.",
        "While risks relating to the pandemic had declined, the war might weaken economic sentiment and could generate new supply-side constraints.",
        "Persistently high energy costs, together with a loss of confidence, could drag down demand more than expected and constrain consumption and investment.",
        "Alternative scenarios for the economic and financial impact of the war, which would be published together with the projections, foresaw that economic activity could be dampened significantly by a steeper rise in energy and commodity prices and a more severe drag on trade and sentiment.",
        "Inflation had increased sharply in recent months.",
        "HICP inflation had surprised to the upside in February, rising to 5.8% from 5.1% in January.",
        "Energy prices, which had increased by 31.7% in February, continued to be the dominant force behind the rise in inflation.",
        "Food prices had also increased on account of seasonal factors, elevated transportation costs and the higher price of fertilisers.",
        "Price pressures had become more widespread, with the prices of many goods and services having increased markedly as energy prices percolated across cost structures in many sectors, and bottlenecks were sustaining pipeline pressures.",
        "Inflation was expected to increase further in the near term as a consequence of the risk related to energy costs.",
        "There would also be further pressure on some food and commodity prices owing to the war in Ukraine.",
        "Most measures of underlying inflation had risen over recent months, but the persistence of the rise in these indicators remained uncertain owing to the indirect effects of higher energy prices and the role of temporary pandemic factors.",
        "Even though labour shortages were affecting more and more sectors, wage growth remained muted overall.",
        "The March staff projections foresaw HICP inflation at 5.1% in 2022, 2.1% in 2023 and 1.9% in 2024.",
        "The substantial upward revision to inflation in 2022 reflected mainly the effect of the upward surprises in January and February and the impact of the war on the path of energy and commodity prices.",
        "HICP inflation excluding food and energy was projected to follow a similar profile, reaching 2.6% this year before declining to 1.8% in 2023 and 1.9% in 2024.",
        "Projected wage growth in 2022 was higher, partly as a result of some catching-up in wages and the indirect impact of minimum wage increases further up the wage scale.",
        "Looking ahead, a further improvement in labour market conditions and the return of the economy to full capacity should support faster growth in wages over the projection horizon.",
        "Longer-term inflation expectations across a range of measures were re-anchoring at the 2% inflation target.",
        "Taken together, the improvement in the labour market and the re-anchoring of inflation expectations made it increasingly likely that inflation would stabilise around the 2% target over the medium term.",
        "The war in Ukraine constituted a substantial upside risk to energy prices.",
        "If price pressures fed through into higher than anticipated wage rises, inflation could also turn out to be higher over the medium term.",
        "However, if economic growth were to weaken over the medium term, this could lead to lower pressure on prices.",
        "In the alternative scenarios for the economic and financial impact of the war, inflation could be considerably higher in the near term.",
        "However, inflation was still expected to fade progressively and settle at levels around the 2% inflation target in 2024.",
        "The Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused substantial volatility in financial markets.",
        "Following the outbreak of the war, risk-free market interest rates had partially reversed the increase observed since the February meeting.",
        "Sovereign yields had also partly retraced the significant increases that had accompanied the steepening of the risk-free curve in early February.",
        "Euro area equities had recorded hefty declines, especially in the banking sector.",
        "The euro had depreciated against the US dollar, as investors were evaluating the consequences of the war for the euro area economy.",
        "The spillovers from the financial market turmoil to unsecured and secured money market rates had been contained so far, while bank lending rates on loans to firms, despite some upward correction, remained favourable overall.",
        "More than ever there was a need to maintain optionality in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "In the current conditions, it was especially important for monetary policy to remain data-dependent and for optionality to be two-sided.",
        "On the one hand, policy should not be restricted in its timely response to the risk of excess inflation, should the observed price pressures extend into the medium term.",
        "On the other, the possibility to take all the measures necessary if the current crisis continued to escalate should not be ruled out, as further escalation might stifle the economic rebound in the euro area and jeopardise the stability of the financial system.",
        "The new inflation landscape and the skew of risks around the inflation baseline suggested that the mission of the net asset purchases – to “reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates” – could be considered as coming close to being accomplished.",
        "This argued for scaling back the profile of purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) relative to the path decided on in December.",
        "At the same time, the war had generated uncertainty about the euro area economic outlook.",
        "There was a need to ensure smooth liquidity conditions and take whatever action was needed to safeguard financial stability and to fulfil the mandate to pursue price stability.",
        "With these considerations in mind, Mr Lane proposed announcing a path for net purchases of €40 billion in April, €30 billion in May and €20 billion in June.",
        "The calibration of net purchases for the third quarter would be data-dependent and reflect the evolving assessment of the outlook.",
        "If incoming data supported the expectation that the medium-term inflation outlook could be maintained even after the end of the net asset purchases, then net purchases would be ended in the third quarter of 2022.",
        "However, if the outlook deteriorated, or if financing conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards the 2% target, the Governing Council would stand ready to revise the schedule for net asset purchases in terms of size and/or duration.",
        "Finally, Mr Lane proposed three adjustments to the rate forward guidance.",
        "First, in the current conditions, the “easing bias” – the expectation that, looking ahead and until the three conditions were judged to have been met, policy rates would be kept at their present “or lower” levels – was no longer necessary.",
        "In particular, if further easing were warranted in response to a significant deterioration in the outlook, asset purchases could be the appropriate tool to adjust.",
        "Second, there was a need to signal that any adjustments to the key ECB interest rates would take place ”some time after the end of the Governing Council’s net purchases under the APP”.",
        "As the indicated time limit for net asset purchases would be tentative and data-dependent, the calendar for any rate hikes should be disentangled from the end date for net purchases.",
        "This would give the Governing Council some extra space to test conditions after ending purchases of bonds and before taking the next step towards normalisation.",
        "Therefore, communication about the sequencing of and spacing between policy actions should be factored directly into the rate forward guidance in a way that reiterated the sequencing of the policy instruments.",
        "The reference to “some time” conveyed the notion that the time interval between the end of net asset purchases and lift-off was not predetermined.",
        "This was especially important in an uncertain environment.",
        "Rather, it would depend on the timeline for the fulfilment of the rate forward guidance criteria and the appropriate incorporation of prevailing economic, financial and market conditions into the interest rate decisions.",
        "All in all, this new formulation clearly enhanced flexibility and optionality.",
        "It would help manage – in a more agile manner – the specific steps towards implementing the sequence of normalisation decisions, allowing such steps to be better attuned to incoming data.",
        "The proposed third innovation concerning the rate forward guidance consisted of two elements.",
        "The Governing Council should reconfirm that the path for the policy rates would continue to be determined by the forward guidance and by the strategic commitment to stabilise inflation at 2% over the medium term.",
        "Additionally, it should signal that any adjustments to the interest rates would be “gradual”, which was especially important in times of uncertainty.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks to the outlook provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The economy had grown by 5.3% in 2021, with GDP returning to its pre-pandemic level at the end of the year.",
        "However, growth had slowed to 0.3% in the final quarter of 2021 and was expected to remain weak during the first quarter of 2022.",
        "The prospects for the economy would depend on the course of the Russia-Ukraine war and the impact of economic and financial sanctions, as well as possible retaliatory measures.",
        "The Russia-Ukraine war would have a material impact on economic activity and inflation through higher energy and commodity prices, the disruption of international commerce and weaker confidence.",
        "The extent of these effects would depend on how the conflict evolved, on the impact of current sanctions and on possible further measures.",
        "At the same time, the impact of the war had to be assessed in the context of solid underlying conditions for the euro area economy, with the waning of a number of headwinds to growth.",
        "Measures to contain the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant had had a milder impact than during previous coronavirus waves and were now being lifted.",
        "The supply disruptions caused by the pandemic also showed some signs of easing.",
        "Furthermore, the impact of the massive energy price shock on people and businesses might be partly cushioned by drawing on savings accumulated during the pandemic and by compensatory fiscal measures.",
        "Members welcomed the fact that, in recognition of the highly uncertain environment, the March staff projections considered alternative scenarios.",
        "In these alternative scenarios for the economic and financial impact of the Russia-Ukraine war, economic activity was seen to be dampened significantly by a steeper rise in energy and commodity prices and a more severe drag on trade and sentiment.",
        "Inflation would be considerably higher in the near term.",
        "However, inflation was still expected to decrease progressively and settle at levels around the 2% inflation target in 2024.",
        "In their discussion, members highlighted the exceptional uncertainty that the war in Ukraine and its ramifications implied for the economic outlook.",
        "This held not only for the short term but also for the medium term.",
        "It was suggested that, in these conditions, the ECB was grappling with “Knightian uncertainty”, i.e.",
        "a type of uncertainty that was not quantifiable.",
        "Fears and concerns associated with the war could not easily be captured by standard models.",
        "There was broad agreement on the direction of the initial effects of the war on the euro area economy, namely upwards on inflation and downwards on economic growth, which was best characterised as yet another negative supply shock.",
        "This could have inflationary or disinflationary impacts in the longer term.",
        "The most prominent and imminent economic risk emerging from the war was that the prices of energy and raw materials would continue to increase.",
        "With the prices of energy and food likely to see further upward pressure and the prominence of these items in consumption baskets, there was a risk of strong impacts on household inflation perceptions and expectations.",
        "The reaction of household savings was considered a key element in the macroeconomic transmission of the war shock.",
        "On the one hand, savings could be expected to rise.",
        "The drop in asset prices and the rise in uncertainty since the start of the war might lead to more precautionary behaviour and portfolio adjustments by households and businesses.",
        "The situation was seen as probably more comparable to the financial crisis than to the pandemic crisis, in which restrictions had led to forced savings.",
        "If combined with a complete cut-off of Russian oil and gas supplies to the euro area, heightened uncertainty and risk aversion could lead to a much more pessimistic assessment of the economic outlook than the one presented in the staff baseline projections and the scenarios.",
        "On the other hand, it was argued that households were faced with higher energy bills, which left little room to build up savings.",
        "Uncertainty effects could be even stronger for the countries bordering Russia.",
        "Finally, it was underlined that the high stock of savings accumulated by households during the pandemic might provide a partial cushion against the rise in energy prices.",
        "As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane that the Omicron variant had slowed global growth momentum at the turn of the year, especially in services, but that its impact had been diminishing.",
        "Moreover, global supply bottlenecks had seemingly passed their peak, although delivery times remained very long.",
        "The Russia-Ukraine war had led to a downward revision to euro area foreign demand, which was mostly visible in 2023 since, for 2022, the effect was dampened by positive carry-over effects from 2021.",
        "Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine commodity prices had surged, the euro had depreciated – particularly against the US dollar – and prices for risky assets had dropped.",
        "Regarding the characteristics of this new shock to the euro area economy, it was mentioned that it would have large economic, military and political implications for Europe, which would unfold gradually over time.",
        "It was mentioned that, in addition to oil and gas, Russia and Ukraine were also major exporters of several other important commodities (wheat, fertilisers and rare metals).",
        "This was likely to lead to more severe worldwide bottlenecks for a number of products.",
        "Finally, it was recalled that the recent weakening of the euro was amplifying the adverse terms-of-trade shock that the euro area was currently experiencing owing to the surge in commodity prices.",
        "Members broadly agreed with Mr Lane that the Russia-Ukraine war had started in the context of otherwise solid foundations for a strong recovery in the euro area this year.",
        "With governments now ending most pandemic-related restrictions, the euro area economy had been set for a strong recovery before the escalation of the conflict.",
        "Hence, the euro area economy was entering this new crisis with better fundamentals than in March 2020.",
        "Even the severe scenario presented by staff was less damaging to growth than the comparable scenario that the Governing Council had considered two years ago in response to the emergence of the coronavirus.",
        "In this context, it was also recalled that at the global level, the Russia-Ukraine war, together with the economic and financial sanctions, could not be compared with the shutdown of the global economy in March 2020.",
        "Comfort was widely drawn from the continuously improving labour market conditions, with unemployment falling to 6.8% in January.",
        "With more or less all labour market indicators at historically high levels, household income should continue to grow.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that a pessimistic assessment of the economic consequences of the Russia-Ukraine war would imply that the very strong labour market might have become a thing of the past.",
        "An economic contraction owing to the Russia-Ukraine war could lead to a weaker labour market, as observed in the 1980s.",
        "The resulting fall in incomes could lead to further economic weakness, including downward pressure on inflation.",
        "Regarding the fiscal policy response to the Russia-Ukraine war, members agreed that further measures were likely and desirable at the national and European levels.",
        "At present, however, there was still a lot of uncertainty about such initiatives.",
        "While it was clear that economic activity would suffer in the short term, over the next few years consumption and investment might receive a boost through three types of fiscal spending.",
        "First, there would be additional investments in the energy sector to reduce the dependency on Russian gas and oil, including investment in the green energy transition.",
        "Second, there would be increased defence spending in Europe.",
        "Third, there would be more public spending to support Ukraine and the refugees.",
        "Overall, such increased government spending would tend to increase pressures on resources and prices.",
        "All in all, members assessed the risks to the economic outlook as having increased substantially with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and as being tilted to the downside.",
        "While risks relating to the pandemic had declined, the war in Ukraine might have a stronger effect on economic sentiment and could worsen supply-side constraints again.",
        "Persistently high energy costs, together with a loss of confidence, could drag down demand more than expected and constrain consumption and investment.",
        "Against this background, it was argued that the war constituted a stagflationary shock, which entailed weaker activity and higher inflation in the near term.",
        "However, given the extremely strong starting point and the anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations, it was difficult to see how this shock could push the euro area economy into stagflation.",
        "In this context, the fiscal response would also be very important to achieve a favourable outcome.",
        "At the same time, weaker activity in the second and third quarters of this year could nonetheless result in a technical recession in terms of quarter-on-quarter growth rates.",
        "Finally, even if the impact of the war was clearly inflationary in the short run, given the significant increase in uncertainty and the rise in financial stability risks, it could become either inflationary or disinflationary in the longer run.",
        "With regard to price developments, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Inflation had continued to surprise strongly to the upside in February, when it had increased to 5.8%, even before the effects of the war had become visible.",
        "Moreover, it was expected to rise further in the near term.",
        "Energy prices continued to be the main reason for this high rate of inflation and were also pushing up prices across many other sectors.",
        "Food prices had also increased, and there would be further pressure on some food and commodity prices owing to the war in Ukraine.",
        "Finally, price rises had become more widespread and most measures of underlying inflation had risen to levels well above 2%.",
        "However, there were different views on how persistent these rises would be, given the role of temporary pandemic-related factors and the indirect effects of higher energy prices.",
        "Market-based indicators suggested that energy prices would stay high for longer than previously expected but would moderate over the course of the projection horizon.",
        "Price pressures stemming from global supply bottlenecks should eventually subside.",
        "Wage growth had remained muted overall, but, over time, the return of the economy to full capacity should support faster growth in wages.",
        "Various measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets and from surveys stood at around 2%.",
        "These factors would help headline inflation to settle durably at the 2% target.",
        "In their discussion of the March 2022 staff projections, members noted the substantial upward revision to the short-term inflation outlook since the December 2021 projections.",
        "February’s inflation data release was the latest in a string of consecutive upside surprises.",
        "This had led to the largest revisions to inflation projections in many years, both in December and again in March.",
        "The high levels of inflation had thus turned out to be less transitory than previously expected, while the latest ECB staff projections nonetheless still foresaw a rapid decline in inflation, nearly to target, over the projection horizon.",
        "Sizeable and persistent projection errors for core inflation were also seen as a reminder that the models were underestimating the impact of the recovery and the pass-through of input prices to final consumer prices.",
        "In particular, doubts were expressed about the convergence of inflation to 1.9% as expected in the baseline staff projection for 2024, the last year of the projection horizon.",
        "The question was raised as to how one could expect such a fast mean reversion in inflation, faster than in the previous projection round, after the current huge shocks to inflation.",
        "It appeared puzzling that inflation projections would still fall somewhat short of the 2% target in 2024 despite consecutive upside surprises in inflation outcomes, a persistently positive output gap for most of the projection horizon and the latest increases in longer-term inflation expectations.",
        "In this context, it was acknowledged that models estimated on historical data naturally had their limits in the face of unusual shocks and possible turning points or regime shifts.",
        "It was again stressed that the medium-term projection for headline inflation was based on the assumption of a declining path of energy futures prices.",
        "Such a path was seen as open to challenge in the light of various factors in energy markets pointing to more lasting upward pressures.",
        "These included the sanctions on Russia, Europe’s plan to reduce Russian gas imports and climate change initiatives.",
        "Sensitivity analyses using alternative technical assumptions for energy commodity prices could imply inflation projections of well above 2% for 2023 and 2024.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that all mechanical assumptions for oil prices had their caveats and that for interpreting the projections it was more important to understand whether oil prices were driven by demand or supply shocks.",
        "With respect to the medium-term outlook, it was considered that the projection for food price inflation might be on the low side towards the end of the horizon and the question was raised whether it could be higher for longer.",
        "Reference was also made to the likely upward impact on medium-term inflation projections of developments in the costs of owner-occupied housing, which were not yet part of the official HICP index.",
        "In view of these different considerations, it was argued that there should be no pretence of knowing what the exact number for inflation would be in 2024, while more attention could be given to uncertainty and risk distributions around point estimates for inflation.",
        "Members highlighted that core inflation and various other measures of underlying inflation had also moved well above 2%.",
        "This included a strong upward movement in those prices that were changed less frequently, which were a good indicator of medium-term inflation developments.",
        "This was seen to argue against attributing inflation only to the energy component and supported the assessment that inflation was becoming more broad-based and more persistent.",
        "With such a trend becoming more entrenched, it was increasingly doubtful whether measures of underlying inflation could be expected to decline again significantly in the short term.",
        "Over the medium term, long and variable lags in the pass-through of producer prices meant that considerable upside pressure was still in the pipeline.",
        "By contrast, in the staff projections recent increases in core inflation were foreseen to partly reverse over the projection horizon.",
        "However, it was stressed that core inflation was currently being driven by external factors, including energy prices and bottlenecks, rather than domestic factors such as wages.",
        "Moreover, these factors were argued to constitute price level effects that would fade from inflation rates over time.",
        "Reference was also made to an analysis of the historical pattern of producer price inflation in the energy sector, which showed that energy inflation had typically been oscillating between positive and negative rates of change.",
        "Notwithstanding the recent upward spike, it should thus not be ruled out that energy inflation might again turn negative at some point in the future.",
        "It was recalled that one-off energy price rises would not result in lastingly higher inflation, which ultimately required higher inflation expectations and higher wage growth to become self-sustaining.",
        "In this context, it was noted that growth in negotiated wages at the end of 2021 was lower than the average for 2020 and did not point to evident wage pressures.",
        "It was also noted that growth in unit labour costs, which combined wage growth with productivity developments, was expected to increase over the projection horizon but to stay below 2%.",
        "A comparison of wage growth with inflation suggested a cumulative decline in real wages over the projection horizon.",
        "The question was raised whether this implied that the terms-of-trade shock associated with energy price increases was being absorbed by workers alone, and how likely that would be in a situation of tight labour markets.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that lower real wages did not necessarily imply a lower labour share in income if there was also positive employment growth.",
        "In any case, inflation, which was stubbornly high and higher than expected, was widely seen as increasing the likelihood that there would be second-round effects, which in turn would make higher inflation more persistent.",
        "It was argued that, if second-round effects in wages were to emerge, these could last longer than a year, as wage contracts tended to be concluded for longer periods.",
        "Concerns were expressed that second-round effects might well be of a non-linear nature, taking some time to emerge but then becoming very strong and difficult to stop.",
        "Labour market dynamics and indications of increasing labour market tightness were seen to point clearly to rising wage pressures in the period ahead.",
        "It was argued that in the past the impact of energy price increases had been short-lived and had therefore been more naturally absorbed by wages or profit margins.",
        "This time the situation appeared to be different, however, given the large energy shock in conjunction with far-reaching structural changes, post-pandemic pent-up demand and supply shortages.",
        "This called into question the seemingly very muted reaction of wages to inflation in the staff projections.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that in the staff projections second-round effects had been assumed to play out in line with historical regularities.",
        "There was also a risk that the projected effects might turn out to be too strong given that so far wage growth, at least in some countries, had come in lower than previously expected.",
        "Moreover, it was cautioned that the current strength in labour markets could quickly vanish.",
        "Reference was made to the 1980s, when second-round effects had induced “third-round” effects in terms of lower output and weaker labour markets.",
        "It was also possible that unions and firms might again prioritise job security over wage gains in the light of the heightened uncertainty owing to the war.",
        "Moreover, wage-price spirals were unlikely as long as – by contrast with the 1970s and 1980s – the central bank’s commitment to price stability was seen as credible.",
        "Against this background, factors that constituted risks to the economic outlook also affected the risks to the outlook for inflation, which were seen to be on the upside in the near term.",
        "The war in Ukraine was a substantial upside risk, especially to energy prices.",
        "If price pressures fed through into higher than anticipated wage rises or if there were persistent adverse supply-side implications, inflation could also turn out to be higher over the medium term.",
        "However, if demand were to weaken over the medium term, this could also lower pressures on prices.",
        "It was observed that risks to the projections had already materialised, as oil prices had risen further between the cut-off date for the assumptions in the projections and the Governing Council meeting.",
        "In addition, the point was made that the fiscal spending on defence and energy that was likely to take place over the coming years would imply additional inflationary pressures.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, members took note of the assessments by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane of the latest developments in market-based measures of inflation compensation and survey-based indicators.",
        "Most indicators were at around 2%, which was seen as good news.",
        "It was pointed out that some market-based measures were significantly above 2%.",
        "On the one hand, it was suggested that this could be seen as the first sign that long-term inflation expectations were becoming unanchored and needed to be closely monitored, as this could give rise to a wage-price spiral.",
        "On the other hand, it was recalled that these measures included risk premia and that correcting for these would still leave genuinely expected inflation at around 2%.",
        "In this respect, attention was drawn to the correlation between movements in oil prices and market-based measures of inflation compensation.",
        "For instance, a rise in the five-year implied forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead might inter alia reflect that investors were looking for hedges in the face of an oil price-driven inflation surge.",
        "Longer-term inflation expectations at around 2% could be interpreted as reflecting perceptions that the current supply shock was having direct upward effects on inflation in the near term but would have downward effects through disposable income over longer horizons.",
        "At the same time, reference was made to national surveys, which showed that the medium-term inflation expectations of businesses and households had moved to well above 2%.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members widely concurred with the assessments, provided by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane in their introductions, that the Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused substantial volatility in financial markets owing to heightened uncertainty.",
        "Stock markets in the euro area had been affected much more than in the United States, reflecting the fact that the euro area was more exposed than other regions of the world to the fallout from the war.",
        "In this regard, the extent of the fall in equity prices since the invasion of Ukraine, including for banks with minor exposures to the Russian or Ukrainian economies, suggested that the transmission of the economic shock in the euro area economy could be much more adverse than was implied by the – relatively small – direct financial and trade exposures.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that so far financial market tensions appeared significantly less severe than at the start of the pandemic.",
        "There had not been a similar “dash for cash” and liquidity was holding up well in most market segments, even though there had been an interruption of primary market issuance in corporate bond markets for a few days From a financial stability perspective, the main channel of transmission from higher energy and commodity prices related to the macroeconomic impact through inflation and growth.",
        "Following the outbreak of the war, risk-free market rates had partially reversed the increase observed in the wake of the 2-3 February meeting, the euro had depreciated against the US dollar and euro area equity prices had recorded hefty declines, especially for banks.",
        "The financial sanctions against Russia had so far not caused persistent strains in money markets or liquidity shortages in the euro area banking system.",
        "Bank balance sheets remained healthy overall, owing to robust capital positions and a reduction in non-performing loans, in turn reflecting sound household finances and corporate balance sheets.",
        "The growth of lending to firms had declined after increasing strongly in the last quarter of 2021, whereas lending to households was holding up, especially loans for house purchase.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, financing and financial conditions in the euro area were assessed to remain favourable overall, notwithstanding the increase in market interest rates observed since the monetary policy meeting in February.",
        "While nominal euro area government bond yields had increased significantly since the 15-16 December 2021 meeting, this had been driven largely by an increase in market-based inflation compensation.",
        "The significant further fall in real interest rates to record low levels and the depreciation of the euro suggested that the monetary policy stance remained very accommodative.",
        "This raised the question of whether the configuration of monetary policy instruments, including the negative interest rate policy, was still consistent with inflation returning to target over the medium term.",
        "However, it was noted that the recent fall in risk-free interest rates had been driven by deteriorating risk sentiment in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a clouding of the macroeconomic outlook.",
        "Bank lending rates for firms had increased somewhat but remained favourable overall, while the cost of market-based debt had risen more markedly.",
        "Rates on loans to households for house purchase had remained steady at historically low levels.",
        "A large number of members held the view that the current high level of inflation and its persistence called for immediate further steps towards monetary policy normalisation.",
        "Inflation was projected to be far above target in 2022, with unprecedented upward revisions over the latest two projection rounds.",
        "It was projected to remain above target in 2023, with significant upside risks, as also evidenced by the alternative scenarios.",
        "Moreover, it was argued that the baseline inflation projection for 2024 could be assessed to be already effectively on target, when the heightened uncertainty surrounding the outlook and the fragility of the assumptions underlying the projections were taken into account.",
        "In addition, available measures of underlying inflation had moved above 2%, suggesting that the staff projections may be underestimating the persistence of above-target inflation.",
        "On this basis it was argued that, for all practical purposes, the three forward guidance conditions for an upward adjustment of the key ECB interest rates had either already been met or were very close to being met.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that it remained uncertain how persistent the rise in the indicators of underlying inflation would be, given the role of temporary, pandemic-related factors and the indirect effects of higher energy prices.",
        "It was also remarked that, even if the forward guidance criteria could be assessed as being met, uncertainty was high at the current juncture and fulfilment of the criteria was a necessary but not sufficient condition for a first hike in policy rates.",
        "The most appropriate timing of a first upward adjustment of the ECB’s key interest rates should be determined by the Governing Council in the light of all available data and other considerations such as prevailing financial market conditions.",
        "While the Russian invasion of Ukraine had increased uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic outlook, related risks to the inflation outlook were seen as largely one-sided, with experience suggesting that wars tended to be inflationary, often fuelled by increased fiscal spending in conjunction with a loose monetary policy stance.",
        "While the war would likely dent economic growth in the short term, annual growth was projected to remain positive even in the severe scenario, pointing to “slowflation” rather than stagflation.",
        "The greater persistence of inflation increased the probability of second-round effects via strengthening wage dynamics.",
        "While wage growth had remained moderate so far, it usually reacted with a lag and possibly in a non-linear way, with the heightened risk of a wage-price spiral if monetary policy did not act in a timely manner.",
        "Moreover, a longer period of above-target inflation would lead to an increased risk of an upward unanchoring of longer-term inflation expectations.",
        "The latest measures of market-based inflation compensation had moved above 2% along the entire maturity structure for the first time in many years.",
        "In such circumstances, the Governing Council could no longer afford to look through higher inflation, even if it was driven by an adverse supply shock.",
        "The evolution in the inflation landscape since December, as outlined by Mr Lane, thus called for acting with confidence and without undue hesitation.",
        "This was viewed as essential to underline the primacy of the price stability objective but also to provide guidance to markets and thereby avoid adding to uncertainty in a volatile environment.",
        "In particular, it was considered essential to take action at the present meeting on scaling back the scheduled APP purchases over the following quarters to “unlock” optionality for future decisions on policy rates.",
        "The view was taken that APP purchases had by now fulfilled the stated objective of reinforcing the monetary policy accommodation provided by the ECB’s negative interest rates.",
        "Given the development of the inflation outlook since the Governing Council’s December 2021 meeting, and the favourable financing conditions, it was no longer evident that the pace of net purchases previously agreed continued to be proportionate, i.e.",
        "suitable, necessary and with no less onerous alternatives available to achieve the declared objective.",
        "Continuing to provide monetary policy accommodation through net asset purchases to the extent that had been envisaged in December was no longer seen as consistent with the primary objective at a time when inflation was moving further away from the Governing Council’s target.",
        "Maintaining net asset purchases under the APP in spite of impending risks to price stability could call into question the Governing Council’s determination to pursue its primary objective, particularly when inflation risks were skewed to the upside.",
        "The present assessment thus called for a prudent and conditional phasing-out of the use of this non-standard instrument, which would in any case remain available for future use, in a proportionate manner, as part of the ECB’s toolbox.",
        "Taking action at the present meeting was also seen as consistent with the principles of gradualism, prudence and caution.",
        "A delayed response could increase the risk that a more abrupt adjustment in the monetary policy stance would prove necessary further down the road, which could prove more costly for growth and financial stability.",
        "In this respect, it was more important than ever for the Governing Council to follow a data-dependent and step-by-step approach, with emphasis on optionality and flexibility.",
        "The war had reinforced this need for optionality, owing to the increased upside risks for inflation.",
        "In the light of heightened uncertainty, it was nonetheless seen as wise to keep some two-sided optionality and a data-dependent approach, as it was too early to tell how events would unfold in the following months.",
        "Against this background, cautious action at the present meeting was seen as warranted, in particular scaling back the schedule for net asset purchases under the APP while de-linking the date of an initial rate rise from the duration of asset purchases.",
        "This would increase the Governing Council’s optionality and flexibility without implying that lift-off would automatically follow shortly after the end of net purchases.",
        "Among those calling for action at the present meeting, some members preferred to set a firm end date for APP net purchases during the summer and not to make that date conditional on unfolding events.",
        "This could clear the way for a possible rate rise in the third quarter of this year in the light of the deterioration in the inflation outlook.",
        "Preserving optionality on asset purchases was not without cost, especially considering the risk of “falling behind the curve”.",
        "Other members expressed a preference for adopting a wait-and-see approach at the present meeting in view of the exceptionally high uncertainty created by the Russia-Ukraine war.",
        "While the pre-war situation might have called for some removal of monetary policy support to accompany the recovery, in the form of a cautious adjustment in addition to the normalisation decisions taken in December 2021, it did not call for a tightening cycle to be initiated.",
        "In the new environment resulting from the war, bold steps were even less justified and could further dent confidence.",
        "The war implied a considerable change in the macroeconomic picture since the February meeting, and the alternative scenarios suggested that the euro area could fall into technical recession in the summer quarters.",
        "The point was made that, in the absence of the currently high level of inflation, the appropriate monetary policy response would likely have been a loosening of the stance.",
        "While the war and the associated amplified energy supply shock created an acute dilemma for monetary policy, there was value in keeping a steady hand and waiting before deciding on further adjustments to the monetary policy stance.",
        "This would allow a better understanding of the planned fiscal policy response and of the implications of the war for the economic and inflation outlook.",
        "Acting at the present meeting raised the question of whether the Governing Council was focused more on short-term inflation developments than on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In the view of these members, the forward guidance conditions had not yet been met and it was also not obvious whether they would be met soon.",
        "The baseline staff projections and the two alternative scenarios all suggested that inflation would fall below 2% in 2024, as the impact of high energy prices on the level of headline inflation would have faded by then.",
        "It was argued that the war constituted a supply and not a demand shock, and it was thus appropriate for monetary policy to look through this shock rather than overreact to current inflation readings.",
        "It was argued that the Governing Council could afford to be patient, with measures of longer-term inflation expectations standing at around 2% and no sign of second-round effects, as wage growth had remained moderate so far and had lately even been slower than expected in recent projection exercises.",
        "All in all, members agreed that the recalibration of the monetary policy instruments proposed by Mr Lane in his introduction was a balanced compromise and a proportionate course of action in the pursuit of the Governing Council’s price stability mandate.",
        "On the one hand, by taking this course of action, the Governing Council continued a step-by-step normalisation of monetary policy, consistent with its assessment that it was increasingly likely that inflation would stabilise around its 2% target over the medium term.",
        "On the other hand, the proposed recalibration maintained the Governing Council’s flexibility in terms of the schedule for net asset purchases under the APP by emphasising conditionality linked to the medium-term inflation outlook and by increasing optionality with respect to the key policy interest rates by de-linking lift-off from the expected end date of net asset purchases.",
        "On the basis of the Governing Council’s updated assessment and taking into account the uncertain environment, there was agreement to revise the net asset purchases under the APP for the second quarter as proposed by Mr Lane in his introduction, namely for monthly net purchases under the APP to amount to €40 billion in April, €30 billion in May and €20 billion in June.",
        "There was also agreement that the calibration of net purchases for the third quarter would be data-dependent and reflect the Governing Council’s evolving assessment of the outlook.",
        "There was wide support for the conditional expectation that the Governing Council would conclude net asset purchases under the APP in the third quarter if the incoming data supported the expectation that the medium-term inflation outlook would not weaken after the end of net purchases.",
        "This gave the Governing Council the necessary flexibility and optionality, as well as the time needed, to reassess the situation in coming meetings.",
        "Regarding the formulation of the Governing Council’s forward guidance on interest rates, members agreed to remove the “easing bias”, i.e.",
        "the Governing Council had previously expressed an expectation that the key policy rates would remain at their present “or lower” levels until the three forward guidance conditions were judged to have been fulfilled, which was viewed as no longer warranted.",
        "Members also agreed to separate the timing of a rate hike from the end date for net asset purchases, replacing the previous formulation that net asset purchases would end “shortly before” the Governing Council started raising the key policy rates.",
        "While net asset purchases under the APP could be viewed as having fulfilled their purpose of reinforcing the accommodative impact of policy rates, further evidence was needed before it could be concluded that the conditions for a rate hike had been met.",
        "Therefore, there should be no automaticity in decisions on rate hikes, and it was prudent to retain flexibility and optionality in this respect until there was more clarity on the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Against this background, it was judged as neither necessary nor advisable to reach a firm conclusion at the present stage on whether the three forward guidance conditions had already been met.",
        "Members generally supported the proposed formulation that any adjustments to the key ECB interest rates would take place “some time after” the end of net asset purchases under the APP.",
        "While it was viewed as appropriate to convey the notion that the Governing Council intended to gain extra space to assess the conditions for a rate hike after net purchases had ended, it was also stressed that maximum optionality and flexibility needed to be maintained.",
        "In particular, it was important to avoid any misinterpretation of the new formulation as necessarily suggesting a long gap between the end of net purchases and an initial rate rise.",
        "Members broadly agreed that the path for the key ECB interest rates would continue to be determined by the forward guidance in a data-dependent manner and by the strategic commitment to stabilise inflation at 2% over the medium term.",
        "There was broad support for the notion of gradualism, which was regarded as a well-established principle of sound monetary policy and consistent with prudence in an environment of heightened uncertainty.",
        "With respect to a possible resurgence of fragmentation in euro area financial conditions, it was recalled that, in December, the Governing Council had included a general reference to flexibility in its communication, which had since been included in the regular monetary policy press releases.",
        "Regarding communication, members highlighted the need to convey a data-dependent approach to monetary policy normalisation, and that the Governing Council was very attentive to the prevailing uncertainties and stood ready to adjust all of its instruments to ensure that inflation stabilised at the 2% target over the medium term.",
        "It was stressed that, amid the uncertainties created by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Governing Council would ensure smooth liquidity conditions and take whatever action needed to fulfil the ECB’s mandate to pursue price stability and to safeguard financial stability.",
        "Reference was also made in this context to the Governing Council’s decision to extend the Eurosystem repo facility for central banks (EUREP) until 15 January 2023, which would be communicated via the ECB’s monetary policy press release.",
        "Prevailing uncertainties called for the Governing Council to maintain maximum optionality and flexibility with respect to the future course of monetary policy normalisation.",
        "A data-dependent approach was essential for keeping confidence and trust in the ECB’s commitment to deliver on its mandate.",
        "It also had to be acknowledged that the ECB was already doing a lot in terms of gradual monetary policy normalisation, with net asset purchases under the PEPP to be discontinued at the end of March in line with the decision taken in December 2021.",
        "It was also highlighted that fiscal measures, including at the European level, had an important role to play in shielding the economy from the negative impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, the President ascertained that all members accepted the policy package proposed by Mr Lane as set out in the ECB’s monetary policy press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 27-28 October 2021 and put these developments into the context of the broader financial stability landscape, in line with the outcome of the ECB’s strategy review.",
        "In response to the discovery of Omicron, stock markets worldwide had suffered marked losses.",
        "The volume of put options on the EURO STOXX 50 had hit its highest level since the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in March 2020, as investors looked for protection against further losses.",
        "At the same time, the ten-year US Treasury and euro area GDP-weighted sovereign yields had almost fallen back to the lows seen over the summer.",
        "They stood well below the levels observed at the Governing Council’s October meeting.",
        "These financial market developments could be interpreted in two ways.",
        "The first was that the market expected Omicron to have a materially larger impact on economic activity than previous mutations.",
        "However, model-based evidence showing a shock-decomposition of the recent decline in ten-year euro area OIS yields assigned only a fraction of the decline in yields to a deterioration in the economic outlook.",
        "Similarly, less than a third of the recent marked decline in oil prices was likely to reflect a reappraisal of the global growth outlook.",
        "The second interpretation of recent financial market developments related to the fragile market conditions that prevailed when the news about Omicron broke.",
        "Since mid-October 2021, volatility in bond markets had been rising sharply and liquidity conditions in derivative markets had deteriorated measurably, amplifying the market reaction to the news of Omicron.",
        "Two factors had contributed to this fragile market environment.",
        "One was the growing conviction among investors that the period of low inflation was over and that globally monetary policy would have to be tightened sooner than had been anticipated earlier in 2021.",
        "The second was the sensitivity of financial markets to such changes in the policy outlook after years of significant monetary policy accommodation.",
        "In the United States, markets now assessed the chance of a rate hike at the Federal Reserve’s meeting in May 2022 as well over one in two.",
        "A one-in-three chance of a rise was seen as early as March 2022.",
        "In the euro area, by contrast, expectations of “lift-off” – a first rate hike – had been pushed back compared with the Governing Council’s previous meeting on 27-28 October 2021.",
        "Nevertheless, lift-off expectations remained far closer than they had been at the Governing Council meeting on 8-9 September 2021, and they had also become less volatile.",
        "Moreover, the gap that had opened in the autumn between the lift-off expectations priced in by markets and those indicated by the participants in the Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) was closing.",
        "In the SMA, the median expectation for lift-off had been brought forward by another two quarters, from the second quarter of 2024 to the fourth quarter of 2023 – only three quarters later than priced in by markets compared with six quarters in October 2021.",
        "The divergence in expected policy cycles had continued to put significant downward pressure on the euro-US dollar exchange rate.",
        "The euro had depreciated by nearly another 3% against the US dollar since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting and was currently down by 8% from its peak in late May 2021.",
        "The ECB’s forward guidance remained a key factor behind the divergence in expected policy cycles.",
        "Although the relationship between expected inflation and expected policy rates had strengthened somewhat since the Governing Council meeting on 8-9 September 2021, it remained significantly weaker than before the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "Also, looking at the relationship between expected policy rates and inflation surprises across advanced economies, the euro area stood out as a clear exception, with significant cumulative upside surprises to inflation having a limited impact on policy rate expectations.",
        "Nevertheless, uncertainty around the future path of policy rates had increased, also in the euro area, which had contributed to the rise in market volatility.",
        "The risk distribution around the three-month EURIBOR had narrowed somewhat compared with the Governing Council’s previous meeting on 27-28 October 2021.",
        "However, it remained significantly larger than in July and clearly skewed to the upside.",
        "This risk distribution suggested investors were concerned that the high uncertainty about the inflation outlook could mean the conditions of the ECB’s forward guidance might be met earlier than currently expected.",
        "This view was corroborated when looking at inflation swap rates.",
        "Although these had come down from their multi-year highs in recent weeks, the current euro area forward inflation swap curve remained close to the 2% target.",
        "It stood well above the level that had been expected before the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "Option markets, too, continued to price in a significant probability of inflation exceeding the ECB’s target.",
        "They suggested around a 10% probability that inflation over the next five years would, on average, be above 3%, and about a 40% probability that inflation would be above 2%.",
        "To understand how sensitive the market was to a shock like Omicron, it was important to look at the risk exposure that investors had previously built up in expectation that short-term rates and volatility would stay low for a long time.",
        "In equity markets, global equity funds had taken in more funds in 2021 than in the previous two decades combined, which had contributed to pushing equity valuation metrics to the tails of, or beyond, the 75th percentile of the historical distribution, in particular in the United States but also in the euro area.",
        "Vulnerabilities had risen substantially in the non-bank sector.",
        "For example, the liquidity, credit and duration risk of euro area investment funds had all increased notably since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "Similarly, in euro area sovereign and corporate bond markets, credit risk premia had been severely compressed over the past months despite much higher leverage.",
        "Prospects of higher risk-free rates had led to a decompression, albeit to varying degrees, with spreads generally remaining well below the levels observed before the pandemic.",
        "Moreover, with volatility elevated and safe assets in high demand, bond yields had actually fallen in almost all euro area Member States since the Governing Council’s October meeting and had otherwise remained close to their October levels.",
        "Spreads had only increased due to a strong decline in German Bund yields, which themselves had fallen much more sharply than the OIS rate.",
        "The spread of the ten-year Bund yield over the equivalent OIS rate had declined below the extraordinary levels seen at the height of the pandemic in March 2020.",
        "These developments highlighted the exceptional demand for safe assets as uncertainty about the policy outlook had increased.",
        "On the supply side, the available “free float” of bonds in the euro area had declined to very low levels.",
        "As a result, there had been a gradual and persistent deterioration in bond market liquidity across most euro area jurisdictions.",
        "Recently the Governing Council had decided to double the aggregate limit on the cash that counterparties could pledge under the Eurosystem securities lending programme.",
        "This had supported liquidity in the repo markets at a time when the demand for collateral had been rising and supply had been limited.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and the recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data had signalled some slowing down of the world economy in the third quarter of 2021, owing to COVID-19-related restrictions and supply chain disruptions.",
        "The latest PMI data signalled a renewed improvement for the fourth quarter – especially in services but less so for manufacturing.",
        "Supply bottlenecks continued to restrain global activity and trade.",
        "Since the October monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council oil prices had decreased sharply (-12%), reflecting demand and supply effects.",
        "The euro exchange rate had declined only modestly in nominal effective terms (-0.4%), but had fallen visibly against the US dollar (-3%).",
        "Gas prices had increased amid heightened volatility, while metal prices had continued their downward trend.",
        "Turning to developments in activity in the euro area, during the lockdown in the first quarter of 2021 there had still been a substantial gap between GDP and its pre-crisis level.",
        "However, much of this gap – though not all – had been closed by the third quarter of 2021.",
        "A lot of the recovery during 2021 had been driven by private consumption, linked to the recovery in household spending on services that had followed the earlier recovery in manufacturing.",
        "The nature of supply constraints had been shifting over time and these continued to weigh on activity.",
        "Manufacturing firms had been suffering from shortages of materials and equipment.",
        "According to the Industry Survey of the European Commission, these shortages had worsened in the fourth quarter of 2021.",
        "The lack of skilled labour had become a concern in parts of both the manufacturing and the services sectors.",
        "Growth in disposable income had increased between the first and third quarters – reflecting a large recovery in real income.",
        "But in the fourth quarter real income was expected to drop, linked to the recent rise in energy prices.",
        "This implied a notable reduction in household real disposable income through a terms-of-trade effect, which was expected to dampen consumer spending in the short term.",
        "As regards housing investment, confidence continued to be strong but constraints from the supply side were playing an increasing role.",
        "Investment in other machinery and equipment had exceeded pre-pandemic levels since the first quarter of 2021, while in the third quarter investment in transport equipment had still been substantially below pre-pandemic levels.",
        "According to the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE), the share of firms saying that they had obtained financing for fixed investment over the latest six-month period had continued to improve and had reached a level above the pre-pandemic average.",
        "The recovery in the labour market continued to be strong.",
        "Although the unemployment rate had decreased further to the pre-crisis level of 7.3% in October, job retention schemes continued to support the labour market.",
        "Staff calculations indicated that the unemployment rate would be around 9% if workers in job retention schemes were added to the unemployed.",
        "In addition, the labour force continued to increase slightly but remained below pre-crisis levels.",
        "Employment and hours worked had been increasing in the third quarter but remained below pre-crisis levels, with some variation across countries.",
        "This signalled that the labour market was nowhere near back to normal.",
        "The job vacancy rate for the total economy had reached 2.6% in the third quarter, its highest level since the start of the data series.",
        "This increase was broad-based across sectors and reflected strong labour demand.",
        "The December 2021 staff projections foresaw a strong recovery in economic activity despite some near-term downward revisions owing to supply bottlenecks and the new pandemic wave.",
        "Economic growth in 2021 was seen to equal 5.1%, compared with 3.9% in the December 2020 projections.",
        "Inflation was expected to remain higher for longer, owing to high energy prices as well as mismatches between supply and demand.",
        "But the narrative remained that bottleneck effects were expected to fade over time.",
        "Headline inflation was foreseen to fall below 2% as of the fourth quarter of 2022 and be equal to 1.8% in 2024.",
        "This reflected low energy inflation but robust core inflation, supported by the absorption of slack, increased labour costs and higher inflation expectations.",
        "Looking at different forecasts over time, the June 2020 Eurosystem staff projections had foreseen only a partial recovery of the economy – whereas now in the December 2021 forecast the real GDP projection had returned to the pre-pandemic path.",
        "It was also very important to look at the labour market, where the December projections were returning to the pre-pandemic path.",
        "At 6.6% at the end of the projection horizon in 2024, the unemployment rate was forecast to be at a level not seen since the early 1980s.",
        "However, this was partly attributable to adverse demographic developments leading to a lack of workers and therefore stronger labour market pressures.",
        "To address the high uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook, the December 2021 Eurosystem staff projections continued to include alternative pandemic scenarios.",
        "Turning to developments in prices and costs, Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) inflation had increased further from 3.4% in September to 4.1% in October and 4.9% in November (flash release), pushed up by another increase in energy inflation.",
        "Energy inflation had reached an all-time high in November – predominantly driven by oil and fuel prices – while gas and electricity had also played an important role.",
        "But there had also been a substantial rise in HICPX inflation, i.e.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food, based on higher inflation for goods and services.",
        "Price pressures had spread to more of the goods and services included in the HICP.",
        "The range of inflation rates across HICP items was currently very wide.",
        "Most indicators of underlying inflation had picked up quite a bit recently, but it remained difficult to disentangle how much of this increase reflected pandemic effects.",
        "These included base effects, bottlenecks – which were expected to fade eventually – and the indirect effects of imported energy.",
        "Because of the many special factors at work it was unclear to what extent these indicators were, at present, good indicators of underlying inflation.",
        "Wage pressures also remained relatively limited, which was an essential aspect for assessing underlying inflationary pressures.",
        "Pipeline price pressures continued to build up.",
        "Owing to their lagged impact, this implied stronger upward pressure on non-energy industrial goods (NEIG) inflation in the future.",
        "At the same time, it was important to remember that goods represented only a relatively small fraction of the overall consumption basket underlying the HICP.",
        "Turning to wage developments, growth in negotiated wages had remained low, at 1.3% in the third quarter of 2021.",
        "So far there was no evidence of substantial second-round effects.",
        "Allowing for productivity increases, this was not yet generating much domestic inflation pressure.",
        "Minimum wages in several euro area countries were expected to grow quite strongly, in part because of inflation indexation, which could have knock-on effects.",
        "The latest developments in indicators of actual wage growth continued to be strongly affected by measures taken in 2020 to cushion the effect of the pandemic, such as job retention schemes.",
        "These also affected the GDP deflator, which was usually seen as a measure for domestic price pressures.",
        "The contribution of unit labour costs to the GDP deflator had so far remained limited.",
        "Measures of longer-term inflation expectations had increased significantly over the course of 2021 but had remained broadly stable in recent weeks – and were still below the 2% target.",
        "Surveys such as the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) or Consensus Economics supported the view that inflation would be high in 2021 and 2022 but fall afterwards and remain below the 2% target from 2023 onwards.",
        "Market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation continued to signal inflation below 2%.",
        "As regards monetary developments, Eurosystem asset purchases remained the largest contributor to money creation.",
        "But bank credit to the private sector had also strengthened in the third quarter of 2021 and in October.",
        "External monetary outflows were weighing negatively on money creation.",
        "Such outflows were consistent with Eurosystem purchases being larger than bond issuance in the euro area and the workings of portfolio rebalancing.",
        "Credit dynamics had remained relatively moderate since the September meeting of the Governing Council.",
        "This reflected contained demand for bank loans to firms, in the light of firms’ high liquidity holdings, the recovery in revenues, and increased use of alternative external financing sources.",
        "Conversely, the footprint left by supply bottlenecks was growing, pushing up short-term lending to firms to finance working capital and inventories.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, the December 2021 Eurosystem staff projections foresaw a less pronounced fiscal tightening for 2022 than the September ECB staff projections.",
        "Some additional fiscal stimulus measures could still be expected, resulting in a looser stance.",
        "But after 2022, and once the general escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact ceased to apply, some fiscal normalisation was to be expected.",
        "This would see fiscal policy becoming less supportive for growth in 2023-24 than during 2020-21.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane stressed that the euro area economy continued to recover and the labour market was improving, underpinned by ample policy support.",
        "Both the services and manufacturing sectors continued to expand.",
        "However, the pace of the expansion was moderating, and the pandemic situation had deteriorated.",
        "A sharp increase in cases of infection had resulted in the reimposition of tighter restrictions in some countries.",
        "These containment measures could, to some extent, delay the recovery in the most contact-intensive services.",
        "At the same time, manufacturing activity continued to be constrained by supply bottlenecks which were expected to persist throughout 2022, although gradually dissipating.",
        "Economic activity was being restrained by factors that were headwinds for the near-term outlook: the deterioration in the pandemic situation; ongoing shortages of labour, materials and equipment in some sectors; and the rise in energy costs.",
        "While the public health crisis was still ongoing, high levels of immunity and robust labour markets were mitigating the economic impact of the pandemic.",
        "In line with this assessment, activity was expected to pick up again strongly in the course of 2022.",
        "GDP was projected to grow by 5.1% in 2021, 4.2% in 2022, 2.9% in 2023 and 1.6% in 2024.",
        "Compared with the September staff projections, growth had been marked up for 2021 on account of upward revisions to the first two quarters of the year, which outweighed the downward revisions to the final two quarters of the year.",
        "The projection for 2022 had been revised down owing to persistent supply-side disruptions and the resurgence of the pandemic.",
        "For 2023, growth had been revised up, reflecting the expected fading of supply bottlenecks, the continued global recovery and an unwinding of accumulated savings.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, HICP inflation had increased from 4.1% in October to 4.9% in November.",
        "Inflation had increased sharply, primarily on account of the surge in energy prices but also because the recovery in demand was outpacing constrained supply in some sectors.",
        "Inflation was expected to remain elevated over the next few months but to decline sharply in the course of 2022, as energy prices stabilised, consumption patterns returned to normal, and the bottlenecks in global supply petered out.",
        "Base effects – including the reversal of the temporary German VAT cut – would also fall out of the year-on-year inflation calculation.",
        "HICPX inflation had risen from 2.0% in October to 2.6% in November.",
        "The increase reflected higher services inflation, mirroring the strengthening of price dynamics for high-contact services.",
        "NEIG inflation had also increased as producer prices had risen amid ongoing global supply dislocations.",
        "Stronger pipeline price pressures were also evident at both the earlier and later stages of the pricing chain.",
        "The December staff projections foresaw a significant upward revision to the path of inflation.",
        "Headline inflation was projected to average 2.6% in 2021, 3.2% in 2022, and 1.8% in both 2023 and 2024, with upward revisions of 0.4 percentage points for 2021, 1.5 percentage points for 2022 and 0.3 percentage points for 2023.",
        "The upward revisions were due to a significantly higher path of energy prices, as well as price pressures related to supply bottlenecks and to the reopening of the economy.",
        "Since these factors were expected to ease in the course of 2022, inflation was expected to fall back below the target in 2023 and 2024.",
        "At the same time, not only had the negative pandemic shock to the projected inflation path been eliminated, but also the projected gap vis-à-vis the medium-term inflation target had narrowed owing to the reabsorption of slack, stronger wage dynamics over the projection horizon and the increase in inflation expectations.",
        "The risks to the economic outlook were broadly balanced.",
        "Economic activity could outperform expectations if consumers became more confident and saved less than expected.",
        "By contrast, the recent worsening of the pandemic, including the spread of new virus variants, could be a more persistent drag on growth.",
        "The future path of energy prices and the pace of the dissipation of supply bottlenecks were risks to the recovery and to the outlook for inflation.",
        "If such price pressures fed through into higher than anticipated wage rises, or if the economy returned more quickly to full capacity, inflation could turn out to be higher.",
        "Financing conditions remained at favourable levels despite a pronounced deterioration in global risk sentiment and the associated fall in prices of risk assets.",
        "Compared with the last quarterly comprehensive assessment in September, risk-free and GDP-weighted sovereign yields had remained broadly stable.",
        "Bank and non-financial corporation (NFC) bond yields were above the levels that had prevailed in September, but the cost of equity was lower, and bank lending rates to both firms and households remained near historical lows.",
        "Overall, progress on economic recovery and towards the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation target permitted a step-by-step reduction in the pace of asset purchases over the coming quarters.",
        "The pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) had been launched with the dual objectives of offsetting the negative impact of the pandemic on the outlook for inflation and of staving off unwarranted market fragmentation caused by the pandemic that threatened the smooth transmission of monetary policy across the entire euro area.",
        "The PEPP had delivered on this dual-purpose mission.",
        "First, inflation at the end of the projection horizon was expected to exceed the end-horizon rate that had been projected prior to the pandemic.",
        "Second, the fragmentation in monetary policy transmission that had occurred in the initial phase of the pandemic had been successfully countered.",
        "As a result, financing conditions for firms and households had been favourable throughout the euro area.",
        "Looking at the big picture, vaccination campaigns and the observed capacity of the economy to adapt to the pandemic supported the conclusion that terminating net purchases at the end of March 2022 met the criterion of the pandemic crisis phase being over.",
        "At the same time, monetary accommodation was still needed for inflation to stabilise at the 2% inflation target over the medium term.",
        "In view of the current uncertainty, Mr Lane stressed that there was a need to maintain flexibility and optionality in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "Against this background, Mr Lane proposed the following: Mr Lane stressed that the Governing Council should clarify the outlook for its policies so that financing conditions remained sufficiently supportive for inflation to be maintained on its path of convergence to the target.",
        "At the same time, necessary optionality would be retained so as to be able to respond adequately to any new inflation surprise leading to an upside unanchoring of expectations regarding inflation in the medium term.",
        "The recalibration of the monetary policy instruments was a proportionate course of action in the pursuit of the price stability mandate.",
        "Inflation was still projected to be below the ECB’s target over the medium term.",
        "Therefore ensuring that the level of long-term interest rates provided sufficient support for economic activity was necessary in order to foster the convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s target over the medium term.",
        "In the current environment of low interest rates, appropriately calibrated asset purchases were also a relatively more efficient measure than turning to alternative monetary policy tools to provide the necessary degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Moreover, the potential side effects of the proposed recalibration did not outweigh the expected benefits in terms of price stability.",
        "In line with the new monetary policy strategy, Mr Lane stated that the Governing Council should also assess the interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability twice a year.",
        "On the one hand, accommodative monetary policy supported growth and thereby corporate balance sheets in both the non-financial and financial sectors.",
        "On the other hand, the impact of accommodative monetary policy on property and financial markets warranted close monitoring, especially since some medium-term vulnerabilities had intensified.",
        "However, macroprudential policy was the first line of defence in preserving financial stability and addressing medium-term vulnerabilities.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks to the outlook provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The euro area economy continued to recover and the labour market was improving.",
        "The near-term outlook faced headwinds from the latest pandemic wave, the significant increase in energy prices and the shortages of materials, equipment and labour in some sectors.",
        "However, overall, society had become better at coping with the pandemic waves and resulting constraints, which was reducing the impact on the economy.",
        "While growth was moderating, activity was expected to pick up again strongly in the course of 2022.",
        "Inflation had risen sharply owing to the surge in energy prices, and also because demand was outpacing constrained supply in some sectors.",
        "Inflation was expected to remain elevated in the near term, but to ease in the course of 2022.",
        "The inflation projections had been revised up, but inflation was still projected to settle below the 2% target over the projection horizon.",
        "As regards the external environment, members took note that 2021 had seen an early recovery in manufacturing and, more recently, a significant recovery in services too.",
        "The momentum in manufacturing was slowing, however, as supply bottlenecks in conjunction with strong increases in global demand had become more pervasive.",
        "Turning to euro area developments, economic activity had been moderating over the final quarter of 2021 and this slower growth was likely to extend into the early part of 2022.",
        "Shortages of equipment, materials and labour in some sectors were hampering production of manufactured goods, causing delays in construction and slowing down the recovery in some parts of the services sector.",
        "These bottlenecks would prevail for some time but were likely to ease during 2022.",
        "The tighter containment measures reintroduced in some euro area countries to cope with the current pandemic wave could delay the recovery.",
        "The pandemic was weighing on consumer and business confidence, and the spread of new virus variants was creating additional uncertainty.",
        "Moreover, increased energy costs – and price increases more broadly – were headwinds for consumption.",
        "Nonetheless, the economic recovery was continuing and the labour market was improving, with more people in jobs and fewer in job retention schemes.",
        "This supported the prospect of rising household income and consumption as well as investment.",
        "Members broadly agreed with the baseline view of economic growth in the December Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections and the revisions compared with the September ECB staff projections.",
        "Expected growth rates for real GDP of 5.1% in 2021 and 4.2% in 2022 showed confidence in a solid recovery and suggested that the sensitivity of activity to the pandemic and the damage caused by the pandemic were seen as limited at this stage.",
        "Vaccination campaigns and the adaptation of households and businesses to life during the pandemic had probably been more effective than expected.",
        "As a result, the link between the strength of the pandemic and the economic outlook had been weakening over time.",
        "The downward revision to growth in the near term as a result of the evolution of the pandemic, and its subsequent rebalancing with higher growth later in 2022, were seen to be in line with what had been experienced in previous waves of the pandemic.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that while economic performance had been better than expected, the economy was not yet “out of the woods”.",
        "Reference was made to the increased uncertainty implied by the emergence of the Omicron variant.",
        "Its emergence would be a setback for services, which had just been starting to recover.",
        "It was argued that the impact on inflation might be upward rather than downward in a context of more persistent supply-side constraints.",
        "However, the fall in oil prices that had followed the news about Omicron could be seen as a signal that the effect would be anti-inflationary.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, it was reiterated that targeted and growth-friendly fiscal measures should continue to complement monetary policy.",
        "This support would also help the economy adjust to the structural changes that were under way.",
        "An effective implementation of the Next Generation EU programme and the “Fit for 55” package would contribute to a stronger, greener and more even recovery across euro area countries.",
        "Against this background, members assessed the risks to the economic outlook as broadly balanced.",
        "Economic activity could outperform the staff expectations if consumers became more confident and saved less than expected.",
        "By contrast, the recent worsening of the pandemic, including the spread of new variants of the coronavirus, could be a more persistent drag on growth.",
        "The future path of energy prices and the pace at which supply bottlenecks were resolved presented risks to the recovery and to the outlook for inflation in both directions.",
        "If price pressures fed through into higher than anticipated wage rises, or the economy returned more quickly to full capacity, inflation could turn out to be higher.",
        "With regard to price developments, members largely concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Inflation had increased further to 4.9% in November 2021 and – according to the Eurosystem staff projections – would remain well above 2% for most of 2022.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to remain elevated in the near term but to decline in the course of 2022.",
        "The upswing in headline inflation primarily reflected a sharp rise in energy prices, which in November had accounted for more than half of headline inflation.",
        "In addition, demand continued to outpace constrained supply in certain sectors.",
        "Base effects related to the end of the VAT cut in Germany were still contributing to higher inflation, but would only do so until the end of 2021.",
        "It was expected that in the course of 2022 energy prices would stabilise and price pressures stemming from global supply bottlenecks would subside.",
        "Over time, the gradual return of the economy to full capacity and further improvements in the labour market were expected to support faster growth in wages.",
        "Market and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had moved closer to 2% in recent months.",
        "These factors would tend to drive underlying inflation up further and were likely to contribute to stabilising headline inflation at the target over the medium term.",
        "In their discussion of the baseline scenario for inflation in the December staff projections, members noted that the December projections had contained the largest cumulative upward revision to the inflation projections in the history of the exercise.",
        "The point was made that in the public perception repeated underestimations of inflation were likely to be more problematic than overestimations, as the general public was typically less concerned if actual inflation turned out lower than expected.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that the Eurosystem staff inflation projection for 2022 was much higher than other recent forecasts, such as those from Consensus Economics.",
        "It was stressed that almost two-thirds of the upward revision to inflation for 2022 was due to developments in volatile energy prices.",
        "These prices reflected a number of economic and geopolitical factors affecting the balance of demand and supply, as well as types of shock that could not have been foreseen.",
        "However, it was pointed out that core inflation had increased strongly over recent months, and inflation had become more broad-based, with barely any of the items in the HICP still exhibiting the low rates of change in prices prevailing in the pre-pandemic period.",
        "This cautioned against portraying the current high level of inflation as being the result of just energy price developments and temporary factors.",
        "Members were of the view that there was elevated uncertainty as to where inflation would settle in the medium term after the current hump.",
        "The baseline scenario of the December staff projections saw HICP inflation at 1.8% in both 2023 and 2024, and it was pointed out that rates below 2% were in line with the expectations of many other professional forecasters.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that, in any case, this outlook did not imply a return to the low inflation regime of the pre-pandemic period but pointed to a regime more similar to that prevailing before the great financial crisis when inflation had averaged around 2%.",
        "This was to be seen as a welcome development.",
        "However, it was also felt that such an outcome could not be taken for granted and high inflation could persist for longer than anticipated.",
        "It was reiterated that models calibrated on pre-pandemic data might not be well suited to capturing major structural changes or a potential switch from a lower to a higher inflation regime.",
        "Faced with a potential turning point in the inflation outlook, it was seen as paramount to pay close attention to timely signals emerging from the real economy, notably those from firms and wage-setters, rather than relying mostly on models and past patterns.",
        "In this context, it was also reiterated that higher inflation in the medium term was unlikely to come about without dynamic wage growth.",
        "In this respect, the baseline scenario of the December staff projections was seen to be predicated on wage growth above the average of the past two decades.",
        "It was argued that high wage growth outcomes could only materialise in the presence of a structural change in the wage-setting process or strong second-round effects.",
        "However, the longer inflation remained substantially above the target, the more it could become entrenched in longer-term inflation expectations, which could then spill over into wage growth and actual inflation.",
        "It was noted that the latest available data for euro area negotiated wages suggested annual growth of around 1.5%, and did not point to second-round effects so far.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that developments in wage growth lagged those in other economic variables, and such effects should hence not be expected in the data at this stage.",
        "It was also argued that the staff projections of relatively high nominal wage growth needed to be put into perspective, as the numbers were still affected by the impact of job retention schemes.",
        "Moreover, if developments in productivity were taken into account, the projected growth in unit labour costs appeared much less striking, although measures of productivity were also uncertain and were affected by special factors related to the pandemic, including the impact on the number of hours worked.",
        "Members discussed different upside and downside factors that could affect the baseline inflation outlook in the staff projections.",
        "Reference was made to the disinflationary impact of Omicron through lower global commodity prices.",
        "It was suggested that the fall in oil prices since the cut-off date for the projections would mechanically lower inflation in 2022.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that the balance between the disinflationary and inflationary consequences of Omicron was uncertain.",
        "In particular, it was argued that it would likely also affect supply adversely and, in line with previous experiences during the pandemic, could then also entail significant upside risks to inflation.",
        "It was recalled that the baseline projections assumed that energy commodity prices would evolve according to current backward-bending futures prices.",
        "These implied a marked decline in energy prices over the projection horizon and contributions of energy prices to headline inflation in 2023 and 2024 well below historical average levels.",
        "It was also reiterated that increases in carbon prices towards levels needed to reach the objectives of the Paris Agreement would push inflation upwards in the coming years, both within and beyond the projection horizon.",
        "Finally, it was recalled that the inflation projections did not yet include developments in owner-occupied housing costs.",
        "Reference was made to estimates indicating that HICP inflation in the second quarter of 2021 would have been 0.2-0.3 percentage points higher if these costs had been included.",
        "At the same time, it was suggested that models and the pricing of inflation compensation derived from financial markets continued to point to a higher likelihood of inflation undershooting the medium-term target than of a lasting overshoot.",
        "As regards inflation expectations, members took note of the assessment given by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane that survey and market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had generally remained below but near to the ECB’s inflation target.",
        "This was also the case taking into account estimates of risk premia, which varied over time and affected the interpretation of inflation expectations derived from the pricing of inflation compensation in financial markets.",
        "There were so far no signs that longer-term inflation expectations had moved away – or even become unanchored – from the target following the repeatedly higher than expected inflation figures in recent months, although they had increased significantly since the beginning of 2021.",
        "However, if inflation exceeded the target in both 2021 and 2022, this risked being perceived less and less as a temporary phenomenon and might drive up longer-term inflation expectations.",
        "If, by contrast, inflation declined sharply throughout 2022 from its current high rates, this would provide reassurance on the inflation outlook.",
        "Members widely concurred with the assessment of financial and monetary conditions provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Market interest rates had fallen since the Governing Council’s October meeting but were little changed compared with the September meeting, when the previous quarterly assessment of the inflation outlook and financing conditions had been carried out.",
        "Financing conditions for the economy remained favourable.",
        "Bank lending to NFCs was being driven partly by short-term funding needs stemming from supply bottlenecks that increased expenses for inventory and working capital.",
        "However, NFCs’ demand for loans remained moderate overall because of strong retained earnings and ample cash holdings, as well as high debt.",
        "By contrast, lending to households continued to be robust, driven by the demand for mortgages.",
        "Euro area banks had further strengthened their balance sheets thanks to higher capital ratios and fewer non-performing loans.",
        "Banks’ profits had recovered to levels seen before the pandemic, despite continued pressure on net interest margins.",
        "Bank funding conditions remained favourable overall.",
        "With respect to the assessment of financing conditions it was noted that, overall, financial and financing conditions had remained favourable despite a pronounced deterioration in global risk sentiment and the associated fall in the prices of risky assets.",
        "Compared with the Governing Council’s quarterly assessment of financing conditions in September, risk-free and GDP-weighted sovereign yields had remained broadly stable in nominal terms, and near or at historical lows in real terms.",
        "Bank and corporate bond yields were above the levels that had prevailed in September, but were counterbalanced by a lower cost of equity.",
        "Bank lending rates for firms and households remained around their historical lows.",
        "Reference was made to the euro having depreciated markedly, both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms, as a factor loosening financial conditions.",
        "This was also seen as likely to exacerbate losses in the terms of trade and to contribute to upward pressures on the euro area inflation outlook.",
        "Regarding the inflation outlook, members concurred that the recent and projected near-term increase in inflation was driven largely by temporary factors that were expected to ease in the course of 2022.",
        "Although the medium-term inflation outlook had been revised up in the staff projections, inflation was still projected to settle below the Governing Council’s 2% target in the baseline scenario.",
        "It was stressed that the projected convergence of inflation expectations towards 2% was to be welcomed although the outlook was surrounded by exceptionally high uncertainty.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that a “higher for longer” inflation scenario could not be ruled out.",
        "For 2023 and 2024, inflation in the baseline projection was already relatively close to 2% and, considering the upside risk to the projection, could easily turn out above 2%.",
        "It was seen as important to preserve the flexibility to act decisively to keep inflation expectations anchored in both directions, and thus also preserve the credibility of the Governing Council.",
        "The Governing Council should therefore communicate clearly that it was ready to act if price pressures proved to be more persistent and inflation failed to fall below the target as quickly as the baseline projections foresaw.",
        "However, concerns were also expressed about any premature scaling back of monetary stimulus and asset purchases.",
        "It was argued that market participants seemed to question the credibility of the Governing Council’s forward guidance, as they expected a first interest rate increase at a date that was difficult to reconcile with the conditions set by the Governing Council for such an increase.",
        "Overall, members broadly agreed that progress on economic recovery and towards the Governing Council’s 2% medium-term inflation target permitted a gradual normalisation of the monetary policy stance.",
        "There was general agreement that the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation had dissipated or been offset, and that net purchases under the PEPP could accordingly be scaled down and discontinued at the end of March, in line with previous communication.",
        "At the same time, members widely agreed that substantial monetary policy support was still needed for inflation to stabilise at the Governing Council’s inflation target over the medium term.",
        "It was argued that the Governing Council should look through the current supply disruptions and keep a steady hand, while carefully monitoring any developments pointing to an unanchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "A continued high degree of monetary policy support was also deemed necessary to prevent inflation falling below the target once the effects of the pandemic, which was still affecting large parts of the euro area economy, had subsided.",
        "However, it was argued that a significant degree of policy stimulus was already in place through the Governing Council’s forward guidance on interest rates, the large stock of acquired assets, together with the reinvestment policy, and the TLTROs.",
        "Therefore, given the measurable progress made in the convergence of medium-term inflation towards the target, there was no need for a further loosening of the stance through additional asset purchases.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that the discontinuation of net purchases under the PEPP at the end of the first quarter of 2022 and the expiry of the favourable interest rate conditions in the TLTRO III operations would imply a monetary tightening in 2022.",
        "Moreover, a divergence from the monetary policy stance in other jurisdictions, which could be perceived as less accommodative than in the euro area, was seen as warranted by different economic conditions.",
        "In the subsequent discussion, members widely agreed that the recalibration of the monetary policy instruments proposed by Mr Lane in his introduction was a proportionate course of action in the pursuit of the Governing Council’s price stability mandate.",
        "Given the exceptionally high uncertainty surrounding the current economic environment, a gradual, data-driven and flexible approach was deemed proportionate to balance the higher near-term inflation outlook against increasing medium-term vulnerabilities, which required maintaining sufficient optionality to adjust policy as new information became available.",
        "At the same time, the argument was made that the benefits of additional asset purchases were diminishing and their costs and side effects were increasing.",
        "This was evidenced, for example, by a structural deterioration in liquidity conditions and the increasing impairment of market functioning as a result of the low free float of bonds in many jurisdictions.",
        "There were also growing risks to financial stability, especially in the housing market, as well as rising distributional effects as asset purchases disproportionally benefited those owning assets.",
        "The proposed policy package was considered to be consistent with the economic outlook and was widely seen as appropriately calibrated to preserve the accommodative monetary policy stance needed to allow inflation to stabilise at the Governing Council’s symmetric 2% inflation target over the medium term.",
        "Against the background of continued favourable financing conditions and the improved inflation outlook, there was broad agreement that net asset purchases under the PEPP should be conducted at a lower pace in the first quarter of 2022 than in the previous quarter.",
        "There was also agreement that net purchases under the PEPP should be discontinued at the end of March.",
        "The PEPP was assessed to have achieved its dual objectives of offsetting the negative impact of the pandemic on the outlook for inflation and staving off unwarranted market fragmentation caused by the pandemic that threatened the smooth transmission of monetary policy across the entire euro area.",
        "The point was made that declaring an end to the emergency might be considered premature given the current deterioration in the pandemic situation.",
        "At the same time, it was widely felt that the “crisis phase” in economic terms could be considered to be coming to an end, in part since economic activity was expected to have returned to its pre-pandemic level by early 2022 and the pandemic shock to the inflation path was considered to have been offset.",
        "Moreover, it was recalled that net purchases under the PEPP could be resumed if the economic consequences of the pandemic endangered the attainment of the Governing Council’s price stability objective in the future.",
        "The extension of the guidance for reinvestments under the PEPP to until at least the end of 2024 was seen as assuring market participants that the Eurosystem would continue to be present in financial markets, thereby underpinning the ability of the PEPP reinvestments to counter market fragmentation risk.",
        "On the one hand, flexibility in operational parameters was seen as important to address potential disorderly market developments and therefore needed to remain in place over a longer period than previously announced.",
        "On the other hand, it was questioned whether lengthening the reinvestment horizon could be interpreted as adding more monetary stimulus, which seemed to contradict the direction of other elements of the policy package that were geared towards a scaling down of net asset purchases.",
        "In addition, a concern was voiced that continued asset purchases could lead to an unwelcome flattening of the yield curve if short-term interest rates needed to be raised before the end of the reinvestment horizon.",
        "However, the extension was also seen as important to ensure the effectiveness of PEPP reinvestments in protecting the monetary policy transmission mechanism.",
        "Members broadly agreed that the experience with the PEPP during the pandemic had shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and implementation of asset purchases helped to counter the impaired transmission of monetary policy and made it more effective.",
        "Maintaining this flexibility by adjusting the PEPP reinvestments across time, asset classes and jurisdictions in the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic was considered important to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy during a period in which net asset purchases were being reduced.",
        "A number of considerations were put forward regarding a commitment to flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases more generally, i.e.",
        "beyond the crisis situation.",
        "On the one hand, it was seen as an important lesson of the PEPP that such flexibility should remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission and to the attainment of price stability became apparent.",
        "The flexibility embedded in the PEPP was judged to have helped to provide the required monetary policy support and to reduce fragmentation in financial markets during the crisis.",
        "It was suggested that the Governing Council should therefore stress the importance of flexibility in its communication.",
        "On the other hand, it was argued that the PEPP’s flexibility was targeted at the specific pandemic shock and might not be proportionate if risks to the transmission of monetary policy and market fragmentation arose in other contexts.",
        "It was recalled that the PEPP had been designed to address a symmetric shock that could give rise to asymmetric consequences.",
        "Members agreed that flexibility in relation to the PEPP reinvestments would include the ability to purchase bonds issued by the Hellenic Republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of the monetary policy stance to the Greek economy while it was still recovering from the fallout of the pandemic.",
        "These purchases would provide assurance to market participants and help avoid market fragmentation.",
        "The proposed pace of net purchases under the APP of €40 billion per month in the second quarter, €30 billion per month in third quarter and €20 billion per month from October 2022 onwards was widely seen as striking a reasonable balance between elevated inflation in the short term and high uncertainty about the medium-term outlook.",
        "The point was also made that the proposed pace of purchases was appropriate to ensure a sufficient level of monetary policy support following the discontinuation of net asset purchases under the PEPP while avoiding unwanted cliff effects.",
        "Overall, members agreed that the legal framework of the APP was well established and would remain unchanged.",
        "While it was widely acknowledged that discontinuing net asset purchases under the PEPP would warrant a temporary step-up in net asset purchases under the APP, it was recalled that the two programmes had different objectives.",
        "The APP net purchases were intended to maintain a sufficiently accommodative stance to allow inflation to stabilise at the Governing Council’s 2% target over the medium term.",
        "It was argued that on this basis the change in the inflation outlook called for lower purchase volumes or an earlier phasing-out of purchases under the APP.",
        "The argument was also made that, in the present context of high uncertainty, the Governing Council should keep the APP open-ended but avoid any perception of a commitment to continuing net purchases under the APP beyond 2022.",
        "Given the high uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook, a sufficient degree of optionality to respond adequately to any new inflation surprises was seen as important for stabilising inflation at the symmetric 2% target.",
        "As incoming data over time would allow the impact of the evolving pandemic to be better understood, the Governing Council should retain the ability to calibrate and recalibrate the monetary policy stance in a data-driven manner in either direction.",
        "It was also emphasised that the Governing Council should reaffirm its forward guidance on interest rates, including the link to the end of the net asset purchases under the APP.",
        "The state-contingent nature of the Governing Council’s forward guidance was seen as well suited to addressing the current uncertain economic environment as it embedded both flexibility and optionality and ensured that short-term yields remained consistent with the inflation outlook.",
        "It was argued that, if risks to growth did not materialise and if the outlook for medium-term inflation moved above the Governing Council’s symmetric 2% inflation target, the forward guidance would allow for a gradual normalisation of the monetary policy stance.",
        "In relation to the targeted lending programme, members agreed that the Governing Council should confirm that it expected the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III to end in June 2022 as announced in 2020, and communicate that it would assess the appropriate calibration of the two-tier system for reserve remuneration so that the negative interest rate policy did not limit banks’ intermediation capacity in an environment of growing excess liquidity.",
        "In line with its new monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council for the first time considered the link between monetary policy and financial stability in a structured manner.",
        "It was argued that monetary policy was not well suited to dealing with financial stability risks as these tended to be concentrated in particular jurisdictions and were therefore better addressed with country-specific macroprudential measures.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that, as stressed in the monetary policy strategy review, existing limitations of macroprudential policy implied that there was a clear case for the ECB to take financial stability considerations into account in its monetary policy deliberations.",
        "It was pointed out that medium-term vulnerabilities had increased and required close monitoring.",
        "Concerns related in particular to credit, asset and housing markets as well as to higher debt levels in the corporate and public sectors as a legacy of the pandemic.",
        "It was also observed that the risk of a disorderly market reaction following a withdrawal of monetary policy support might lead to financial market fragmentation affecting monetary transmission across jurisdictions.",
        "However, this should not be used as an argument against modifying the monetary policy stance if that was required to achieve the ECB’s primary objective of price stability in the euro area as a whole.",
        "From this perspective it was advised that the dual objectives of asset purchases, i.e.",
        "in relation to the monetary policy stance and to transmission, be kept distinct.",
        "Overall, members concurred with the view that an accommodative monetary policy supported the balance sheets of companies and financial institutions, as well as countering risks of market fragmentation in the near term.",
        "To prevent the build-up of medium-term vulnerabilities, however, the impact of an accommodative monetary policy on property markets and financial markets should be closely monitored.",
        "Macroprudential policy was seen as the first line of defence in preserving financial stability and addressing medium-term vulnerabilities.",
        "In sum, a large majority of members agreed with the policy package proposed by Mr Lane, namely to conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP at a lower pace in the first quarter of 2022 than in the previous quarter; to adjust PEPP reinvestments flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions if needed; to extend the PEPP reinvestment horizon until at least the end of 2024; to increase net asset purchases under the APP temporarily to ensure that the monetary policy stance remained consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term; and to reconfirm the other elements of the current monetary policy configuration.",
        "Some members retained reservations about some elements of the proposed package such that they could not support the overall package.",
        "These reservations pertained, in particular, to the recalibration of APP purchases and the extension of the minimum PEPP reinvestment period, as well as the statement about flexibility in future asset purchases beyond the confines of the specific circumstances of the present pandemic.",
        "Regarding communication, it was emphasised that the Governing Council should stress its willingness to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate, in either direction, in order to stabilise inflation at 2% over the medium term.",
        "In addition, the Governing Council should reassure markets by stressing its determination to act flexibly and quickly to counter risks of fragmentation.",
        "The Governing Council judged that the progress on economic recovery and towards its medium-term inflation target permitted a step-by-step reduction in the pace of its asset purchases over the coming quarters.",
        "But monetary accommodation was still needed for inflation to stabilise at the 2% inflation target over the medium term.",
        "In view of the existing uncertainty, the Governing Council needed to maintain flexibility and optionality in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "With this in mind, taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the corresponding ECB press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel noted that uncertainty had increased in financial markets since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 7-8 September 2022.",
        "This had occurred amid persistently high inflation and elevated fears of a recession, with increased attention on potential financial instability.",
        "Inflation concerns had remained the dominant driver of financial market developments, as inflation outcomes had continued to surprise to the upside, leading to a renewed adjustment of market expectations for monetary policy globally.",
        "Against the background of persistent inflation surprises, investors had sharply revised up their expectations regarding central banks’ “terminal policy rate” (the level at which market participants expected the current interest rate cycle to peak) as embedded in risk-free rates, for all major advanced economies, albeit to different degrees.",
        "In the euro area, compared with expectations at the time of the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, market pricing and survey evidence now pointed to expectations of a faster pace of policy rate hikes and a markedly higher terminal rate.",
        "Forceful policy action was bringing about a tightening of financial conditions, with medium to longer-term real interest rates moving notably higher and risk assets continuing to be sold off.",
        "However, there was still a high degree of uncertainty about the extent of the policy adjustment needed to rein in inflation.",
        "At the same time, investors had gradually shifted their attention towards the side effects of the sharp global rate hiking cycle, amid tighter funding conditions for lower-rated entities, low market liquidity and heightened volatility in repo markets.",
        "The heightened concerns about inflation had resulted in euro area risk-free yields being much more sensitive to news about inflation in 2022 than had been the case in 2021.",
        "In contrast, the relationship between risk-free yields and news about growth had remained rather weak, suggesting that market participants expected central banks to focus primarily on inflation.",
        "In the United States, the adjustment of near-term rate expectations in financial market prices had been even more pronounced.",
        "Unlike in the euro area, the forward rate curve in the United States showed a marked inversion, signalling expectations of a reversal of rate hikes in the course of 2023.",
        "In the euro area, real interest rates had increased across the entire maturity spectrum since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "However, they were still deeply negative at short maturities and remained below the levels prevailing in previous tightening cycles, such as in December 2006, when inflationary pressures had been far less intense.",
        "On the back of repeated upward inflation surprises and heightened uncertainty about the path of monetary policy required to tame inflation, market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation in the euro area had trended upwards in recent weeks.",
        "They now stood above the levels observed at the time of the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, despite the sharp reappraisal of monetary policy expectations.",
        "Additional inflationary pressure could emanate from the ongoing depreciation of the euro.",
        "So far this year the euro had weakened by 13% vis-à-vis the US dollar.",
        "Considering that the bulk of commodities were denominated in US dollars, such currency developments had exacerbated the energy price shock.",
        "The reappraisal of monetary policy expectations had led to a broad-based tightening of financial conditions beyond risk-free rates.",
        "The global sell-off in equity markets had continued also in the euro area, even though analysts had lately made only limited downward revisions to euro area firms’ longer-term earnings prospects and earnings expectations remained at a high level overall.",
        "Cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratios had come down markedly from the elevated levels prevailing during the extended period of accommodative monetary policy.",
        "They were now much closer to, albeit still above, their long-run averages since 2005.",
        "In the euro area corporate bond market, the spreads of both high-yielding and investment-grade bonds had increased.",
        "Moreover, bond issuance by euro area non-financial corporations had declined markedly, especially in the high-yield segment.",
        "Developments in sovereign bond markets had so far been benign.",
        "Despite the sharp rise in risk-free yields, sovereign spreads vis-à-vis the overnight index swap (OIS) rate had remained broadly unchanged and had become less sensitive to changes in risk-free yields than before the announcement of the Transmission Protection Instrument.",
        "While the direct spillovers from the financial market turmoil in the United Kingdom had been limited, euro area financial markets had not been entirely immune.",
        "However, two mitigating factors were present.",
        "First, the euro area pension fund sector was comparatively small and concentrated, reducing the risk to euro area-wide financial stability.",
        "Second, interest rate derivatives were commonly based on the euro interbank offered rate (EURIBOR), limiting the impact of country-specific shocks on margin calls.",
        "Regarding the transmission of policy rate adjustments to money markets, after the September rate hike the functioning of euro area repo markets had been impaired, though only temporarily.",
        "This had been triggered predominantly by concerns about additional cash flows into the repo market from the non-monetary policy deposits held with the Eurosystem.",
        "The tensions in the repo market also reflected the general scarcity of collateral and the abundance of cash to be deposited in the repo market in an environment of high uncertainty.",
        "At the same time, cash bond markets had continued to function smoothly.",
        "Mr Lane highlighted that global economic activity had continued to slow in October.",
        "Global economic growth had seen a sharp reversal from a strong performance at the beginning of the year to a below-trend performance more recently.",
        "While data on goods trade had shown relatively stable growth rates until July, the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for new export orders had in October been significantly below the threshold of 50, indicating a contraction.",
        "The filling of the backlog of orders still supported activity, while new orders were declining.",
        "However, the latest data showed that manufacturing firms had largely worked through the backlogs accumulated over the last year, suggesting that this channel would provide less support to the economy in the future.",
        "Turning to exchange rate developments, in the past couple of years the euro effective exchange rate and the bilateral exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar had recorded a trend depreciation.",
        "However, since the Governing Council’s last monetary policy meeting little movement had been seen in the effective exchange rate, owing to the fact that the Japanese yen had depreciated.",
        "In fact, the trade-weighted exchange rate had appreciated slightly since the September meeting.",
        "Looking at the determinants of the euro’s depreciation versus the US dollar in 2022, the differences in the expected paths of policy rates had played a big role.",
        "However, the deterioration in the euro area terms of trade, as the prices paid for imports rose faster than those received for exports, had also been increasingly important.",
        "Regarding commodities, compared with the situation at the time of the September meeting, the prices of oil, metals and foods had not changed significantly.",
        "In contrast, there had been a huge decline in the spot price of gas, although the latest gas futures curve signalled a reversal of some of the drop in early 2023 and a stabilisation afterwards.",
        "Turning to the euro area, GDP growth in the second quarter of 2022 had been boosted by a strong increase in private consumption as a result of the reopening of contact-intensive services.",
        "In this period the contribution to inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) from demand factors had also increased.",
        "In particular, the very large increase in private consumption had made a larger contribution to inflation.",
        "The most recent indicators suggested that GDP growth had broadly stagnated in the third quarter of the year.",
        "For the next two quarters, the current assessment pointed to a drop in economic activity.",
        "However, this was very different from a scenario in which the euro area entered a prolonged period of negative growth.",
        "It was also very different from the downside scenario described in the September 2022 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, as energy prices were currently much lower than had been assumed in the downside scenario.",
        "Moreover, the assumption of energy rationing leading to sizeable production cuts had not materialised, nor had there been a major increase in financial stress.",
        "Survey-based sectoral indicators confirmed a continuing downward trend in manufacturing activity, despite the fact that industrial production had been supported by the filling of order backlogs and by the easing of supply bottlenecks.",
        "This support was not expected to continue in the future.",
        "PMI indicators showed that there had also been a significant slowdown in the services sector in recent months, while retail sales volumes had been on a declining path since June.",
        "Both manufacturing and services were experiencing a further increase in uncertainty, which affected the expected dynamics of demand.",
        "Focusing on private consumption, consumer confidence had continued to decline in the period to September, before rising marginally in October.",
        "The European Commission’s consumer survey showed that households were increasingly postponing major purchases and reducing their savings in order to maintain their consumption of basic necessities.",
        "The investment outlook had darkened significantly.",
        "Indicators of housing investment, such as building constructions and the PMI for residential output, had started to signal a contraction in the second quarter of this year and had continued to decline in the third quarter.",
        "Indicators of non-construction investment had also moved into contractionary territory in the third quarter.",
        "The goods trade balance had continued to deteriorate, reaching a deficit of around 4% in August.",
        "This new record had been driven mainly by the rapidly rising import bill for energy.",
        "High energy prices were not only increasing import costs, but were also affecting chemical exports.",
        "The production of chemicals, which had a high energy content, had become very expensive in Europe, reducing the competitiveness of these products and their exports.",
        "On the services sector side, there had been a strong recovery in tourism indicators.",
        "However, the latest data had started to signal a return towards more normal levels.",
        "Turning to the labour market, the unemployment rate had remained at a historical low of 6.6% in August.",
        "Employment and total hours worked had increased in the second quarter, by 0.4% and 0.6% respectively.",
        "That said, recent indicators were starting to suggest some weakening in the labour market.",
        "While the ECB’s latest Corporate Telephone Survey showed that employment growth remained in positive territory, firms had become more pessimistic about employment, which was in line with their sentiment about economic activity.",
        "A slowdown was also visible in the PMI data, although employment indices remained on the whole above the threshold indicating growth.",
        "While the PMI indicators for services and manufacturing were still above the threshold value, the indicator for construction had moved below it.",
        "Looking at the tightness of the labour market, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed persons had increased significantly in the past two years, which was evident both from Eurostat data and from data obtained from the private digital job search platform Indeed.",
        "While both sets of data had suggested an increase in tightness in the period to the second quarter of 2022, the most recent indications from Indeed suggested a stabilisation of the ratio in the third quarter.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, structural balances were not expected to improve in 2022, as the reduction in pandemic-related spending was being compensated by new energy-related spending measures.",
        "These large energy spending programmes had in part been financed by the large revenue windfalls in 2022.",
        "As a result, while the overall euro area fiscal deficit was still expected to improve this year, it was unlikely to improve next year.",
        "Governments had announced further large packages of fiscal measures in their budgetary plans for 2023, which were likely to prevent any further improvement in their deficit-to-GDP ratios.",
        "While so far it appeared that spending on the newly announced measures would be reduced in 2024, it was still too early to assess how temporary and targeted the measures would be.",
        "The increase in interest rates was expected to lead to higher financing costs for governments.",
        "Moving to the latest inflation developments, HICP inflation had increased further to 9.9% in September.",
        "The forecast error in the September projections amounted to 0.5 percentage points and was primarily related to the energy and food components.",
        "The projection for non-energy industrial goods inflation had been slightly higher than the actual outcome, while the projection for services inflation had been lower.",
        "Most countries had contributed to the September forecast error.",
        "Since the weight of food prices in the total HICP was double that of energy prices, understanding their dynamics was very important.",
        "Consumer prices for food had seen a sharp increase and food producer price indices were rising.",
        "At the same time, growth in “upstream” prices at the start of the production chain – such as fertiliser prices and international food commodity prices – had started to decelerate.",
        "The fact that food producer prices were still on a rising path implied that more pipeline pressures should be expected for food consumer prices.",
        "For goods prices, the most recent data showed that pipeline pressures on intermediate goods prices had started to ease, although these remained very elevated.",
        "However, pressures on consumer goods prices continued to increase, reflecting transmission lags.",
        "Focusing on core inflation, i.e.",
        "inflation excluding energy and food, the decomposition into supply and demand factors showed that until July 2022 supply factors had continued to make a significant contribution, suggesting that the core inflation rate would come down significantly if supply factors eased.",
        "However, the decomposition also showed a steady increase in the contribution from demand factors.",
        "Mr Lane recalled that core inflation was also affected by indirect effects of high energy prices, which were causing many energy-intensive sectors to raise their prices.",
        "ECB staff analysis, which divided goods and services into either energy-intensive or non-energy-intensive items, showed that a disproportionate share of inflation stemmed from the energy-intensive sectors.",
        "A stabilisation of energy prices would thus have important implications for core inflation.",
        "Turning to domestic wage pressures, negotiated wages had continued to increase gradually over the last few months, even when the impact of one-off wage payments was excluded.",
        "The forward-looking information compiled in the experimental ECB wage tracker for the euro area showed wage agreements concluded in the third quarter of 2022 implying wage growth of 3.7% in 2023.",
        "This represented an acceleration compared with 2022 but was still a relatively moderate pace of growth.",
        "Headline inflation in the euro area had exceeded headline inflation in the United States owing to much higher energy and food inflation.",
        "In the United States, however, core inflation was stronger than in the euro area, and it was very closely correlated with wage inflation.",
        "In the euro area, core inflation remained well ahead of wage inflation because the sectors with the highest price increases were not particularly labour-intensive but were relatively energy-intensive.",
        "Inflation in wage-sensitive HICP items had continued to increase in line with negotiated wage growth, which, however, remained relatively contained overall.",
        "These sectors had generally seen less inflation pressure than sectors more exposed to supply-chain problems.",
        "Moving to price pressures related to housing, rental price growth had remained below 2% in September.",
        "It was thus exerting a dampening effect on services prices and on the overall inflation rate.",
        "However, other prices related to housing had increased strongly.",
        "The growth of owner-occupied housing costs had reached 10.1% in the second quarter of 2022.",
        "Looking ahead, the September projections suggested a significant deceleration in residential property price growth.",
        "Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2027) reported in the October ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters had remained basically constant at 2.2% for headline inflation and had decreased from 2.2% to 2.1% for core inflation.",
        "However, respondents had significantly revised up their inflation expectations for 2024 to 2.4%.",
        "Most of the responses continued to lie between 2% and 2.4%.",
        "But the average was affected by movements in the tails of the distribution, with an increase in the number of respondents who expected inflation to exceed 3% in 2024 and a marked decline in the numbers who expected inflation to be below 2%.",
        "The September data from the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey showed that there had been no significant change since the increase in expected inflation that had occurred in March 2022.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation compensation continued to point to a sharp decline in inflation rates next year, from very high levels to significantly lower rates.",
        "Turning to monetary and financial developments, bank funding costs had been gradually increasing, which reflected the changes in risk-free rates.",
        "Since early 2022 bank bond yields had risen by more than 300 basis points.",
        "Deposit rates for households and firms had also seen a significant increase and were expected to rise further in the coming months in the context of monetary policy normalisation.",
        "Rates on lending to firms and households had also increased and credit standards had tightened markedly.",
        "The latest monetary data for September showed large shifts from overnight to time deposits, mainly on the part of firms and other financial intermediaries (OFIs).",
        "Households had also recorded their largest inflow into time deposits for ten years, but still continued to increase their holdings of overnight deposits.",
        "This deposit reconfiguration was in line with the increase in opportunity costs of holding overnight deposits since the beginning of monetary policy normalisation.",
        "The September monetary data also confirmed a drop in loan flows to non-financial corporations and, in particular, to households, providing further evidence that the tightening of financial conditions was being transmitted to the real economy.",
        "Finally, Mr Lane reported the results of the October ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts.",
        "Compared with the September survey, respondents now expected the path of the key ECB interest rates to steepen and shift upwards by about 100 basis points.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane stressed that inflation remained far too high and would stay above the ECB’s target of 2% for an extended period.",
        "Inflation had increased again in September, to 9.9%.",
        "Energy price inflation had exceeded 40%, which was due to one-off effects but also reflected the ongoing pass-through of wholesale prices to retail prices.",
        "Food price inflation had also risen further, to 11.8%, owing to developments in both the unprocessed and processed food components.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation were at elevated levels.",
        "Among those measures, inflation excluding energy and food had risen to 4.8% in September, from 4.3% in August, reflecting the impact of high utility prices on the cost structures of many sectors, the ongoing impact of supply bottlenecks and the post-pandemic recovery in demand.",
        "Wage growth had continued to increase gradually.",
        "At the same time, there were no clear signs of widespread second-round effects, and longer-term inflation expectations remained broadly aligned with the 2% target.",
        "Still, the increases in wage growth signalled by the ECB wage tracker were moderately above the levels embedded in the September staff projections, and wage pressures in the public sector could add a further impulse.",
        "Overall, risks to the inflation outlook were primarily on the upside.",
        "The major risk in the short term was a further rise in retail energy prices.",
        "Over the medium term inflation could turn out to be higher than expected if there were increases in the prices of energy and food commodities and a stronger pass-through to consumer prices; a persistent worsening of the production capacity of the euro area economy; a persistent rise in inflation expectations above the ECB’s target; or higher than anticipated wage rises.",
        "By contrast, a decline in energy costs and a further weakening of demand would lower price pressures.",
        "Economic activity was likely to have slowed significantly in the third quarter of the year and was expected to weaken further in the remainder of 2022 and the beginning of 2023.",
        "Higher inflation, lingering uncertainty and further cuts in the supply of gas from Russia had dampened consumer and business confidence and were expected to curb aggregate demand in the second half of 2022.",
        "The effects of the reopening of the economy that had boosted services over the spring and summer were expected to fade in the autumn and winter months.",
        "Households were concerned about inflation eroding real disposable incomes, with those on low incomes being especially affected.",
        "While supply-chain bottlenecks were gradually easing, the energy supply shock would continue to weigh on manufacturing activity and trade.",
        "In addition, global economic prospects remained clouded.",
        "In line with these developments, available indicators and short-term estimates pointed to marginal downside risks for the third quarter of 2022 and to clear downside risks for both the fourth quarter of the year and the first quarter of 2023, compared with the September 2022 projections.",
        "A long-lasting war in Ukraine was still a significant risk.",
        "Confidence could deteriorate further and supply-side constraints could worsen again.",
        "Energy and food costs could also remain persistently higher than expected.",
        "A weakening world economy could be an additional drag on growth in the euro area.",
        "So far, the labour market had continued to be a source of resilience for the economy but, since it generally reacted with a delay to economic activity, it was likely to lose momentum.",
        "Accordingly, the weakening of the economy could lead to somewhat higher unemployment in the future.",
        "Market interest rates had risen and broader financial conditions had tightened significantly amid expectations of faster and more substantial monetary policy tightening, both in the euro area and globally.",
        "Government bond yields had risen in tandem with risk-free interest rates, with spreads narrowing slightly, probably continuing to reflect support from the Transmission Protection Instrument and communication on flexible reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).",
        "Bank funding costs were increasing in response to rising market interest rates.",
        "This was making borrowing more expensive for firms and households.",
        "While bank lending to firms had remained robust, as they needed to finance high production costs and build up inventories, demand for loans to finance investment had continued to decline.",
        "Household borrowing for house purchase had reached a turning point in the summer.",
        "The latest bank lending survey indicated that credit standards had tightened, with banks becoming more concerned about the deteriorating outlook for the economy and the risks faced by their customers in the current environment.",
        "Banks expected to continue tightening their credit standards in the fourth quarter.",
        "In view of the protracted period of excessively high inflation and the risk that this may add to medium-term price pressures, Mr Lane proposed that the three key ECB interest rates be raised again by 75 basis points at the present meeting.",
        "With this third major policy rate increase in a row, substantial progress would be made in withdrawing monetary policy accommodation.",
        "Since the ECB’s policy rates were still accommodative, a large increase would underscore the Governing Council’s commitment to taming inflation by reducing support for demand and ensuring inflation expectations remained anchored at the medium-term target.",
        "As a further tangible sign of this commitment, it should be communicated that the Governing Council expected to raise rates further.",
        "The future rate path should be based on the evolving outlook for inflation and the economy, following a meeting-by-meeting approach.",
        "In addition to further rate normalisation, Mr Lane proposed changing the terms and conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III).",
        "During the acute phase of the pandemic, the TLTROs had played a key role in countering downside risks to price stability.",
        "In that period the ECB had granted exceptionally favourable conditions to credit institutions that borrowed via these operations, with the aim of sustaining the supply of bank loans to the real economy at a time when banks were likely to pull back and disengage from credit intermediation.",
        "At present, in view of the unexpected and extraordinary rise in inflation, the instrument needed to be recalibrated to ensure that it was consistent with the broader monetary policy normalisation process and to reinforce the transmission of policy rate increases to bank lending conditions.",
        "It was therefore necessary to adjust the interest rates applicable to TLTRO III from 23 November 2022 and to offer banks additional voluntary early repayment dates.",
        "The proposed recalibration was proportionate.",
        "First, it would contribute to the normalisation of bank funding costs.",
        "The ensuing normalisation of financing conditions would, in turn, exert downward pressure on inflation over the medium term.",
        "Moreover, the recalibration removed disincentives for voluntary early repayment of outstanding TLTRO III funds, which would reduce the Eurosystem’s balance sheet.",
        "It was also expected to facilitate the release of securities currently being used as collateral with the Eurosystem, thereby alleviating collateral scarcity and improving the money market intermediation capacity of banks by reducing their balance sheets.",
        "This, in turn, supported a smoother and more efficient pass-through of the Governing Council’s policy rate increases to secured money market rates.",
        "Second, the proposed recalibration was more efficient than seeking to achieve the same objective through a shorter full-reinvestment period for the Eurosystem’s bond holdings or through more aggressive interest rate hikes.",
        "While amending the TLTRO III conditions might have side effects, the abrupt and unforeseeable change in circumstances justified a change in the policy stance if this was in the service of the ECB’s primary objective.",
        "Moreover, Mr Lane proposed adjusting the remuneration of the minimum reserves held by credit institutions with the Eurosystem, to align it more closely with money market conditions.",
        "Given the high levels of excess liquidity, the marginal cost of reserves was currently anchored at the interest rate on the deposit facility, not the rate on the main refinancing operations.",
        "Changing the remuneration from the main refinancing operations rate to the deposit facility rate would thus restore the neutrality of the minimum reserves system.",
        "Finally, Mr Lane proposed continuing to apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.",
        "Regarding the economic analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks to the outlook provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Inflation remained far too high and would stay above target for an extended period.",
        "In September euro area inflation had reached 9.9%, with soaring energy and food prices, supply bottlenecks and the post-pandemic recovery in demand having led to a broadening of price pressures and an increase in inflation in recent months.",
        "As regards the external environment, the latest data confirmed signals of slowing economic growth across countries and sectors and implied a substantial reversal of the pick-up in global activity recorded earlier in the year.",
        "It was observed that an increasing number of economies were expected to enter a recession.",
        "The concern was expressed that the cumulative impact of the slowdown, also including spillovers from synchronised monetary policy tightening, could even result in a “technical recession” at the global level.",
        "At the same time, reference was also made to easing global supply bottlenecks.",
        "Uncertainty surrounded China and the United States, with global activity being negatively affected by China’s closure of its economy and by the global fallout from restrictive monetary policy in the United States.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that lockdowns in China had led to declines in the country’s imports of liquified natural gas, with dampening effects on gas prices.",
        "In this regard, it was noted that spot prices for natural gas had seen an unexpected sharp fall in recent days and that the recent movements in global commodity markets had almost reversed the price increases posted since the beginning of the year.",
        "Some further alleviation of global energy price pressures was anticipated for 2023.",
        "However, it was argued that futures prices suggested some reversal of this trend and that, even after their recent decline, gas prices had been very volatile and were still many times higher than in the past.",
        "Turning to euro area developments, economic activity in the euro area was likely to have slowed significantly in the third quarter of 2022, with the weakening expected to continue during the remainder of the year and into early 2023.",
        "By reducing real incomes and pushing up costs for firms, high inflation continued to dampen spending and production.",
        "Severe disruptions in the supply of gas had further worsened the situation, and consumer and business confidence had fallen rapidly, also weighing on the economy.",
        "Demand for services was slowing after performing strongly in previous quarters, when those sectors most affected by the pandemic-related restrictions had reopened, and survey-based indicators for new orders in the manufacturing sector were lower.",
        "Moreover, global economic activity was growing more slowly, in a context of persistent geopolitical uncertainty – especially owing to Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine – and tighter financing conditions.",
        "Worsening terms of trade were weighing on incomes in the euro area.",
        "At the same time, the labour market had continued to perform well in the third quarter, with the unemployment rate remaining at the historically low level of 6.6% in August.",
        "While short-term indicators suggested that jobs were still being created in the third quarter of the year, the weakening of the economy could lead to somewhat higher unemployment in the future.",
        "Members widely agreed that the outlook for euro area economic activity had deteriorated since the September monetary policy meeting.",
        "It was noted that all components of demand, including consumption, investment and exports, showed signs of weakening.",
        "Reference was made to the latest forward-looking survey indicators for economic activity, which had posted strong declines and were signalling a contraction.",
        "It was argued that a technical recession was becoming the baseline scenario and the most likely outcome.",
        "The view was expressed that, while real GDP for the quarter ahead had repeatedly been underestimated in previous staff projections, it was currently likely that the projection error would have the opposite sign.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that, so far, the hard evidence was consistent with a mild recession rather than suggesting a hard landing for the economy or a protracted downturn.",
        "This distinction was widely seen as a key issue for the current economic picture and for the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "A question was raised on the propagation mechanisms that could turn a shallow and short-lived recession into a deep and prolonged slump.",
        "Weakness in the banking sector had been a factor in past episodes but was likely not a key factor now, while the housing market – at least in some countries – might play a role.",
        "Another issue was what a recession would imply for the resilience of the labour market.",
        "In this regard, it was noted that the latest data for the forward-looking PMI survey indicators for manufacturing were down for activity but up for employment.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed persons had remained much lower in the euro area than in the United States, pointing to a lesser degree of labour market tightness in the euro area.",
        "It was argued that uncertainty and losses in purchasing power were the main factors behind the deterioration in the outlook, reflecting lower real wages but also lower real financial wealth, given that many households held their savings in low-remunerated deposits and debt securities.",
        "In this context, reference was made to analysis that pointed to substantially higher inflation rates for lower income households, since energy and food items made up a greater proportion of their consumption.",
        "This was seen as a reminder that inflation had substantial distributional consequences.",
        "It was argued that consumer confidence was likely to stay weak as long as inflation stayed high, as consumers had now lost a large part of previous gains in purchasing power.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that there were still substantial excess savings accumulated during the pandemic crisis that could – together with fiscal support and a strong labour market – bolster consumption.",
        "In this context, it was noted that the findings of the Consumer Expectations Survey suggested that some households were keeping up their spending either by saving less or by liquidating part of their stock of savings.",
        "Regarding fiscal policy, it was reiterated that fiscal support measures to shield the economy from the impact of high energy prices should be temporary and targeted at the most vulnerable, in order to limit the risk of fuelling inflation.",
        "Policy measures should provide incentives to lower energy consumption and bolster energy supply.",
        "At the same time, governments should pursue fiscal policies that showed they were committed to gradually bringing down high public debt ratios.",
        "Structural policies should be designed to increase the euro area’s growth potential and supply capacity and to boost its resilience, thereby contributing to a reduction in medium-term price pressures.",
        "The swift implementation of the investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme would make an important contribution to these objectives.",
        "The solution to the energy problem was seen as mainly of a structural nature.",
        "The point was made that the planned fiscal support appeared to differ across countries.",
        "Concern was expressed that, in the face of high energy costs, there was growing pressure on governments to support demand via transfers, which would then fuel inflation, instead of fostering potential growth through targeted public investment.",
        "While there was a risk that fiscal compensation packages would turn out to be bigger than warranted, also from a price stability perspective, it was also argued that the planned and expected additional fiscal measures were needed in view of the expected recession.",
        "When assessing the fiscal stance, it was considered important to include the EU funds.",
        "It was recalled that a recession would activate automatic stabilisers, which would increase spending at the same time as tax revenues declined.",
        "Moreover, as tax revenues had been bolstered by the “inflation tax”, the expected decline in inflation would have a dampening impact on revenues at a time when funding costs were rising as a result of higher interest rates, leading to a deterioration in nominal deficits.",
        "Against this background, the incoming data confirmed that risks to the economic growth outlook were clearly on the downside, especially in the near term.",
        "A long-lasting war in Ukraine remained a significant risk.",
        "Confidence could deteriorate further and supply-side constraints could worsen again.",
        "Energy and food costs could also remain persistently higher than expected.",
        "A weakening world economy could be an additional drag on growth in the euro area.",
        "The concern was expressed that, with the changes in the economic outlook, the economy was now closer to the downside scenario than to the baseline scenario depicted in the September ECB staff projections.",
        "However, a note of caution was voiced against equating the current outlook to the downside scenario.",
        "This was because the mechanisms were different, as regards both gas price developments and potential gas-supply rationing affecting production.",
        "It was argued that, in many respects, the outlook was more benign than the September downside scenario.",
        "However, in the meantime, other downside risks had materialised.",
        "With regard to price developments, members generally agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Inflation had risen to 9.9% in September, reflecting further increases in all components.",
        "Energy price inflation had remained the main driver of overall inflation, with an increasing contribution from gas and electricity prices.",
        "Food price inflation had also risen further, as high input costs had made food production more expensive.",
        "Supply bottlenecks were gradually easing, although their lagged impact was still contributing to inflation.",
        "The impact of pent-up demand, while weakening, was still driving up prices in the services sector.",
        "The depreciation of the euro had added to the build-up of inflationary pressures.",
        "Price pressures were evident in an increasing number of sectors, in part owing to the impact of high energy costs feeding through to the whole economy.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation had thus remained at elevated levels.",
        "Among those measures, inflation excluding energy and food had risen further to 4.8% in September.",
        "Members underlined that the latest inflation outcomes were not at all reassuring.",
        "Data continued to come in above expectations.",
        "Concerns were expressed especially with regard to core inflation and the broader array of measures of underlying inflation, which appeared to be gradually increasing further and – with few exceptions – did not point to the stabilisation that had been hoped for and that had been embedded in the September staff projections.",
        "The continued strong short-run momentum was also confirmed by the upward trend in month-on-month increases in core inflation.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that prices for natural gas had fallen.",
        "There were doubts as to whether, in view of the high volatility in the market, these lower gas prices would be sustained and should form the basis of a revised outlook.",
        "But it was also noted that the latest developments cautioned against simply extrapolating the very large impact that had been included in the September projections.",
        "The point was made that a correction in wholesale energy prices did not automatically imply a corresponding pass-through to HICP inflation.",
        "The earlier surges in energy prices had led to ever-faster impacts on inflation, and it remained to be seen how this would evolve when the commodity price surges were reversed.",
        "Changes and non-linearities in the speed and strength of the pass-through, depending on the size and persistence of the energy price shock, were typically not embedded in the models used for forecasting.",
        "It was recalled that what ultimately mattered was not wholesale but consumer energy prices, and that it was thus important to understand the pass-through mechanisms between the two and the corresponding time lags.",
        "The observation was made that long-term contracts could imply long delays, with significant upward pipeline pressures still working their way through.",
        "References were made to various decompositions of inflation into underlying factors.",
        "First, it was noted that the rise in both headline and core inflation had come with an increase in demand-driven factors.",
        "Inflation could thus decline as a result of both supply and demand factors.",
        "Doubts were expressed as to whether, at the current juncture, relaxations on the supply side would be sufficient, and it was argued that a reduction in inflation would need to be driven mostly by a lower contribution from the demand component.",
        "Second, the decomposition of non-energy industrial goods inflation and services inflation showed that the non-energy-intensive components of inflation were also increasing.",
        "It was thus cautioned that any alleviation of inflationary pressures on the energy side could be offset by countervailing forces.",
        "One such force was exchange rate depreciation, which was negatively affecting the inflation outlook on a broad basis.",
        "More generally, the pass-through from producer to consumer prices was taking time and was still accounting for further upward pressure in the pipeline.",
        "It was recalled that the pass-through had recently been faster and stronger than expected and embedded in standard models.",
        "However, it was also argued that the quicker and stronger the pass-through, the faster the overall price adjustment would be completed and the earlier inflation rates could normalise.",
        "In this context it was seen as useful to also look at quarter-on-quarter inflation rates to get a better picture of inflation dynamics, given that annual rates were affected by base effects and carry-over.",
        "With regard to wages, continued strong labour markets were likely to support higher wages, and some catch-up in wages to compensate for higher inflation was likely.",
        "Incoming wage data and recent wage agreements indicated that wage growth might be picking up.",
        "This could also be inferred from the statements of union representatives, employers and politicians.",
        "The tight labour market and the prolonged period of high inflation were seen as beginning to have an impact on wage growth.",
        "In the Corporate Telephone Survey, a large majority of respondents had expected wage increases to be above 4% in 2023.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that, even though growth in negotiated wages and in compensation per employee might be more dynamic, their levels were still moderate compared with inflation and there were no clear signs of a wage-price spiral.",
        "However, it was recalled that wages were a lagging indicator, and some doubts were expressed as to whether the still comforting picture provided by the experimental ECB wage tracker would hold up.",
        "It was considered unwise to assume that workers would simply accept the hit to real wages without a stronger response of nominal wages.",
        "There was a risk that future wage growth was being underestimated, as also suggested by more timely information on wages from job postings on private digital platforms, which were increasing faster than data on negotiated wages.",
        "While it was argued that the euro area labour market was clearly a source of strength and resilience, it was cautioned that labour markets were still undergoing normalisation in the wake of the pandemic-related crisis, also with respect to the associated swings in productivity and sectoral reallocations.",
        "Hence, concern was expressed that this strength could be undermined if wages were overstretched in such a delicate adjustment period.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the unusual resilience of profits and profit margins in the light of deteriorating cyclical conditions, which was as important as wage developments when it came to factors driving inflation and inflation persistence.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, most measures were currently standing at around 2%, although further above-target revisions to some indicators warranted continued monitoring.",
        "It was argued that survey-based measures had been trending upwards for some time and that market-based measures were pointing in the same direction, with no sign of a turning point.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that market-based inflation measures contained an inflation risk premium, which had turned positive.",
        "A note of caution was added, to not only look at the upper tail of the distribution when assessing risks to longer-term inflation expectations but to include the lower tail.",
        "In the Survey of Monetary Analysts, the distribution appeared to have become more symmetric.",
        "Moreover, survey expectations had likely been measured at a cut-off date prior to the recent fall in gas prices and, if this fall were to persist, these expectations might see some downward adjustment.",
        "It was argued that, with actual HICP inflation standing at around 10%, longer-term inflation expectations had remained relatively well anchored.",
        "At the same time, it was warned that the formation of inflation expectations was becoming more and more backward-looking.",
        "If actual inflation was not brought down in a timely manner, expectations would increasingly react to actual inflation and would, in turn, push it higher.",
        "In this context, reference was made to the substantial upward shifts in the expectations for headline and core inflation in 2024 as reflected in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, which pointed to an increased risk of unanchoring.",
        "An upward shift in medium-term inflation expectations had also been seen in the Consumer Expectations Survey.",
        "Against this background, members agreed that the risks to the inflation outlook were primarily on the upside.",
        "The major risk in the short term was a further rise in retail energy prices.",
        "Over the medium term, inflation could turn out to be higher than expected if there were increases in the prices of energy and food commodities and a stronger pass-through to consumer prices; a persistent worsening of the production capacity of the euro area economy; a persistent rise in inflation expectations above the ECB’s target; or higher than anticipated wage rises.",
        "By contrast, a decline in energy costs and a further weakening of demand would lower price pressures.",
        "It was pointed out that risks and their direction needed to be reassessed in the December Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "One key issue was the extent to which a possible recession would limit upside risks to inflation in the medium term.",
        "It was argued that a shallow or technical recession was unlikely to keep inflation in check given its recent momentum and the risk that price increases would be difficult to reverse.",
        "However, reference was made to the downside scenario in the September projections, in which there would be a deeper recession in 2023 than in the baseline scenario and a higher inflation rate in 2024.",
        "It was commented that any dampening effect from a recession could be counterbalanced by an increased likelihood of second-round effects as a result of higher inflation in the short term, leading to greater inflation persistence and constituting an upside risk to the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "It was argued that there was an increasing risk of a vicious circle in which higher inflation expectations would feed into both higher prices and higher wages, and the concern was raised that such effects could be highly non-linear given the size of the shock.",
        "It was also argued that potential economic output might be lower than currently estimated.",
        "Lower potential output would imply higher inflationary pressures and could reconcile the difference between estimates of the unemployment and output gaps.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Bank funding costs were increasing in response to the rise in market interest rates, translating into higher borrowing costs for firms and households.",
        "Bank lending to firms had remained robust, whereas household borrowing for house purchase had reached a turning point in the summer.",
        "The latest bank lending survey indicated that banks had tightened their credit standards in the third quarter of the year and expected to continue tightening them in the fourth quarter.",
        "It was pointed out that the transmission of the increase in bank lending rates to households was highly dependent on the fixation period for interest rates in mortgage contracts, which differed significantly across euro area economies.",
        "Members agreed that financial conditions across markets and financing conditions for different types of borrowers had tightened significantly in anticipation of a faster and more substantial monetary policy tightening, both in the euro area and globally.",
        "Euro area government bond yields had risen in lockstep with risk-free interest rates, with their spreads relative to the OIS rate having remained broadly unchanged since the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting.",
        "The spreads had been relatively insensitive to shifts in monetary policy expectations, which probably reflected support from the Transmission Protection Instrument and communication on flexible reinvestments under the PEPP.",
        "In this context, it was highlighted that the Governing Council’s interest rate hike in September had not been transmitted smoothly to all segments of the repo markets.",
        "Use of the Eurosystem facility for securities lending against cash had reached its second highest level ever after the September interest rate decision took effect.",
        "Tensions in the repo market had also been reflected in the behaviour of the swap spread, i.e.",
        "the spread between OIS rates and sovereign bond yields of the same maturity, which had widened in some jurisdictions, partly owing to the scarcity of collateral.",
        "It was remarked that financial market volatility had increased since the September Governing Council meeting, as evidenced by the bond market turbulence that was triggered by the announcement of the initial UK budget plans for 2023.",
        "The view was expressed that, for a long period, central bank policy measures had suppressed volatility to a significant extent and that some reversal of this situation could be considered a healthy return to more normal market conditions.",
        "It was considered noteworthy that volatility had been especially pronounced in markets that were traditionally considered low-risk, such as the money markets and the sovereign bond markets, with higher volatility in these markets since the beginning of the year than in the equity market.",
        "However, measures such as liquidity or bid-ask spreads indicated that euro area markets had continued to function well.",
        "Turning to the monetary policy proposals, the view was widely shared that the inflation outlook continued to worsen, with inflation far too high and repeatedly above the projected figures.",
        "In addition, price pressures had become more broad-based, with a rising trend in core inflation and other measures of underlying inflation.",
        "These developments indicated an increasing risk that inflation might become entrenched and that second-round effects and a wage-price spiral could emerge.",
        "A return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% target was deemed unlikely without further decisive monetary policy action.",
        "Such action would also underscore the Governing Council’s commitment to bringing inflation under control and keeping inflation expectations anchored.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that, although wage growth was accelerating, it could still be considered moderate and there were no indications of a wage-price spiral at present.",
        "Moreover, price pressures originating from international commodity markets had weakened recently, and the expected economic downturn, together with higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions, would dampen inflation in the medium term.",
        "Although the economic outlook had deteriorated considerably, it was widely judged that the expected weakening in economic activity would not suffice to curb inflation to a significant extent and would not in itself bring projected inflation back to the target.",
        "It was argued that, in the event of a shallow recession, the Governing Council should continue normalising and tightening monetary policy, whereas it might want to pause if there was a prolonged and deep recession, which would be likely to curb inflation to a larger extent.",
        "In this context, attention was also drawn to the divergence between monetary policy, which was removing accommodation, and fiscal policy, which was becoming more expansionary.",
        "It was reiterated that the Governing Council had to focus squarely on its primary objective and on bringing inflation back to target in a timely manner.",
        "Reference was made to the outcome of the ECB’s strategy review, which had underscored its commitment to act forcefully, using all available instruments, to address prolonged downward deviations from the target.",
        "The ECB now needed to show equal determination when inflation was above the target, countering far too high inflation and preventing it from becoming entrenched, irrespective of a deteriorating outlook for economic activity.",
        "Against this background, all members agreed that, in view of the current inflation outlook, it was appropriate to continue normalising monetary policy by withdrawing accommodation to ensure that demand was no longer sustained.",
        "While the Governing Council’s monetary policy actions were having the desired effect on financial and financing conditions, the current setting of the ECB’s key policy rates was judged to be still accommodative, which implied that they should be increased further.",
        "The view was widely shared that monetary policy normalisation had to continue in order to counter the risk of long-term inflation expectations becoming unanchored and of a possible wage-price spiral.",
        "Successive inflation figures above the projections, heightened uncertainty and the prevailing upside risks to the inflation outlook were seen as warranting further action.",
        "Turning to the size of the rate increase, Mr Lane’s proposal to raise the key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points was supported by a very large majority of members.",
        "A 75 basis point increase was judged to be an appropriate response in view of the protracted period of excessively high inflation and the risk that this might add to medium-term price pressures.",
        "It was recalled that the monetary policy stance was still accommodative and argued that a 75 basis point increase constituted a necessary step toward a more neutral level.",
        "It would also amount to a further frontloading of interest rate increases, allowing a neutral level to be reached swiftly.",
        "Moreover, it was noted that market participants were pricing in an increase of this size.",
        "It was argued that falling short of these market expectations would imply an unwelcome loosening impulse, potentially undermining confidence in the Governing Council’s commitment to price stability.",
        "The view was held that feeding uncertainty as regards the way the Governing Council would react to the inflation outlook could further increase the volatility of risk-free interest rates in the present environment.",
        "It was also argued that, when the persistence of high inflation was uncertain, optimal policy called for a forceful response to reduce the risk of inflation remaining high for too long.",
        "A few members expressed a preference for increasing the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points, taking into account that the rate hike would be accompanied by a signal on the need for further future rate hikes, by a change in the remuneration of minimum reserves, and by the adjustment of the terms and conditions of TLTRO III, all of which would imply some additional monetary policy tightening.",
        "While the direction of monetary policy was clear, prudence was necessary as regards the pace of the adjustment.",
        "A 50 basis point hike was deemed sufficient to adjust the monetary policy stance in a gradual and measured way given that market sentiment was fragile, the risk of a significant slowdown in economic activity was increasing and financing conditions had already tightened significantly since the start of the normalisation process.",
        "Moreover, it was argued that an overly aggressive pace of tightening could have repercussions for financial stability, economic activity and ultimately inflation.",
        "While it was widely felt that, with a 75 basis point increase, the Governing Council would make substantial progress in withdrawing monetary policy accommodation, it was also clear that rates would need to be raised further to reach a level that would deliver on the ECB’s 2% medium-term target, although decisions would need to be based on incoming data and the evolving outlook for inflation and the economy.",
        "Overall, in the light of prevailing uncertainties, there was broad support for a meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach to taking monetary policy decisions.",
        "A discussion took place on the use of concepts such as the “neutral rate” or the “terminal rate” consistent with inflation returning to target over the medium term, with different views expressed on the link between these measures and projection scenarios or on their steady state properties.",
        "At the same time, while the difficulty of relying on precise values of these rates was acknowledged, there was agreement that, looking ahead, the Governing Council needed to continue removing accommodation with further interest rate hikes.",
        "Moreover, the view was expressed that monetary tightening would probably need to continue after the monetary policy stance had been normalised and moved into broadly neutral territory.",
        "With respect to the December monetary policy meeting, it was noted that the Governing Council would have more information available, which was seen as especially valuable in the light of the high market volatility and uncertainty that characterised the current environment.",
        "Moreover, the December staff projections would provide more information over a horizon extending up to 2025, including an assessment of how the increased recession risks, the development of commodity prices and the tightening of financial conditions since the September meeting would affect the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Turning to the ECB’s outstanding lending operations, members unanimously agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to change the terms and conditions of TLTRO III.",
        "The adjustment was seen as an essential part of the ongoing monetary policy normalisation process and the recalibration of the Governing Council’s toolkit to ensure consistency across all monetary policy instruments.",
        "Moreover, it was in line with the Governing Council’s communication that it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returned to its medium-term target.",
        "Since the last recalibration of TLTRO III in December 2020 the inflation outlook had changed fundamentally, in part owing to the war against Ukraine, which had led to an energy crisis that could not have been foreseen at the time.",
        "Accordingly, the Governing Council had to recalibrate its monetary policy stance, including the terms and conditions of TLTRO III, in order to pursue its price stability mandate.",
        "In the light of the worsening inflation outlook and the still negative short-term real interest rates, monetary policy transmission had to be accelerated.",
        "The view was widely held that a change in the TLTRO III conditions would reinforce the transmission of changes in the policy rates to bank funding costs and bank lending conditions for households and firms, which to date did not fully reflect the intended monetary policy tightening.",
        "Moreover, it was argued that maintaining the average TLTRO III rate for the remaining lifetime of the operations at a rate below the deposit facility rate risked blurring the intended policy signal, which could call into question the Governing Council’s determination to bring inflation back to its medium-term target of 2% in a timely manner.",
        "It was noted that with the adjustment of the TLTRO III conditions banks would have the incentive and the opportunity for early repayment of their borrowing, which would also contribute to the normalisation of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet.",
        "Such a decrease in the size of the balance sheet was judged to be necessary and a helpful first step before considering a reduction of the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio.",
        "Finally, it was noted that a repayment of TLTRO III funds would reduce banks’ need for collateral, which could flow back to the market and thereby help to alleviate the collateral scarcity that had led to repo market tensions.",
        "Overall, members agreed that the monetary policy case for adjusting the TLTRO III conditions was strong and that the resulting effects could not be achieved through other measures, as indicated by Mr Lane in his proposal.",
        "Although side effects were acknowledged, these were seen not to outweigh the benefits from the TLTRO III adjustment, which was required in order to maintain the effectiveness of monetary policy and thereby the Governing Council’s ability to attain its medium-term inflation target in a timely manner.",
        "In consideration of all these arguments, the adjustment was therefore judged to be proportionate in the service of the Governing Council’s mandate.",
        "Members further agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to lower the remuneration of the minimum reserves held by euro area credit institutions with the Eurosystem, from the rate on the main refinancing operations to the deposit facility rate, in order to align it more closely with money market conditions.",
        "Members also agreed with the proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the PEPP portfolio.",
        "Retaining the existing flexibility in PEPP reinvestments was seen as a prudent approach to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic, which still persisted in the current market environment.",
        "Looking beyond the configuration of the key ECB interest rates, it was underlined that the Eurosystem’s large bond portfolios were continuing to provide further significant monetary policy accommodation by compressing term premia.",
        "Allowing the downward pressure on term premia to decline would facilitate more efficient setting of monetary policy, thereby helping to contain inflation.",
        "In this respect, it was seen as necessary, following an assessment of the repayments resulting from the adjustment of TLTRO III and their impact on financial conditions, to discuss the reinvestment strategy for the APP portfolio at the Governing Council’s December monetary policy meeting.",
        "Members widely concurred with Mr Lane that monetary policy should continue to be data-dependent and not follow a pre-set path, in accordance with a meeting-by-meeting approach to setting interest rates.",
        "To stress the Governing Council’s commitment to achieving its medium-term inflation target, it was seen as important to indicate that interest rates were expected to be raised further in order to guard against the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored.",
        "Forward guidance on interest rates was widely seen as being of little value in view of the high uncertainty currently prevailing.",
        "In the same vein, indicating the size of future interest rate adjustments was seen as implying renewed forward guidance on interest rates, which the Governing Council had deemed no longer warranted.",
        "The Governing Council stressed the importance of authorities addressing supply-side issues with appropriate structural and macroprudential policies, which would support monetary policy in ensuring price stability.",
        "Finally, it was seen as appropriate to reiterate that the Governing Council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returned to its medium-term target of 2%.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the latest financial market developments, noting that the narrative had shifted since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting in early June 2022.",
        "Weaker than expected incoming data on the global economy and concerns about disruptions to gas supplies, in combination with further higher than expected inflation outcomes, had turned investors’ focus towards a possible “stagflationary” scenario.",
        "In this environment, the volatility of short-term interest rate expectations stood at a historical high.",
        "The EUR/USD exchange rate remained under pressure.",
        "The sell-off of risk assets had continued as investors were still not attracted by cheaper valuations.",
        "Ms Schnabel then turned to the key drivers of the shift in investor sentiment from concerns about inflation to concerns about stagflation.",
        "Surprises in economic data releases had recently been negative across the global economy.",
        "In the United States, fears of a recession had, at least temporarily, weighed on natural gas prices, and on commodity prices more generally.",
        "By contrast, despite the waning growth momentum, gas prices had continued to increase in Europe owing to the domestic gas supply shock.",
        "Daily movements in expectations about short-term interest rates had been at historical highs lately, reflecting the uncertainty that investors were facing regarding the monetary policy implications of incoming information.",
        "Looking through this volatility, investors expected the ECB to speed up policy normalisation over the near term, relative to expectations at the time of the June 2022 Governing Council meeting, despite increasing risks of slowing growth momentum.",
        "Compared with June 2022, the overnight index swap (OIS) forward curve had steepened at the front end.",
        "Survey participants had now, by and large, converged to the market’s view regarding a swift tightening of the key ECB policy rates.",
        "Measures of inflation compensation led to three key observations.",
        "First, the very front end of the inflation-linked swap forward curve had increased notably since the June monetary policy meeting, reflecting in particular the supply-side-driven sharp increase in European gas prices.",
        "Second, medium-term inflation expectations had peaked around the Governing Council’s April meeting and had since gradually shifted lower, partly owing to a reappraisal of expectations about the Governing Council’s monetary policy intentions.",
        "Forward inflation swap rates were now converging towards 2% from above that level in 2024 and fluctuated around 2% over the following years.",
        "Third, despite the decline in inflation compensation, tail risks to inflation and the risk of an unanchoring of longer-term compensation had not moderated.",
        "The probability that markets assigned to high inflation outcomes of above 4% over a five-year horizon five years ahead had risen steadily since the start of the year.",
        "The probability currently stood at 15%, the highest level since 2013.",
        "According to the latest Survey of Professional Forecasters, longer-term inflation expectations had been revised upwards to stand on average at 2.2%.",
        "This was consistent with stickier long-term inflation compensation in markets.",
        "The repricing of inflation compensation had been the key factor driving the recent decline in nominal long-term sovereign bond yields.",
        "The ten-year real rate – i.e.",
        "adjusted for inflation – had increased further since the June monetary policy meeting.",
        "However, from a historical perspective, both short and long-term euro area real sovereign bond yields remained low.",
        "Against the background of the ECB’s monetary policy normalisation path embedded in market expectations, Ms Schnabel noted that a substantial tightening of financial conditions was ongoing in the euro area.",
        "However, unlike in some other major currency areas, the rate expectations embedded in financial market prices had yet to be validated by the ECB through actual decisions.",
        "The asset price affected most by the divergence between monetary policies across major currency areas was the euro exchange rate.",
        "Around half of the 10% depreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar since the start of the year could be attributed to the divergence in monetary policies.",
        "The ad hoc Governing Council meeting on 15 June 2022 might have contributed to mitigating further downward pressures on the euro exchange rate.",
        "As regards sovereign bond spreads, the initial orderly increase since the beginning of the year had accelerated after the June 2022 Governing Council meeting, as concerns about the extent of monetary policy tightening that would be required to restore price stability had intensified.",
        "The ECB’s announcement after the ad hoc Governing Council meeting that it would accelerate the completion of the design of a new anti-fragmentation instrument had halted or reversed adverse dynamics in some euro area sovereign bond markets.",
        "Market-based funding costs for banks had increased notably since the start of the year on the back of the rise in the risk-free rate and the broad-based increase in risk premia.",
        "Yet, in contrast to previous episodes of heightened volatility in sovereign bond markets, there had so far been no visible differentiation between banks across euro area jurisdictions.",
        "The same observation could be made for the market-based financing costs of non-financial corporations: in tandem with rates on other risk assets, corporate bond yields had surged over the past few months on the back of rising real yields and, lately, the deterioration in investor sentiment.",
        "Ms Schnabel then noted that the rise in real rates and the weakening in investor sentiment had also had an impact on equity prices.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s meeting in early June 2022, euro area stock markets had declined further, falling by around 7%, driven by an increase in the equity risk premium, higher discount rates and weakening longer-term earnings growth expectations, while near-term earnings forecasts had remained resilient.",
        "Mr Lane then went through the latest economic, monetary and financial developments in the global economy and the euro area.",
        "Starting with the global picture, compared with the level in December 2019, global trade was well above its pre-pandemic level, but there had been a decline in the first few months of this year and high-frequency data on global trade, available until mid-July, showed that this decline was accelerating.",
        "Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data for the manufacturing sector in the second quarter showed a sharp drop in output across advanced economies.",
        "The PMI for services showed a levelling-off in May and June, after the strong reading for April.",
        "Comparing the current level of the EUR/USD exchange rate with the level at the end of 2020, when it had reached a peak, there had been a sustained but fairly gentle depreciation of the euro.",
        "More recently the bilateral exchange rate had seen a more pronounced drop.",
        "Oil prices had declined since the June Governing Council meeting and the futures curve extended this decline until 2024, while the gas price had increased markedly.",
        "Other commodity prices had moderated.",
        "Turning to the euro area economy, various indicators for the manufacturing sector showed a sharp slowdown, with the PMI new export orders index falling below the 50 threshold in June.",
        "By contrast, services remained on an upward trend thanks to the reopening of the economy, although the latest data pointed to some moderation.",
        "Supply bottlenecks, as measured by the PMI indicator of suppliers’ delivery times, had seen a visible improvement, having halved compared with their worst level observed last autumn.",
        "However, this was largely due to a significant moderation in demand rather than a genuine improvement in supply.",
        "Alongside the deterioration in the short-term GDP outlook, the terms of trade shock continued to severely hit the real income and purchasing power of households.",
        "The goods trade balance had stabilised in May compared with April, which was partly due to the fact that energy consumption was moderating in Europe.",
        "However, compared with spending about 1% of GDP on energy imports at the start of 2021, the euro area was now spending about 4% of GDP.",
        "Turning to domestic demand, private consumption had moderated significantly since the end of last year.",
        "Consumers were buying fewer retail goods and were expecting to make fewer major purchases.",
        "At the same time, consumers were increasing their spending on services.",
        "For housing investment, concerns related to shortages of materials and labour had declined somewhat in recent months, reflecting lower than expected construction activity.",
        "However, concerns related to financing conditions had become more prominent and, overall, the outlook for the housing sector was for a cooling-down.",
        "Regarding business investment, capital goods production pointed to continued weakness.",
        "With regard to the labour market, the unemployment rate had declined in May to a record low of 6.6%.",
        "As labour force participation was recovering in the euro area, the improvement in the unemployment figure reflected job creation.",
        "However, the latest PMI data were indicating a loss of momentum.",
        "Changes in the sectoral composition of employment could help explain why the labour market remained strong, driven by the reopening of the recreation sector and other labour-intensive activities, which had seen a big drop during the pandemic.",
        "Turning to the latest inflation developments, inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had increased further in June, to stand at 8.6%.",
        "Energy inflation, which accounted for about 10% of the HICP basket, had contributed about half of the overall increase and had remained exceptionally high in June at around 42%.",
        "This reflected continued high increases in gas, oil and electricity commodity and wholesale prices.",
        "A second big contributor continued to be food, which accounted for about 20% of the HICP basket.",
        "Non-energy industrial goods prices had also continued to increase in June, with durable goods being strongly affected by supply bottlenecks and most recently by pipeline pressures – i.e.",
        "the pass-through of earlier increases in prices in the production chain.",
        "Services inflation had seen a small decline in June, which was due to the reduction in public transportation prices in Germany from 1 June to 31 August.",
        "Indicators of underlying inflation continued to rise.",
        "A new index constructed by ECB staff provided a measure of domestic inflation, by including prices of all items with a low import content.",
        "This measure was currently above 3%, at the bottom of the range of indicators for underlying inflation.",
        "The expectation that all the indicators of underlying inflation would revert to 2% was based on the assumption that the energy shock and supply bottlenecks would gradually disappear.",
        "The momentum in terms of the month-on-month change in underlying inflation indicators had been roughly stable.",
        "However, it was stable at a rate well above levels consistent with 2% inflation.",
        "The question remained as to whether this would be a temporary adjustment or more persistent.",
        "Turning to wages, negotiated wages had continued to grow at a modest rate over the last few months.",
        "The experimental ECB wage tracker, which included some of the largest euro area countries, indicated that the wage increases agreed in the first quarter of 2022 implied annual wage growth of around 3% this year, before falling back to around 2.5% next year.",
        "The most recent wage agreements signed in the second quarter showed a pick-up in wage growth to around 3.5% both this year and next year.",
        "This implied that new agreements were consistent with inflation remaining significantly higher for longer, but also that the wage adjustment was far from catching up 100% with inflation.",
        "Regarding profit margins, the latest ECB Corporate Telephone Survey gave a mixed picture between those firms able to increase margins and those with decreasing margins, reflecting differences in their capacity to pass on the large increases in input costs.",
        "The pass-through potential was higher for intermediate firms selling to other businesses than for those selling directly to consumers.",
        "With respect to inflation expectations, the latest Survey of Professional Forecasters indicated that the mean longer-term inflation forecast had risen slightly, while the mode, i.e.",
        "the most frequent answer given by participants, remained at 2%.",
        "There was still a part of the distribution of responses that was below 2%, but in the course of this year there had been an increase in the share of participants who thought inflation would remain above 2.5%, which now amounted to nearly 20% of the respondents.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation compensation were consistent with an acute episode of high inflation but implied a return to 2% around mid-2024.",
        "Turning to financial and monetary developments, Mr Lane first noted that the respondents in the July Survey of Monetary Analysts had shifted up and steepened the path for the expected deposit facility rate, relative to the survey round in June, and had changed their assessment of the stance at the end of the interest rate hiking cycle.",
        "Mr Lane also reported that banks had seen a big increase in the cost of market funding since the start of the year and their composite funding costs had been creeping up even without any increase in interest rates paid on bank deposits.",
        "Firms too had seen a marked increase in the cost of market-based financing and the costs of borrowing from banks had also edged up.",
        "Real borrowing rates, while remaining in negative territory, had also crept up in the period to May.",
        "The cost of bank borrowing for households for house purchase had continued to increase strongly, reflecting rising long-term market interest rates.",
        "When adjusting for inflation, real rates had also started to increase, while remaining in negative territory.",
        "The July 2022 bank lending survey showed that banks had considerably tightened their credit standards for both firms and households in the second quarter of 2022.",
        "Behind this tightening was a reduction in risk tolerance and an increase in risk perception, related to the deteriorating economic outlook.",
        "Bank lending to firms remained robust.",
        "Since the end of 2021 firms had been tapping the bond market to a lesser extent and instead had mainly been using bank financing.",
        "The July bank lending survey indicated that firms’ demand for bank loans was being driven by the need to finance working capital and inventories rather than new investment.",
        "Lending flows to households remained strong.",
        "However, the July bank lending survey indicated a drop in demand for housing loans in the second quarter and in the following months.",
        "Money growth had moderated significantly from its peak and its short-term dynamics were now below the long-term average.",
        "This reflected the fact that the ECB had stopped its net asset purchases, as well as lower firm deposits with banks.",
        "Regarding the role of the monetary policy transmission mechanism in a currency union, Mr Lane recalled that the smooth transmission of the single monetary policy across all euro area jurisdictions was a prerequisite to deliver on the ECB’s price stability mandate.",
        "He explained that in a decentralised currency union the smooth transmission of monetary policy did not mean that the level of borrowing costs had to be the same across all jurisdictions in the union.",
        "Differences in local financing conditions could legitimately arise owing to, among other things, country-specific economic factors.",
        "However, the monetary policy impulses that the Governing Council sent should be transmitted smoothly and not give rise to disproportionate reactions in some jurisdictions that were divorced from fundamental factors in those regions.",
        "A fundamentally unjustified reaction of local financing conditions to expected or actual changes in the monetary policy stance would induce distortions that would ultimately undermine the singleness of the ECB’s monetary policy and its ability to deliver on its Treaty mandate.",
        "In particular, a breakdown in the relation between sovereign yields and fundamentals, with bond markets becoming fragmented along national borders, might lead to excessive divergences in financing conditions across the euro area which, if left unchecked, could result in persistent impairments in the transmission mechanism.",
        "Episodes of acute and unwarranted divergences in financing conditions across countries could arise in response to a wide range of different shocks and in the face of inflation that was too low or too high.",
        "Mr Lane stressed that the ongoing normalisation of the ECB’s monetary policy stance could be a trigger for fragmentation in bond markets, with adverse consequences for all euro area countries.",
        "Volatility and upward shifts in the risk-free yield curve meant that the duration risk for private investors increased, which tested their capacity to hold different types of risk and put upward pressure on sovereign spreads in vulnerable jurisdictions.",
        "This could lead to a tightening of financing conditions in these countries – possibly over and above what was appropriate to address excess inflation.",
        "A symmetric distortion in the opposite direction could emerge in less vulnerable countries, where capital inflows originating from the vulnerable countries could compress yields below the levels necessary to stabilise inflation at the target over the medium term.",
        "In all these cases, a currency union was particularly susceptible to the risk that fragmentation events might degenerate into self-fulfilling debt crises.",
        "While there was typically a maximum level of interest rates at or below which national government debt was sustainable, the interest rates at which euro area countries could refinance debt could spiral upwards in a self-fulfilling manner to levels where debt dynamics became unstable and ultimately unsustainable.",
        "Such self-perpetuating mechanisms gave rise to multiple equilibria.",
        "In particular, even a fundamentally sound sovereign could be brought to the brink of default owing to a self-fulfilling dynamic involving market participants demanding higher risk premia based on a fear that the market might become illiquid.",
        "Announcing that the Governing Council was prepared to intervene in the bond market to lean against market movements not justified by fundamentals could therefore coordinate creditors’ expectations at a stable equilibrium in which a crisis was avoided.",
        "Mr Lane therefore proposed that the Governing Council should at the present meeting approve a new Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), as put forward by the Executive Board, to safeguard monetary policy transmission throughout the euro area and the singleness of monetary policy – a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its mandate.",
        "The TPI would be an addition to the ECB’s toolkit and could be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that posed a serious threat to the smooth transmission of monetary policy across the euro area.",
        "By safeguarding the transmission mechanism, the TPI would allow the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.",
        "Subject to fulfilling established criteria, the Eurosystem would be able to make secondary market purchases of securities issued in jurisdictions experiencing a deterioration in financing conditions not warranted by country-specific fundamentals.",
        "This would enable the Eurosystem to counter risks to the transmission mechanism to the extent necessary.",
        "The scale of TPI purchases would depend on the severity of the risks facing policy transmission.",
        "Purchases would not be restricted ex ante.",
        "The TPI was a monetary policy tool to address a wide variety of shocks that could lead to fragmentation and ultimately to transmission impairments.",
        "The TPI’s specific design features, as well as the safeguards for complying with the monetary financing prohibition and the principle of proportionality, would be decided on by the Governing Council in the light of the specific shocks that needed to be addressed in any given situation.",
        "At present the TPI was necessary – and specifically designed – to minimise threats to transmission arising from the normalisation of interest rates that was appropriate in the current environment of high inflation and significant upside risks, to ensure that inflation stabilised at the ECB’s target over the medium term.",
        "There were two elements to the effectiveness of the TPI.",
        "First, its announcement should act as a stabilising force.",
        "Second, if considered necessary by the Governing Council, its activation at any point in time would allow an active response to an emerging threat to the transmission mechanism.",
        "To assess whether announcing the TPI at the present meeting was proportionate, three conditions should be met: first, the new tool needed to be effective in pursuing the intermediate objective of protecting the transmission mechanism as a precondition for attaining the ECB’s primary objective; second, it should be efficient in the sense that its intermediate objective could not be achieved with an alternative measure having less intrusive effects on other areas of economic life; and, third, the new tool should be cost-efficient, that is, its benefits in achieving the protection of the transmission mechanism should outweigh its potentially adverse side effects, including any conflict with the maintenance of the monetary policy stance appropriate to achieving the primary objective and any risks that the new tool might unduly interfere with economic policy.",
        "In making this assessment, the Governing Council relied on a thorough exercise that had been carried out by Eurosystem committees and ECB staff over the past few months.",
        "The outcome of that exercise demonstrated that, first, in its current design, the TPI was an effective instrument particularly suited to accompanying the announcement of further normalisation steps, as it could prevent impairments in transmission.",
        "Second, the announcement of the TPI, which did not imply its immediate activation, was an efficient way to preserve the smooth transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy stance to an extent that could not be achieved with other instruments available to the Eurosystem, given their specific design features and purpose.",
        "Third, potential side effects as a result of a TPI announcement did not outweigh the benefits of announcing the instrument to mitigate the risk of fragmentation during the normalisation and tightening of monetary policy in the current highly uncertain economic and geopolitical environment.",
        "This was particularly true in view of the specific design features and safeguards of the TPI, which also ensured that any potential interference with the monetary policy stance and other policies would be avoided.",
        "This included the fact that, being designed to enable a normalisation of the policy rates in view of the current high level of inflation, the TPI would also mitigate the risk of a weakening of the impetus for sound fiscal policies in the euro area.",
        "In accordance with the governance of the TPI, the Governing Council would only activate it after assessing that tangible risks to policy transmission existed at the time of activation; that adequate safeguards were in place at that time to ensure that the obligations and principles contained in EU law were respected; and after conducting a comprehensive proportionality assessment to establish that activation was proportionate to the price stability mandate of the ECB.",
        "TPI purchases would be terminated either to reflect a durable improvement in transmission or based on an assessment that persistent tensions were due to country fundamentals.",
        "Summing up the assessment of the economy and the outlook for price stability, Mr Lane remarked that economic activity was slowing but was still benefiting from the reopening of the economy.",
        "Risks to the growth outlook remained tilted to the downside.",
        "Russia’s war in Ukraine remained a source of significant downside risk, especially if energy supplies from Russia were to be disrupted to such an extent that it led to rationing for euro area firms and households.",
        "The war could also further dampen confidence and aggravate supply-side constraints, while energy and food prices could remain persistently higher than expected.",
        "A faster deceleration in global growth would also pose a risk to the euro area outlook.",
        "Purely mechanical updates of the June projections saw high downside risks to GDP growth in the third quarter.",
        "Inflation had increased further, from 8.1% in May to 8.6% in June.",
        "Overall, inflationary pressures had broadened and intensified, as signalled by an increase in a range of indicators of underlying inflation.",
        "Inflation was expected to remain undesirably high for some time, owing to continued pressures from energy and food prices and pipeline pressures in the pricing chain.",
        "The depreciation of the euro was also a source of higher inflation.",
        "Looking further ahead, in the absence of new disruptions, energy costs were expected to stabilise and supply bottlenecks to ease.",
        "Together with the ongoing policy normalisation, this should support the return of inflation to the ECB’s target.",
        "Developments in measures of inflation expectations were mixed.",
        "While there had been limited upward revisions in survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, these remained close to 2%.",
        "By contrast, market-based measures of inflation compensation had eased appreciably of late: forward inflation-linked swap rates had already priced in a return of inflation to 2% from above that level over the course of 2024.",
        "Overall, most measures of longer-term inflation expectations stood at around 2%, although recent above-target revisions to some indicators warranted continued monitoring.",
        "The risks to the inflation outlook continued to be on the upside and had intensified, particularly in the short term.",
        "The risks to the medium-term inflation outlook included a durable worsening of the production capacity of the euro area economy, persistently high energy and food prices, inflation expectations rising above target and higher than anticipated wage rises.",
        "However, if demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would ease pressures on prices.",
        "Market interest rates had been exceptionally volatile as a result of the pronounced economic and geopolitical uncertainty.",
        "In addition, the dispersion across sovereign bond yields had remained elevated and global risk asset markets had recorded further declines.",
        "Bank funding costs had risen in the past few months, which had increasingly fed into higher bank lending rates, in particular for households.",
        "While the volume of bank lending to households remained strong, it was expected to decline in view of lower demand.",
        "Lending to firms had also been robust as high production costs, inventory building and lower reliance on market funding created a continued need for credit from banks.",
        "At the same time, the demand for loans to finance investment had declined.",
        "On balance, financial conditions in the euro area had tightened.",
        "Against this backdrop, Mr Lane proposed to progress further along the path of policy normalisation to make sure that inflation returned to the 2% target over the medium term.",
        "In addition to the approval of the TPI, he proposed raising the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points.",
        "While this increment was larger than the step that had been signalled at the June meeting, a bigger first step in the ECB’s policy rate normalisation path was appropriate.",
        "This was based on the updated assessment of inflation risks and taking into account the reinforced support that would be provided by the TPI for the effective transmission of monetary policy.",
        "An increment of this magnitude would support the return of inflation to the ECB’s medium-term target by strengthening the anchoring of inflation expectations and by ensuring that demand conditions adjusted to deliver the ECB’s inflation target in the medium term.",
        "Mr Lane remarked that further normalisation of interest rates would be appropriate at forthcoming meetings.",
        "The frontloading of the exit from negative interest rates at the current meeting would allow the Governing Council to make a transition to a meeting-by-meeting approach to interest rate decisions.",
        "The future policy path would be data-dependent and guided by the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation target of 2%.",
        "In the context of the policy normalisation, the Governing Council should evaluate options for remunerating excess liquidity holdings at one of its forthcoming meetings.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks to the outlook provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Inflation continued to be undesirably high and was expected to remain above target for some time.",
        "The latest data indicated a slowdown in economic growth, clouding the outlook for the second half of 2022 and beyond.",
        "At the same time, while risks to growth were on the downside – related in particular to the uncertainty about the consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine – the slowdown was being cushioned by a number of supportive factors.",
        "Risks to the inflation outlook were on the upside and had intensified, especially for the short term.",
        "They were also spreading more broadly.",
        "As regards the external environment, the slowdown in global trade observed in the first quarter of 2022 was worsening, reflecting developments in both advanced and emerging market economies.",
        "Concerns were expressed about a deteriorating outlook for the United States and the United Kingdom.",
        "It was also observed that China would probably not be able to play its past role as the engine of global growth, as its economy was slowing down.",
        "Members widely noted that the depreciation of the euro constituted an important change in the external environment and implied greater inflationary pressures for the euro area, in particular through higher costs of energy imports invoiced in US dollars.",
        "The point was made that the improvements in competitiveness and support for growth that would normally be associated with a depreciation were being impeded by the prevailing global supply constraints and logistics restrictions.",
        "At the same time, it was suggested that most of the depreciation against the US dollar was due to divergent monetary policies, which partly reflected the differences in the outlook for the two economies.",
        "It was argued that, if the present risks of recession in the US economy were to materialise, the euro would be expected to appreciate.",
        "However, a countervailing – and probably dominant – effect could result from worsening global risk sentiment, which typically implied a strengthening of the US dollar.",
        "Turning to euro area developments, economic activity was slowing and Russia’s war in Ukraine was an ongoing drag on growth.",
        "The adverse impact of high inflation on purchasing power and demand, continuous supply constraints and higher uncertainty were having a dampening effect on the economy.",
        "Firms continued to face higher costs and disruptions in their supply chains, although there were tentative signs that some of the supply bottlenecks were easing.",
        "Taken together, these factors were significantly clouding the outlook for the second half of 2022 and beyond.",
        "At the same time, economic activity continued to benefit from the reopening of the economy, a strong labour market and fiscal policy support.",
        "For instance, as people started to travel again, tourism was expected to help the economy in the coming months.",
        "Consumption was being supported by the savings that households had built up during the pandemic and by a strong labour market, where unemployment had fallen to a historical low of 6.6% in May and job vacancies across many sectors showed that there was robust demand for labour.",
        "In their discussion, members noted that there were increasing signs of a downturn in euro area economic activity that could extend into 2023.",
        "PMI survey data for output in manufacturing and services pointed to a loss of momentum.",
        "In the case of manufacturing, the indicator had dropped to contractionary territory for the first time since mid-2020.",
        "Survey data on new orders and business expectations suggested that this weakening would continue in the coming months.",
        "Moreover, consumer confidence had declined to an all-time low.",
        "Inflation was eroding real wealth and savings, as well as real incomes, and the decline in equity prices pointed to negative effects on capital expenditure.",
        "Against this background, caution was warranted regarding the prospects for consumption and investment demand.",
        "At the same time, it was reiterated that the euro area economy had demonstrated considerable strength and resilience in the face of multiple crises, notably with regard to the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.",
        "Additionally, there were no indications of a major recession in the euro area so far.",
        "In this context, a good understanding of the current resilience of labour market dynamics was needed.",
        "Members broadly agreed that the risks to economic activity were on the downside.",
        "A prolongation of the war in Ukraine remained a source of significant downside risk to growth, especially if energy supplies from Russia were disrupted to such an extent that it led to rationing for firms and households.",
        "Indeed, the possibility of Russian gas supply shortages increased the probability of a recession.",
        "More generally, the war might further dampen confidence and aggravate supply-side constraints, while a faster deceleration in global growth would also pose a risk to the euro area outlook.",
        "The risk of a renewed pandemic wave was seen as still looming, with infection rates remaining high despite favourable weather conditions.",
        "Overall, it was acknowledged that developments in energy markets warranted close attention, but it was also stressed that the baseline scenarios of the June staff projections and the European Commission forecasts just published did not foresee a recession.",
        "Members agreed that fiscal policy was helping to cushion the impact of the war in Ukraine for those bearing the brunt of higher energy prices.",
        "Temporary and targeted measures should be tailored so as to limit the risk of fuelling inflationary pressures.",
        "Fiscal policies in all countries should aim at preserving debt sustainability, as well as raising the growth potential in a sustainable manner to enhance the recovery.",
        "It was noted that the dispersion of inflation rates across euro area countries and the role played in this by energy and gas prices required a response that could not be provided by monetary policy alone but needed to be addressed by other policy areas.",
        "However, a warning was given that such calls should not be interpreted as recommending continued and untargeted fiscal stimulus.",
        "On price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Inflation had increased further to 8.6% in June, and surging energy prices had again been the most important component of overall inflation.",
        "Price pressures were spreading across more and more sectors, in part owing to the indirect impact of high energy costs across the whole economy.",
        "Accordingly, most measures of underlying inflation had risen further.",
        "Inflation was expected to remain undesirably high for some time, owing to continued pressures from energy and food prices and pipeline pressures in the pricing chain.",
        "Higher inflationary pressures also stemmed from the depreciation of the euro exchange rate.",
        "Looking further ahead, in the absence of new disruptions, energy costs should stabilise and supply bottlenecks should ease, which, together with the ongoing policy normalisation, should support the return of inflation to the Governing Council’s target.",
        "It was underlined that the latest inflation developments implied a clear materialisation of upside risks since the previous meeting of the Governing Council.",
        "Once more, June had seen an inflation surprise, confirming the underestimation bias observed in the recent past when outturns were compared with earlier projections.",
        "Not only had the inflation rate recorded in June increased to well above the projections, but also seasonally adjusted month-on-month rates pointed to continued strong momentum in almost all inflation components.",
        "It was also observed that the upward movement of inflation had taken place despite the dampening effect of temporary measures introduced to cope with high energy prices.",
        "Actual inflationary pressures were thus even greater than suggested by official readings and, to some extent, reflected government measures.",
        "Against this background, it was argued that upside risks were clearly dominant in the short term.",
        "These upside risks were evident when updating the short-term projections by taking explicit account of the recent stronger month-on-month dynamics, the elevated level of oil refining margins, the stronger link between electricity prices and oil and gas futures, and the apparent faster pass-through of energy and producer prices to consumer prices.",
        "However, it was noted that such an updated short-term outlook could not easily be converted into an updated medium-term outlook.",
        "A key issue in the outlook for 2023 was the extent to which further inflation pressures were still to be observed, as, in the absence of further shocks, the large contribution of energy and food to the rise in inflation should otherwise diminish mechanically.",
        "Moreover, it remained to be seen by how much indirect effects would contribute to a further rise in core inflation over time.",
        "In considering the possible persistence of inflationary pressures in the medium term, it was recalled that HICP projections did not as yet fully include costs for owner-occupied housing, while the latest data pointed to quite persistent upward pressures on housing costs despite recent increases in mortgage interest rates.",
        "It was also argued that upward shifts in medium-term inflation could emerge from structural changes to the economy.",
        "Examples were a possible partial reversal of globalisation and the green transition.",
        "Over the usual projection horizon, it was seen as important to assess whether potential second-round effects or a weak anchoring of expectations would imply higher inflation over the medium term or whether current price pressures were simply one-off inflation bursts owing to the war and would stop once the adjustment was complete.",
        "The expected retreat of inflation from its anticipated peak later this year was seen to be predicated on two main factors: first, base effects, and second, a process of convergence with the target in line with Phillips curve predictions.",
        "However, it was cautioned that this type of prediction had disappointed more than once in the past.",
        "It was thus seen as questionable to keep shifting the short-term outlook upwards while keeping the end point unchanged, as the short-run situation would have an impact on persistence and thus propagate inflation tendencies into the medium term.",
        "In this respect, there might be more persistence in the inflation process than embedded in models where parameters were maintained at the values that had been estimated in a low-inflation environment, even though such values were likely to be changing as inflation moved higher.",
        "In addition, more persistent price pressures could emerge if the strong supply constraints implied that potential output was lower than initially thought.",
        "Such negative effects were all the more likely if there should be a failure to bring more people into the labour market.",
        "Members agreed that the persistence of inflation depended, to a large extent, on the behaviour of wages.",
        "Wage growth, also according to forward-looking indicators, had continued to increase gradually over the last few months but still remained contained overall.",
        "Over time, the strengthening of the economy and some catch-up effects were likely to support faster growth in wages.",
        "It was recalled that steady-state inflation of 2% was consistent with wages growing at 3% per year given typical productivity growth.",
        "Reference was made to indications from the ECB’s Corporate Telephone Survey, in which three-quarters of the respondents expected higher wage growth in 2023 than in 2022, pointing to an elevated risk of second-round effects.",
        "Reference was also made to the forward-looking wage tracker, which suggested a pick-up in wage growth and thus pointed to possible greater persistence of inflation.",
        "Overall, it was maintained that there was no evidence of significant second-round effects as yet, but the repeated upward surprises as regards inflation and indications that inflation had become more persistent had increased the probability of such effects.",
        "In this context, reference was made to the Annual Economic Report 2022 from the Bank for International Settlements, which had concluded that transitions from low to high inflation regimes tended to be self-reinforcing, mainly owing to the occurrence of wage-price spirals.",
        "While members pointed out that wage formation in the euro area was built on overlapping multi-year wage agreements, this was also seen as implying that there could be long delays in higher inflation being reflected in the negotiation process.",
        "The catch-up of nominal wages in response to the current erosion of real wages might thus still take place.",
        "The risk was that, once wages started moving, they would keep increasing over the medium term, particularly in view of the higher persistence of inflation than observed in other major currency areas.",
        "It was argued that, thus far, the costs of the terms of trade shock had been borne essentially by workers.",
        "A rebalancing of the distribution of the implied “tax” between workers and employers would take some time, in part depending on productivity developments, bargaining power and the ability of firms to maintain profit margins.",
        "It was argued that there was a need to closely monitor wage developments, as these could transform price-level effects into presistent inflation.",
        "However, it was also remarked that a rebalancing between profits and wages would not necessarily represent the start of a wage-price spiral.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that the current high rates of inflation could trigger increased wage indexation and then change the structural features of wage formation.",
        "This could reverse the earlier wage growth trend that had taken hold in a low-inflation environment.",
        "The current situation raised the question of why the apparent tightness of the labour market had not led to higher wage growth thus far.",
        "One explanation put forward was that workers were still hesitant to ask for higher wages, even though stronger pricing power for firms should have increased the scope for granting higher wages.",
        "This was corroborated by evidence from the Corporate Telephone Survey, with firms reporting both labour shortages and an easier pass-through of costs into higher selling prices.",
        "In this context, it was also pointed out that there was evidence of a higher frequency of repricing in the face of the current significant cost-push shocks.",
        "With regard to longer-term inflation expectations, most measures were currently standing at around 2% and were thus still in line with the medium-term target.",
        "However, recent above-target revisions to some indicators warranted continued monitoring.",
        "Survey-based measures had edged up.",
        "In the case of the Survey of Professional Forecasters, longer-term expectations had risen to a new historical high of 2.2%.",
        "The median stood at 2%, but the increasing number of survey respondents at the upper end of the distribution of expectations was seen as an early warning sign of further shifts in the mean.",
        "The point was made that expectations had proven relatively slow to adjust upwards after many years of below-target inflation.",
        "If the same was now true in the opposite direction, it would be very difficult to re-anchor expectations once these had moved away from the target.",
        "Reference was also made to the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey and the renewed upshift in inflation expectations three years ahead, after a temporary drop following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.",
        "Such upward shifts might reflect “experience effects”, which could be very long-lived and hard to reverse.",
        "The view was expressed that the latest survey data suggested a greater threat to anchoring than was apparent from financial market-based measures of inflation expectations.",
        "It was remarked that market-based measures of inflation compensation mattered for monetary policy because financial markets transmitted interest rate changes.",
        "So far no extreme movements had been observed in these measures, despite heightened volatility.",
        "The measures had actually declined since mid-June, with market participants expecting higher interest rates and lower economic growth.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that their return to just above 2% – a level last seen in January – suggested that expectations were well anchored.",
        "This was seen to corroborate the notion that the current high inflation was being driven mainly by supply factors and not by expectations.",
        "On the other hand, the question was raised as to whether this could be seen as a stable anchoring when these expectations had first risen substantially to almost 2.5% and then fallen again by the same amount.",
        "This cautioned against drawing too much comfort from market-based measures and models that used them as inputs.",
        "Against this background, members assessed that the risks to the inflation outlook continued to be on the upside and had intensified, particularly in the short term.",
        "The risks to the medium-term inflation outlook included a durable worsening of the production capacity of the euro area economy, persistently high energy and food prices, inflation expectations rising above the Governing Council’s target and higher than anticipated wage rises.",
        "However, if demand were to weaken over the medium term in the wake of an economic slowdown, it would lower pressures on prices.",
        "Risks to the medium-term inflation outlook were seen to be clearly tilted to the upside.",
        "It was argued that even a recession would not necessarily diminish upside risks, especially if it was related to a gas cut-off or another supply shock implying a further increase in inflation.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that this scenario of low growth but high and persistent inflation owing to supply shocks could be contrasted with a scenario where low growth would itself take care of high inflation.",
        "This appeared to be the current view of the markets, which were reflecting a combination of lower growth expectations and lower inflation expectations.",
        "In this respect the behaviour of the unions in response to a recession was seen as crucial.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Bank funding costs had risen in recent months, which had increasingly fed into higher bank lending rates, in particular for households.",
        "It was remarked, however, that the increase in bank funding costs had remained contained – probably owing to the fact that banks were generally not yet paying interest on customer deposits and continued to have access to favourable Eurosystem funding, including from the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs).",
        "Moreover, the transmission of higher funding costs to lending rates was incomplete in some countries – perhaps owing to strong competition among banks or typical lags in the transmission.",
        "However, bank lending rates might start to increase more strongly in the coming quarters.",
        "While the volume of bank lending to households remained strong, it could be expected to decline in view of lower demand for loans.",
        "Lending to firms had been robust as high production costs, inventory building and lower reliance on market funding had created a continued need for credit from banks.",
        "At the same time, demand for loans to finance investment had declined.",
        "Money growth had continued to moderate owing to lower liquid savings and lower Eurosystem asset purchases.",
        "The most recent bank lending survey had reported that credit standards had tightened for all loan categories in the second quarter of the year, as banks were becoming more concerned about the risks faced by their customers in the current uncertain environment.",
        "Overall, despite the increase in the cost of borrowing and a decline in equity prices, monetary and financial conditions were assessed as having remained favourable, also taking into account the contribution from the exchange rate.",
        "Real interest rates for short maturities had declined since the June Governing Council meeting, as expected inflation had been revised upwards, while for longer maturities real rates had increased somewhat.",
        "Market interest rates had been volatile as a result of the pronounced economic and geopolitical uncertainty.",
        "It was remarked that market expectations for the terminal rate in the interest rate hiking cycle had also displayed significant volatility, increasing until mid-June on the back of higher interest rate expectations and decreasing thereafter when perceived recession risks rose.",
        "Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members agreed that it was appropriate to take further steps on the path of monetary policy normalisation.",
        "In recent months inflation had repeatedly been higher than expected, and some of the upside risks that the Governing Council had anticipated in June had materialised, while further increases in energy prices were dampening the economic growth outlook.",
        "Medium-term risks had also increased.",
        "It was recalled that monetary policy was not able to provide effective support when the economy was hit by a series of supply shocks.",
        "As witnessed during the pandemic, governments were better able to provide support to households and firms, leaving monetary policy to focus on inflation developments and take the necessary action in line with the ECB’s mandate.",
        "Inflationary pressures were judged to have intensified since the Governing Council’s June meeting, especially in the short term.",
        "It was highlighted that persistently high inflation posed an increasing risk of longer-term inflation expectations becoming unanchored, even though both market-based measures of inflation compensation and survey-based longer-term inflation expectations were still broadly in line with the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation target.",
        "It was cautioned that a continued anchoring of inflation expectations was dependent on the Governing Council acting decisively on the worsening inflation outlook.",
        "Against this background it was seen as appropriate to reaffirm the Governing Council’s determination to bring inflation back to its 2% target over the medium term, particularly in view of the fact that an instrument was being established to prevent unwarranted, disorderly reactions in financial markets to the ongoing normalisation of monetary policy and to safeguard a smooth monetary policy transmission throughout the euro area.",
        "Members first discussed Mr Lane’s proposal to approve the TPI, as put forward by the Executive Board.",
        "Members highlighted the importance of the measure, which was seen as a decisive step to ensure the smooth transmission of the monetary policy stance and enable the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.",
        "The TPI would strengthen the Governing Council’s toolkit when fragmentation threatened the transmission of monetary policy, and would complement reinvestment flexibility under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme.",
        "Confidence was expressed that the TPI, with clear eligibility criteria, a well-structured process for its activation and conditions for an exit from its use, would support the stabilising potential of the toolkit and allow an effective response in the event of unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics.",
        "In this vein, the TPI would complement the other instruments available to address fragmentation by helping to support a smooth transmission of monetary policy across all the euro area countries while the stance was being normalised.",
        "It was argued that a detailed monetary policy case for the TPI and a clear framework for its activation were essential.",
        "The TPI was deemed an important way to increase the resilience of Economic and Monetary Union, which – due to decentralised fiscal policy and the lack of a fully-fledged capital markets and banking union – was still incomplete and exposed to asymmetric shocks.",
        "This incompleteness would only disappear with fundamental changes to the euro area’s architecture.",
        "In this context, monetary policy had to play its role, within the ECB’s mandate, in addressing fragmentation to the extent that it impeded a smooth transmission of the monetary policy stance, a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate.",
        "Fragmentation risks were considered to be more likely in the current environment, in which monetary policy was being normalised at a time of large supply-side shocks and increasing risks to economic growth.",
        "While the ECB was taking action to preserve the efficiency of monetary policy, it was suggested that European governments should, within their own domain of responsibility, advance institutional reforms in order to better address the underlying sources of fragmentation in the euro area.",
        "The design of the TPI was considered to be proportionate and to contain sufficient safeguards and conditions to ensure that the Governing Council acted within its mandate.",
        "It was recalled that the European Court of Justice had confirmed in its case law that, in exercising its competence in monetary policy in the pursuit of price stability, the Governing Council had broad discretion but had to carry out a thorough proportionality assessment of any new initiative.",
        "The comprehensive work on the TPI carried out over the past three months by the Eurosystem committees and ECB staff clearly documented the fact that the Governing Council was basing its decisions on a thorough analysis along the three dimensions of the proportionality assessment: effectiveness, efficiency and limited side effects.",
        "That analysis led to the conclusion that the instrument incorporated sufficient eligibility criteria and activation conditions, and a number of additional safeguards.",
        "This made the new instrument a proportionate response to the challenge posed by fragmentation to an effective and efficient conduct of monetary policy.",
        "It was also highlighted that the TPI was designed in such a way as to avoid weakening incentives for governments to pursue sound economic policies, particularly in the fiscal domain.",
        "While it was remarked that the success of the TPI ultimately required sufficient commitment by governments to maintain the impetus for sound fiscal and economic policies, it was viewed as essential that the Governing Council underlined its readiness to use the TPI to the extent necessary to address risks to transmission and as appropriate under the stated conditions.",
        "Moreover, it was recalled that more persistent and fundamental problems were to be addressed by the OMT programme and that, while monetary policy was able to react to self-fulfilling liquidity crises, solvency problems had to be tackled by other actors.",
        "In this respect it was pointed out that, when assessing the sustainability of public debt, the Governing Council would take into account, where available, the debt sustainability analyses by the European Commission, the European Stability Mechanism, the IMF and other institutions, together with the ECB’s internal analysis, without establishing a hierarchy between the analyses of the different institutions.",
        "Importantly, however, it was stressed that the Governing Council would undertake this assessment with full discretion.",
        "In the light of the foregoing discussion, members unanimously supported the TPI as proposed by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The unity and the team spirit in the discussion among the members of the Governing Council were widely praised, and the Eurosystem committees and staff at the ECB and national central banks were thanked for their efficient collaboration during the preparatory phase.",
        "A unanimous decision by the Governing Council with forceful and convincing communication was seen to lend strong credibility to the TPI.",
        "Turning to the consideration of the current monetary policy stance, a very large number of members agreed that it was appropriate to raise the ECB’s key interest rates by 50 basis points as proposed by Mr Lane.",
        "A 50 basis point hike was seen as warranted in view of the worsening of the inflation outlook since the Governing Council’s June meeting.",
        "The Governing Council thereby took a larger first step on its policy rate normalisation path than signalled at its previous meeting, applying the stated principles of data-dependence and optionality.",
        "This was seen as providing a clear signal of its determination to act and to fulfil its mandate.",
        "Some members argued in favour of raising the ECB key interest rates by 25 basis points as this was the intended move communicated at the Governing Council’s June meeting and would preserve consistency with the Governing Council’s earlier communication.",
        "With recession risks looming, an increase of 25 basis points was seen as more in line with a gradual monetary policy normalisation.",
        "It was also perceived as compatible with inflation returning to the Governing Council’s 2% target over the medium term once transitory shocks had faded.",
        "Moreover, the concern was raised that, if the Governing Council deviated from its earlier guidance and surprised markets with a larger than expected increase, this would add to the prevailing market uncertainties.",
        "These considerations notwithstanding, it was maintained that the Governing Council had to demonstrate that it was willing and able to respond if the outlook changed.",
        "It was also argued that, despite constituting a larger than expected increase, a 50 basis point interest rate hike provided more clarity for market participants in a highly uncertain environment.",
        "Moreover, it was judged that the monetary policy stance remained accommodative even after a 50 basis point rise.",
        "Members widely held the view that the TPI provided reinforced support for the effective transmission of monetary policy, thereby helping the Governing Council to proceed more decisively with the normalisation of monetary policy than envisaged at the June meeting.",
        "While the TPI was judged as allowing the Governing Council to address unwarranted, disorderly financial market developments more effectively, it was also perceived as necessary to enable the Governing Council to act more decisively to maintain price stability.",
        "It was underlined that a decision to raise interest rates by 50 basis points at the present meeting should be regarded as frontloading the exit from negative rates and as part of the interest rate adjustment necessary to normalise monetary policy, rather than indicating a change in the rate to be expected as the end-point of the normalisation cycle.",
        "Indeed, the Governing Council was not changing its assessment regarding the terminal rate in the hiking cycle, which could only be determined more precisely when interest rates were approaching it more closely.",
        "A 50 basis point hike would take the deposit facility rate to zero, ending the period of negative interest rates, which were clearly no longer warranted in view of longer-term inflation expectations standing at or above 2% and the current high inflation numbers.",
        "Furthermore, it was argued that frontloading a 50 basis point increase in July would allow the Governing Council more flexibility in reacting to incoming data and proceeding with monetary policy normalisation at its future meetings.",
        "Looking at the September meeting and further ahead, broad support was expressed for Mr Lane’s proposal to transition to a meeting-by-meeting approach to interest rate decisions.",
        "While providing forward guidance on interest rates was a powerful instrument in times when interest rates were close to the effective lower bound, its usefulness was judged as being significantly diminished in the normalisation phase.",
        "In the current circumstances with exceptionally high uncertainty, specific forward guidance on the future interest rate path was seen as excessively constraining the Governing Council’s optionality, flexibility and data-dependence, with the risk that the Governing Council would tie itself to decisions that it needed to reverse later when circumstances changed.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to the continued forward guidance on the evolution of the Eurosystem balance sheet.",
        "Different views were expressed as to the need for and the interpretation of the notion of gradualism and how to reconcile it with the need for data-dependence and optionality.",
        "On the one hand, it was stressed that in an uncertain environment in which incoming data pointed to increasing risks to price stability, optionality should take precedence over gradualism.",
        "On the other hand, it was maintained that gradualism should be interpreted as proceeding step by step with the policy normalisation and not jumping immediately to an end-point rate that was highly uncertain under current conditions.",
        "In that sense, a 50 basis point increase was regarded as gradual and compatible with the principles of flexibility, optionality and data-dependence, which would continue to govern the normalisation path.",
        "Members agreed that flexibility in reinvestments of redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio remained the first line of defence to counter risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.",
        "In the discussion it was questioned whether the narrowing of spreads observed since mid-June could be attributed to the activation of flexible PEPP reinvestments or whether it was linked to other factors, such as the expectation that the Governing Council would create a new tool to fight fragmentation and whether the activation of PEPP flexibility in June had been necessary.",
        "Against this background, members expressed readiness to join a consensus on raising the ECB’s three key interest rates by 50 basis points.",
        "Communication had to acknowledge that upside risks to the inflation outlook had intensified, especially in the short term.",
        "It was also emphasised that the Governing Council’s decision was based on an updated assessment of the risks to the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "The decision had to be seen as a further step in an ongoing normalisation process that had started in December last year with the phasing-out of the unconventional monetary policy measures.",
        "It was seen as important to stress that the 50 basis point hike did not consitute an upward shift in the interest rate path but rather a frontloading of the policy normalisation.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, and after having ascertained that there were no further comments, on a proposal by the President, the Governing Council approved the TPI with the broad conditions and safeguards set out in the dedicated press release.",
        "The Governing Council also decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points.",
        "Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would be increased to 0.50%, 0.75% and 0.00% respectively, with effect from 27 July 2022.",
        "At the Governing Council’s upcoming meetings, further normalisation of interest rates would be appropriate.",
        "The frontloading of the exit from negative interest rates allowed the Governing Council to make a transition to a meeting-by-meeting approach to interest rate decisions.",
        "The Governing Council’s future policy rate path would continue to be data-dependent and would help to deliver on its 2% inflation target over the medium term.",
        "The Governing Council intended to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme (APP) for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "As concerns the PEPP, the Governing Council intended to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024.",
        "In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio would be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "Redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio were being reinvested flexibly, with a view to countering risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.",
        "The Governing Council would continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) did not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy.",
        "The Governing Council would also regularly assess how targeted lending operations were contributing to its monetary policy stance.",
        "The Governing Council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation stabilised at its 2% target over the medium term.",
        "The Governing Council’s new TPI would safeguard the smooth transmission of its monetary policy stance throughout the euro area.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel started by noting that the narrative in financial markets had shifted since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting in July.",
        "Initially, fears of a recession had dominated global asset prices and financial conditions had eased on the expectation that the pace of interest rate increases by central banks around the world would slow down, as a recession was perceived to do part of the job of bringing inflation back to the target level.",
        "However, more recently the focus of investors had gradually shifted back towards a tighter monetary policy stance as inflation outcomes had continued to be higher than expected.",
        "In this environment, there had been four key observations.",
        "First, volatility in interest rate markets remained at historically high levels, reflecting very high uncertainty regarding inflation, as well as heightened data dependence of monetary policy.",
        "Second, monetary policy normalisation in the euro area was now expected to proceed at a significantly faster pace than had been expected at the time of the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "Third, the summer rally in risk assets had been halted and partly reversed by investors’ reappraisal of the future path of monetary policy.",
        "Finally, the sensitivity of euro area sovereign bond yield spreads to policy rate expectations remained notably weaker than before the Governing Council’s ad hoc meeting on 15 June 2022.",
        "Volatility in global interest rate markets and currency markets remained elevated.",
        "The heightened volatility in interest rate markets had primarily been driven by the uncertainty around the future course of inflation and the shift of monetary policy to a meeting-by-meeting approach, which had increased data dependency.",
        "Regarding the change in policy rate expectations, markets had reassessed both the extent and the pace of policy normalisation.",
        "After reaching a trough in late July, the “terminal rate” (the level at which market participants expected the policy interest rate to peak) had rebounded markedly and currently stood close to the peak seen in mid-June.",
        "The expected speed of progress towards this terminal rate had also increased, as investors expected a less gradual tightening cycle.",
        "The steeper expected policy path partly reflected the fact that investors attached an increasing probability to a scenario of inflation being higher for longer.",
        "Investors now expected inflation to peak in December, instead of September, as had been expected at the time of the July meeting.",
        "Options markets also pointed to rising upside risks to inflation, with investors currently pricing in a probability of around 15% that inflation would, on average, be above 4% over the next five years.",
        "Moreover, some measures of longer-term inflation compensation had started to creep higher again.",
        "In the euro area, with the latest increase in front-end inflation swap rates, real short-term rates were expected to remain highly accommodative for some time to come.",
        "This contrasted markedly with developments in the United States, where, according to market-based estimates, comparable rates were expected to be in restrictive territory in 2023.",
        "Ms Schnabel then explained how the reappraisal of monetary policy expectations had been transmitted to broader financial markets.",
        "Equity prices had increased notably during the summer, in spite of the weaker growth outlook, but had started to decline in the second half of August owing to increased concern about inflation – and the associated increase in discount rates – and weaker corporate earnings growth expectations.",
        "Yet, the decline in risk asset prices had been partly offset by an improvement in investor sentiment, as investors now required less compensation for holding risky assets instead of risk-free bonds.",
        "Overall, US stock markets were slightly down, while euro area markets were notably below the levels prevailing at the time of the Governing Council’s July meeting.",
        "A key factor in this divergence had been the sharp rise in European energy prices, which weighed on households’ real disposable income and firms’ earnings expectations.",
        "High energy prices in Europe and rising downside risks to growth in the euro area relative to the United States were also weighing on the euro exchange rate, as was the divergence of the expected path of the policy rate differential between the two economies.",
        "In euro area fixed income markets, in tandem with the repricing of other risk assets, corporate bond spreads had temporarily narrowed during the early summer, in line with a recovery in investors’ risk appetite, before reversing some of the narrowing in August.",
        "Euro area sovereign spreads had gradually widened, reflecting the shift in policy rate expectations.",
        "Yet, the link between spreads and interest rate expectations seemed to have become weaker since the Governing Council’s ad hoc meeting on 15 June 2022.",
        "In money markets, the pass-through of the 50 basis point rate hike in July had been smooth, with some exceptions in the repo and Treasury bill markets.",
        "Specifically, there had been only a partial pass-through to German non-general collateral rates following the July hike, mainly reflecting the scarcity of German Bund collateral.",
        "Mr Lane then went through the latest economic, monetary and financial developments in the global economy and the euro area.",
        "After the unusually high economic growth rates recorded at the start of the year as sectors reopened, global activity had slowed to the average growth rates observed before the pandemic.",
        "The deceleration in trade, coupled with a fall in new export orders, pointed to a continued loss of momentum.",
        "Despite a reduction in the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for suppliers’ delivery times, resulting from weakening demand and the partial resolution of supply bottlenecks, the overall level of supply bottlenecks remained elevated.",
        "The euro had been depreciating since the start of 2021, driven in part by monetary policy expectations and the worsening terms of trade.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, there had been a significant moderation in the manufacturing sector since the start of 2022, with the PMI for manufacturing output falling below the threshold of 50 – indicating a contraction – in the second quarter.",
        "The level of the PMI for services activity had been higher but was also weakening – even in the accommodation and food sectors, which had benefited most from the reopening of the economy.",
        "After the euro area economy had grown by 0.8% in the second quarter of 2022, mechanical short-term forecasting tools pointed to a substantial slowdown in activity in the third and fourth quarters.",
        "Focusing on demand components, private consumption had recovered significantly in the second quarter thanks to a strong contribution from the consumption of services, while the consumption of durable goods had continued to be weak over the period.",
        "The European Commission survey pointed to a significant weakening of demand for contact-intensive services in the future, together with a weakening of demand for goods from already low levels.",
        "The European Commission’s uncertainty indicator pointed to a big increase in household uncertainty and in the perceived need for precautionary savings.",
        "Moving on to investment, after a first quarter that had still been affected by supply bottlenecks and lockdowns, non-construction investment had recorded a strong growth rate in the second quarter of 2022.",
        "By contrast, the contribution of construction investment had been limited, with housing investment declining.",
        "Survey indicators suggested a moderation in non-construction investment in the second half of the year.",
        "The euro area goods trade balance had stabilised at around 3% of GDP in June, with the energy balance resulting in a deficit of around 5% of GDP in the second quarter.",
        "The effect on income of the terms-of-trade loss amounted to about 5 percentage points, which constituted the income transfer to energy-exporting countries outside the euro area and implied 5 percentage points less available income for domestic spending.",
        "The labour market had remained robust in the second quarter, but the PMI for employment signalled a moderation in the third quarter across all sectors.",
        "An analysis of the relationship between unemployment and the job vacancy rate – the Beveridge curve – helped to better understand the dynamics in the labour market.",
        "In the euro area there was currently a historically low unemployment rate and a historically high vacancy rate.",
        "By comparison, in the United States the ratio of vacancies to unemployment was a lot higher.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, euro area governments had provided even more support in 2022, in response to the war in Ukraine, notwithstanding the scaling-back of pandemic-related measures.",
        "According to Eurosystem models, fiscal support had raised euro area growth by around 0.4 percentage points and lowered inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) by around 0.6 percentage points this year.",
        "Since the support measures were designed to be temporary, their unwinding was estimated to push inflation higher in both 2023 and 2024.",
        "Despite the higher fiscal support, the euro area deficit continued to be estimated to fall to 3.8% of GDP in 2022.",
        "Moving on to the latest inflation developments, HICP inflation had increased to 9.1% in August.",
        "Energy continued to contribute about half of total headline inflation, but all other components also played significant roles.",
        "The September 2022 ECB staff macroeconomic projections featured a significant upward revision to inflation in the period to the third quarter of 2023.",
        "This was mostly due to higher energy and food commodity prices, but core inflation also accounted for an upward revision of about 1 percentage point.",
        "This revision, in turn, was related to the assumption of a speedier pass-through of energy and food inflation to core inflation.",
        "From the last quarter of 2023 onwards, the upward revisions were smaller.",
        "The overall picture of broadening inflationary pressures remained in place.",
        "Many indicators of underlying inflation had shifted further upwards.",
        "However, in terms of momentum, as reflected in monthly changes, some indicators had started to flatten or had even turned slightly negative.",
        "This was likely due to the fact that these indicators were more sensitive to changes in oil prices, which had fallen.",
        "Looking at pipeline pressures for goods price inflation, some measures remained robust.",
        "However, import prices for intermediate goods, i.e.",
        "goods in the early stages of the production chain, had moderated to some extent.",
        "Services price inflation had increased from a pre-pandemic rate of 1.5% in 2019 to above 3% in July 2022.",
        "A decomposition into supply and demand factors showed that demand factors were making an increasing contribution to services price inflation in 2022.",
        "So, it was not only supply shocks that were important, but the recovery of demand also played a role.",
        "That said, it was important to distinguish between a recovery in demand and a situation of excess demand.",
        "This distinction also mattered for the comparison of inflation in the euro area and in the United States.",
        "In the United States, the pick-up in core inflation was closely matched by a pick-up in wage growth.",
        "This was not the case in the euro area, where there was a clear disconnect between the evolution of core inflation and that of negotiated wages.",
        "In the euro area, inflation in items in the HICP basket with a relatively high share of wages in direct input costs had broadly followed the dynamics of negotiated wages and had thus remained quite contained overall.",
        "The large movements in euro area core inflation were instead due to other components, such as manufacturing goods and other items with a relatively low share of wages in direct input costs.",
        "It followed that the factors behind the increase in core inflation in the two economies were different, with wages playing a central role in the United States but not in the euro area.",
        "Turning to the latest wage developments, in the second quarter euro area negotiated wages had grown by 2.4%.",
        "The experimental ECB wage tracker pointed to a gradual acceleration in wage growth over the coming quarters.",
        "Recently concluded wage agreements included increases of around 3%, on average, in the euro area for both 2022 and 2023.",
        "However, in the agreements concluded in the third quarter, wage increases for 2023 were slightly lower than in the agreements concluded in the second quarter.",
        "So far there had not been an accelerating trend in the data.",
        "With regard to inflation expectations, the Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) showed that analysts had been continuously re-estimating the inflation rate for this year and next year.",
        "However, for 2023, the projected inflation rate was 4%, which was significantly below the 5.5% inflation rate included in the September staff projections.",
        "The SMA also pointed to a stable 2% inflation rate for 2024.",
        "Three-year ahead inflation expectations, as measured by responses to the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey, had jumped in March this year and since then had continued to fluctuate around the March level.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased strongly for the near term.",
        "This increase largely reflected expectations of higher near-term inflation, but the energy shock and the uncertainty related to the supply of Russian gas had also caused inflation risk premia to increase.",
        "Looking further ahead, however, inflation compensation measures embedded a very steep decline, to around 2%, by mid-2024.",
        "Mr Lane then recalled the key assumptions featured in the September staff projections.",
        "Compared with the June projections, oil prices had been revised down moderately, while gas and electricity prices had been revised up sharply.",
        "Short-term interest rates had also been revised up significantly for 2023 and 2024, with three-month interest rates now seen as being close to 2% for 2023 and remaining around that level for 2024.",
        "So a significant tightening of financing conditions was embedded in the projections, which reflected the ECB’s monetary policy tightening.",
        "Moving on to the main features of the September staff projections, it was useful to look at some key figures expressed as changes in the fourth quarter relative to the previous year’s fourth quarter.",
        "This better captured the developments in the interim, cleaned of carry-over effects that were influencing annual averages.",
        "Inflation was expected to average 9.2% in the fourth quarter of 2022, relative to the fourth quarter of 2021.",
        "Inflation was then seen to fall to 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and to 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2024.",
        "When looking at annual averages, inflation was expected to be 5.5% next year.",
        "The difference with respect to the 3.3% expected in the fourth quarter of 2023 was due to the fact that the annual figure for 2023 embedded a large carry-over effect, given the high starting point of the projection.",
        "Thus, the annual figures shown in the ECB staff projections featured a significant drop in momentum when looking at the quarterly inflation developments.",
        "At the same time, the decline in core inflation was expected to be less pronounced.",
        "While the energy and supply bottleneck shocks were expected to have less of an impact, some catch-up in wages to recover the loss in real wages, on the back of a strong labour market, implied that core inflation would remain above 2% over the projection horizon.",
        "Turning to financial and monetary developments, Mr Lane noted that the tightening of financing conditions had continued and its impact was spreading across the economy.",
        "Banks’ bond funding costs had seen a strong increase for both covered bonds and senior unsecured bonds.",
        "In addition, deposit rates for firms and households had started to increase.",
        "Both the nominal cost of firms’ debt financing and household borrowing costs were expected to increase further later in the year.",
        "The volume of loans to firms remained strong, as firms preferred to borrow now rather than later, while the net issuance of debt securities was negative, as firms continued to substitute bond issuance with bank loans, given the relatively lower rates on loans.",
        "Loan flows to households remained solid, but lending for house purchase was showing the first signs of a slowdown.",
        "Forward-looking indicators pointed to a slowdown in private sector borrowing in the second half of the year.",
        "Turning to developments in M3, there had been a significant moderation in money growth rates over the past year.",
        "After the end of the Eurosystem’s net asset purchases, money creation had been supported by bank lending, but as the growth of credit to the private sector was expected to slow, money creation was expected to decelerate further.",
        "Corporate and household deposit accumulation had normalised in recent months, with annual deposit growth rates standing close to their pre-pandemic averages.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane stressed that price pressures were extraordinarily high and likely to persist for an extended period.",
        "At 38.3% in August, energy price inflation had remained at extremely elevated levels and had again been the largest contributor to overall inflation, which had stood at 9.1% in August.",
        "Food price inflation had also risen in August, to 10.6%, from 9.8% in July, partly reflecting higher input costs related to energy, disruptions to trade in food commodities and adverse weather conditions.",
        "Market-based indicators suggested that, in the near term, oil prices would moderate, but wholesale gas prices would stay extraordinarily high.",
        "While supply bottlenecks had been easing, these continued to gradually feed through to consumer prices.",
        "Recovering demand in the services sector had also contributed to the rise in inflation, and the recent depreciation of the euro had added to the build-up of inflationary pressures.",
        "Price pressures had continued to strengthen and broaden across the economy, in part owing to the impact of high energy costs across the whole economy.",
        "Accordingly, most measures of underlying inflation remained at elevated levels.",
        "Inflation could rise further in the near term.",
        "As the current supply-side drivers of inflation faded over time and the normalisation of monetary policy worked its way through to the economy and price-setting, inflation would come down.",
        "Resilient labour markets and some catch-up to compensate for higher inflation were likely to support growth in wages.",
        "At the same time, incoming data and recent wage agreements indicated that wage dynamics remained contained overall.",
        "Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations stood at around 2%, although recent above-target revisions to some indicators warranted continued monitoring.",
        "The staff projections for inflation had been revised up, especially for the near term.",
        "Headline HICP inflation was expected to remain at very high levels for the rest of 2022 as a result of extremely elevated energy and food commodity prices, as well as the reopening of the economy and supply bottlenecks.",
        "Compared with the June projections, headline inflation had been revised up by 1.3 percentage points for 2022, 2.0 percentage points for 2023 and 0.2 percentage points for 2024.",
        "The upward revisions reflected recent data surprises, exceptional increases in the assumptions for wholesale gas and electricity prices, stronger wage growth and the depreciation of the euro.",
        "HICP inflation was projected to average 8.1% in 2022, before subsequently decreasing to 5.5% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024.",
        "The projected decline was largely attributable to expectations of falling energy and food commodity prices over the projection horizon.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food was also likely to remain at elevated levels until the middle of 2023, but was expected to decline thereafter as the effects of the reopening of the economy subsided and supply bottlenecks and energy input cost pressures eased.",
        "The latest staff projections saw inflation excluding energy and food reaching 3.9% in 2022, 3.4% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024.",
        "After a rebound in activity in the first half of 2022, the latest data pointed to a substantial slowdown in euro area economic growth, with the economy expected to stagnate later in 2022 and in the first quarter of 2023.",
        "Very high energy prices were reducing the purchasing power of people’s incomes and, while easing, supply bottlenecks were still constraining economic activity.",
        "Although employment had risen by 0.4% in the second quarter and survey indicators of employment perceptions still suggested further growth in the third quarter of 2022, high-frequency indicators signalled that job vacancies had started to plateau in July, possibly leading to a peak in the second half of the year.",
        "The weaker outlook was also reflected in the new staff projections, notwithstanding upward revisions in the back data.",
        "Compared with the June projections, GDP growth had been revised up by 0.3 percentage points for 2022, with growth in the first half of the year higher than expected.",
        "In contrast, growth had been revised down by 1.2 percentage points for 2023 and by 0.2 percentage points for 2024, owing mainly to the impact of energy supply disruptions, higher inflation and declining confidence.",
        "The new projections saw real GDP growing by 3.1% in 2022 and slowing markedly to 0.9% in 2023.",
        "As the energy market rebalanced, uncertainty declined, supply bottlenecks were resolved and real incomes recovered over the medium term, growth was expected to rebound and to stand at 1.9% in 2024.",
        "In the context of the slowing global economy, downside risks to the growth outlook had intensified, in particular in the near term.",
        "As reflected in the downside scenario in the staff projections, a long-lasting war in Ukraine remained a significant risk to growth, especially if firms and households faced rationing of energy supplies.",
        "In such a situation, confidence could deteriorate further and supply-side constraints could worsen again.",
        "Energy and food costs could also remain persistently higher than expected.",
        "A further deterioration in the global economic outlook could be an additional drag on euro area external demand.",
        "The risks to the inflation outlook were primarily on the upside.",
        "A further disruption of energy supplies was a major risk in the short term.",
        "Over the medium term, inflation could turn out to be higher than expected because of a persistent worsening of the production capacity of the euro area economy, further increases in energy and food prices, inflation expectations rising above the ECB’s inflation target and higher than anticipated wage rises.",
        "However, if energy costs were to decline or demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressures on prices.",
        "Market interest rates had increased in anticipation of further monetary policy normalisation in response to the inflation outlook.",
        "Credit to firms had become more expensive over recent months and bank lending rates for households stood at their highest levels in more than five years.",
        "The volume of bank lending to firms had remained strong, however, in part reflecting the need to finance high production costs and inventory building.",
        "Mortgage lending to households was moderating because of tightening credit standards, rising borrowing costs and weak consumer confidence.",
        "Sovereign yields had moved broadly in line with risk-free rates, against the backdrop of the ongoing application of flexibility in reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and reflecting the unanimous approval of the Transmission Protection Instrument at the 20-21 July Governing Council meeting.",
        "Corporate bonds and equities had rallied for most of the period since that meeting, on the back of improving risk sentiment, but had lately fallen back as discount rates increased.",
        "Mr Lane proposed that the three key ECB interest rates be raised by 75 basis points at the present meeting.",
        "This major step would frontload the transition from the prevailing highly accommodative level of policy rates towards levels that would ensure a timely return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% medium-term target.",
        "He furthermore proposed to communicate that, based on the current assessment, over the next several meetings interest rates were expected to be raised further to dampen demand and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations.",
        "Mr Lane recalled that the monetary policy strategy stipulated that the appropriate monetary policy response to a deviation of inflation from the target was context-specific and depended on the origin, magnitude and persistence of the deviation.",
        "With inflation expected to be well above target for a long period, in view of the net upside risks to inflation and taking into account the fact that the key policy rates were still highly accommodative, it was appropriate to take this major step.",
        "The communication of this decision should make it clear that the appropriate monetary policy for the euro area would continue to take into account the fact that the energy shock remained a dominant driving force behind inflation dynamics and the general economic outlook, including through the impact of the very significant terms-of-trade deterioration.",
        "In particular, the inflation dynamics associated with the energy shock component – to which the euro area was particularly exposed – were of a different nature to that of demand-driven overheating dynamics.",
        "In line with a meeting-by-meeting approach to setting interest rates, the Governing Council should also underline that its policy would continue to be data-dependent and was not on a pre-set path, and that future interest rate decisions would reflect the evolving inflation outlook and the incoming data.",
        "In addition, Mr Lane proposed that the Governing Council continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio.",
        "Finally, Mr Lane proposed that the two-tier system for the remuneration of excess reserves be suspended by setting the multiplier to zero.",
        "With a positive deposit facility rate, the two-tier system was no longer necessary, as its role was to support the bank-based transmission of monetary policy when the deposit facility rate was negative.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks to the outlook provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "After a rebound in activity in the first half of 2022, the latest data pointed to a substantial slowdown in euro area economic growth, with the economy expected to stagnate later in 2022 and in the first quarter of 2023.",
        "Very high energy prices were reducing the purchasing power of people’s incomes and, while easing, supply bottlenecks were still constraining economic activity.",
        "In addition, the adverse geopolitical situation – especially Russia’s war in Ukraine – was weighing on the confidence of businesses and consumers.",
        "This outlook was reflected in the September staff projections for economic growth, which had been revised down markedly for the remainder of the current year and well into 2023.",
        "Inflation remained far too high and was likely to stay above target for an extended period.",
        "Soaring energy and food prices, demand pressures in some sectors as a result of the reopening of the economy and supply bottlenecks were still driving up inflation.",
        "Price pressures had continued to strengthen and broaden across the economy, and inflation could rise further in the near term.",
        "However, as the current drivers of inflation faded over time and the normalisation of monetary policy worked its way through to the economy and price-setting, inflation would come down.",
        "Global economic activity had decelerated in the first half of 2022, on the back of supply-side disruptions and other headwinds, and growth momentum had weakened significantly over recent months.",
        "Looking ahead, weakening global activity would also weigh on global trade and euro area foreign demand, despite easing pressures on global supply chains, with global growth expected to remain moderate in the second half of the year as high inflation eroded real incomes.",
        "In the context of a global monetary policy tightening cycle, members saw differences between the economic situation in the United States and in the euro area.",
        "In the United States, price pressures were more related to overheating domestic demand, while in the euro area they reflected, to a greater extent, imported inflation and a sequence of supply shocks.",
        "More visible wage pressures in the United States were seen to reflect the fact that the labour market had adjusted through an increase in redundancies rather than a reduction in hours worked per person employed.",
        "This implied that, at present, with a strong recovery in activity and employment, the United States was seeing a sharp rise in the number of job vacancies, which had led to a shift in the cyclical relationship between job vacancies and unemployment (as represented by the Beveridge curve).",
        "In the euro area, the relationship had remained stable overall.",
        "This suggested that the current higher wage pressures in the United States reflected a more pronounced labour market tightness than in the euro area.",
        "Moreover, the euro area had been more exposed to the surge in energy prices – particularly gas prices – since the start of the war in Ukraine, as the main driver of high inflation.",
        "It was also noted that the trend depreciation of the euro over the past year, notably vis-à-vis the US dollar, could add to inflationary pressures for the euro area in the period ahead.",
        "The weakening of the euro against the US dollar could be explained by a number of factors.",
        "These included the different implications of the energy shock for the economies’ respective terms of trade, diverging cyclical conditions and different risks associated with the war and the energy crisis.",
        "At the same time, the faster tightening of US monetary policy was also seen to have played an important role.",
        "Turning to developments in the euro area, the economy had grown by 0.8% in the second quarter of 2022, owing mainly to strong consumer spending on contact-intensive services, as a result of the end of pandemic-related restrictions.",
        "Over the summer, as people travelled more, countries with large tourism sectors had benefited especially.",
        "At the same time, businesses had suffered from high energy costs and continued supply bottlenecks, although the latter had been easing gradually.",
        "While buoyant tourism had been supporting economic growth during the third quarter, the economy was expected to slow down substantially over the remainder of the year.",
        "There were four main reasons behind this.",
        "First, high inflation was dampening spending and production throughout the economy, and these headwinds were being reinforced by gas supply disruptions.",
        "Second, the strong rebound in demand for services that had come with the reopening of the economy would run out of steam in the following months.",
        "Third, weakening global demand, also in the context of tighter monetary policy in many major economies, and worsening terms of trade would mean less support for the euro area economy.",
        "Fourth, uncertainty remained high and confidence was falling sharply.",
        "At the same time, the labour market had remained robust, supporting economic activity.",
        "More than 600,000 people had entered employment in the second quarter of 2022 and the unemployment rate had stood at a historical low of 6.6% in July.",
        "Total hours worked had increased further, by 0.6%, in the second quarter of 2022 and had surpassed pre-pandemic levels.",
        "With regard to economic activity, members concurred with Mr Lane that there were increasing signs of a downturn in the euro area that could extend into 2023.",
        "However, it was also highlighted that the economy had demonstrated considerable strength in the second quarter of 2022, with a quarter-on-quarter growth rate of 0.8%.",
        "Looking ahead, it was highlighted that the baseline in the September staff projections did not suggest a recession, although it did foresee a period of stagnation around the turn of the year.",
        "However, it was mentioned that a range of models and indicators suggested that a recession was likely next year.",
        "If there were to be a complete shutdown of gas supplies from Russia, this could turn into an outright recession.",
        "The reaction of domestic demand was considered a key element in the further transmission of high energy prices, as well as the less accommodative monetary policy.",
        "It was recalled that an important feature of the latest projections was that high energy prices would inevitably weigh on consumption as real incomes declined.",
        "In addition, business investment was expected to be worse than previously anticipated, especially as energy-intensive firms and firms operating in the energy sector might be exposed to financial stress generated by higher energy prices.",
        "Members noted that, in addition to the negative impact from the surge in energy and other commodity prices, there was uncertainty about the distribution of the associated terms-of-trade loss among workers and firms.",
        "In this context, the view was expressed that it would take time before the income losses due to the terms-of-trade shock were fully absorbed, as firms and workers would seek to recoup lost profits and real incomes.",
        "Regarding the fiscal policy response to higher energy prices, members agreed that measures should be temporary and targeted at the most vulnerable households and firms in order to limit the risk of fuelling inflationary pressures.",
        "However, the concern was expressed that governments would find it difficult to keep measures targeted and to reverse them in a timely manner.",
        "The view was taken that, in the context of an adverse supply shock, governments were well advised to reduce their deficits and to put their finances on a structural consolidation path, especially in those countries where public debt sustainability might be called into question.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that addressing the energy crisis as a supply shock required, first and foremost, action on the side of governments.",
        "It was argued that monetary policy primarily controlled inflation via a dampening effect on economic activity, with long and variable lags.",
        "It could not therefore control short-term inflation developments on which initiatives by governments and the European Commission could have a stronger impact.",
        "With regard to potential output, it was commented that the impact of the war and the pandemic on the productive capacity of the economy was turning out to be bigger and longer-lasting than expected, so that demand might need to be reduced commensurately if inflation were to be curbed.",
        "If the supply side was hit harder than the demand side, this could fuel inflationary pressures even if real incomes declined.",
        "According to survey evidence, companies’ production constraints were mainly related to shortages of labour and equipment rather than insufficient demand.",
        "Hence the question was raised as to whether the output gap might have already closed, in line with indications coming from the unemployment gap that pointed to a potential underestimation of the role of capacity constraints in driving inflation.",
        "However, the view was also expressed that aggregate demand was still clearly below potential.",
        "All in all, it was clear that both demand and supply factors were playing an important role in determining the current degree of economic slack in the euro area.",
        "Against this background, members assessed that, in the context of the slowing global economy, risks to growth were primarily on the downside, particularly in the near term.",
        "As reflected in the downside scenario in the staff projections, a long-lasting war in Ukraine remained a significant risk to growth, especially if firms and households faced rationing of energy supplies.",
        "In such a situation, confidence could deteriorate further and supply-side constraints could worsen again.",
        "Energy and food costs could also remain persistently higher than expected.",
        "A further deterioration in the global economic outlook could be an additional drag on euro area external demand.",
        "With regard to price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Inflation had risen further to 9.1% in August.",
        "Energy price inflation had remained extremely elevated, at 38.3%, and it was again the dominant component of overall inflation.",
        "Market-based indicators suggested that, in the near term, oil prices would moderate, while wholesale gas prices would stay extraordinarily high.",
        "Food price inflation had also risen in August, to 10.6%, partly reflecting higher input costs related to energy, disruptions of trade in food commodities and adverse weather conditions.",
        "While supply bottlenecks had been easing, these continued to gradually feed through to consumer prices and were putting upward pressure on inflation, as was recovering demand in the services sector.",
        "The depreciation of the euro had also added to the build-up of inflationary pressures.",
        "Price pressures were spreading across more and more sectors, owing in part to the impact of high energy costs across the whole economy.",
        "Accordingly, measures of underlying inflation remained at elevated levels.",
        "Resilient labour markets and some catch-up to compensate for higher inflation were likely to support growth in wages.",
        "At the same time, the latest data and wage agreements indicated that wage dynamics remained contained overall.",
        "Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stood at around 2%, although recent above-target revisions to some indicators warranted continued monitoring.",
        "It was widely underlined that recent high inflation outcomes had largely been driven by higher energy prices.",
        "Recent developments in energy markets also suggested that headline inflation would not reach a turning point before the end of the year.",
        "Month-on-month inflation rates continued to indicate strong momentum.",
        "The argument was made that the nature of the inflation process was changing.",
        "Inflation had started to become self-reinforcing, to the point that even a projected marked weakening in growth was not sufficient to bring inflation back to target.",
        "This was also the message from the downside scenario prepared by ECB staff, which pointed to a significant recession with inflation standing even higher at the end of the horizon, well above the ECB’s target.",
        "Moreover, demand-side factors had become an important driver of underlying inflation, which also stood well above target in the baseline projection for 2024.",
        "Inflation had continued to broaden to more sectors and spending categories.",
        "Moreover, producer price inflation for core consumer goods continued to rise and the unprecedented size of pipeline pressures implied that firms would very likely continue to pass a substantial amount of these cost increases on to consumers.",
        "However, it was also argued that inflation was still largely driven by the pass-through of supply shocks in the goods market, which appeared to be unwinding, with the exception of volatile gas prices.",
        "A recession was becoming increasingly likely and would mitigate inflationary pressures.",
        "With expectations still anchored and wage growth contained, there were no convincing signs that second-round effects were already materialising.",
        "Members recalled that wage pressures were key to understanding the risk of higher energy prices having second-round effects on inflation.",
        "While wage developments in the euro area appeared moderate overall, there was evidence of differences between countries.",
        "In some euro area countries, labour markets were clearly overheated, which should ultimately lead to higher wages.",
        "However, while wages were a lagging indicator of the business cycle in general, and although a number of important wage negotiations would only take place in the autumn, it was generally observed that there were so far no convincing signs of second-round effects through wages.",
        "In this context, it was commented that the usefulness of ongoing wage developments as an indicator of future inflation pressures was questionable given that wages reacted gradually and with a substantial lag to labour market conditions in the euro area.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, most measures of market and survey-based inflation expectations were considered to be broadly anchored and in line with price stability in the medium term.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that a number of indicators pointed to an increasing risk of longer-term inflation expectations becoming unanchored.",
        "Consumers’ medium-term inflation expectations, as reported in the Consumer Expectations Survey, had gradually increased, and in July the median expectations for inflation three years ahead had stood at 3%.",
        "The mean of the longer-term inflation expectations reported in the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters had increased to 2.2%, which was also a historical high.",
        "It was highlighted that a prolonged period of very high inflation had in itself increased the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored, in particular if they were being affected by recent experience, as suggested by empirical evidence.",
        "Higher than expected inflation figures exacerbated the risk of second-round effects via wages, creating upside risks to the inflation outlook.",
        "Projection models might be unable to fully capture the persistence and scale of the current inflationary episode.",
        "The expected decline in inflation towards the end of the projection horizon was therefore seen to be surrounded by a higher than usual degree of uncertainty.",
        "Against this background, members assessed that the risks to the inflation outlook were primarily on the upside.",
        "In the same way as for growth, the major risk in the short term was a further disruption of energy supplies.",
        "Over the medium term, inflation might turn out to be higher than expected because of a persistent worsening of the production capacity of the euro area economy, further increases in energy and food prices, a rise in inflation expectations above the target, or higher than anticipated wage rises.",
        "The point was made that an expansion of unfunded or partially funded government support could also constitute an upside risk to inflation.",
        "However, if energy costs were to decline or demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressures on prices.",
        "Reference was made to the very useful large set of sensitivity analyses carried out by ECB staff in the context of the latest projections.",
        "It was also widely felt that, at times of extraordinary statistical uncertainty around the baseline projections, the precise numbers foreseen for inflation at the end of the projection horizon mattered less than the assessment of risks, which were seen to be on the upside throughout the horizon, including over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Credit to firms had become more expensive over recent months, and bank lending rates for households stood at their highest levels in more than five years.",
        "In terms of volumes, bank lending to firms had so far remained strong, in part reflecting the need to finance high production costs and inventory building.",
        "Mortgage lending to households was moderating because of tightening credit standards, rising borrowing costs and weak consumer confidence.",
        "However, it was noted that, despite an increase in the cost of mortgages, credit growth had remained resilient.",
        "In parallel with the apparent resilience of the real economy, the banking sector was so far still holding up well, with bank profitability benefiting from higher operating income, lower operating expenses, lower loan loss provisions and better asset quality.",
        "This could be expected to mitigate the risk of negative feedback loops between the financial sector and the rest of the economy once economic growth slowed, even if pockets of vulnerability could still appear.",
        "Although market interest rates had increased in anticipation of further monetary policy rate increases in response to the inflation outlook, it was maintained that market conditions did not show signs of destabilisation.",
        "It was also noted that financial market fragmentation had not reappeared since the Governing Council’s last monetary policy meeting, and sovereign yields had moved broadly in line with risk-free rates.",
        "Corporate bond spreads had also narrowed since the previous monetary policy meeting, while equity markets, except for the financial sector, had been broadly weaker.",
        "It was underlined that the euro had depreciated by nearly 20% against the US dollar since June 2021, amplifying the energy price shock and adding to import price pressures for an extended period.",
        "Overall, financial conditions had tightened somewhat in the euro area since the last monetary policy meeting, while remaining relatively loose, particularly in real terms and when the exchange rate was taken into account.",
        "At the same time, higher market interest rates were starting to feed through to bank lending rates and financing conditions for the real economy, with further increases to be expected.",
        "Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members agreed that it was appropriate to take a further step on the path of monetary policy normalisation.",
        "Overall, the current level of the ECB’s key policy rates was judged to be still highly accommodative; with inflation at 9.1% in August 2022 and the deposit facility rate at 0%, short-term real rates were deeply negative.",
        "Inflation was far too high and likely to stay above the Governing Council’s target for an extended period.",
        "It was therefore essential that it be brought back to 2% in a timely manner.",
        "Inflation had repeatedly been higher than expected in recent months and inflationary pressures were seen as unlikely to abate on their own.",
        "The inflation projections had been revised upwards for the current year and for next year, while the projection for 2024 had drifted upwards over the past few quarters and now clearly exceeded the Governing Council’s target of 2%.",
        "Risks surrounding the projected inflation path remained tilted to the upside over the entire projection horizon.",
        "Moreover, month-on-month figures for headline and core inflation were rising strongly.",
        "While it was underlined that supply shocks, in particular those affecting energy prices, were the main driver of the current high level of inflation and the worsening outlook, demand-side factors also played a role.",
        "While monetary policy was not equipped to address supply shocks, it clearly affected the balance of supply and demand.",
        "Hence it was argued that putting too much emphasis on supply-side problems could risk neglecting the fact that aggregate demand had to adjust to curb inflation.",
        "In this regard, it was maintained that the expected weakening in economic activity would not be sufficient to reduce inflation to a significant extent and would not in itself bring projected inflation back to target.",
        "This was seen to present the Governing Council with the difficult challenge of ensuring that inflation returned to target in a timely manner without unnecessarily exacerbating an economic downturn.",
        "However, it was also argued that growth concerns should, in any case, not prevent a needed forceful increase in interest rates.",
        "Moreover, it was remarked that, without a timely reduction in monetary policy accommodation, inflationary pressures resulting from a depreciation of the euro might increase further, while lower exchange rates provided limited support to economic activity in an environment of continued global supply bottlenecks and shortages.",
        "While monetary policy could not prevent first-round effects from higher energy prices and the impact of supply shocks, its primary responsibility was to counter risks of second-round effects and prevent an unanchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "Such risks were increasing, with inflation becoming more persistent than initially expected.",
        "Against this background, the Governing Council’s response to upside deviations from the ECB’s target ought to be as forceful as it had been when inflation had been too low.",
        "It was recalled that the Governing Council regarded deviations of inflation from target in either direction as equally undesirable.",
        "The ECB’s monetary policy strategy prescribed that price stability had to be maintained with a medium-term orientation, and the magnitude and persistence of the deviation from the Governing Council’s inflation target, as well as the context and origin of inflation pressures, had to be taken into account.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that acting forcefully now could avoid the need to increase interest rates more sharply later in the economic cycle when the economy was slowing down.",
        "Moreover, it was maintained that the longer high inflation persisted, the higher the risk that inflation expectations could become unanchored and the costlier it would be to bring them back to target.",
        "Turning to the size of the interest rate increase, a very large number of members, in line with Mr Lane’s proposal, expressed a preference for raising the key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points.",
        "A 75 basis point increase was judged to be a proportionate response to the further upward revisions to the inflation outlook and an important signal that the Governing Council was determined to bring inflation back to its 2% target in a timely manner.",
        "The fact that inflation had repeatedly been higher than expected and the upward revision to the medium-term inflation projections were seen as calling for a faster pace of monetary policy normalisation to keep inflation expectations anchored at the target level in the medium term.",
        "Market participants had priced in a larger interest rate increase than in July in response to the latest inflation data.",
        "Since the deposit facility rate was, at 0%, far from a level that could be considered neutral in terms of monetary policy accommodation, and in view of the worse inflation outlook, progress towards a level that supported a return of inflation to 2% had to be frontloaded.",
        "While the Governing Council’s decision in July to raise the ECB’s key policy rates by 50 basis points had been an important first step in normalising the interest rate level, it was argued that policy would remain expansionary after a 75 basis point rate hike.",
        "Some members expressed a preference for increasing the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points.",
        "While a 25 basis point increase was seen as clearly insufficient to address the current inflation outlook, it was argued that a 50 basis point hike would be large enough to signal determination in proceeding with the interest rate normalisation that the Governing Council had begun at its July meeting.",
        "With the looming risk of a recession, which would mitigate inflationary pressures, an increase of 50 basis points, if part of a sustained path towards more neutral rate levels, might prove sufficient to return inflation to the Governing Council’s 2% target over the medium term once transitory shocks had faded.",
        "What needed to be addressed was the risk of the sharp rise in inflation, exacerbated by the war, destabilising inflation expectations.",
        "A response that was too aggressive could also exacerbate a recession, with few benefits for inflation in the short term.",
        "So far, inflation expectations were still anchored and wage growth remained moderate, with little evidence of second-round effects.",
        "Moreover, the size of the upward revision in the staff inflation projection for 2024 was not seen as sufficiently large as to require a more aggressive response, since it was uncertain how much inflation was likely to dampen domestic demand and high uncertainty surrounded the projections, particularly towards the end of the projection horizon.",
        "It was noted that the euro area was less affected by excess demand than the United States.",
        "Supply-side factors such as energy played a much larger role in the euro area, wage inflation was more moderate and medium-term inflation expectations were better anchored.",
        "At the end of the discussion, all members joined a consensus to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points, while reaffirming that the Governing Council’s decision remained data-dependent and that a 75 basis point increase should not signal that the Governing Council intended to agree on interest rate increases of a similar magnitude at its future meetings.",
        "It was seen as essential to communicate prudently on the way forward and to counter the risk of increased volatility in the bond market by referring to a frontloading of interest rate normalisation.",
        "Members widely concurred with Mr Lane that monetary policy should continue to be data-dependent and not follow a pre-set path, and that interest rates should be set on a meeting-by-meeting basis.",
        "At the same time, it was considered important to indicate that interest rates would be raised further over subsequent meetings as part of the normalisation process.",
        "Regarding the interest rate level ultimately required to stabilise inflation at 2% over the medium term and the time at which that level was to be reached, it was stressed that these were subject to uncertainty, model-dependent and context-specific, and changed over time.",
        "In addition, the “neutral rate of interest” depended on long-term trends in factors such as productivity and demographics, as well as the interplay between savings and investment behaviour.",
        "Hence, the concept was debatable, unobservable and difficult to measure in real time.",
        "Despite these difficulties, there was broad consensus that, even after the current decision, the key policy rates would remain significantly below the neutral rate.",
        "Looking beyond the configuration of the key ECB interest rates, it was underlined that the Eurosystem’s large balance sheet was continuing to provide significant monetary policy accommodation by compressing term premia.",
        "It was seen as appropriate to reiterate that the Governing Council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returned to its medium-term target of 2%.",
        "Members also agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio.",
        "Containing unwarranted volatility in sovereign bond markets was generally seen as an essential complement to a 75 basis point interest rate increase and signalled the ECB’s commitment to ensure a smooth transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area.",
        "Finally, members agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to suspend the two-tier system for the remuneration of excess reserves by setting the multiplier to zero, since the two-tier system was no longer considered necessary in view of the positive value that the deposit facility rate would reach as a consequence of the decision to raise the three policy rates by 75 basis points.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 15-16 December 2021.",
        "Markets had digested well the Governing Council’s decisions in December 2021 to discontinue net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in March 2022 and to adjust the future path of purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP).",
        "The day after that meeting, ten-year overnight index swap (OIS) rates and euro area GDP-weighted sovereign yields had been lower than before the meeting.",
        "Nevertheless, long-term real and nominal interest rates had increased globally from the exceptionally low levels that had prevailed after the discovery of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in late November last year.",
        "A model-based breakdown of the recent increase in ten-year euro area risk-free rates suggested that it had been mainly driven by two factors.",
        "The first was a change in investors’ assessment of the economic impact of the Omicron variant.",
        "Developments over the past few weeks had reinforced the impression that the Omicron wave might be sharp but short-lived, and the drag it exerted on economic growth weaker than initially feared.",
        "The second factor pushing interest rates higher in recent weeks had been a reappraisal of the global monetary policy outlook.",
        "In the United States, investors had brought forward the expected time of “lift-off”, with the first hike currently expected in March.",
        "They had also priced in more tightening over the next two years, and were now expecting balance sheet runoff to start sooner.",
        "In the euro area, rising inflation compensation had added to the upward pressure from higher real rates, as markets had revised up their expectations of the future path of inflation in response to the renewed upside surprises to inflation in December and January.",
        "Recent energy price developments had added to perceptions in the market that inflation risks were rising.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had increased to about USD 90 per barrel, the highest level since 2014 and about 25% higher compared with mid-December.",
        "According to futures curves, oil prices were expected to remain high over the medium term.",
        "Gas spot and futures prices, too, were higher than before the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, reflecting the growing tensions between Russia and Ukraine as well as low inventories.",
        "These developments had contributed to a continued reappraisal of the medium-term inflation outlook for the euro area.",
        "First, respondents to the Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) saw upside risks to inflation over the entire horizon covered by the SMA.",
        "Second, survey-based indicators of long-run inflation expectations had been revised up.",
        "In the SMA, in particular, they had risen to 2% from 1.8% in December.",
        "This was the highest they had ever been since the start of the SMA.",
        "Likewise, in January long-term inflation expectations from Consensus Economics had reached 2% for the first time since 2015.",
        "Market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation had remained at around 2%.",
        "Furthermore, in the inflation options market, investors were pricing in a probability of around 30% that inflation over the next five years would, on average, be above 2.5% and a probability of around 50% that it would be above 2%.",
        "In this environment, markets had significantly revised their expectations about the monetary policy outlook in the euro area.",
        "Compared with December, the OIS forward curve had steepened visibly for short-term maturities.",
        "Markets were pricing in a cumulative 50 basis point hike in the deposit facility rate (DFR) by mid-2023, which would raise the DFR to 0%.",
        "As usual, these dates had to be treated with caution because the market rates included term premia.",
        "Allowing for such premia, market pricing implied that the DFR would actually rise above zero somewhat later.",
        "SMA participants, too, were now expecting the first DFR increase to be one quarter earlier, in the third quarter of 2023, with a much steeper path after lift-off than they had anticipated in December.",
        "Developments in options markets suggested that investors had revised not only their expectations about the central future path of short-term interest rates, but also their expectations about the distribution of risks around this path.",
        "This distribution had become more skewed to the upside.",
        "Nevertheless, monetary policy in the euro area was still expected to normalise at a measurably slower pace than in many other economies, as could be seen from the developments in foreign exchange markets.",
        "The euro had temporarily fallen against the US dollar to the lowest level since June 2020.",
        "At the time of the meeting, the euro was still down against the US dollar by more than 6% compared with a year ago and was trading close to its 2019 average.",
        "In nominal effective terms, the euro was down by around 3% compared with a year ago.",
        "With investors preparing for faster policy normalisation globally, risk assets that had benefited from the long period of very low interest rates might have been expected to come under pressure.",
        "However, risk assets had in fact remained resilient overall, in particular in the euro area.",
        "According to market intelligence, real interest rates currently remained at levels that were supportive for growth and risk assets.",
        "In euro area sovereign bond markets, yield spreads over German ten-year Bunds had remained around their December levels with few exceptions.",
        "The resilience of these spreads was noteworthy in the current environment.",
        "The change in the expected future policy path – by the logic of the ECB’s sequencing – implied a significant reduction in the amount of assets expected to be bought under the APP.",
        "The picture was very similar in the euro area corporate bond markets, where spreads had only increased marginally.",
        "Thus, financing conditions for euro area firms had remained highly favourable.",
        "As regards developments in global equity markets, stocks had first declined visibly in the United States, but had then recovered a good part of their losses.",
        "In the euro area, stock markets had suffered only very moderate losses compared with December 2021.",
        "Here the impact of higher discount rates had been offset by continued upward revisions to longer-term earnings expectations and improved risk sentiment.",
        "All in all, therefore, the rise in real and nominal interest rates had so far been absorbed well by financial markets, as real financing conditions remained favourable amid high inflation and expectations of continued buoyant global growth in the coming years.",
        "In his review of global developments Mr Lane noted that the Omicron variant had led to a sharp rise in global coronavirus cases in January.",
        "Although these cases appeared milder than in previous waves, many parts of the world had strengthened their containment measures.",
        "Whereas previous waves had seen a rotation between advanced economies and emerging markets, in the recent wave a lot of countries across the globe had found themselves in a similar situation.",
        "This could imply a stronger, more synchronised rebound compared with earlier waves.",
        "The most recent loosening of containment measures in some countries was confirming the expectation that Omicron case numbers could fall quickly once a sufficient level of immunity had been reached.",
        "The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for both manufacturing and services at the global level continued to point to an ongoing recovery at the turn of the year.",
        "But there were signals of a slowdown in the near term, especially in manufacturing.",
        "Supply bottlenecks continued to restrain global activity.",
        "While these bottlenecks seemed to be levelling off according to various indicators, they remained substantial.",
        "The euro exchange rate had depreciated since the December meeting of the Governing Council, both against the US dollar (-0.9%) and in nominal effective terms (-1.2%).",
        "Taking a longer-term perspective, the exchange rate appreciation observed in 2020 had largely been reversed, bringing the exchange rate closer to its pre-pandemic level.",
        "Oil prices had increased sharply (+28%) since the December meeting, with the oil futures curve shifting upward until the end of 2024.",
        "Most of the oil price increase since the December meeting could be attributed to supply factors and the recent failure of some OPEC+ members to step up production.",
        "In contrast to oil prices, gas prices had declined by 33% since the December 2021 Governing Council meeting.",
        "This was due to the relatively mild winter in Europe and the redirection of imports of liquified natural gas from Asia to Europe, which had more than offset the large drop in gas imports from Russia.",
        "Concerning the outlook for gas prices, it was important to recognise that supply shocks tended to have a more persistent effect on gas prices when inventories were low, which was currently the case.",
        "Global food prices had increased by 6% since the December meeting following poor harvests, rises in shipping costs and higher fertiliser prices as a result of rising energy costs.",
        "Turning to developments in activity in the euro area, Mr Lane noted that after a strong performance in the middle of last year there had been a significant slowdown at the end of the year.",
        "Real GDP had grown by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2021 (according to Eurostat’s flash estimate) following a growth rate of 2.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter.",
        "In the fourth quarter of 2021 euro area GDP had reached its pre-pandemic level.",
        "The slowdown in GDP growth reflected the intensification of the pandemic, persisting bottlenecks and still high energy prices.",
        "In Europe, COVID-19 cases had risen more than tenfold since mid-November, but with the emergence of the Omicron variant the number of intensive care admissions was no longer rising in line with the number of infections.",
        "Nevertheless, health concerns among consumers had increased.",
        "The European Commission survey of December 2021 showed that households had become less optimistic about their near-term spending, especially in sectors providing contact-intensive consumer services.",
        "Turning to production, pressures exerted by supply bottlenecks had levelled off, but there was no evidence so far of a significant decline in those bottlenecks.",
        "Production of transport equipment continued to be dampened by shortages of semiconductors and by logistical problems.",
        "As a result, capacity utilisation had fallen and stocks of almost finished and finished goods had risen in the sector.",
        "Production of other capital goods remained robust.",
        "Turning to trade in goods and services, the accumulated level of export orders remained higher than before the pandemic, but the flow of new orders was diminishing, most likely owing to the still acute bottlenecks.",
        "The recovery in the labour market continued to be strong.",
        "Unemployment had declined to 7.0% in December, which was the lowest unemployment rate since the creation of the euro area.",
        "The December 2021 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections foresaw a significant improvement in labour market conditions and the latest data were in line with that prediction.",
        "The number of people employed, which included workers in job retention schemes, was basically back to its pre-pandemic level in the third quarter of 2021.",
        "However, total hours worked were still below the pre-pandemic level, with the gap between the two measures mainly being explained by job retention schemes.",
        "Across sectors, the recovery in hours worked in services had accelerated more in the second and third quarters of 2021 than in the manufacturing sector.",
        "To assess how tight the labour market was, it was useful to look at the ratio between the vacancy rate and the unemployment rate and to compare this ratio across the euro area and the United States.",
        "In the United States, even before the pandemic there had been more jobs available than people unemployed, i.e.",
        "the ratio had been above one.",
        "While the ratio had fallen to below 0.5 in mid-2020, it had climbed back up to 1.5 at the end of 2021.",
        "By contrast, in the euro area although a pick-up could be observed in this ratio at the end of 2021, the number of vacancies posted was only around 30% of the number of people unemployed.",
        "Thus, the situation in the euro area was very different from that in the United States.",
        "Still, the outlook for employment in the euro area continued to be positive and to improve, with all euro area PMI employment indicators standing above the expansion threshold of 50.",
        "Turning to inflation, Eurostat’s HICP flash estimate for January had been released on the first day of the Governing Council meeting and had only been reflected in the analysis to a limited extent.",
        "The latest inflation data would be integrated more fully in the analysis for the March meeting.",
        "In recent months around half of the headline inflation rate had resulted directly from energy inflation, but the contribution of food prices had increased.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash release, headline inflation had increased slightly further to 5.1% in January 2021 – from 5.0% in December and 4.9% in November.",
        "This was substantially higher than foreseen in the December projections.",
        "Energy inflation had been very high in January, at 28.6%, with fuel prices accounting for the largest share of this figure.",
        "The rise in energy inflation could increasingly be explained both by higher electricity prices, which had been affected by various policies, and by higher gas prices.",
        "Prices for unprocessed food had exceeded their projected price increase by more than than prices for processed food.",
        "The latter mainly reflected increases in prices within the EU’s internal market amid global rises in both energy costs and prices for international commodities.",
        "With respect to non-energy industrial goods (NEIG) inflation, the contribution of durable goods had continued to increase, which could be attributed to supply bottlenecks as well as to the energy price rise.",
        "However, price dynamics for the other components of NEIG indicated that the increase in NEIG inflation was broad-based across items.",
        "The indirect contribution of energy to non-energy inflation items was relevant in this context, since all non-energy sectors used energy as an input.",
        "Typically, the energy input was less than 10% of overall costs, but energy price increases as high as 28.6% were going to affect many individual categories of goods.",
        "Further up the pricing chain, pipeline pressures for NEIG inflation continued to build up, partly reflecting the rise in energy production costs.",
        "Import prices for intermediate goods remained at unusually high levels and domestic producer price inflation for non-food consumer goods had increased further to stand at a new historical high.",
        "The annual rate of change in import prices for final non-food consumer goods, which had been negative for most of 2020 and had a dampening effect on NEIG inflation, had increased further and added to pipeline pressures for NEIG.",
        "This reflected both the higher goods prices that euro area importers had to pay but also the effect of the depreciation of the euro.",
        "A range of indicators of underlying inflation had moved up to levels above 2%.",
        "However, there were important temporary factors behind this, in particular the effects of bottlenecks and high energy prices.",
        "A rise in the price of energy increased the price level for other goods in the input-output matrix across the board.",
        "However, this did not necessarily imply that high inflation was going to persist.",
        "Historically, measures of underlying inflation were good predictors of future inflation, as they were to some extent designed to reflect persisting developments.",
        "But temporary factors were clearly also playing a role in the present situation.",
        "Comparing recent headline inflation developments in the euro area and the United States, many issues were similar in qualitative terms.",
        "However, in quantitative terms HICP inflation excluding food and energy (HICPX) stood at 2.6% in December in the euro area, while in the United States the CPI less food and energy was 5.5%.",
        "While part of the higher inflation in the United States could be explained by the higher increases in rents and their larger weight in the CPI, the biggest difference related to the effects on core inflation of supply disruptions, bottlenecks and the reopening of the economy.",
        "These effects had so far been much more evident in the US data.",
        "Turning to indicators of wage developments in the euro area, growth in negotiated wages had remained low in recent months, although the labour market was “hotter” in some countries than in others.",
        "Overall, however, there was no evidence of any big structural change in the behaviour of negotiated wages.",
        "Nor did expectations of labour costs point to any evidence so far of significant second-round effects from the current high level of inflation.",
        "Regarding sources of domestic inflation, it was noteworthy that in the euro area most energy was imported and import prices for energy had increased by almost 50% in the second half of 2021.",
        "This had led to a big drop in the terms of trade.",
        "This drop was essentially a tax on Europe paid to the rest of the world.",
        "The income effect of the deterioration in the terms of trade was estimated at around 2.5% of GDP.",
        "According to another calculation, the most recent balance of payments data showed that payments by EU countries for energy imports had risen from €200 billion in the first 11 months of 2020 to €335 billion in the first 11 months of 2021.",
        "This was a 66% increase.",
        "Thus the high energy price increases constituted a collective negative wealth effect on the European economy.",
        "Although the negative effect could be alleviated via taxes and subsidies, it would certainly affect macroeconomic dynamics.",
        "While the euro area was cushioned by the accumulated household savings, forecasters needed to take this negative wealth effect into account in the analysis of future spending and production decisions.",
        "Turning to longer-term inflation expectations, available survey indicators of longer-term inflation expectations had recently become re-anchored at 2% after they had dipped at the start of 2020.",
        "This was a success story and the strategy review had helped to achieve this.",
        "Anchoring inflation expectations at 2% was the foundation stone for meeting the ECB’s inflation target.",
        "Looking at the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters, the distribution of expectations for the first quarter of 2022 compared with the results of the survey a year ago showed that the mode (the most frequent answer) had increased to 2%, reflecting the centre of the distribution.",
        "Furthermore, of the forecasters who were still not expecting 2% inflation, most expected a figure below 2%.",
        "The share of forecasters expecting inflation above 2% remained relatively small, indicating that the risk of an upside unanchoring was hard to see.",
        "Thus there had been a convergence of longer-term inflation expectations to the ECB’s target.",
        "In the SMA the fraction of respondents expecting longer-term inflation to be below 2% was still sizeable, but had come down measurably over the last few survey rounds.",
        "Meanwhile, the proportion of participants expecting longer-term inflation to equal 2% had risen significantly, and there had been little movement in terms of the share who thought that inflation would be above 2% in the longer term.",
        "Market-based measures of medium to longer-term inflation compensation had been broadly stable at just below 2%, with the measures adjusted for risk premia being somewhat lower.",
        "With regard to financing conditions, these had overall remained favourable for all sectors.",
        "Although bank bond yields were rising in line with the wider bond market movement, there was little impact from this on overall bank funding costs.",
        "One reason was the continued application of negative interest rates to corporate and household deposits, while the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) also played a role.",
        "Overall, the borrowing rates facing firms and households remained low.",
        "The recovery in the volume of loans had continued, with the growth rate of loans to euro area firms increasing to 4.2% in December.",
        "Euro area banks had a generally benign view of the credit risk related to lending to firms.",
        "Credit standards remained largely unchanged (with the bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2021 indicating a slight tightening for loans to firms).",
        "The growth of loans to households continued to be supported by dynamic lending for house purchase, and credit standards for housing loans had remained unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2021.",
        "As regards monetary developments, the annual growth rate of M3 had slowed to 6.9% in December, which was partly related to base effects.",
        "Nonetheless, the short-term dynamics of money growth remained broadly stable.",
        "Household deposit inflows had moderated since April 2021, in the context of recovering consumption, lower real returns and the possible use of deposits to fund the purchase of property.",
        "Turning to fiscal policy, additional fiscal support had been agreed in response to the Omicron variant and energy price increases, leading to slightly weaker fiscal tightening in 2022 than expected in the December staff projections.",
        "The additional euro area sovereign financing needs were estimated to be less in 2022 than in 2021 and 2020, and less pressure was expected on the supply of bonds this year.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane stressed that the euro area economy continued to recover, although it was likely to remain subdued in the first quarter of 2022.",
        "While the current pandemic wave was weighing on economic activity, especially contact-intensive consumer services, it appeared less damaging to economic activity than previous waves.",
        "Although shortages of equipment, materials and labour in some sectors continued to hamper production of manufactured goods, delay construction and hold back the recovery in parts of the services sector, there were early signs, including in the January flash PMI release, that supply bottlenecks might be starting to ease.",
        "However, the substantial negative terms-of-trade shock generated by higher energy prices was reducing the purchasing power of households and the earnings of businesses, which restrained consumption and investment.",
        "At the same time, the labour market was improving further with unemployment coming down, which should support incomes.",
        "In overall terms, a strong pick-up in activity later in the year was still expected.",
        "The risks to the growth outlook remained broadly balanced over the medium term.",
        "Uncertainties related to the pandemic had abated, in view of the milder impact of the Omicron variant than had been feared.",
        "Growth could be stronger than expected if households became more confident and saved less than foreseen in the December projections.",
        "However, geopolitical tensions had increased, and a prolonged phase of high energy costs constituted a material downside risk to consumer spending and investment, while also increasing cost pressures in energy-intensive sectors and elevating the risk of second-round inflation effects through higher nominal wage settlements.",
        "Moreover, if supply bottlenecks failed to resolve at the pace envisaged in the December staff projections, growth could be negatively affected.",
        "A sharper than expected tightening in global financial conditions and a sharp slowdown in China related to property market developments constituted external risk factors that warranted monitoring.",
        "Inflation had surprised to the upside in both December and January, increasing to 5.0% and 5.1% respectively.",
        "Energy prices remained by far the most important factor for HICP inflation, with the direct impact accounting for over half of headline inflation in January and energy costs also pushing up prices across many sectors.",
        "Moreover, the indicators based on futures markets signalled a more prolonged phase of elevated energy prices during most of 2022.",
        "Food prices had also increased, reflecting unfavourable weather and harvest conditions, but also high transportation costs and the rising costs of fertilisers, which were both associated with the surge in the prices of commodities.",
        "The HICPX stood at 2.3% in January, down from 2.6% in December.",
        "The lower rate was mainly due to weaker dynamics in the NEIG component, as services price inflation remained unchanged.",
        "Overall, price gains had become more widespread, with the prices of a large number of goods and services having increased markedly.",
        "In this context, most measures of underlying inflation had risen, although the role of temporary pandemic factors and energy input costs meant that the persistence of these increases remained uncertain.",
        "According to a purely mechanical update of the latest short-term inflation projections, in the near term inflation was expected to be higher than projected in December and would likely remain above 2% for the rest of the year.",
        "At the same time, it was still expected that energy price dynamics would slow and the price pressures stemming from global supply bottlenecks would recede in the course of 2022.",
        "In addition, while labour market conditions were improving further, wage growth remained muted overall.",
        "Market and survey-based measures of inflation expections saw a sharp decline in inflation in 2023 and 2024 relative to 2022, while measures of longer-term inflation expectations had continued to converge to the 2% target.",
        "Importantly, these indicators did not suggest that there were signs of inflation expectations becoming unanchored to the upside.",
        "Compared with the December staff projections, risks to the inflation outlook were tilted to the upside, particularly in the near term.",
        "Inflation could be higher than anticipated over the next few months if the surge in energy prices intensified, especially if geopolitical tensions were to escalate further, if oil supply remained persistently sluggish, or if the bottlenecks in production and international commerce were to extend through the end of the year.",
        "Looking beyond the near term, inflation could be higher than foreseen if current price pressures fed through into higher than anticipated wage rises, or if the economy returned more quickly to full capacity than considered likely at present.",
        "But inflation could be lower than expected if the higher prices of energy and food were to exert a stronger than expected drag on consumption and investment, and thus suppress underlying inflation, or if downside risks to the world economic outlook materialised.",
        "Market interest rates had increased since the Governing Council’s December meeting, reflecting mainly firming expectations of monetary policy tightening at a global level.",
        "As a result, the date for a first interest rate hike implied in the forward curve had been brought forward, and markets were now pricing in a faster pace of interest rate normalisation after lift-off.",
        "Notwithstanding, bank lending rates for firms and households continued to stand at historically low levels, reflecting contained bank funding costs, helped by the terms of TLTRO funding.",
        "Overall, financing conditions for the economy remained supportive.",
        "Pending the March staff projection round, which would help in reassessing the implications for medium-term inflation of the new data accrued since December, Mr Lane proposed to maintain a steady course and reconfirm the December monetary policy stance.",
        "This would mean that, in view of the economic recovery and the reduction in downside risks to the medium-term inflation target, the Governing Council would discontinue net purchases under the PEPP at the end of March and would continue reducing the pace of asset purchases step by step over the coming quarters.",
        "But monetary support was still needed for the economy to advance further and for inflation to stabilise durably at the 2% target.",
        "In view of the many uncertainties that clouded the outlook, there was a need to maintain flexibility and optionality in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The Governing Council should therefore stand ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation stabilised at the 2% target over the medium term.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members expressed broad agreement with the assessment of the economic situation in the euro area and the risks to the outlook provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "As regards the external environment, the recovery of the world economy was continuing but faced a slowdown in the near term.",
        "This was especially the case in manufacturing, where suppliers’ delivery times had not shortened substantially.",
        "The main news since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting was considered to be the significant movement in energy commodity prices, which was, to a large extent, due to supply factors.",
        "These were associated in turn with the impact of geopolitical tensions.",
        "Given Europe’s dependence on energy imports and the need to replenish relatively low storage levels, it was argued that, looking ahead, a rise in geopolitical uncertainty might bring with it even higher and more persistent inflation.",
        "More generally, it was underlined that inflation was to a large extent a global phenomenon.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that there were important differences between the inflation developments in the United States and those in the euro area.",
        "The notion was put forward that in the euro area inflation essentially reflected a more persistent external supply shock, while in the United States it largely reflected domestic demand that had been fuelled by the more substantial fiscal stimulus, which was already feeding into higher wage growth.",
        "Turning to euro area developments, output had reached its pre-pandemic level at the end of 2021 despite a weakening of quarter-on-quarter growth to 0.3% in the final quarter of the year.",
        "Economic activity and demand were likely to remain muted in the early part of 2022 as pandemic containment measures were affecting activity in consumer services, and high energy costs were constraining consumption and investment.",
        "Supply bottlenecks continued to hamper production and were holding back the recovery in some sectors, and while there were signs that these might be starting to ease, they would nonetheless persist for some time.",
        "Looking beyond the near term, growth was likely to rebound strongly over the course of 2022, driven by robust domestic demand, the global recovery and the ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support.",
        "Members agreed that the economic recovery was continuing despite the bumpiness induced by the COVID-19 waves.",
        "It was argued that the spread of the Omicron variant did not constitute a major risk to economic developments, and it was observed that some countries were lifting protective measures, as hospitalisation and death rates were falling despite elevated infection rates.",
        "This allowed for more sustained growth dynamics and more normal business cycle dynamics in the period ahead.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that businesses saw supply chain bottlenecks lasting into 2023, which was longer than previously expected, despite some recent signs of attenuation.",
        "Looking through short-term volatility, it was argued that pent-up consumer demand was materialising, with the saving ratio receding from the high levels reached during the pandemic.",
        "However, it was pointed out that according to the latest available data, which were for the third quarter of 2021, the euro area saving ratio remained well above pre-pandemic levels and it might well have risen again since then, given the renewed pandemic restrictions in the winter.",
        "It was suggested that the decline was not necessarily being driven by a lower propensity to save income but by a drawdown of net financial assets and hence a temporarily higher propensity to consume out of wealth.",
        "In this respect, the savings that households and firms had accumulated were seen to be buffering consumption and investment against the impact of the adverse energy and terms-of-trade shock.",
        "Reference was made in particular to the strong rebound in corporate profits, which might allow firms to absorb part of the shocks via compression of margins.",
        "At the same time, pent-up demand pressures allowed some cost increases to be passed through more easily into consumer prices.",
        "However, it was also underlined that the terms-of-trade shock induced by the rise in energy prices was equivalent to a tax and a loss of disposable income which had to be borne by euro area households and firms.",
        "While many countries had introduced compensatory measures, it was pointed out that this loss was offset to only a very limited extent by fiscal measures, and, looking ahead, was likely to weigh on consumption and investment.",
        "It was widely noted that the labour market recovery had been robust and that unemployment had fallen to a historically low rate more quickly than expected.",
        "At the same time, job retention schemes were still being used.",
        "Shortages of skilled labour were becoming increasingly acute and less and less tied to specific sectors, although there were differences across euro area countries.",
        "Employment had recovered to pre-pandemic levels in terms of headcount, and survey data pointed to further strong employment growth ahead.",
        "In terms of total hours worked, however, the recovery was less advanced.",
        "This was seen as partly a consequence of the widely used government support measures aimed at retaining employment in the euro area.",
        "More generally, it was suggested that some aspects of labour market adjustments in the euro area, such as those associated with immigration and the rate at which workers change jobs, remained incomplete and uncertain.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that there was no evidence of a significant reduction in labour supply.",
        "On the other hand, it was cautioned that some of the acute labour shortages could prove more lasting and in some segments it was not clear whether and when workers who had withdrawn from the labour force would return.",
        "Regarding economic policies, it was reiterated that targeted and productivity-enhancing fiscal measures and structural reforms, attuned to the conditions in different euro area countries, were essential to complement monetary policy effectively.",
        "The pandemic crisis had demonstrated that monetary and fiscal policy working in concert could be very efficient.",
        "With regard to the fiscal side, reference was made to the compensatory measures that governments had recently introduced to buffer the impact of high energy costs on the purchasing power and real incomes of households.",
        "This was a clear manifestation of the important role of fiscal policy at this stage, as had been highlighted in Mr Lane’s introduction.",
        "It was widely remarked that further fiscal measures could be expected to be adopted, and that in some jurisdictions the fiscal measures were having a direct downward effect on measured headline inflation.",
        "A concern was expressed that a change in the monetary policy stance in this context could be seen to run counter to the additional accommodation provided by fiscal policy and hence weaken the “policy mix” at a time when fiscal policy was providing the targeted support to demand that was needed in the short term.",
        "Against this background, members assessed the risks to the economic outlook as broadly balanced over the medium term.",
        "The economy could perform more strongly than expected if households became more confident and saved less than expected.",
        "Although uncertainties related to the pandemic had abated somewhat, geopolitical tensions had increased.",
        "Furthermore, persistently high energy costs could exert a stronger than expected drag on consumption and investment.",
        "The pace at which supply bottlenecks were resolved was a further risk to the outlook for growth and inflation.",
        "With regard to price developments, members largely concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction, while underlining that the inflation picture had changed considerably since the Governing Council’s December assessment.",
        "Inflation had continued to be higher than projected and had increased both in December and in January, when it had reached 5.1%.",
        "In the near term inflation was likely to remain higher than previously anticipated.",
        "Energy prices continued to be the main reason for the elevated rate of inflation, with energy costs also pushing up prices of goods and services across many sectors.",
        "At the same time, price rises had become more widespread and most measures of underlying inflation had risen over recent months, although the role of temporary factors related to the pandemic meant that the persistence of these increases was uncertain.",
        "The December and January inflation releases were assessed in terms of magnitude, direction and surprise component.",
        "It was highlighted that for the euro area as a whole and for many countries, the January figure was the highest level reached since the introduction of the euro.",
        "Reference was made to double-digit or close to double-digit rates in some smaller economies.",
        "In one large euro area economy, a much lower inflation figure relative to that of the euro area as a whole was partly explained by government measures to contain energy price increases.",
        "In another case, a substantial increase in tariffs for electricity had caused a much higher outturn than expected.",
        "It was also noted that in a number of countries inflation had actually declined compared with December.",
        "Regardless of the magnitude and direction of the change, it was acknowledged that the January figures were significantly higher than had been expected for the euro area as well as for all countries across the forecasting community.",
        "This could be gauged from the reaction of markets to the release.",
        "It was stressed that a large part of the upward surprise was explained by energy inflation and it was argued that it thus stemmed from factors that did not reflect developments in the euro area domestic economy.",
        "However, it was noted that for the euro area as a whole all of the main HICP components had surprised on the upside, thus indicating broader price pressures than just those stemming from the energy component.",
        "It was observed that the surprise for January was the latest in a succession of underestimated outcomes and that it had occurred in spite of a large upward revision to the inflation outlook in the December staff projections.",
        "On the one hand, the exceptional size of the recent projection errors was seen to be a testament to the uncertainty that forecasters were currently facing.",
        "On the other hand, it was acknowledged that inflation could now be expected to be higher in the short run and that it would take longer for the inflation hump to recede.",
        "Reference was made to the mechanical update of the short-term projections incorporating the January figures, which suggested that inflation could remain well above 2% for the entire year.",
        "This implied inflation above 2% for an extended period of time and raised the question of whether the deviations from the inflation target could still be described as “moderate” and “transitory”.",
        "Such persistent deviations raised the risk that inflation could become entrenched in inflation expectations.",
        "Looking further ahead, it was suggested that increases in energy costs and other production costs had yet to pass fully through to consumer prices in large parts of the euro area and that the effect would then only show in the data for 2023.",
        "Doubts were expressed as to whether inflation in 2023 would be below 2% as anticipated in the December staff projections.",
        "It was argued that it had become increasingly likely that inflation would converge to 2% in the medium term, but from above the target rather than from below.",
        "Reference was made to the average error in the staff projections for projected inflation two years ahead, which was around three-quarters of a percentage point, and the fact that the recent downward bias in the projections followed a period of upward bias.",
        "This raised the questions of whether the underlying models were performing sufficiently well and whether the historical relationships underpinning the models and projections still held.",
        "Moreover, it was argued that the projected decline in inflation over the medium term was at odds with the fast absorption of labour market slack and strong demand in the coming years embedded in the December staff projections.",
        "This argued for putting more weight on other sources of information, such as surveys, expert judgement and incoming data, in assessing the medium-term outlook.",
        "It was recalled that a major element in the expected decline of inflation to below 2% over the medium term was the assumption included in the staff projections that energy commodity prices would evolve along their downward-sloping futures curves.",
        "Alternative technical assumptions, such as those derived from a “random walk” forecast, would result in inflation above 2% in 2023 and 2024.",
        "It was also remarked that the projections might underestimate the structural upward pressure on energy prices stemming from the green transition.",
        "In addition, it was argued that, although not yet part of the official HICP, the unprecedented rise in the costs of owner-occupied housing warranted consideration in the medium-term outlook.",
        "In the third quarter of 2021 these costs would have added 0.3 percentage points to HICP inflation and 0.6 percentage points to HICP inflation excluding energy and food.",
        "All members expressed concern over the latest upside surprises in the inflation figures, which were also apparent when looking at seasonally adjusted month-on-month price developments.",
        "It was remarked that the most vulnerable segments of the population were being hit hardest by high energy costs and inflation.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that what mattered for monetary policy was the nature of the underlying economic forces and the implications of those forces for the medium-term outlook.",
        "In addition, monetary policy needed to be forward-looking and not react mechanically to data releases related to past periods, such as the recent inflation figures.",
        "It was argued that a distinction between supply and demand, as well as between global and domestic influences, was more meaningful than simple dichotomies contrasting temporary and persistent shocks.",
        "In this respect, it was important to assess to what extent the latest inflation increases reflected the pass-through of past increases in global energy prices or instead pointed to changes in the domestic inflation process.",
        "It was observed that almost all of the upward revisions to euro area headline and core inflation between the September and December projection rounds could be explained by the energy price shock, when both direct and indirect effects were taken into account.",
        "This amounted to a large terms-of-trade shock to the euro area economy that implied substantial declines in real household incomes and corporate earnings which could translate into lower consumption and investment in the period ahead, in turn suggesting a downward impact on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In this context, it was reiterated that there were no incipient signs of sustained domestically generated inflation, as that would require higher wage growth and further upward moves in inflation expectations.",
        "In this respect, the lack of evidence of stronger contractual wage growth and the fact that inflation expectations remained well anchored were seen as the key missing elements in the inflation picture.",
        "Data on past wage growth, however, were a lagging indicator and did not provide timely signals about future inflation.",
        "This was especially true at present, when the available data related to a period in which the pandemic was still raging.",
        "More prominence should therefore be given to forward-looking indicators, such as those based on surveys.",
        "Reference was made to the results of the ECB’s Corporate Telephone Survey, which pointed to expectations of significantly higher wage growth compared with last year, as well as significant labour shortages and a strong pass-through of input prices to final consumer prices, possibly pointing to a steepening of the Phillips curve.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that the December staff projections had already anticipated wage growth of around 3% for all the years of the projection horizon and that this had been judged to be compatible with inflation projections of around 2%.",
        "The latest available data saw negotiated wages in the euro area growing by substantially less than 2%.",
        "While it was pointed out that there was no evidence so far of second-round effects associated with the current high inflation rates, members widely referred to an increased risk should inflation remain higher for longer.",
        "Inflation was outpacing wage growth in many countries.",
        "This eroded households’ purchasing power and was likely to trigger stronger wage increases over time.",
        "The view was expressed that for such second-round effects to emerge it did not matter whether the underlying drivers of inflation were supply or demand factors.",
        "Given the lagged nature of wage data, it would take some time before second-round effects could be observed in actual wage growth.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the backward-looking inflation component in the wage-setting process was a “stylised fact” and thus part of forecasting models predicated on historical relationships.",
        "Therefore, the prevailing high inflation rates would be incorporated into the upcoming March staff projections, although this would not imply per se an upward revision to the medium-term inflation outlook, given that the impact of the energy price shock and the terms-of-trade shock would likely influence projected inflation in the opposite direction.",
        "Against this background, compared with the expectations at the time of the December 2021 Governing Council meeting, risks to the inflation outlook were tilted to the upside, particularly in the near term.",
        "If price pressures fed through into higher than anticipated wage rises or the economy returned more quickly to full capacity, inflation could turn out to be higher.",
        "Overall, it was seen as important to await the outcome of the March staff projections for a more integrated and holistic assessment of the outlook, rather than jumping to conclusions based on partial analysis.",
        "As regards inflation expectations, members took note that market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation had remained just below 2% and survey-based indicators had increased to 2% in the latest rounds of the Survey of Professional Forecasters and Consensus Economics.",
        "This was seen as a welcome development and suggested that longer-term inflation expectations were well anchored at the 2% target, while there were no signs of unanchoring on the upside.",
        "At the same time, the rise in longer-term expectations and their surrounding probability distributions also indicated that there was no longer a risk of a downward unanchoring.",
        "The anchoring of inflation expectations was seen as a key element in the inflation outlook.",
        "It was reiterated that, in very uncertain times, more focus should be on the expectations of firms and households so as to assess whether high actual inflation implied a risk of unanchoring.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members widely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction that, overall, financing conditions for the euro area economy had remained favourable.",
        "While market interest rates had increased since the Governing Council’s December meeting, bank lending rates for firms and households had remained at historically low levels.",
        "Lending to firms had picked up across all maturities and robust demand for mortgages was sustaining lending to households.",
        "It was underlined that credit appeared to be flowing freely in the economy with no signs that firms and households with sound balance sheets were facing restrictions on their access to finance.",
        "Bank profitability had recovered and bank balance sheets remained solid.",
        "It was noted in this respect that ECB Banking Supervision had recently completed the 2021 Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) cycle, confirming the overall resilience of the euro area banking sector, with significant institutions having maintained solid capital and liquidity positions in 2021 well in excess of regulatory requirements.",
        "Banks were thus well placed to cope with the gradual removal of remaining supervisory support measures.",
        "Regarding the monetary policy stance, members underlined that financing conditions remained favourable for all sectors of the economy.",
        "However, it was remarked that there had been considerable interest rate spillovers from developments in the United States to market rates in the euro area.",
        "It was noted that the combination of expectations of monetary tightening at the global level, improved growth prospects, tightening labour markets, renewed upside surprises in inflation figures and rising inflation expectations had led markets to bring forward the expected date for a first ECB rate hike and to price in a faster normalisation after lift-off.",
        "This implied an endogenous tightening of financing conditions, although real interest rates remained deeply in negative territory.",
        "With respect to the implications for the monetary policy stance stemming from the inflation outlook, members concurred that the latest figures suggested that inflation was likely to remain elevated for longer than had been expected in December, with risks to the outlook remaining tilted to the upside, particularly in the near term.",
        "Accordingly, there was broad agreement that the situation had changed and that the inflation narrative needed to be adjusted, putting emphasis on optionality in the use of all instruments in the period ahead.",
        "The view was widely shared that convergence to the ECB’s medium-term inflation target was no longer a distant prospect, thus making the fulfilment of the forward guidance criteria more likely within a shorter time span.",
        "Some members argued that the likelihood that inflation would settle at around 2% over the medium term had already increased significantly, with the outlook coming close to satisfying the conditions established in the forward guidance on interest rates.",
        "This was seen as requiring a timely adjustment of the still highly accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "Net asset purchases and negative policy rates were no longer seen as consistent with the incoming data, as it was regarded as unlikely that inflation would drop below the target in the medium term.",
        "In this context it was underlined that any conclusion on whether the conditions in the forward guidance on interest rates had been met was not predicated on the staff projections but was up to the judgement of the Governing Council based on its assessment of all relevant information, with the staff macroeconomic projections being only one element.",
        "The remark was made that the performance of the projections models might be challenged by the prevailing high uncertainty, which was seen as a further reason for putting less weight on the projections relative to other sources of information.",
        "It was recalled that the current formulation of the Governing Council’s forward guidance on interest rates had been derived from the monetary policy strategy, which called for forceful and persistent monetary policy action in the presence of the effective lower bound on interest rates.",
        "However, it was remarked that the inflation outlook had evolved in the meantime and, at the present stage, the Governing Council should be careful not to introduce additional policy inertia (i.e.",
        "a slower pace of adjustment) when assessing the fulfilment of the forward guidance criteria.",
        "A scaling-back of monetary accommodation should commence, in line with the established forward guidance on sequencing (i.e.",
        "the order in which the different policy instruments operated).",
        "It was recalled that the Eurosystem was currently on track to buy a significant share of new issuances of euro area sovereign bonds, and this implied adding further policy accommodation at a time when inflation could be expected to be higher for longer than previously anticipated.",
        "It was also stressed that monetary policy needed to be forward-looking and that the longer the period of elevated inflation lasted, the higher the risk of material second-round effects would become.",
        "It was argued that the task of monetary policy in this environment was to ensure that inflation expectations remained firmly anchored and to avoid the risk of the prevailing high inflation becoming entrenched.",
        "Caution was expressed about basing the Governing Council’s assessment on wage data which were only available with a lag.",
        "In this environment, the main risk was no longer of tightening monetary policy too early but too late.",
        "An earlier monetary policy normalisation would reduce the risk of abrupt tightening later on, which could potentially be associated with high economic and social costs.",
        "Against this background, a number of these members were of the view that the forward guidance conditions were already broadly satisfied and expressed a preference for adjusting the forward guidance on the phasing-out of the APP at the present meeting.",
        "Other members, however, stressed that there were no signs of an upside unanchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area.",
        "The increase in inflation expectations towards 2% observed since the previous summer had to be considered a welcome development.",
        "While downside risks to price stability had clearly receded, it was regarded as premature to draw conclusions as to whether the conditions in the forward guidance on interest rates had already been met without a full assessment of the implications of the energy price shock for the medium-term inflation outlook that would only become available with the March ECB staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "It was also stressed that it remained an open question whether the outcome of the March projections would show inflation reaching the ECB’s target durably within the projection horizon, which was a key condition for considering a rate increase under the forward guidance.",
        "Moreover, it was underlined that such a scenario was conditional on financing conditions remaining favourable.",
        "With respect to the staff projections, it was emphasised that the exceptional uncertainty around the duration of the inflation spike needed to be explained, including the role of the energy price assumptions in determining the inflation outlook.",
        "It was recalled that the Governing Council’s credibility was above all founded on its ability to maintain price stability, which contributed to the well-being of the European people.",
        "Against this background, it was maintained that the Governing Council should avoid an overreaction to inflation developments that were assessed as being short-lived.",
        "Changing the stance and the related communication at the current meeting was seen as premature and could jeopardise the recovery, as the December Eurosystem staff projections still showed inflation remaining below the Governing Council’s target in the medium term without any visible signs of an unanchoring of inflation expectations or any sound evidence of emerging second-round effects on wages.",
        "All in all, members widely agreed that the March ECB staff macroeconomic projections would allow the Governing Council to assess in greater depth the implications for the medium-term inflation outlook of the new data accrued since December.",
        "It was noted that in view of the limited time until the Governing Council’s March meeting, incoming information was unlikely to lead to a substantially different or more benign inflation assessment but might instead imply another upward revision to the inflation outlook for the coming quarters.",
        "It was also cautioned, however, that, despite the latest higher than expected inflation outcomes, the extent of possible revisions in the March projections, in particular for the medium-term outlook, remained an open issue.",
        "A structured and quantitative evaluation of all relevant factors forming the basis of the projection exercise would provide the Governing Council with important information that would help to put the evolution of the monetary policy stance on more solid ground.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement that a gradual normalisation of the monetary policy stance continued to be appropriate.",
        "It was recalled that at the December meeting the Governing Council had already started this normalisation process by announcing the discontinuation of net asset purchases under the PEPP and the step-by-step reduction of its asset purchases, as well as its expectation that the special interest rate period of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) would end in June.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that a clear distinction needed to be made between the interest rate forward guidance and the guidance for APP net purchases, which was based on a different criterion, namely the need to reinforce the accommodative impact of the ECB’s policy rates.",
        "A gradual and flexible conduct of monetary policy was seen as critical.",
        "To this end, there was a need to maintain sufficient optionality with respect to the time horizon for adjusting the Governing Council’s policy instruments in a data-driven manner.",
        "In addition, heightened geopolitical risks were seen as calling for a very prudent approach to normalisation.",
        "In this context, the Governing Council needed to recognise that the elevated inflation figures were partly a result of global shocks and were neither caused by monetary policy nor could they be addressed by monetary policy without causing a sharp fall in domestic demand at a time when the economy was still recovering from the pandemic shock.",
        "It was generally deemed important for the Governing Council to emphasise that it would maintain a clear and predictable path for its policy actions, based on its careful and regular assessment of the outlook for the economy and for inflation.",
        "Against this background, members widely agreed that the Governing Council should confirm its forward guidance on the sequence of its different policy measures, which would entail ending net asset purchases under the APP before raising the key ECB policy rates and finally phasing out reinvestments.",
        "It needed to be recalled that the Governing Council’s forward guidance and forward-looking communication was always data-dependant, reflecting an expectation or a probability assessment that was conditional on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Overall, the Governing Council should use optionality to fine-tune the timing of the different milestones of its forward guidance in such a way that the medium-term inflation outlook converged to the ECB’s target of 2%.",
        "In this context it was recalled that the Governing Council had a wide range of instruments at its disposal to ensure sufficient flexibility in gradually normalising the monetary policy stance in line with the evolving situation.",
        "Members also widely agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to confirm the decisions taken at the Governing Council’s December meeting, namely to discontinue net asset purchases under the PEPP at the end of March and to continue reducing the pace of net purchases step by step over the coming quarters.",
        "In adapting the inflation narrative and communication, it had to be acknowledged that inflation had continued to turn out higher than anticipated and was expected to remain elevated for some time, which could augment risks of second-round effects in the period ahead.",
        "Compared with the assessment in December, upside risks to the inflation outlook had increased, particularly in the near term.",
        "Regarding communication, it was emphasised that the inflation narrative and communication needed to be adapted in order to retain or increase optionality in the period ahead.",
        "As the increase in inflation was becoming longer-lasting than initially expected, it was remarked that the Governing Council should avoid characterising inflation developments as temporary or transitory and instead stress its assessment that inflation was expected to decline in the course of the year.",
        "Compared with December the outlook had changed and the likelihood of seeing inflation rates below 2% in 2023 had decreased significantly.",
        "At the same time, communication had to highlight the gradual, data-driven approach to monetary policy normalisation to ensure that inflation stabilised at the 2% target over the medium term.",
        "In the light of the increased uncertainty and the heightened upside risks to the inflation outlook, the general view prevailed that the Governing Council should convey its increased alertness and should monitor incoming information carefully, in particular regarding second-round effects.",
        "Communicating the possibility of faster progress on the path of policy normalisation – should such a decision be warranted by an updated medium-term outlook for inflation – was seen as a means to ensure that the Governing Council had at its disposal sufficient policy flexibility at its upcoming meetings on the basis of data that would become available.",
        "It was underlined that the Governing Council had to reaffirm its determination to adjust all of its instruments, maintaining more than ever flexibility and optionality in a situation of exceptionally high uncertainty.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council confirmed the decisions taken at its monetary policy meeting last December and as set out in the dedicated press release published after the meeting.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 13-14 April 2022, there had been a major shift in monetary policy expectations and actions around the world as inflation had continued to surprise to the upside.",
        "The main developments in financial markets revolved around four main themes.",
        "First, volatility in financial markets was high by historical standards, reflecting the longer than expected persistence of high inflation and the associated uncertainty about the extent and pace of monetary policy adjustment required to restore price stability over the medium term.",
        "Second, monetary policy normalisation in the euro area was expected to proceed at a significantly faster pace than at the time of the Governing Council’s 13-14 April meeting, with a rate lift-off expected in July.",
        "Third, expectations of a steeper policy path contributed to halting and partly reversing both the rise in inflation risk premia and the marked depreciation of the euro, thereby offsetting part of the renewed rise in oil prices.",
        "Fourth, changes in monetary policy expectations had brought the valuations of riskier assets closer to their long-term averages, in both fixed income and stock markets.",
        "The increase in volatility witnessed globally over the previous few months had been reflected in higher implied volatility across virtually all main asset classes: bonds, equities and foreign exchange.",
        "The higher volatility went hand in hand with a deterioration in market liquidity.",
        "While such volatility was not surprising at turning points in monetary policy, its magnitude had been amplified by the combination of shocks hitting the world economy: the war in Ukraine, the energy transition, global excess demand and China’s zero-COVID policy.",
        "Three sources of policy uncertainty were behind the current volatility: (i) the extent of the required policy adjustment, (ii) the pace of the policy adjustment, and (iii) the transmission of changes in policy rates to market interest rates and bank lending rates.",
        "Regarding the first source of uncertainty, related to the extent of the required policy adjustment in the euro area and other major currency areas, investors had significantly repriced expected terminal rates – the peak interest rates expected by markets at the end of the normalisation or tightening cycle not corrected for term premia.",
        "This strong repricing of terminal rates had been a major factor in the recent increase in nominal long-term bond yields.",
        "While, in 2021, the rise in nominal ten-year overnight index swap (OIS) rates had been driven by rising inflation compensation, the real ten-year rate had increased markedly in 2022.",
        "Market feedback suggested that the uncertainty about the extent of policy normalisation was driven by two main factors: uncertainty about the level of the neutral rate, and hence the level of the equilibrium real rate of interest, and uncertainty about the need to take policy rates above the neutral rate.",
        "The second source of uncertainty, which related to the pace of policy adjustment, meant markets had not only repriced the terminal rate but were also expecting a significantly swifter policy normalisation than at the time of the Governing Council’s 13-14 April meeting.",
        "Surveys continued to lag market prices.",
        "The pace of policy adjustment expected by investors was dependent on the perceived degree of anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations.",
        "Survey-based measures of inflation expectations gave different indications regarding the risks of unanchoring, depending on the underlying sample.",
        "Market-based measures of long-term inflation compensation had declined from their decade-high level recorded in April but had started to rise again lately and remained above 2%.",
        "These developments reflected markets’ changing views on the likelihood of a recession, in particular market expectations of a resilient growth outlook, as well as the ECB’s communication pointing towards a rate lift-off in July.",
        "The ECB’s communication had been an important factor behind the decline in inflation risk premia at longer horizons, as it emphasised the commitment to protect price stability.",
        "The third source of uncertainty in financial markets related to the expected strength of the transmission of changes in the key ECB interest rates to money market and bank lending rates.",
        "The weaker the expected transmission, the stronger and swifter the required policy adjustment in the eyes of investors.",
        "The strength of policy transmission also depended on the extent and expected pace of a decline in excess liquidity.",
        "Excess liquidity was now expected to decline more slowly than previously assumed.",
        "This was because higher expectations of a prospective rise in the key ECB interest rates would lead banks to postpone repayment of the funds from targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs).",
        "Changes in policy rate expectations had been transmitted to broader financial markets.",
        "Equities had sold off as expected, coming down from the elevated levels that had been underpinned by historically low real interest rates.",
        "At the same time, since the 13-14 April monetary policy meeting, euro area stock markets had outperformed other indices despite expectations of a steeper policy path.",
        "In euro area fixed income markets, spreads had continued to widen as markets repriced the future path of policy.",
        "Despite challenging liquidity conditions and elevated volatility, neither sovereign bond markets nor corporate bond markets had seen excessive moves.",
        "However, there had been a marked differentiation across issuers.",
        "Spreads had increased the most in Italy and Greece, where debt-to-GDP ratios were highest, and for corporate high-yield issuers, for whom credit risk was the largest.",
        "Spreads had increased less in Spain and Portugal and for corporate investment grade issuers.",
        "Although expectations of monetary policy tightening had firmed almost everywhere, the euro had appreciated visibly against the currencies of many advanced economies since the Governing Council’s meeting on 13-14 April.",
        "The US dollar was the most notable exception.",
        "The marked and persistent depreciation of the euro against the US dollar, the currency in which oil imports were predominately invoiced, had tangible and immediate effects on inflation, and therefore on inflation expectations.",
        "Since May 2021, oil prices had increased by 88% in US dollar terms but by 111% in euro terms.",
        "At the same time, the ECB’s communication since the start of the year had provided a counterweight to the downward pressure on the euro that had resulted primarily from the forceful action of the Federal Reserve System.",
        "All in all, the outlook for inflation and hence for monetary policy would remain a key driver of asset prices for the foreseeable future.",
        "In this context, higher volatility was a natural reflection of price discovery in an environment in which central banks found it harder to provide clear forward guidance given the uncertainty around the policy outlook.",
        "Mr Lane went through the latest economic, monetary and financial developments in the global economy and the euro area.",
        "Starting with the international environment, there had been a noticeable slowdown in the global trade of goods in the first quarter of 2022.",
        "The most recent data for March pointed to the contraction being largely driven by developments in China.",
        "As lockdown measures there had continued into the second quarter, it was likely that the loss of global trade momentum would persist.",
        "The war in Ukraine and the lockdown in China had interrupted the easing in global supply pressures in March.",
        "In the euro area, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) delivery times had deteriorated in March, but in May there was some improvement.",
        "Looking at exchange rates, the euro was marginally weaker against the US dollar, while it had appreciated slightly in nominal effective terms since the Governing Council’s 13-14 April meeting.",
        "Oil prices had increased notably since the April meeting.",
        "The June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area were therefore based on higher oil prices, but the slope of the futures curve remained negative.",
        "Other commodity prices had moderated since the meeting, with gas, metals and food prices declining.",
        "The June staff projections had seen a significant downward revision of world growth, with the projection for 2022 down from 4.1% to 3.0%.",
        "The lower projected growth implied a downward revision of euro area foreign demand, especially in 2023.",
        "Turning to the euro area, real GDP had grown by 0.6% in the first quarter of 2022 according to Eurostat’s latest estimate.",
        "However, excluding Ireland, euro area GDP was up by only 0.3%.",
        "The contribution of domestic demand to euro area growth had been negative, amid the lockdowns at the start of the quarter and the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.",
        "The June staff projections had revised the quarterly GDP profile down but still embodied a significant recovery over the summer and into the fourth quarter.",
        "Short-term estimates were subject to high uncertainty for the rest of the year.",
        "The projections had generally been within the range of the available short-term forecasting tools, but the range of these estimates was wide on account of the high uncertainty.",
        "Indicators of uncertainty had risen sharply following the outbreak of the war, especially for manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, services.",
        "The PMI composite indicator was still above 50, but the PMI for manufacturing output had fallen as the indicator of services business activity had risen.",
        "With regard to private consumption, households were increasingly feeling the squeeze on their real incomes from rising energy and food prices.",
        "The Consumer Expectations Survey showed that households did not expect to be able to maintain consumption in real terms.",
        "The survey also pointed to a reduction in saving flows.",
        "Housing investment was affected by a jump in input costs.",
        "Construction used materials that relied on imported commodities.",
        "As a result, shortages of materials and equipment continued to accumulate in the construction sector.",
        "Rising construction costs were expected to put a break on growth in housing investment.",
        "The Consumer Expectations Survey indicated that the perceived attractiveness of housing as an investment was decreasing.",
        "The elevated uncertainty was expected to weigh on housing investment over the course of the year.",
        "Data on capital goods production had shown a significant recovery at the end of 2021 with the rebound in car production.",
        "Following the outbreak of the war, however, production in the sector had seen little progress.",
        "The euro area goods trade balance had deteriorated owing to the rising cost of imported energy and food.",
        "The overall trade balance had deteriorated by about 4 percentage points since the start of 2021, of which about 2.5 percentage points was due to the energy and food balance.",
        "This captured the real income cost of having to pay more money to the rest of the world.",
        "A key reason for the good third-quarter prospects was tourism, by far the sector hit hardest by the pandemic.",
        "All available indicators were pointing to a very strong recovery, with expectations for demand in the summer months well above their pre-pandemic levels.",
        "For the labour market, the evidence suggested that the very good recovery had continued in the first quarter of 2022.",
        "Growth in employment was overall consistent with a return to the pre-pandemic relationship between GDP and employment, after the break caused by the pandemic and the support measures put in place.",
        "This also meant that the recovery in economic activity currently explained most of the recovery in employment.",
        "The unemployment rate had declined again in April, in particular in countries such as Spain, where the recovery in tourism had helped to create jobs.",
        "Survey data continued to signal favourable labour market developments.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, the June staff projections had incorporated a significant amount of new support measures related to the war and compensation for energy price increases.",
        "These new measures amounted to roughly 1% of GDP for the euro area as a whole, with the figure varying across countries.",
        "GDP growth was expected to be supported mainly in 2022, as some of the measures were likely to be withdrawn later in the forecast horizon.",
        "Their impact on inflation was expected to be on the downside in 2022 and to largely reverse in 2023, owing to the temporary nature of the energy compensation measures.",
        "In terms of euro area fiscal balances, a gradual rolling back of the deficit continued to be expected, although the new projections signalled slower progress than foreseen in March.",
        "Nonetheless, thanks to the higher nominal GDP, the debt-to-GDP ratio was still expected to decline despite higher interest payments.",
        "Moving on to the latest inflation developments, headline inflation had increased further in May, with the largest contribution again from energy.",
        "All categories of energy inflation, not only fuel, were important factors behind the evolution of energy inflation.",
        "However, the contributions of all categories of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had increased.",
        "The May outcomes for both headline HICP inflation and HICP inflation excluding energy and food were above the June staff projections.",
        "While forecast errors were made in all components, the largest was in food inflation.",
        "The intensification of pipeline pressures was one reason for the upward revision of the inflation projections for 2023 and, to some extent, for 2024.",
        "Pipeline pressures could take a long time to be transmitted to headline inflation, but one of the key uncertainties was that there could currently be a faster pass-through because of the scale of the increases in pipeline pressures.",
        "At the same time, a faster pass-through could also mean a shorter adjustment period afterwards, so that the pass-through could lead to a stronger effect on inflation in the near term, but a weaker effect once the price level had adjusted.",
        "Core inflation had clearly risen.",
        "Continued analysis was needed of those components of core inflation that were moving up.",
        "It was often the case that all components of core inflation rose together, which could be described as a general inflation impulse.",
        "By contrast, current core inflation was essentially characterised by a lot of relative price movements as a result of the reopening of certain sectors.",
        "For goods inflation, staff analysis showed that energy prices and bottlenecks accounted for about 0.8 percentage points and 1 percentage point of the increase respectively.",
        "However, goods inflation might also have been affected by the green transition.",
        "The recovery in domestic demand was also playing a role.",
        "Services inflation was not developing in the same way across all sectors.",
        "Contact-intensive sectors were contributing the most to the increase in services inflation.",
        "The oil-sensitive services sectors were also seeing a large increase in their contributions to services inflation, suggesting that energy was also having significant indirect effects on services inflation.",
        "Overall, the reopening of the economy and energy price increases explained much of the dynamics in services inflation.",
        "Moving to wages, growth in negotiated wages had seen a considerable increase in the first quarter, largely owing to one-off payments.",
        "When excluding these, the increase was considerably more moderate.",
        "The forward-looking wage tracker for the euro area, which was an aggregation of data for four of the euro area’s five largest economies, indicated that wage growth obtained on the basis of what had been negotiated this year and covering also next year was around 3% in 2022 and 2.6% in 2023.",
        "This represented an increase from the current figure for negotiated wages, but the increase was well below what Eurosystem staff were projecting in terms of aggregate wage dynamics.",
        "Wage expectations remained contained according to the Consumer Expectations Survey.",
        "Looking at how firms were coping with the spike in costs, unit profits had weakened significantly in the first quarter of 2022, after increasing steadily during 2021.",
        "This seemed to suggest that rising input costs meant that unit profits had to absorb them.",
        "The latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises indicated – based on qualitative replies – that firms in most industries expected to increase their selling prices over the next 12 months.",
        "This applied, in particular, to those sectors that had seen the highest cost increases, namely construction, industry and trade, while the share of respondents expecting higher increases in services was smaller.",
        "Turning to the assumptions in the June staff projections, Mr Lane noted that, compared with the December 2021 staff projections, the oil price was almost 40% higher.",
        "At the same time, the trade-weighted exchange rate of the euro for 2022 was currently 1.4% weaker, while the exchange rate against the US dollar was four times weaker than the trade-weighted exchange rate.",
        "Long-term yields were also 116 basis points higher for 2022 than expected last December, and short-term yields were 44 basis points higher.",
        "Developments in oil and exchange rates had played a major role in inflation forecast errors, but the inflation rate would have been even higher without the tightening of assumptions that had taken place in 2022.",
        "The June staff projections also contained a wealth of sensitivity analyses and a downside scenario.",
        "This was a way to capture non-linearities.",
        "Regarding financial developments, since the 13-14 April Governing Council meeting euro area risk-free rates had increased further as market participants revised their expectations of an earlier tightening of monetary policy.",
        "However, correcting the forward curve for risk premia gave indications similar to those in the latest Survey of Monetary Analysis.",
        "It was important to note that, in the course of 2022, a significant increase and steepening of real interest rates could be observed.",
        "Since the Governing Council meeting on 15-16 December, looking at the term structure of real forward rates, there had been a 1.5-percentage point increase in real forward rates at the very long end for the one-year forward rate nine years ahead contract.",
        "From the two-year forward rate contract onwards, there had been an increase in real rates of around 1 percentage point or more.",
        "With regard to inflation expectations, those reflected in the Survey of Monetary Analysts had previously fallen to below 2% for 2024 but were now expected to be at 2% from 2024 onwards and to stay there durably.",
        "So this survey was closely aligned with the view that inflation would come down to close to target in 2024 and stay there.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation compensation still saw inflation peaking in the very near term and declining across maturities thereafter.",
        "Price-level effects were permanent, but it remained the case that market participants envisaged a sizeable reduction in inflation dynamics.",
        "Masked by the recent slight decline, longer-term measures of inflation compensation, such as the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, had temporarily increased well above target since the last meeting.",
        "Estimates of genuine inflation expectations at the five-year horizon five years ahead – obtained by purging plain market data of inflation risk premia – had also increased recently.",
        "These estimates, including those from new models with a shifting endpoint, now stood closer to – but still below – 2%, amid high model uncertainty.",
        "Allowing for the treatment of risk premia, the expectation that inflation would come back to the target remained the narrative.",
        "However, the inflation risk premium was capturing the upside risks.",
        "For consumer inflation expectations three years ahead, the Consumer Expectations Survey for April pointed to a slight decline since March, with the median down from 2.9% to 2.7%.",
        "In May, there was a further slight decrease to 2.5%.",
        "At the same time, the results indicated heightened uncertainty.",
        "Moving to lending to firms and households, flows remained positive.",
        "Credit growth to firms had remained positive, but that was partly a rotation away from bond issuance, which had become more expensive than bank borrowing.",
        "The picture for households was mixed, as there had been some recovery in credit for consumption but still not to the pre-pandemic level.",
        "It remained the case that, in aggregate, households still had a lot of savings.",
        "On financing costs, so far bank lending rates and credit conditions had, by and large, been insulated from the increase in market rates.",
        "This was explained by the fact that deposit rates remained low and deposit funding remained readily available, as people were still holding a lot of money in deposits.",
        "Mortgage rates were picking up more in some countries than in others, displaying some correlation with sovereign yields and with bank deposit rates, although there had not yet been a significant pass-through.",
        "There were so far no strong signs of a big slowdown in mortgage lending, but this picture might change rapidly, as in some countries mortgage rates had already moved significantly.",
        "In summary, Mr Lane stressed that there had been a further significant increase of 8.1% in HICP inflation in May, up from 7.4% in April.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food had increased to 3.8%, from 3.5% in April.",
        "The higher rate reflected a rise in both non-energy industrial goods inflation, from 3.8% to 4.2%, and services inflation, from 3.3% to 3.5%.",
        "So far, negotiated wage growth in the euro area had remained moderate, especially when excluding one-off payments.",
        "The forward-looking wage tracker that incorporated the latest wage settlements showed an uptick in nominal wage increases but still at a moderate pace.",
        "Nevertheless, wage formation warranted careful monitoring, particularly in a context in which the labour market had become tighter and some countries were implementing increases in minimum wages.",
        "The future path of headline inflation had been revised up significantly in the June staff projections, especially for the near term.",
        "These projections indicated that inflation would remain undesirably elevated for still some time.",
        "Over the projection horizon, wage growth was now expected to rise to levels well above the historical average.",
        "HICP inflation was projected to stand at 6.8% in 2022 (1.7 percentage points higher than in the March staff projections), before declining to 3.5% in 2023 (1.4 percentage points higher) and further to 2.1% in 2024 (0.2 percentage points higher).",
        "This meant that headline inflation in the final year of the projection horizon was projected to be slightly above target.",
        "The decline over the projection horizon reflected the moderation in energy and food commodity prices that was embedded in current futures prices, the fading of pandemic effects, a gradual easing of supply bottlenecks and the normalisation of monetary policy.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food had also been revised up over the entire projection horizon.",
        "It was now expected to be 3.3% in 2022 (0.7 percentage points higher than in the March staff projections), 2.8% in 2023 (1.0 percentage point higher) and 2.3% in 2024 (0.4 percentage points higher).",
        "The upward revision reflected the ongoing reopening of the economy, especially in some services, the re-emergence of some supply disruptions, tightening labour markets and a pick-up in wage increases.",
        "At the same time, core inflation was expected to decline over the projection horizon owing to the fading impact of the pandemic, the easing of bottlenecks and the indirect contribution of the current surge in energy prices falling away.",
        "The assumption that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored and the rising level of market interest rates throughout the projection horizon also contributed to a sustained decline in headline inflation towards the ECB’s target by the end of 2024.",
        "Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets and from expert surveys stood at around 2%.",
        "At the same time, initial signs of above-target revisions in those measures warranted close monitoring.",
        "Risks to inflation projections were primarily on the upside, especially in relation to 2022 and 2023.",
        "The risks to the medium-term inflation outlook included a durable worsening of the production capacity of the economy, higher energy and food prices, longer-term inflation expectations rising above the ECB’s target and higher than anticipated wage rises.",
        "However, if demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressures on prices.",
        "Turning to the growth forecast in the June staff projections, countervailing forces had resulted in a marked downward revision to real GDP growth for 2022 and 2023.",
        "Real GDP growth was now expected to be 2.8% in 2022 (0.9 percentage points lower than in the March staff projections) and 2.1% in 2023 (0.7 percentage points lower).",
        "However, stronger growth, at 2.1%, was expected in 2024 owing to catch-up effects (0.5 percentage points higher than in the March staff projections).",
        "Taken together, the revisions implied a lower level of GDP throughout the projection horizon.",
        "Risks relating to the pandemic had declined but the war continued to be a significant downside risk to growth.",
        "In particular, a major risk would be a further disruption in the energy supply to the euro area, as reflected in the downside scenario included in the staff projections.",
        "Furthermore, if the war were to escalate, economic sentiment could worsen, supply-side constraints could increase, and energy and food costs could remain persistently higher than expected.",
        "Markets had priced in a sequence of ECB rate hikes.",
        "Increases in risk-free rates had been amplified in euro area sovereign bond yields and corporate bond yields, while bank lending rates were also starting to rise.",
        "Lower equity prices had also contributed to a tightening in financial conditions.",
        "On the basis of this updated assessment, it was appropriate to take further steps in normalising monetary policy: First, the Governing Council should announce that net asset purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) would end as of 1 July.",
        "This would be consistent with communication after the March and April meetings and in line with the stated sequencing, i.e.",
        "the prior action opening the door to a first rate hike at the July meeting.",
        "Furthermore, the Governing Council should reiterate and update its forward guidance on the length of the horizon for full reinvestment under the APP.",
        "Rather than referring to the need to maintain “favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation”, which up to now had been the Governing Council’s language on the reinvestment period, it should state the need to ensure “ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance”.",
        "Second, the Governing Council should communicate that it saw the conditions of its forward guidance on raising the ECB’s policy rates as satisfied.",
        "The first condition of the forward guidance stated that inflation should be seen reaching the target of 2% well ahead of the end of the projection horizon.",
        "The second condition required inflation to be stabilising at that level durably for the rest of the projection horizon.",
        "In fact, the June staff projections saw inflation exceeding the target by a wide margin in 2023 and, more moderately, for a substantial part of 2024.",
        "The third condition stipulated that the realised progress in underlying inflation needed to be judged as sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term.",
        "The most recent data confirmed that underlying inflation dynamics were strengthening and broadening.",
        "First, core inflation was expected to stand above target over the entire projection horizon – albeit on a declining path.",
        "Second, a wide range of statistical filters, used to extract the underlying common factor and time trend explaining price changes cross-sectionally and over time, suggested that inflation dynamics were not likely to return to the pre-pandemic below-target configuration.",
        "Third, the latest wage settlements were also in line with a stronger trend consistent with inflation stabilising at the target in the medium term.",
        "Accordingly, and in line with the ECB’s policy sequencing, the Governing Council should express its intention to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at its monetary policy meeting in July.",
        "The Governing Council should also state that it expected to raise the key ECB interest rates again in September and signal that the scale of the rate increase in September would depend on the updated medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "There were several factors justifying the signal that the intended first increment in July should be 25 basis points.",
        "First, a moderate initial increase was most likely to foster a continuing orderly market adjustment amid high uncertainty.",
        "Second, longer-term inflation expectations remained anchored at the ECB’s target.",
        "Third, based on a yield curve that reflected underlying expectations of a gradual but sustained sequence of rate increases over 2022 and 2023, inflation was projected to return close to target in 2024.",
        "Fourth, the most effective way to manage the upside risks to medium-term inflation was to be clear about the ECB’s reaction function.",
        "This meant communicating that larger increments or a faster sequence of moderate rate increases would be appropriate if such risks intensified or materialised.",
        "Given the current projections and the high degree of uncertainty, a larger, pre-emptive initial increment ran the risk of triggering excessive adjustments in market interest rates.",
        "That could be counterproductive, especially if the upside risks failed to materialise.",
        "Moreover, in terms of inflation dynamics, which in any event would only be affected with a considerable lag, deferring a larger increment to a subsequent meeting would not make a material difference.",
        "These considerations suggested that a 25-basis point increment was a proportionate first step.",
        "In addition, opening the door to a larger increment in September would also allow the Governing Council to benefit from an updated set of projections and from observing the impact of the first rate hike on financial conditions over the summer.",
        "This step-by-step approach to interest rate adjustment during the third quarter would signal determination to exit the negative rate policy expeditiously, while also reasserting the value of optionality in a context fraught with multiple sources of risk.",
        "More generally, the Governing Council should be clear that the future path of policy interest rates would be data-dependent and determined by its commitment to stabilise inflation at 2% over the medium term.",
        "Looking beyond the third quarter, the Governing Council should signal that, based on its current assessment, it anticipated that a gradual but sustained path of further increases in interest rates would be appropriate.",
        "The pace at which the Governing Council adjusted its monetary policy would depend on the incoming data and how the Governing Council assessed inflation to develop in the medium term.",
        "If the medium-term inflation outlook were to deteriorate, the pace of rate increases would accelerate.",
        "Likewise, if the medium-term inflation outlook were to moderate, the pace would be slower.",
        "Throughout this process, gradualism, flexibility, optionality and data-dependence would be important considerations in setting out the path for interest rates.",
        "The likelihoods of the different scenarios would depend – among other factors – on how quickly current price pressures abated, the evolution of excess capacity and the degree to which inflation expectations continued to remain anchored at the ECB’s target.",
        "Finally, the Governing Council should confirm that, as announced previously, the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III would end on 23 June 2022.",
        "The sequential plan had several attractive elements.",
        "First, ending net asset purchases before raising rates would avoid the ECB’s monetary policy instruments working in opposite directions, thereby mitigating volatility and minimising financial stability risks.",
        "Moving sequentially would allow the Governing Council to observe how the market adjusted to the end of the net asset purchases and to this pivot in the process of policy normalisation.",
        "Second, what mattered most for the monetary policy stance was not so much the level of the overnight interest rate at present but the path that the rate was expected to follow over the coming months and years.",
        "A moderate hike at lift-off had the additional benefit that it would foster an orderly adjustment in financing conditions, reducing volatility.",
        "Finally, flexibility would help the Governing Council to ensure the smooth and even transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy across the entire euro area during the process of policy normalisation.",
        "In line with its monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council should also use the present meeting to consider its biannual assessment of the interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability.",
        "On the evidence available, from a financial stability perspective, the environment had worsened since December 2021 – the most recent review period – especially in the short term.",
        "In particular, lower growth and increasing cost pressures, as well as rising risk-free rates and sovereign bond yields, could lead to a further deterioration in the financing conditions faced by borrowers, especially in some countries.",
        "At the same time, tighter financing conditions could reduce some existing financial stability vulnerabilities over the medium term.",
        "Banks, which had started the year with solid capital positions and improving asset quality, were now facing greater credit risk.",
        "The Governing Council would watch these factors closely.",
        "In any case, macroprudential policy remained the first line of defence in preserving financial stability and addressing medium-term vulnerabilities.",
        "As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane that global trade had seen an important loss of momentum in the first quarter of 2022, mainly as a result of developments in China.",
        "The war in Ukraine and the lockdown in China had halted the gradual easing of global supply pressures that had started at the end of 2021.",
        "In this respect, it was important to monitor the latest data for signs that easing could have resumed.",
        "At the same time, concern was expressed that surges in inflation were being observed across many economic areas.",
        "Members saw important differences, however, with price pressures in the United States more related to overheating domestic demand and those in the euro area reflecting, to a larger extent, imported inflation.",
        "Turning to euro area developments, activity was expected to be dampened by high energy costs, the deterioration in the terms of trade, greater uncertainty and the adverse impact of high inflation on disposable income.",
        "Firms faced higher costs and renewed disruptions in their supply chains, and their outlook for future output had deteriorated.",
        "However, there were also factors supporting economic activity and these were expected to strengthen over the months to come.",
        "The reopening of those sectors most affected by the pandemic and a strong labour market, with more people in jobs, would continue to support incomes and consumption.",
        "Unemployment remained at its historical low of 6.8% in April and job vacancies across many sectors showed that there was robust demand for labour.",
        "In addition, savings accumulated during the pandemic were a buffer.",
        "Members noted that economic growth and employment had remained surprisingly robust given the size of the supply shocks.",
        "It was cautioned that the stronger than expected quarter-on-quarter growth in euro area real GDP in the first quarter of the year had been driven, to a large extent, by a higher contribution from inventory changes that was likely to unwind.",
        "Domestic demand excluding inventory changes had contracted in the first quarter.",
        "Looking at the June staff projections, the question was raised whether the assumptions behind the baseline were too benign in terms of the impact of the sanctions and the war.",
        "Doubts were also expressed concerning the assumption, in these same projections, that the saving ratio would unwind less and no longer implied a reduction in previously accumulated savings.",
        "The question was also raised whether consumers would start tapping their savings more heavily to cope with the loss of purchasing power or they would reallocate their savings into real assets.",
        "Members widely acknowledged the resilience of the labour market.",
        "This implied that the unemployment gap would close much earlier than the output gap, which was puzzling given that the labour market was typically a lagging indicator.",
        "It was observed that the size of the output gap had been revised down significantly, while there had been hardly any revision to potential output despite the additional supply shocks, and it was thus suspected that the output gap could also be smaller and close faster.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that the current resilience of the labour market reflected a number of factors that made it unlikely to be permanent, such as public employment, temporary jobs and job retention schemes.",
        "This implied the risk that there would eventually be a deterioration in employment.",
        "Members broadly agreed with the downside risks to economic activity that the staff projections anticipated in the near term.",
        "Risks relating to the pandemic had declined but the war continued to be a significant downside risk to growth.",
        "In particular, a further disruption in the energy supply to the euro area would be a major risk, as reflected in the downside scenario included in the staff projections.",
        "Furthermore, if the war were to escalate, economic sentiment could worsen, supply-side constraints could increase, and energy and food costs could remain persistently higher than expected.",
        "In this context, it was emphasised that the downside risks were not only related to the negative cost shocks but also to the impact of uncertainty on demand.",
        "Moreover, there was still a risk that the pandemic could restart.",
        "While the medium-term outlook for growth looked balanced in terms of risks, the next few quarters would be weak and the risk of a technical recession needed to be borne in mind.",
        "However, it was generally considered that stagflation was an unlikely outcome.",
        "Members agreed that fiscal policies were helping to cushion the impact of the war.",
        "Targeted and temporary budgetary measures protected those people bearing the brunt of higher energy prices while limiting the risk of adding to inflationary pressures.",
        "The swift implementation of the investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme, the “Fit for 55” package and the REPowerEU plan would also help the euro area economy to grow faster in a sustainable manner and become more resilient to global shocks.",
        "It was suggested that fiscal measures compensating for high energy prices would likely continue if energy prices remained high.",
        "At the same time, further fiscal support would, in any case, have negative implications for public debt.",
        "In this respect, it was warned that not all fiscal measures were well targeted and temporary.",
        "On price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Inflation had risen further to 8.1% in May.",
        "Although governments had intervened and had helped to slow energy inflation, energy prices stood 39.2% above their 2021 levels.",
        "Market-based indicators suggested that global energy prices would stay high in the near term but then moderate to some extent.",
        "Year-on-year food prices had risen by 7.5% in May, in part reflecting the importance of Ukraine and Russia among the main global producers of agricultural goods.",
        "Prices had generally also gone up more strongly because of renewed supply bottlenecks and a recovery in domestic demand as the economy reopened, especially in the services sector.",
        "Price rises were becoming more widespread across sectors and, accordingly, measures of underlying inflation had been rising further.",
        "Wage growth, including in forward-looking indicators, had started to pick up.",
        "Over time, the strengthening of the economy and some catch-up effects should lead to faster growth in wages.",
        "It was noted that May was the tenth month in a row in which the inflation figure had been underestimated.",
        "Reference was made to the fact that a mechanical update of the June staff projections with the May numbers would imply a level of inflation 0.3 percentage points higher for 2022 as a whole.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that most of the recent inflation projection errors could be explained by the direct and indirect effects of under-predictions of energy and food price rises, rather than by an underlying change in agents’ behaviour.",
        "Such errors could be explained by the difficulty in forecasting supply shocks.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that energy and food shocks appeared to be more persistent than previously thought and that this was not just a consequence of the war in Ukraine, because inflation had gained momentum before the outbreak of conflict.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that the inflation rates for services and non-energy industrial goods had also surprised on the upside and that none of the increases in core inflation every month so far this year had been anticipated.",
        "Inflationary pressures from re-opening in the tourism sector, which had been prominent in the May figures, were likely to continue in the coming months as tourism opened up more widely.",
        "Core inflation had reached almost 4% in May and indicators of underlying inflation continued to increase markedly, standing between 3% and 6%.",
        "This indicated that price pressures were broadening and becoming more persistent.",
        "In terms of absolute deviations, currently the upside deviation of core inflation from the inflation target was much larger than it had been on the downside at any time during the period when monetary policy had focused on deflation risks.",
        "It was also emphasised that core inflation was projected to remain above 2% over the entire horizon in the June staff projections.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that measures of underlying inflation had to be interpreted carefully, as they were also affected by unusual transitory forces such as the indirect effects of the energy shocks, the re-opening and supply bottlenecks.",
        "For example, taking the indirect effects of energy prices out of the core inflation projection would result in a 2.0% projection for core inflation in 2024.",
        "Members broadly agreed that wage developments played a central role in the current inflation outlook.",
        "Reference was made to the usefulness of the so-called wage tracker, which afforded a more forward-looking perspective on negotiated wage growth.",
        "That measure confirmed that negotiated wages were increasing by around 3-4%.",
        "However, it was argued that one-off payments, which had been behind the latest pick-up in negotiated wages, should not be seen as a sign of second-round effects and incipient wage-price spirals.",
        "At the same time, the wage tracker was suggesting that increasingly tight labour markets were starting to translate into higher wage demands.",
        "Mention was also made of greater recourse to wage indexation in some countries, also in the context of European legislation for a minimum wage.",
        "This was seen as a particular concern for the potential emergence of wage-price spirals.",
        "It was also noted that the wage tracker did not account for those negotiations that would only take place at the end of the year and could then change the forward-looking picture.",
        "The point was made that, ultimately, it was necessary to look beyond negotiated wage growth and consider all elements affecting actual wage growth.",
        "Caution was also expressed about looking only at nominal wage growth, as growth in unit labour costs was ultimately the more relevant indicator for inflation trends and showed only modest dynamics.",
        "In this regard, it was remarked that wage growth, while currently contained, was projected to run slightly higher than the sum of productivity growth and the inflation target over the coming years.",
        "It was also stressed that the current reduction in real wages could lead to upward pressures on nominal wages going forward.",
        "In their discussion of the June staff projections members highlighted the further large upward revisions to the inflation outlook, particularly in 2022 and 2023, and raised a number of questions about the future path of inflation.",
        "It was observed that the inflation path in the current baseline resembled that of the adverse scenario in the March staff projections.",
        "It was also underlined that the last time headline inflation had been above 2% in the final year of the projection horizon was 2007, while core inflation had never been above 2% at that horizon.",
        "Reference was made to the latest OECD forecast, which showed a higher level of core inflation in the euro area that persisted for longer and stood at 4%, on average, for both 2022 and 2023.",
        "Given the steeply downward-sloping future path of both headline and core inflation, the view was once again expressed that this was likely the result of the assumption that shocks were transitory combined with model dynamics being mean-reverting.",
        "Such “built-in” convergence neglected the issue of successive adverse shocks and the possibility of greater persistence and/or non-linear behaviour, which were currently the main challenges to the inflation outlook.",
        "With the tendency of the projections to strongly converge to target in the last year of the horizon, the projection for that year was seen as having limited information content.",
        "Moreover, as core inflation was also higher than headline inflation in 2024, this was seen as a signal of upside risks to headline inflation for 2024 and beyond, as core inflation typically captured more persistent components of inflation relevant for medium-term trends.",
        "It was also recalled that, if owner-occupied housing was fully taken into account, core inflation would likely be even higher.",
        "Moreover, the remark was made that a normalisation of monetary policy according to the rate path currently priced by markets, which was already included in the technical assumptions, would not be sufficient to bring inflation back to 2% over the medium term according to the baseline projection.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that a succession of supply shocks suggested a lengthening, rather than a shortening of the relevant policy horizon, when aiming to maintain price stability over the medium term.",
        "It was also recalled that the ECB’s strategy review in 2021 had confirmed that it targeted headline, rather than core inflation, as the relevant yardstick for monetary policy.",
        "It was underlined that the future path of inflation in the June staff projections was not so different from that foreseen by many other forecasters in the private sector and by international institutions.",
        "Overall, it was widely acknowledged that uncertainty was high and that the transmission of the current inflation shock and its potential persistence into 2023 and 2024 needed to be better understood.",
        "The baseline in the staff projections was seen as potentially too benign, despite substantial upward revisions to the inflation outlook.",
        "The historically high level of core inflation pointed to increasing risks of higher inflation becoming more entrenched and persistent.",
        "Pipeline pressures were also seen to be continuing to build up, with the odds of a stronger and quicker pass-through to consumer prices increasing.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that risks existed in both directions and, in any case, when considering the inflation outlook, the Governing Council would take both the baseline and the configuration of risks into account.",
        "Regarding the assumptions underlying the projections, it was noted that energy and commodity prices themselves might be seen as likely to rise further, or at least stay higher for longer, in contrast to the downward-sloping path of the futures curve embedded in the projections.",
        "This technical assumption had been one of the main reasons for forecast errors in the past.",
        "Moreover, structural shifts such as climate change might exert more lasting upward pressure on energy and food prices.",
        "This could lead to headline inflation exceeding core inflation by a much larger margin than observed historically, casting further doubt on the plausibility of headline inflation falling below core inflation in 2024, as embedded in the projections.",
        "On the fiscal side, it was argued that government support measures could reinforce inflation pressures if they turned out to be less targeted and less temporary than envisaged, at a time of generally high pressures on resources and mismatches between supply and demand.",
        "Additionally, supply bottlenecks might prove more protracted than assumed in the baseline scenario.",
        "Attention was drawn to the ongoing rotation between bottlenecks in goods, which were expected to ease, and those in services, which had just been emerging and would gain more prominence as households rebalanced their consumption from goods to services.",
        "Medium-term inflation pressures could also be higher than assumed in the projections if potential economic growth suffered more lasting damage from successive supply shocks and the war in Ukraine.",
        "Questions were raised as to the reliability and stability of the Phillips curve relationship since behavioural economics indicated that collective psychology might change rapidly when there were threshold effects and possible non-linearities.",
        "It was remarked that the longer inflation stayed elevated, the greater the risk of second-round effects via higher wages and/or higher profit margins.",
        "According to the projections, 2024 would be the fourth consecutive year of inflation above 2%, which suggested rising risks of second-round effects and of higher inflation becoming entrenched over time.",
        "The spending power of households might also turn out to be higher than assumed in the projections, where the saving ratio had been revised up on the expectation of higher precautionary saving.",
        "The projections foresaw no drawing down of savings in nominal terms – notwithstanding ”forced dissaving” in real terms – to maintain consumption in the face of higher and unanticipated inflation.",
        "Accordingly, firms’ pricing power could be higher than projected and they could use the current reopening of the economy to restore profit margins and increase the pass-through of costs to consumer prices, instead of absorbing higher costs by accepting lower margins.",
        "Reference was also made to the period following the financial crisis, during which profit margins had increased even in a downturn in a number of euro area economies with weak corporate balance sheets.",
        "At the same time it was underlined that, at present, no second-round effects or wage-price spirals could be observed and that there were indications that unions would be cautious with wage claims to preserve employment at a time of renewed uncertainty.",
        "This caution would help avoid derailing a strong labour market, which had been a source of income stability in Europe throughout the pandemic.",
        "While there was wide agreement that market-derived indicators of inflation expectations were broadly anchored at around the target level, it was widely felt that there was no room for complacency given the high costs of re-anchoring expectations.",
        "The risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations was seen as particularly high when inflation expectations adapted to recent developments.",
        "Such a risk was considered as increasingly likely to materialise since HICP inflation was projected to stand above, and mostly far above, 2% for more than three years.",
        "Emphasis was placed on the importance of households’ and firms’ inflation expectations, which were more directly relevant for wage and pricing decisions.",
        "More generally, it was underlined that concerns over a loss of purchasing power were very pronounced among the general public all over Europe.",
        "Against this background members assessed the risks surrounding inflation as primarily on the upside.",
        "The risk to the medium-term inflation outlook included a durable reduction in the production capacity of the economy, persistently high energy and food prices, inflation expectations rising above target and higher than anticipated wage rises.",
        "However, if demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressures on prices.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessments provided by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane in their introductions.",
        "Market interest rates had increased further in nominal terms since the Governing Council’s 13-14 April meeting in response to the changing outlook for inflation and monetary policy.",
        "Near-term real rates largely remained in negative territory close to historical lows, but the real forward curve had, overall, risen substantially over recent months.",
        "With benchmark interest rates rising, bank funding costs had increased, and this had fed into higher lending rates, in particular for households.",
        "Nevertheless, bank lending to firms had picked up in March, reflecting the continued need to finance investment and working capital, against the backdrop of increasing production costs, persistent supply bottlenecks and lower reliance on market funding.",
        "Lending to households had also increased, reflecting continued robust demand for mortgages.",
        "Euro area banks had started the year with solid capital positions and improving asset quality.",
        "So far, bank-based financing conditions for households and firms had, on the whole, remained relatively resilient to increases in market rates, notwithstanding growing signs of a turning point having been reached in bank borrowing costs for firms, after the historical lows seen in December.",
        "Broader financial conditions had tightened considerably owing to rising bond yields and lower equity valuations, while the euro exchange rate had stabilised.",
        "At the same time, risk aversion was rising and investors were becoming more selective, as evidenced by rising risk premia in yields on lower-rated corporate and sovereign bonds.",
        "It was remarked that the scale and speed of recent yield spread increases for some countries, without major changes in country economic fundamentals, suggested that other factors might be at play, including non-linearities, multiple equilibria and factors of a political nature.",
        "In line with the monetary policy strategy adopted in July 2021, the Governing Council held its regular biannual structured exchange on the interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability.",
        "Members concurred that the environment for financial stability had worsened since the last review in December 2021, especially over the short term.",
        "In particular, lower economic growth and increasing cost pressures, as well as rising risk-free rates and sovereign bond yields, could lead to a deterioration in the financing conditions faced by borrowers.",
        "In this context, there was agreement that monetary policy normalisation might affect financial stability at different horizons in opposite ways.",
        "Tighter financing conditions could reduce some financial stability vulnerabilities over the medium term, for example in residential real estate.",
        "At the same time, when interest rates were exiting a prolonged period in negative territory, monetary policy normalisation could be accompanied by short-term financial stress and increased fragmentation of financial conditions.",
        "Moreover, banks were facing greater credit risk in an environment of lower growth and heightened uncertainty.",
        "Looking ahead, these factors would need to be watched closely.",
        "In any case, macroprudential policy remained the first line of defence in preserving financial stability and addressing medium-term vulnerabilities.",
        "Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members agreed that the revised medium-term inflation outlook required further steps to be taken in normalising monetary policy.",
        "The latest Eurosystem staff projections saw headline and core inflation in the baseline scenario standing above 2% in 2024, and in the staff assessment risks to the inflation projections were tilted to the upside over the entire horizon, especially for 2022 and 2023.",
        "In this respect, it also had to be taken into account that the baseline projections were based on the assumption that monetary policy would be adjusted in line with market expectations at the cut-off date for the projections, with those expectations having shifted markedly upwards in recent months.",
        "It was underlined that the appropriate monetary policy response for the Governing Council to take depended on its assessment of the inflation outlook, which comprised both the baseline and the risk assessment.",
        "In view of the baseline inflation projection exceeding the ECB’s target at the relevant horizon, together with the large and persistent upside risks, it was suggested that the ECB needed to respond more strongly than implied by the market expectations for interest rates embedded in the staff projections.",
        "Members agreed that it was imperative for the ECB to preserve its credibility by showing its resolve to make sure that inflation returned to its 2% inflation target over the medium term.",
        "On the one hand, credibility was perceived to have been called into question recently in the light of very high inflation, repeated projection errors and a narrative that had insisted on the temporary nature of inflation shocks for too long.",
        "Determined action was judged to be needed to protect the anchoring of inflation expectations and to avoid sizeable second-round effects, with inflation and wages feeding into one another.",
        "It was also argued that, if the monetary policy stance were normalised too slowly, monetary policy risked adding to demand pressures at a time when the economy was recovering from the pandemic and pressures on resources were already high.",
        "On the other hand, it was stressed that the ECB’s credibility was not in doubt as long as inflation expectations remained anchored and as long as no evidence of second-round effects could be seen.",
        "Moreover, the ECB should take confidence from the reputation it had earned in successfully combatting the risk of deflation in the past.",
        "Reference was made to survey evidence from the general public confirming that the ECB was not currently being blamed for the present episode of high energy inflation, given that the shock was seen as mainly related to rising food and energy costs and that the euro area was not experiencing excessive demand.",
        "At the same time, however, it was clear that the general public expected the ECB to take action and to live up to its mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term.",
        "Members concurred overall that most measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets and expert surveys appeared to be still broadly anchored at the ECB’s target, notwithstanding initial signs of above-target revisions.",
        "While risks of an unanchoring had been increasing for some time, it was argued that, since April, there had been some reassuring developments in a number of the indicators, including a stabilisation in the euro exchange rate.",
        "On the whole, the evidence so far was seen to remain consistent with a successful re-anchoring of inflation expectations around the ECB’s target, in line with the new monetary policy strategy announced in 2021.",
        "This provided the Governing Council with grounds for a reasonable degree of self-confidence.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that there was no room for complacency because, looking ahead, the anchoring of inflation expectations could not be taken for granted.",
        "Some measures of longer-term inflation expectations stood at levels above the Governing Council’s inflation target.",
        "Moreover, the view was held that it would be much more costly to address a broad-based unanchoring of inflation expectations once it had materialised, as opposed to responding pre-emptively.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that the experience gained in the 1970s, when different inflation outcomes across jurisdictions could be traced back to different central bank reaction functions, suggested that central banks that acted earlier achieved better inflation outcomes.",
        "On the other hand, it was maintained that the current environment differed from the 1970s in important respects, such as improved central bank transparency, weaker aggregate demand conditions, a lower degree of unionisation and a lower prevalence of wage-indexation clauses.",
        "Members broadly agreed that the monetary policy normalisation process should continue to be guided by the four principles of optionality, data-dependence, gradualism and flexibility.",
        "Different views, however, were expressed on the need for and the interpretation of gradualism, as well as on how in practice to reconcile gradualism with the need for data-dependence and optionality in an uncertain environment.",
        "The view was put forward that the notion of gradualism could be misleading if it was interpreted as implying too slow or too rigid a pace of adjustment in the monetary policy stance.",
        "Such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the need for optionality and data-dependence.",
        "In particular, it was necessary to avoid gradualism being seen as precluding interest rate steps in excess of 25 basis points.",
        "Ensuring price stability over the medium term might, depending on changes in the inflation outlook and prevailing risks and circumstances, require more forceful and front-loaded responses to signal the determination to protect price stability.",
        "Moreover, it was argued that the principle of gradualism suggested responding early and in a forward-looking manner, which would then reduce the need for larger and more disruptive adjustments later.",
        "A remark was made that the merits of gradualism depended on the nature of uncertainty and shocks.",
        "In the light of a long sequence of persistent upward inflation surprises and an increasing risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations, the “Brainard principle”, i.e.",
        "that policymakers should act cautiously if there is uncertainty about the effects of monetary policy measures, no longer applied.",
        "There was agreement that gradualism should not necessarily be interpreted as slow action in small steps.",
        "Therefore, members felt that the sustained succession of rate increases over the coming quarters – as reflected in the rate path embedded in market expectations and the staff projections – could be characterised as gradual.",
        "It was cautioned that dropping the notion of gradualism could be seen as a signal that the ECB intended to take abrupt action, which could undermine predictability and risked triggering disorderly market movements.",
        "Gradualism also was considered consistent with the medium-term orientation of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy and with the prevailing uncertainty on the growth outlook.",
        "This was deemed especially important in the face of supply shocks such as those faced by the euro area, and also since the euro area was more exposed to movements in energy prices than other currency areas.",
        "Overall, members agreed to retain gradualism as one of the four guiding principles for the monetary policy normalisation process, on the understanding that this did not rule out interest rate steps in increments larger than 25 basis points if and when needed to protect price stability over the medium term.",
        "The point was also made that the principles of optionality and data-dependence seemed to be essentially equivalent and were especially important in the present circumstances.",
        "In any case it was emphasised that the notion of gradualism should not interfere with the Governing Council’s duty to do – at all times –what was needed to maintain price stability over the medium term.",
        "A number of members recalled that in their view, the three forward guidance criteria for interest rates established in July 2021 had been satisfied for some time.",
        "At the same time, the need to safeguard the coherence and predictability of ECB policy was acknowledged, which suggested sticking to the sequence previously communicated.",
        "However, it was suggested that the implied “delay” in raising interest rates should, in principle, be offset by implementing a larger rate hike in July or by indicating more explicitly the possibility of a larger interest rate move later in the third quarter of 2022.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that in communicating policy intentions for future meetings, the Governing Council should avoid unduly constraining its optionality and data-dependence.",
        "In any case, all members agreed that, at this point, on the basis of the latest staff projections and developments in measures of underlying inflation, the three forward guidance criteria were satisfied.",
        "The revised medium-term inflation outlook called for further, decisive steps towards monetary policy normalisation.",
        "In line with the agreed sequencing, the present meeting would be the appropriate moment to announce that net asset purchases under the APP would end as of 1 July 2022.",
        "This was the action opening the door to a first rate hike at the July meeting.",
        "Looking ahead, members also agreed, overall, that it was appropriate to provide guidance on the Governing Council’s expectations regarding the path for the key policy rates to be decided at the July and September 2022 meetings.",
        "However, some reservations were expressed about appearing to “lock in” any decisions still to be taken by the Governing Council beyond the very short term.",
        "It was underlined that forward guidance always needed to remain conditional on the outlook and prevailing circumstances.",
        "However, it was also recalled that the signalling of policy intentions one or two meetings ahead had been a feature of ECB communication in the past, such as through the references to “vigilance” or “strong vigilance”, or “(very) close monitoring” of inflation risks.",
        "Most members expressed support for the proposal to signal the Governing Council’s intention to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at the July meeting.",
        "Starting the rate-hiking cycle with a step of this magnitude was seen as a “proportionate first step”, as indicated by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "In this respect, different arguments were brought forward.",
        "First, this would be the first rate hike in 11 years, a step that needed to be prepared and explained carefully.",
        "Second, the start of the rate-hiking cycle had to be orderly, avoiding unnecessarily surprising the markets and inducing unwarranted volatility.",
        "Third, adverse economic surprises in the near term could not be excluded, and it was thus prudent not to start more forcefully.",
        "A number of members expressed an initial preference for keeping the door open for a larger hike at the July meeting.",
        "They remarked that the current signal should not be seen as an unconditional commitment, since the Governing Council needed to retain the discretion to adjust the size of the interest rate move in case new information available for the July meeting materially affected the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Against this background, it was broadly agreed that the Governing Council should at this point be more specific about its expectations for the September meeting and, in particular, open the door to an increase in the key ECB interest rates by more than 25 basis points.",
        "A larger increment would be appropriate at the September meeting if the outlook for medium-term inflation had not improved by that time.",
        "A rate hike by a larger increment would signal the Governing Council’s intention to move the deposit facility rate into positive territory, ending an eight-year period of negative rates.",
        "At the same time, it was generally deemed important to maintain optionality and data-dependence, as it could not be excluded that incoming data in the period to September would materially affect the medium-term inflation outlook in either direction.",
        "The point was also made that an acceleration of the monetary policy normalisation process was conditional on market conditions remaining orderly.",
        "Looking beyond September, members widely agreed that, on the basis of the current assessment, a gradual but sustained path of further interest rate increases would be appropriate, with the pace of adjustment depending on incoming data and developments in the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "A comment was made that the neutral rate was unobservable and too vague a concept to guide actual policy measures.",
        "It was maintained that the achievement of a neutral stance would be revealed only over time as the Governing Council observed how the economy and the inflation outlook reacted to new shocks and to monetary policy normalisation.",
        "It was noted, in this respect, that it might be helpful for the ECB to communicate at some point on the rate path beyond September to avoid markets overshooting.",
        "It was remarked there were good reasons to move all three key ECB interest rates in parallel, at least for the initial step in July.",
        "On the basis of the shared assessment and the above considerations, all members accepted the monetary policy proposal presented by Mr Lane in his introduction, subject to more explicit guidance being provided for the September meeting, as appropriate for taking further steps in normalising monetary policy.",
        "It was confirmed that the conduct of monetary policy would continue to be guided by optionality, data-dependence, gradualism and flexibility.",
        "All members agreed that the decision on ending net purchases under the APP would pave the way for interest rate increases at the next two meetings, in line with the sequencing of monetary policy action enshrined in the ECB’s forward guidance.",
        "It was also seen as appropriate at this point in time to confirm that maturing holdings under the APP would continue to be reinvested for an extended period of time past the date when the Governing Council started raising the key ECB interest rates.",
        "Reinvestment was considered important for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity, thereby ensuring orderly money market conditions, and an appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "It was also agreed to confirm that the special interest rate period under TLTRO III would end on 23 June 2022, as announced previously.",
        "With regard to the path of the key ECB interest rates, members agreed that following the current meeting the Governing Council should communicate that the forward guidance conditions had been satisfied and announce, in line with its policy sequencing, its intention to raise the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at the July monetary policy meeting.",
        "Looking ahead, it was agreed that the Governing Council should announce that it expected to raise the key ECB interest rates again in September, with the calibration of this rate increase depending on the updated medium-term inflation outlook, indicating that if the medium-term outlook were to persist or deteriorate, a larger increment would be appropriate at the September meeting.",
        "Regarding other elements of communication, members agreed that the Governing Council needed to reiterate its readiness to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflation stabilised at the 2% target over the medium term.",
        "Within the ECB’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility would remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardised the attainment of price stability.",
        "Attention was drawn to the widening of sovereign spreads over recent months.",
        "In this context, the point was made that the establishment of an anti-fragmentation tool was not at odds with the need to contain inflation pressures.",
        "Indeed, addressing fragmentation could be regarded as necessary for putting the Governing Council in a better position to accelerate monetary policy normalisation if warranted by the inflation outlook.",
        "Reference was made to the “separation principle”, which had been introduced by the ECB in the wake of the financial crisis to distinguish between non-standard measures aimed at safeguarding monetary policy transmission and instruments aimed at setting the appropriate policy stance for the euro area as a whole.",
        "A call was made for work on a possible new anti-fragmentation tool to be accelerated and completed rapidly since the risk of fragmentation could intensify as the ECB advanced with its monetary policy normalisation.",
        "Members agreed that communication had to emphasise that high inflation was a major challenge and that the Governing Council would make sure that inflation returned to its 2% target over the medium term.",
        "The Governing Council would maintain optionality, data-dependence, gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy, without hierarchy among these guiding principles.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, the President ascertained that all members were able to support the policy proposals put forward by Mr Lane, subject to including more explicit guidance with respect to the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting.",
        "Upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council accordingly decided, on the basis of its updated assessment, to take further steps in normalising its monetary policy, while confirming that earlier decisions would remain in place, as set out in the ECB’s monetary policy press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting."

    "2024": [
        "Ms Schnabel noted that since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 6-7 March 2024 financial markets had started to price in some divergence between the monetary policy paths expected in the euro area and in the United States.",
        "This was reflected in a widening interest rate differential.",
        "In the United States, a series of solid economic data releases had signalled the US economy’s resilience to the current levels of interest rates.",
        "This had led financial markets to expect the timing of a first interest rate cut to be later and the overall extent of monetary policy easing to be less than previously anticipated.",
        "In the euro area, by contrast, expectations regarding the path of the ECB’s monetary policy had changed to a lesser extent.",
        "Owing to the Governing Council’s communication and incoming euro area economic data, spillovers of US rate expectations to the short end of the euro area yield curve had remained contained.",
        "Investors saw almost no chance of a rate cut at the present meeting, but had fully priced in a rate cut for June, followed by another two rate cuts later in the year.",
        "This was in line with evidence from the April round of the Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA).",
        "The increasing divergence between expected developments in euro area and US short-term interest rates had been mirrored in a visible divergence between longer-term interest rates in the two economies.",
        "Euro area longer-term overnight index swap (OIS) rates had increased only modestly since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 6-7 March 2024, while OIS rates in the United States had increased notably over the same period.",
        "The increase in the United States reflected a rise in both the real interest rate and inflation compensation.",
        "This had not spilled over to the euro area, which pointed to a degree of decoupling of the longer end of the yield curve.",
        "An unprecedented combination of macroeconomic and monetary policy shocks common to both economies had driven the co-movement of US and euro area interest rates in 2022 and 2023 to the closest level seen since the global financial crisis.",
        "Since the start of 2024 the extent of the co-movement had diminished, as both macroeconomic developments and the outlook for monetary policy had become less synchronised across the two economies.",
        "The resulting widening of the yield differential since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting in March had been accompanied by a slight depreciation of the euro exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar.",
        "While recent ECB communication had cemented expectations of the timing of the initial cut in policy interest rates, the uncertainty around the subsequent policy path remained elevated.",
        "Volatility in euro area interest rate markets remained markedly elevated compared with the period before the ECB began to hike rates.",
        "By contrast, the benign macroeconomic developments in the global economy – especially in the United States – and reduced downside tail risks to economic growth had gone hand in hand with very low volatility in risk asset markets.",
        "Measures of implied volatility in euro area and US equity markets had returned to pre-pandemic levels.",
        "One source of still elevated uncertainty about the path of the ECB’s monetary policy was that, based on options pricing, investors continued to assess risks to the euro area inflation outlook to be tilted to the upside despite the ongoing disinflation process.",
        "Among the drivers of these perceived upside risks to the inflation outlook, food prices had increased sharply over recent weeks, in part owing to extreme weather events related to climate change and the El Niño phenomenon.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had risen above USD 90 per barrel on fears of rising tensions in the Middle East.",
        "Risk asset markets remained resilient to monetary policy uncertainty.",
        "The benchmark EURO STOXX index had increased further since the March monetary policy meeting, but the latest equity valuations continued to stand close to the historical median in the euro area.",
        "The rally in euro area equity markets since the start of the year had mainly been driven by large, internationally active euro area firms.",
        "Small and medium-sized companies, which were likely to be more dependent on domestic markets, had benefited less from the global risk-on environment.",
        "Given stretched market valuations in some segments, especially in the United States, the risk of a market correction had increased.",
        "The combination of buoyant global risk asset markets with resilient growth and low market volatility had also continued to support euro area sovereign spreads vis-à-vis OIS rates.",
        "Despite a recent small uptick, spreads had remained at compressed levels, notwithstanding higher debt servicing costs and a recent deterioration in the fiscal outlook in several euro area economies.",
        "As regards bank funding, markets were functioning well and liquidity was being redistributed smoothly in the banking system as excess liquidity declined.",
        "The recent repayments in March 2024 of funds borrowed in the seventh operation of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) had led to a further drop in euro area excess liquidity, which had declined by 31% – falling by €1.5 trillion from its peak of €4.7 trillion in November 2022.",
        "The increase in the take-up of funds in standard refinancing operations relative to the size of repayments in March had been very limited and was comparable to levels seen at the time of earlier TLTRO repayments.",
        "Banks had adapted to lower central bank funding by increasing their funding from other sources, including repo borrowing, amid significantly increased activity in secured money markets.",
        "Another important funding source had been new bank bond issuance.",
        "In particular, covered bond issuance had picked up markedly in 2022 and 2023, reversing developments seen over the previous two years.",
        "Overall, it was encouraging that bond and money markets were functioning smoothly with signs of reduced fragmentation risks.",
        "Developments in bank funding markets would continue to be closely monitored, in line with the Governing Council’s decisions in the context of the operational framework review.",
        "Starting with the global economy, Mr Lane reviewed the incoming information, which pointed to a modest pick-up in global activity in the first quarter.",
        "Global trade was expected to recover gradually during the year as the economic recovery proceeded, expenditure patterns gradually rebalanced from services back to goods, and the inventory cycle normalised.",
        "However, the tensions in the Red Sea area remained a downside risk to trade.",
        "The euro exchange rate had remained broadly stable since the March monetary policy meeting, both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms.",
        "There had been a clear jump in oil prices since the March meeting, with Brent crude oil increasing by 4.7%, to USD 92.8 per barrel.",
        "The price futures curve implied a partial retracement of the latest increases over the coming months.",
        "European natural gas prices had increased by 6.9% since the March meeting, but still stood a lot lower than at the time of the December 2023 meeting.",
        "Metal prices had increased somewhat.",
        "Food commodity prices had increased substantially since the March meeting, driven mainly by rising cocoa prices.",
        "Turning to the euro area, Mr Lane highlighted that headline inflation, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), had been improving gradually over the past few months and had declined to 2.4% in March, from 2.6% in February.",
        "Energy inflation had risen to -1.8% in March, from -3.7% in the previous month, mainly owing to an upward base effect and the reversal of some fiscal support measures.",
        "Food inflation had weakened further to 2.7% in March, from 3.9% in February, with processed food inflation continuing to decline and unprocessed food inflation turning negative.",
        "the HICP excluding energy and food) had decreased to 2.9% in March, from 3.1% in February.",
        "The non-energy industrial goods inflation rate had again decelerated, to 1.1% in March, from 1.6% in the previous month.",
        "Services inflation had remained unchanged at 4.0% in March, owing in part to the early timing of Easter.",
        "Many observers had noticed that the momentum of inflation had picked up again, which was visible across the different components – but it was important to note that this was taken into account in the March 2024 ECB staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "Focusing on services, inflation had come down from 5.6% at the peak last summer to 4% in March.",
        "A large part of that reduction had been due to the pandemic reopening effects fading away, particularly in “contact-intensive” services such as tourism, accommodation and restaurants.",
        "There was a tight correlation between wages and the inflation rate in wage-sensitive sectors, which explained why a material drop in services inflation would not be seen until 2025, in line with the projected deceleration in wages in 2025 compared with 2024.",
        "Most measures of underlying inflation had declined further in February, confirming the picture of gradually diminishing price pressures.",
        "The impact of past adverse supply shocks was continuing to fade and tight monetary policy still weighed on demand.",
        "At the lower end of the range of measures, the indicators based on the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI) had edged higher but remained close to 2%.",
        "The annual rate of domestic inflation was unchanged at 4.5%.",
        "Wage pressures were gradually moderating but remained elevated compared with a steady-state benchmark.",
        "Annual growth in compensation per employee had decelerated to 4.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, from 5.1% in the third quarter.",
        "This outcome was 0.2 percentage points below the March ECB staff projections.",
        "Growth in compensation per hour had also slowed, falling in annual terms to 4.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023 from 5.0% in the third quarter.",
        "The wages and salaries component of the labour cost indicator had decreased to 3.3% in the fourth quarter, from 5.1% in the third quarter.",
        "Annual unit labour cost growth had fallen to 5.8% in the fourth quarter, from 6.5% in the previous quarter, but remained high, in part reflecting weak productivity growth.",
        "Negotiated wage growth, including one-off payments, had declined from 4.7% in the third quarter of 2023 to 4.5% in the fourth quarter.",
        "The ECB’s forward-looking wage trackers had also continued to show signs of easing.",
        "The Indeed tracker, based on job adverts, and the feedback from firms participating in the Corporate Telephone Survey (CTS) and the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) pointed to lower wage growth in the course of the year.",
        "The ongoing and projected deceleration in wage growth remained the fundamental underpinning of the expected convergence of inflation to the ECB’s 2% target in 2025.",
        "But it was important to emphasise that wage growth was not going to be stable for the rest of this year and that the reduction in wage pressures was not going to follow a linear trend.",
        "Negotiated wage growth would bounce around – mainly as a result of one-off payments.",
        "It was therefore important to keep in mind the overall dynamics, as embedded in the projections, rather than just the latest reading.",
        "Profits continued to buffer the pass-through of higher labour costs to inflation.",
        "Annual growth in unit profits had decelerated further in the fourth quarter of 2023, falling to 2.8% from 4.7% in the third quarter.",
        "The significant decline was the main driver of the reduction in the annual growth rate of the GDP deflator, which had fallen by 0.6 percentage points to stand at 5.3% in the fourth quarter.",
        "Turning to inflation expectations, in the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), the centre of the distribution of long-term inflation expectations had remained around 2% since inflation had peaked in the fourth quarter of 2022.",
        "But the right tail of the distribution, which reflected a risk measure, implied that far fewer respondents now expected inflation to be noticeably above target in the longer term.",
        "This was reassuring in terms of people having a solid understanding of the inflation target.",
        "From the perspective of firms, as reflected in the SAFE, median expectations and the interquartile range for inflation one year ahead were lower than in the previous survey round.",
        "Selling price expectations of firms were also lower, as reported in the SAFE, as well as in the corresponding European Commission survey that captured near-term selling price expectations.",
        "Looking ahead, headline inflation was expected to fluctuate around current levels in the near term, on account of base effects in the energy component and the reversal of the upward effect of the early timing of Easter on services inflation in March.",
        "Nevertheless, inflation was expected to decline to the ECB’s target in 2025 as labour cost pressures eased; the effects of past energy shocks, supply bottlenecks and the post-pandemic reopening of the economy continued to dissipate; and the disinflationary impact of monetary policy further unfolded.",
        "Upside risks to inflation included the heightened geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade.",
        "Inflation could also turn out higher than anticipated if wages increased by more than expected or profit margins proved more resilient.",
        "By contrast, inflation might surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampened demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsened unexpectedly.",
        "The euro area economy had remained weak in the first quarter of 2024.",
        "The data available continued to point to a divergence between weak manufacturing sectors and improving services sectors, partly reflecting the persistent adverse impact of past energy price shocks on manufacturing output.",
        "Economic activity was expected to pick up modestly in the second quarter and to gain some momentum over the course of the year.",
        "The recovery should be supported by rising real incomes, resulting from lower inflation, increased wages and improved terms of trade.",
        "In addition, growth in euro area exports should pick up over the coming quarters as the global economy recovered and spending shifted further towards tradables.",
        "Finally, monetary policy should exert less of a drag on demand over time.",
        "Consumer confidence had picked up to some extent, but it was still subdued compared with the levels prevailing before the war in Ukraine.",
        "The latest Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) showed signs of an upward trend in consumers’ plans for major purchases and holidays.",
        "Concerning housing investment, survey indicators remained very weak.",
        "The most recent property price data for the fourth quarter of 2023 showed that, after dropping, residential property prices were stabilising.",
        "For business investment, indications from surveys also remained weak – but with substantial variation across countries.",
        "With regard to the labour market, weak GDP growth together with strong employment growth in 2023 had resulted in weak labour productivity.",
        "The unemployment rate had remained unchanged at a historical low of 6.5% in February.",
        "At the same time, the tightness in the labour market continued to decline gradually, with employers posting fewer job vacancies.",
        "Looking at the fiscal stance, the euro area cyclically adjusted primary deficit in 2023 was likely to have been somewhat larger than indicated in the March ECB staff projections, The risks to economic growth remained tilted to the downside.",
        "Growth could be lower if the effects of monetary policy turned out stronger than expected.",
        "A weaker world economy or a further slowdown in global trade would also weigh on euro area growth.",
        "Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East were major sources of geopolitical risk.",
        "This might result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted.",
        "Growth could be higher if inflation came down more quickly than expected and rising real incomes meant that spending increased by more than anticipated, or if the world economy grew more strongly than expected.",
        "Turning to the analysis of monetary and financial developments, risk-free interest rates had been broadly stable since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting and the transmission of the restrictive monetary policy stance to broader financing conditions remained strong.",
        "Lending rates on business loans and mortgages had edged lower in February but remained elevated at 5.1% and 3.8% respectively.",
        "The information available continued to signal stagnant loan dynamics against the backdrop of weak aggregate demand, tight credit standards and restrictive monetary policy.",
        "The annual growth rate of bank loans to firms had increased slightly to 0.4% in February, but for loans to households it was unchanged at 0.3% in February.",
        "Weak credit creation had weighed on M3 growth, which had remained subdued at 0.4% in February, up from 0.1% in January.",
        "Bank funding costs remained at historically high levels.",
        "The information from the latest bank lending survey (BLS) and the SAFE was consistent with persistently weak credit demand and a stabilisation at tight levels in credit supply conditions for firms.",
        "The BLS indicated a further modest net tightening of bank credit standards for loans to firms, mainly on account of banks’ risk perceptions.",
        "In parallel, banks cited higher interest rates and cutbacks to investment plans as the main factors behind the further marked decline in net loan demand among firms in the first quarter of 2024.",
        "Confirming this profile, in the SAFE, companies had reported a decrease in the availability of bank loans.",
        "The SAFE had also registered a marked drop in the share of firms applying for bank loans.",
        "For households, the results of the BLS had indicated a moderate decline in net demand for loans for house purchase and broadly stable net demand for consumer credit.",
        "Credit standards for household mortgages had eased in the first quarter for the first time in over two years, but standards for consumer credit had tightened further.",
        "Based on the assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, Mr Lane proposed keeping the three key ECB interest rates unchanged.",
        "The incoming data were in line with the medium-term inflation trajectory embedded in the March ECB staff macroeconomic projections, which foresaw headline inflation returning to target by mid-2025.",
        "Headline inflation had declined further in March and, looking beyond some near-term volatility associated with base effects and the reversal of various fiscal measures, it was expected to resume its downward path later in the year.",
        "Taken together, the range of underlying inflation measures also indicated further disinflation could be expected.",
        "At the same time, year-on-year domestic inflation and services inflation were edging down only slowly.",
        "Accordingly, the Governing Council needed further confirmation that wage growth was decelerating as anticipated and that profit margins continued to buffer the pass-through of higher labour costs to inflation.",
        "Further progress towards the target in the course of 2025 would be underpinned by the next phase of deceleration in wage growth, the ongoing fading-out of the energy shock and supply bottlenecks, and a smaller contribution from the reversal of fiscal measures.",
        "These disinflationary pressures would also be reinforced by the cumulative demand-dampening impact of the restrictive monetary stance, including by limiting the capacity of firms to pass on cost increases.",
        "The incoming data confirmed that the transmission of monetary tightening remained strong.",
        "There were some signs of stabilisation in credit supply at a tight level and some easing in the pricing of new loans, primarily owing to an anticipation of future policy rate cuts.",
        "Based on the three elements of its reaction function, the Governing Council could conclude that the key ECB interest rates were at levels that were making a substantial contribution to the ongoing disinflation process.",
        "The Governing Council’s future decisions would ensure that its policy rates would stay sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary.",
        "If the Governing Council’s updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase its confidence that inflation was converging to target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction.",
        "In any event, the Governing Council would continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and it was not pre-committing to a particular rate path.",
        "As regards the external environment, global GDP growth had remained subdued but there were early signs of improvement.",
        "Global growth momentum was building up, with a strong increase in the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing.",
        "Moreover, despite only modest GDP growth, global trade had seen a rebound driven by emerging market economies.",
        "Strong economic data in the United States and a rebound of the UK economy were seen as supporting the global recovery.",
        "Members noted that industrial activity in China had been better than expected, but also stressed the uncertainties and risks for global growth related to the country’s recovery.",
        "Members took note of the release of consumer price index (CPI) data for March in the United States, which had been higher than expected.",
        "The data were seen as confirmation that global inflation currently reflected mainly “sticky” services price developments.",
        "But it was also pointed out that recent US inflation outcomes reflected idiosyncratic factors.",
        "In any case, the depreciation of the euro following the release of the US inflation data pointed to a need for close monitoring of the impact of the exchange rate on euro area inflation.",
        "Spillovers from the United States through a sustained exchange rate effect would likely slow the disinflationary process in the euro area.",
        "More generally, it was argued that the exchange rate effects would depend on the underlying shocks driving economic activity and inflation.",
        "In this respect, inflation developments in the United States and the euro area were seen to be different in nature, with those in the United States being driven more strongly by demand factors and those in the euro area more by supply factors.",
        "With regard to the euro area economy, members widely agreed that latest information broadly vindicated the growth and inflation outlooks entailed in the March 2024 staff projections.",
        "This indicated that the forecasting ability of the quarterly projection exercises had been restored.",
        "On economic activity, members concurred with Mr Lane that the economy had remained weak in the first quarter of 2024.",
        "While spending on services was resilient, manufacturing firms were facing weak demand and production was still subdued, especially in energy-intensive sectors.",
        "Surveys pointed to a gradual recovery over the course of the year, led by services.",
        "The PMI for future activity 12 months ahead had reached its long-term average in March, and some incoming hard data were confirming this picture.",
        "This recovery was expected to be supported by rising real incomes, resulting from lower inflation, increased wages and improved terms of trade.",
        "In addition, growth in euro area exports was expected to pick up over the coming quarters, as the global economy recovered and spending shifted further towards tradables.",
        "Finally, monetary policy should exert less of a drag on demand over time.",
        "Members acknowledged the mixed signals in the latest data.",
        "While some soft indicators had become more favourable, some hard indicators persistently pointed to weak growth momentum.",
        "Mechanical nowcasting tools indicated quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the first and second quarters that was broadly in line with the March staff projections, with a slight downward risk for the first quarter.",
        "Even though growth in the first quarter was still estimated to have been weak, comfort was drawn from the observation that the latest data were consistent with the March staff projections showing a recovery in activity as of the second quarter.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that achieving the profile of the baseline projection remained quite a challenge.",
        "Observed upward movements in incoming data should therefore not be equated with a materialisation of upside risks to the baseline projections.",
        "Against this background, it was remarked that there were as yet no signs of a recovery in private consumption, which was expected to be the growth engine in 2024.",
        "Similarly, the latest weak indicators of business sentiment did not bode well for investment prospects.",
        "Even the relatively sluggish recovery foreseen in the staff projections had yet to unfold.",
        "Meanwhile, it was reassuring that a recession had been avoided despite the monetary policy stance contributing to bringing inflation down from double digits to moderate levels.",
        "It was also observed that the euro area growth landscape was heterogeneous, both across countries and across sectors.",
        "Less energy-intensive sectors were growing faster than energy-intensive ones, which could be seen as pointing to structural rather than cyclical weakness.",
        "With respect to fiscal and structural policies, members reiterated that governments should continue to roll back energy-related support measures so that disinflation would stay on track.",
        "Implementing the EU’s revised economic governance framework fully and without delay would help governments bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis.",
        "National fiscal and structural policies should be aimed at making the economy more productive and competitive, which would help to reduce price pressures in the medium term.",
        "At the European level, an effective and speedy implementation of the Next Generation EU programme and a strengthening of the Single Market would help foster innovation and increase investment in the green and digital transitions.",
        "More determined and concrete efforts to complete the banking union and the capital markets union would help mobilise the massive private investment necessary to achieve this, as the Governing Council had stressed in its statement of 7 March 2024.",
        "It was highlighted that the assumptions for fiscal policies embedded in the March staff projections constituted an element of uncertainty and risk.",
        "Concerns were expressed about the sizeable upward revisions to the deficit and debt figures for 2023 in a number of euro area countries.",
        "The need for fiscal prudence and consolidation across the euro area had to be clearly spelled out.",
        "This was especially important in view of the special situation in 2024, with the transition to a new EU framework for assessing excessive deficits and fiscal trajectories.",
        "At the same time, it was widely considered good news from a monetary policy perspective that there would soon be a new framework in place, providing guiding principles and enhancing prospects for more credible implementation.",
        "Turning to the labour market, it was recalled that the unemployment rate was at its lowest level since the introduction of the euro.",
        "At the same time, the tightness in the labour market continued to diminish gradually, with employers posting fewer job vacancies.",
        "Labour market developments could be seen from different perspectives.",
        "On the one hand, it was suggested that the state of the labour market had remained broadly unchanged and its tightness remained a concern for the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "The unemployment rate was at a historical low, employment was growing robustly, and indicators of tightness continued to stand well above pre-pandemic levels.",
        "On the other hand, it was acknowledged that the direction of developments in the indicators implied some cooling of labour demand.",
        "This was particularly visible in decreasing job vacancies.",
        "Concerns were expressed that the labour market support to the economy had reached its limit.",
        "Labour supply had already increased substantially and firms had limited buffers left for hoarding labour.",
        "A turn of the cycle in the labour market could thus imply greater labour shedding and reduced hirings.",
        "A deterioration in the employment outlook could prompt lower consumption.",
        "On that basis, members assessed the risks to economic growth as remaining tilted to the downside.",
        "Growth could be lower if the effects of monetary policy turned out to be stronger than expected.",
        "A weaker world economy or a further slowdown in global trade would also weigh on euro area growth.",
        "Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East were major sources of geopolitical risk.",
        "This might result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted.",
        "Growth could be higher if inflation came down more quickly than expected and rising real incomes lifted spending more than anticipated, or if the world economy grew faster than expected.",
        "The downside risks to economic growth were seen as particularly relevant for the short term and were confirmed by the mechanical nowcasting tools.",
        "However, the view was also expressed that near-term risks were now balanced, with reference made to recent rebounds in survey-based indicators and some hard data.",
        "Looking ahead, it was stressed that factors that had previously cushioned the economy against potential adverse shocks – including high levels of liquidity, ample household savings, fiscal space, rising labour supply and sizeable business profit margins – had partly diminished.",
        "It was also suggested that the geopolitical risk stemming from the conflict in the Middle East had increased in tandem with the escalation of the conflict during past weeks.",
        "With regard to price developments, members concurred with the assessment by Mr Lane that the incoming information had broadly confirmed the previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Inflation had continued to edge down from an annual rate of 2.6% in February to 2.4% in March, led by lower food and goods price inflation.",
        "However, services price inflation had remained high in March, at 4.0%.",
        "Most measures of underlying inflation had fallen further in February, confirming the picture of gradually diminishing price pressures.",
        "While domestic inflation remained high, wages and unit profits had grown less strongly in the last quarter of 2023 than anticipated, and more recent indicators pointed to further moderation in wage growth.",
        "Unit labour cost growth had remained high, in part reflecting weak productivity growth, but firms were using profits to absorb part of the rise in labour costs.",
        "Inflation was expected to fluctuate around current levels in the coming months and to then decline to the inflation target next year, owing to weaker growth in labour costs, the unfolding effects of restrictive monetary policy, and the fading of the impact of the energy crisis and the post-pandemic reopening.",
        "Members saw the latest inflation developments as evidence that the impact of the past extraordinary shocks was waning and economic relationships were normalising.",
        "This bolstered confidence in the projections and the expected path towards reaching the ECB’s inflation target in 2025.",
        "Outcomes for the first quarter of 2024 were very similar to what had been anticipated in the March staff projections.",
        "Members took note of the bumpy profile of headline inflation for 2024 as indicated by the projections and that there would be no downward linear trend for the remainder of the year.",
        "Many of the expected “bumps” were related to base effects in energy inflation and were already taken into account in the baseline projections.",
        "While headline inflation was naturally a key variable to monitor, it was not the only one that would be particularly volatile.",
        "Services inflation, which had recently seen an increase in momentum, as measured by the annualised three-month-on-three-month rate, and developments in wage growth were also affected.",
        "In this respect, it was important to identify the underlying direction of developments and to look at the big picture.",
        "There was broad agreement that services inflation and the role of wages remained key issues for the inflation outlook.",
        "This was also signalled by services inflation having stayed at the high level of 4% over the past five months.",
        "Moreover, the indicator of domestic inflation, which reflected inflation in those HICP items with relatively low import intensity, was standing at around 4.5%.",
        "Meanwhile, the GDP deflator, a measure of domestic inflation in the national accounts, had remained above 5% in the fourth quarter of 2023.",
        "In view of these figures, conclusive evidence of progress on disinflation in the more persistent domestic components had yet to become apparent.",
        "At the same time, the greater “stickiness” of services inflation was seen as natural, as it was less affected by the fading of supply-side shocks.",
        "In addition, the transmission of monetary policy to the services sector was likely weaker because services were less capital-intensive, while the pass-through from wages was higher owing to the characteristic cost structures in that sector.",
        "The capacity for services firms to absorb higher wage costs through profit margin compression remained uncertain, as they had neither experienced the same level of profit margin increases in the wake of the pandemic as other sectors, nor benefited as much from the declines in other input costs.",
        "For these reasons, developments in services inflation warranted close monitoring and further confirmation was required of weakening pressures on both wages and profits.",
        "However, disaggregated data available up to February suggested that price pressures in services had not come from the more wage-sensitive items.",
        "Instead, these pressures had come from items typically affected by repricing at the beginning of the year to include adjustments for past cost increases, for instance insurance policies or goods and services with administered prices.",
        "Turning to domestic price pressures more broadly, as measured by the GDP deflator in the national accounts, members saw the wages-profits-productivity triangle as key to assessing the speed and extent of further disinflation.",
        "There was still considerable uncertainty about whether assumptions and expectations regarding these variables would play out as projected in March.",
        "Having a new data point and new projections for these variables was therefore important but euro area national account data for the first quarter of 2024 would only be released shortly after the Governing Council’s June monetary policy meeting.",
        "It was underlined that the inflation outlook remained very sensitive to the behaviour of profit margins.",
        "Concern was expressed that margins might not absorb higher costs to the extent assumed in the projections.",
        "It was argued that still elevated margins combined with a relatively weak economic environment could be an indication of persistently strong pricing power and relatively weak competition.",
        "At least, this could be the case for businesses serving domestic demand – and notably the services sector.",
        "This could then lead to further increases in wages and, in turn, might put additional competitive pressure on exporters.",
        "It was pointed out that there had been no additional upward pressure on wages from recently signed wage agreements and that wage growth was so far broadly in line with the projections.",
        "If anything, wage pressures had even diminished somewhat compared with earlier expectations.",
        "It was suggested that, with wage growth having begun to moderate as expected, the focus should shift to productivity developments.",
        "These were crucial from the perspective of ultimate labour cost pressures, which would be higher if productivity growth did not recover as quickly and as strongly as foreseen in the baseline of the March staff projections.",
        "It was argued that this might be the case if current low and negative productivity growth rates turned out to be not merely cyclical, but also partly structural in nature.",
        "The point was made that with the bleak investment outlook embedded in the projections it was difficult to see a more structural improvement in labour productivity.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, market-based measures of inflation compensation and survey-based indicators had remained broadly stable, with most standing around 2%.",
        "The fact that inflation expectations had remained well anchored was seen as reassuring, since it indicated that the monetary policy stance was having the desired effect.",
        "Upside risks to inflation included the heightened geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade.",
        "Inflation could also turn out higher than anticipated if wages increased by more than expected or profit margins proved more resilient.",
        "By contrast, inflation could surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampened demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsened unexpectedly.",
        "Further upside risks could result from higher growth in unit labour costs, especially if productivity growth did not recover as expected.",
        "Upside risks were also seen as prevailing in food and oil prices.",
        "The risk of second-round effects was, however, considered to be relatively small in an environment of general disinflation, unlike in 2022-23.",
        "Nevertheless, it was noted that oil prices had increased substantially in the year to date and were significantly higher than in the assumptions for the March projections.",
        "This pointed to some upside risk for inflation.",
        "Moreover, the slowdown in inflation had recently been supported by lower gas and electricity prices, following a relatively warm winter and low demand due to a recession in manufacturing sectors.",
        "This implied upside risks as and when typically inelastic energy demand met with a recovery in economic activity or a colder period.",
        "The upside risks to food prices were partly related to extreme weather events, including the El Niño and La Niña phenomena, and climate shocks.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane and Ms Schnabel in their introductions.",
        "Market interest rates had been broadly stable since the Governing Council’s previous meeting and wider financing conditions had remained restrictive.",
        "Financial markets had been calm and steady since the meeting in March, amid a further compression of risk premia.",
        "Markets were pricing in a first cut in ECB interest rates in June, with further cuts priced in by the end of the year.",
        "It appeared that peak restrictiveness in euro area financing conditions might have passed.",
        "Interest rates on new loans to households and firms had started to come down, primarily in anticipation of future policy rate cuts, while average rates on existing loans were still edging up overall.",
        "The most recent information had continued to signal weak bank loan dynamics on the back of weak aggregate demand, tight credit standards and restrictive monetary policy.",
        "Bank lending to firms, in particular, was seen as persistently weak.",
        "In part, this was due to lower demand for loans from firms.",
        "The decline had also been reported by banks and firms in the latest BLS and the SAFE, and reflected still elevated borrowing rates and cutbacks in investment plans.",
        "As for lending to households, credit standards for mortgages had eased for the first time in over two years but standards for consumer credit had tightened further.",
        "The point was made that weaker demand for consumer credit and an increase in rejected bank loan applications could suggest fragile household balance sheets or greater risk aversion by banks.",
        "If so, this in turn would signal risks of a more persistent weakness in consumption.",
        "Overall, the latest credit developments remained subdued and could point to a pick-up in credit growth later on, with loan creation being held back by higher rates and tighter credit standards.",
        "It was highlighted that the ratio of credit to GDP had been falling rapidly, with continued weak credit dynamics seen as posing a risk to the recovery or raising the prospect of a “credit-less recovery” as liquidity buffers diminished.",
        "However, signs of stabilisation were visible in loan flows to both households and firms, despite some volatility around the turn of the year.",
        "Turning to the monetary policy stance, members assessed the data that had become available since the last monetary policy meeting in accordance with the three main elements that the Governing Council had communicated in 2023 as shaping its reaction function.",
        "These comprised (i) the implications of the incoming economic and financial data for the inflation outlook, (ii) the dynamics of underlying inflation, and (iii) the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Overall, each of the three elements suggested that the key ECB interest rates were at levels that were making a substantial contribution to the ongoing disinflation process.",
        "Starting with the inflation outlook, members widely agreed that the data were broadly in line with the medium-term inflation trajectory embedded in the March staff projections, which foresaw headline inflation returning to target by mid-2025.",
        "While inflation had come in slightly higher than expected in February, the increase had been offset by a weaker than expected outturn in March.",
        "Overall, the figures suggested limited news, thus broadly validating the projections.",
        "Economic growth was assessed as having been slightly weaker than expected in the first quarter of 2024, but the narrative of an improving growth outlook remained intact.",
        "While significant risks remained around the baseline projections for both growth and inflation, members expressed increasing confidence in the projections, since the extraordinary shocks of the recent past were waning and economic relationships were normalising.",
        "Moreover, inflation expectations had remained well anchored.",
        "At the same time, the view was widely shared that further evidence was required to gain sufficient confidence that inflation was solidly on track to return to the ECB’s target in a timely and sustained manner.",
        "Members also generally concurred that further progress had been made regarding underlying inflation.",
        "Most measures had continued to decline and were expected to continue on a downward path in the period ahead.",
        "Indications from wages and profit margins were broadly in line with the March staff projections or suggested slightly more muted developments than anticipated.",
        "At the same time, domestic inflation was still elevated and there had been little progress in services inflation, which was steady at 4%.",
        "It was stressed that a return of inflation to target remained conditional on a rebound in productivity growth and a significant compression of unit profits through the absorption of higher costs.",
        "The most recent data confirmed that the transmission of monetary tightening continued to be strong.",
        "While there had been some signs of stabilisation in credit conditions at a restrictive level, further weak credit data were suggesting that the credit channel of monetary policy transmission was more powerful than previously expected.",
        "The decline in the demand for loans, as reported in the BLS, was seen as a downside risk for the growth outlook because it pointed to weak investment.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that the tightening impulse from monetary policy had already reached its peak, with the likelihood of a gradual easing of conditions in the near future.",
        "Forward-looking indicators were recovering, with firms indicating in their responses to the SAFE that they were expecting an increase in both investment and turnover.",
        "Moreover, the transmission of monetary policy was seen as weaker for the services sector than for other parts of the economy because services were less capital-intensive and therefore less interest rate-sensitive.",
        "With inflation declining and a delayed pick-up in economic growth, it was regarded as important to assess how restrictive the monetary policy stance was, as a basis for future monetary policy decisions.",
        "It was underlined that there was considerable uncertainty about the degree of restrictiveness of the ECB’s monetary policy stance, both measured against unobservable concepts like the neutral rate of interest and judged by the transmission lags to the capital, labour and goods markets in the real economy and ultimately to inflation.",
        "One way of assessing the restrictiveness of monetary policy was to evaluate the level of policy rates relative to available model-based estimates of the natural or neutral rate of interest.",
        "In this context, it was argued that ongoing structural changes might have led to an increase in such benchmark rates.",
        "These changes included the anticipation of the significant global investment needs to address climate change and the green transition, geopolitical shifts and trade fragmentation leading to deglobalisation, and advances in artificial intelligence and digitalisation.",
        "In addition, rising public debt burdens worldwide might exert further upward pressure on the natural rate of interest.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that staff estimates for the euro area, published recently in the ECB’s Economic Bulletin, did not suggest a significant increase.",
        "In view of the sizeable model and parameter uncertainty attached to such model-based constructs, the natural rate – while providing useful indications – was seen as being of limited use for day-to-day policymaking.",
        "For the time being, to assess the restrictiveness of monetary policy, it was preferable to look at incoming data.",
        "Against this background, a very large majority of members agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to maintain the three key ECB interest rates at their current levels.",
        "Members concurred that the most recent information had broadly confirmed the March staff projections, thus increasing their confidence that the disinflationary process was continuing.",
        "At the same time, important new data – including new staff projections – would be released ahead of the June meeting, allowing the Governing Council to make a more comprehensive assessment.",
        "While progress had been seen, monitoring the triangle between wages, productivity growth and profits continued to be key.",
        "It was seen as plausible that the Governing Council would be in a position to start easing monetary policy restriction at the June meeting if additional evidence received by then confirmed the medium-term inflation outlook embedded in the March projections.",
        "A few members felt sufficiently confident that the three elements of the Governing Council’s reaction function gave grounds for a reduction in the policy rates already at the present meeting.",
        "It was recalled that, since the last policy rate increase in September 2023, the decline in expected inflation had implied a further tightening in the policy stance, with real rates currently close to the peak of the cycle.",
        "Moreover, policy rates were seen as likely to remain in restrictive territory for some time, while the effects of the present restrictive policy stance would continue to be felt even after the start of the easing phase.",
        "It was also remarked that the reduction of the Eurosystem balance sheet was having a contractionary impact on the economy.",
        "Moreover, while there were currently no significant risks of inflation expectations becoming unanchored to the downside, such risks could emerge if the current weakness in growth persisted.",
        "These members also referred to risk management considerations, seeing the balance of risks as having shifted recently.",
        "The risk of undershooting the inflation target and eventually having to pay too high a price in terms of declining activity was now seen as being at least as high as the risk of acting too early and overshooting the target over the medium term.",
        "All in all, a broad consensus emerged whereby members agreed it was prudent to wait until the next monetary policy meeting to see further evidence of, and gain sufficient confidence in, a timely and sustained return of inflation to target.",
        "Compared with the outlook in March, no major surprise had been observed that would justify action at the present meeting.",
        "Conversely, as long as the available data continued to confirm the projections, looking ahead the policy path underlying the projections was seen as broadly consistent with a return of inflation to target in the medium term.",
        "Members stressed the value of waiting until June for further evidence confirming, or indicating a change to, the outlook, but also the value of taking into account any existing or new risks materialising by June, including renewed risks to inflation posed by a possible escalation of geopolitical tensions.",
        "The next projections in June would allow a more comprehensive analysis of the main risks and their implications for price stability.",
        "Members stressed that maintaining a data-dependent approach with full optionality at every meeting was warranted, thus allowing all incoming data to be taken into account while excluding a pre-commitment to any particular rate path.",
        "Data dependence meant not overly focusing on one data point, as the path many indicators took was likely to be bumpy.",
        "Headline inflation, in particular, was expected to fluctuate around current levels in the near term and to decline again later on, suggesting that some bumpiness in the inflation profile was foreseen and consistent with a return of inflation to target by mid-2025.",
        "On the whole, members felt that markets had understood the ECB’s communication and reaction function and were prepared for the possibility of a rate cut at the June meeting, should the data confirm the current outlook.",
        "Members also agreed with the Executive Board proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the pandemic emergency purchase programme portfolio.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel noted that since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 5-6 June 2024, financial markets had moved in response to political news, which had caused some volatility, and in response to weaker than expected US inflation data.",
        "The announcement of snap elections in France had dented investors’ risk appetite and the rally in euro area risk asset markets.",
        "However, the resulting rise in volatility in some market segments had remained contained and short-lived, without signs of systemic stress or fragmentation.",
        "Risk premia had risen only modestly, and the euro exchange rate had recovered quickly.",
        "Macroeconomic news had been muted, with small negative macroeconomic surprises in both the euro area and the United States.",
        "Expectations regarding ECB policy rates had remained broadly unchanged amid some volatility following the elections for the European Parliament, but had edged lower after the release of US consumer price index (CPI) data.",
        "Euro area financial conditions had also remained broadly unchanged, with continued benign market conditions.",
        "The absorption of the net issuance of government bonds had continued to proceed smoothly as investor demand remained strong.",
        "Political uncertainty had affected financial markets, as reflected in a spike in implied volatility in the euro area stock market.",
        "However, implied volatility had remained contained from a longer-term perspective and had retreated swiftly to previous lows.",
        "By contrast, option-implied volatility in euro area bond markets had hardly moved and stood close to the lowest level seen since 2021.",
        "Moreover, investor risk appetite in the euro area had recovered quickly after a temporary slump and currently stood well above the levels seen at the start of the year, pointing to continued strong investor risk sentiment.",
        "The resilience of financial markets and a high degree of investor differentiation had also been visible in sovereign bond markets.",
        "The increase in sovereign spreads over the German Bund had been small from a historical perspective.",
        "Spreads had narrowed again after the initial spike in volatility and currently stood below the levels prevailing before the European parliamentary elections, with the exception of French sovereign bond spreads, which stood slightly higher.",
        "Investor differentiation had also extended to euro area equity markets and corporate bond markets.",
        "Overall, however, the impact on euro area stock market valuations had been muted and short-lived.",
        "Developments in euro area corporate bond markets had mirrored those in equity markets, with spreads of investment-grade financial corporate bonds and non-financial corporate bonds in the euro area, excluding France, having narrowed overall.",
        "The EUR/USD exchange rate had initially depreciated somewhat, but had quickly recovered its losses, and was broadly unchanged from the levels prevailing at the time of the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "As regards expectations about US monetary policy, following the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee the probability of a cut in US interest rates in September had initially declined slightly.",
        "However, this had been counterbalanced subsequently by the somewhat weaker than expected US macroeconomic data and, in particular, the June release of US CPI data, which had pushed the US fed funds futures curve substantially lower than it had been at the time of the June Governing Council meeting.",
        "US developments had also spilled over to some extent to expectations regarding ECB interest rates.",
        "Rate expectations had remained broadly unaffected by the political uncertainty after the European elections, but had edged lower in July after the weaker than expected US CPI data release.",
        "However, the current market pricing of the expected policy rate path remained relatively close to the peak forward curve in late May and substantially above the trough in rate expectations reached at the start of the year.",
        "Moreover, as regards the speed and extent of the rate-cutting cycle, participants in the Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) had not changed their views since the previous survey round and, on average, continued to expect 25 basis point rate cuts at every quarterly meeting at which new staff projections were available until December 2025.",
        "This was broadly in line with expectations in financial markets and with other surveys, with some differences regarding the expected level of the terminal rate.",
        "The more moderate downward shift of the euro area forward curve relative to the United States could partly reflect the fact that euro area core inflation – as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) excluding energy and food – had continued to surprise to the upside, in contrast to the latest US inflation data release.",
        "Euro area near-term “inflation fixings” (swap contracts linked to specific monthly releases in euro area year-on-year HICP inflation excluding tobacco) had edged up since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, but they remained below the level foreseen in the June 2024 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "Moreover, according to market participants, risks to the longer-term inflation outlook remained tilted to the upside, as evidenced by option-implied probabilities for five-year forward inflation-linked swap rates five years ahead.",
        "Under the assumption of risk neutrality – meaning that investors assessed an overshooting of the inflation target to be as costly as an undershooting – investors were pricing in a substantially higher probability of inflation overshooting a level of 2.5% than of it undershooting a level of 1.5%.",
        "This could reflect the anticipation of more frequent adverse supply shocks, as signalled by positive inflation risk premia.",
        "At the same time, developments in euro area real interest rates had been mixed recently.",
        "While ten-year real rates had remained broadly unchanged amid high volatility, two-year and five-year real rates had dropped since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "The absorption of government securities had continued to proceed smoothly, including for France.",
        "Recent auctions had continued to see strong investor demand, with auction results being in line with past regularities.",
        "Over the past year net issuance had found strong demand among foreign investors, with foreign hedge funds emerging as important players in European sovereign bond markets.",
        "Starting with inflation in the euro area, Mr Lane noted that headline HICP inflation had declined slightly to 2.5% in June, after rising to 2.6% in May.",
        "Energy inflation had edged down to 0.2%, from 0.3% in May, despite upward base effects; food inflation had fallen to 2.4% from 2.6% in May.",
        "Goods price inflation and services price inflation had been 0.7% and 4.1% respectively in both May and June.",
        "While some measures of underlying inflation had ticked up in May, owing to one-off factors, most measures of underlying inflation had either been stable or edged down in June compared with May.",
        "On average over the second quarter of 2024, all measures of underlying inflation had declined compared with the previous quarter.",
        "In relation to current wage developments, compensation per employee had increased to 5.0% in the first quarter of 2024, in line with the June staff projections.",
        "Negotiated wages remained an important driver of total compensation.",
        "After decreasing slightly in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 4.5%, negotiated wage growth including one-off payments had increased to 4.7% in the first quarter of 2024.",
        "The forward-looking wage trackers had continued to signal elevated wage pressures this year, largely driven by catch-up dynamics.",
        "Wage agreements in the euro area’s largest economy accounted for the bulk of the latest tracker information, as agreements had been reached in the wholesale, retail, chemical and construction sectors, which tended to have long contract durations and therefore a more pronounced catch-up component during this phase.",
        "The Indeed tracker, which reflected wages for new hires, had picked up to 3.7% in June, from 3.5% in May.",
        "However, beyond the near term the responses from firms participating in the ECB’s Corporate Telephone Survey (CTS) and the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) had pointed to materially lower wage growth in 2025.",
        "This picture was also reflected in the year-by-year profile of recently agreed multi-year wage contracts.",
        "The participants in the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) also expected a marked deceleration in wage growth in 2025.",
        "According to the SPF, the expected deceleration in wage growth next year was attributable to the catch-up to past inflation playing a much smaller role and to the decline in expected inflation.",
        "For domestic price pressures to moderate in the period ahead, profits also needed to play their part.",
        "In the first quarter the annual growth rate of the GDP deflator had declined more than expected, falling to 3.6%, from 5.1% in the fourth quarter of 2023.",
        "The largest contribution to this decline had come from unit profits, with the contribution of the annual growth rate of unit profits turning negative in the first quarter of 2024.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to fluctuate around current levels for the remainder of 2024.",
        "It should then resume its downward path and decline to the ECB’s target of 2% in the second half of 2025 owing to the fading impact of the past inflation surge, weaker growth in labour costs and the unfolding effects of restrictive monetary policy.",
        "Medium and longer-term inflation expectations had remained broadly stable, with most standing at around 2%.",
        "Turning to the global economy, growth momentum was increasing, with the global composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) excluding the euro area rising to 53.2 in the second quarter, from 52.6 in the first quarter, and other survey-based indicators also signalling a further improvement in global activity.",
        "Global trade continued to strengthen, driven by a frontloading of demand, as firms rebuilt inventories after a long phase of destocking.",
        "This was also confirmed by the July 2024 update of the IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO), which projected global real GDP growth to be 3.2% in 2024 and 3.3% in 2025, and global trade growth to be 3.1% in 2024 and 3.4% in 2025.",
        "Compared with the April WEO, there was basically no change in the outlook for global growth and trade.",
        "The euro exchange rate had remained broadly stable, both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms, since the last Governing Council meeting, while oil prices had increased by 15% to USD 88 per barrel of Brent crude oil.",
        "The increase in the oil price since the last meeting reflected tighter supply conditions and rising geopolitical concerns.",
        "European natural gas prices had decreased by 7% since the last Governing Council meeting, to stand at around €31 per megawatt-hour, as demand remained subdued and gas storage levels were high.",
        "The incoming information indicated that the euro area economy had continued to expand in the second quarter of 2024.",
        "The services sector continued to lead the recovery, although the services component of the PMI had softened somewhat in June.",
        "Construction output, which had been boosted by favourable weather in Germany and fiscal incentives in Italy in the first quarter, had fallen in April.",
        "Non-construction investment had risen moderately in the first quarter but was likely to remain muted for the rest of the year.",
        "Manufacturing activity had shown renewed signs of weakness, with the PMI indicators for output and new orders dropping further into contractionary territory, at 46.1 and 44.4 respectively in June.",
        "Goods exports had been weak.",
        "The overall narrative remained that of a consumption-led recovery with rising real incomes translating into rising consumption.",
        "The latest data for the first quarter supported the view that consumption was growing overall.",
        "Consumer confidence had slowly increased in the second quarter, but remained subdued compared with its pre-pandemic average level.",
        "Employment had expanded by 0.3% in the first quarter, in line with economic activity and supported by a further expansion of 0.3% in the labour force.",
        "The unemployment rate had remained unchanged at 6.4% in May.",
        "Survey indicators suggested that positive, but moderating, employment growth would continue.",
        "The PMI for employment had averaged 51.7 in the second quarter, suggesting employment growth of around 0.2%, compared with 0.1% in the June staff projections.",
        "At the same time, labour demand seemed to be gradually moderating.",
        "The ECB’s labour hoarding indicator – which measured the share of firms holding on to workers despite a deteriorating outlook – had declined further in the second quarter, and the Indeed job postings had declined by 1.8% from May to June, following the deceleration in the job vacancy rate in the first quarter of the year.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, the level of fiscal support in the euro area remained sizeable and was likely to be somewhat stronger than assumed in the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "While concrete fiscal news since the June projections had been relatively limited, the uncertainty surrounding the fiscal outlook had increased.",
        "The policy rate cut in June had been transmitted smoothly to money market interest rates, while broader financial conditions had been somewhat volatile.",
        "Financing conditions for firms and households remained at restrictive levels, as the effects of past policy rate increases continued to work their way through the transmission chain.",
        "The average interest rate on new business loans had declined slightly to 5.1% in May, while interest rates on new mortgage loans had remained constant at 3.8% for the third consecutive month.",
        "Growth in loans to firms and households had remained broadly stable at very subdued rates over the past several months.",
        "The annual growth in broad money – as measured by M3 – had continued to recover, reaching 1.6% in May, driven by strong net foreign inflows.",
        "Taken together, the information from the euro area bank lending survey (BLS) and the SAFE suggested that credit supply conditions for loans to firms were stabilising but still tight, with demand persistently weak.",
        "While respondents to the July BLS had reported a slight tightening in credit standards for loans to firms, participants in the SAFE had seen a small net improvement in bank loan availability.",
        "According to both surveys, demand for corporate loans had declined further in the second quarter of 2024.",
        "On the household side, the BLS had signalled an easing in standards for mortgages but a moderate tightening for consumer credit.",
        "Net demand for housing loans and consumer credit had increased for the first time since mid-2022.",
        "In the aggregate, Mr Lane concluded that the incoming information broadly supported the previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "The overall quarterly profile of measures of underlying inflation remained in line with the picture of gradually diminishing price pressures.",
        "The weakening in the economic data also helped to contain upside inflation risks.",
        "The elevated wage growth was in line with expectations, and firms had seen their profits decline, buffering the inflationary impact of higher labour costs.",
        "Monetary policy was keeping financing conditions restrictive.",
        "At the same time, domestic price pressures were still high, services inflation was elevated and headline inflation was likely to remain above the target well into next year.",
        "Against this background, Mr Lane proposed keeping the three key ECB policy rates unchanged.",
        "The information available at the Governing Council’s next monetary policy meeting in September would incorporate a wealth of fresh data and the new staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area.",
        "Data for the second quarter would also be available – including GDP growth, compensation per employee, profit margins and productivity – alongside two more HICP releases, as well as monetary indicators and more timely soft indicators for activity and consumer confidence.",
        "Looking at the external environment, members took note of the outlook for global growth presented by Mr Lane.",
        "The July 2024 update of the IMF’s April WEO entailed broadly unchanged expectations for real GDP growth in 2024 and 2025, which were somewhat above those embedded in the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "This was positive news, as solid growth in global activity and trade was an important element in the anticipated euro area recovery.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to the latest, softer data on economic activity for both the United States and China.",
        "It was argued that the external environment had recently become more clearly disinflationary, mitigating concerns over “higher for longer” inflation.",
        "Of late, inflation had declined in the United States, and the issue of a possible divergence of US and euro area monetary policy – much discussed in the spring – was abating.",
        "With regard to the euro area economy, members widely noted that the medium-term outlook discussed during the previous Governing Council meeting and entailed in the June 2024 Eurosystem staff projections had not changed overall.",
        "The most recent data revealed that inflation was more persistent than previously anticipated, while activity indicators had disappointed on the downside.",
        "It was argued that the short-term outlook had thus become somewhat more “stagflationary”.",
        "At the same time, it was contended that weaker activity was likely to dampen inflation over time.",
        "On economic activity, members concurred with Mr Lane that the incoming information indicated that the euro area economy had grown in the second quarter, but likely at a slower pace than in the first quarter.",
        "Services continued to lead the recovery, while industrial production and goods exports had been weak.",
        "Indicators pointed to muted investment growth in 2024, amid heightened uncertainty.",
        "The recovery was expected to be supported by consumption, driven by stronger real incomes resulting from lower inflation and higher nominal wages.",
        "Moreover, exports should pick up with a rise in global demand.",
        "Finally, monetary policy should exert less of a drag on demand over time.",
        "In their discussion, members acknowledged that the short-term outlook for growth had deteriorated.",
        "This was visible in both soft and hard data, most notably in weak PMI indicators for manufacturing.",
        "The prospect of somewhat lower short-term growth than embedded in the staff projections was also corroborated by the latest surveys, such as the SPF and the SMA.",
        "Concerns were expressed that muted activity might not only be of a temporary or cyclical nature.",
        "This inference was supported notably by the fact that there were few signs of a recovery in manufacturing and industrial production, even though the adverse impact of earlier energy and terms-of-trade shocks had largely faded.",
        "Reference was made to the share of energy costs in GDP, which had fallen back to close to its longer-term average.",
        "It was doubtful that short-term cyclical phenomena could fully explain the weak performance of manufacturing.",
        "Rather, this was consistent with the observed subdued developments in exports and might well reflect a more lasting or structural loss of competitiveness, casting doubt on the capacity of the euro area to recover on the back of growth in world trade.",
        "It was stressed that the economy remained lopsided, as the recovery continued to be driven, in essence, by activity in services.",
        "This was confirmed by positive incoming information on the services PMI and services production.",
        "Tourism had been playing an important role in recent services activity, but it was questionable whether this type of spending could support the economy sustainably in the second half of the year.",
        "It was also observed that the moderate recovery in consumer confidence was still from low levels and that the saving ratio was increasing.",
        "The point was made that the increase in the saving ratio reflected, to a large extent, increases in the non-labour income of high-income households that were likely to save rather than consume out of additional income.",
        "Moreover, greater saving was seen as a natural reaction to the higher interest rates on deposits offered in the context of past monetary policy tightening.",
        "However, the strong increase in savings observed in the first quarter of the year was raising questions about the consumption-based narrative embedded in the projections.",
        "Overall, despite all these layers of uncertainty, it was felt that the euro area economy remained on track for a consumption-led recovery, in line with rising real income growth.",
        "Survey results entailed some positive signs for future household spending and, according to the latest BLS, households’ demand for loans had risen.",
        "Turning to the labour market, incoming data confirmed continued resilience.",
        "The unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.4% in May, its lowest level since the start of the euro.",
        "Employment had grown by 0.3% in the first quarter, supported by a further increase in the labour force, which had expanded at the same rate.",
        "More jobs were likely to have been created in the second quarter, mainly in the services sector.",
        "At the same time, firms were gradually reducing their job postings, albeit from high levels.",
        "Members widely pointed to continued tightness in the labour market.",
        "It was noted that this tightness had persisted despite immigration and rising labour force participation.",
        "Participants in the ECB’s CTS continued to report difficulties in recruiting, which highlighted continued labour shortages.",
        "At the same time, the CTS findings suggested that firms were responding to these shortages by investing in labour-saving technology such as automation and digitalisation.",
        "It was noted that employment growth continued to be driven mainly by the services sector.",
        "However, a note of caution was expressed that the observed state of the labour market had two interpretations.",
        "On the one hand, its persistent resilience was reinforcing the prediction that a soft landing of the economy was indeed achievable.",
        "On the other, the lack of sustained growth dynamics raised concerns about the durability of what appeared to be the most inclusive and vibrant labour market in the history of the euro area.",
        "With respect to national fiscal and structural policies, members reiterated that these policies should aim to make the economy more productive and competitive, which would help raise potential growth and reduce price pressures in the medium term.",
        "An effective, speedy and full implementation of the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme, progress towards capital markets union and the completion of banking union, and a strengthening of the Single Market were key factors that would help foster innovation and increase investment in the green and digital transitions.",
        "The European Commission’s recent guidance calling for EU Member States to strengthen fiscal sustainability and the Eurogroup’s statement on the fiscal stance for the euro area in 2025 were welcome.",
        "Implementing the EU’s revised economic governance framework fully and without delay would help governments bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis.",
        "The course of fiscal policy was seen as posing challenges in the coming months.",
        "Concerns were expressed that, in a period of political uncertainty and changing governments, there might be less fiscal consolidation than expected thus far.",
        "A combination of fiscal slippage in some countries and fiscal discipline in others was leading to a divergence in fiscal positions and greater vulnerability.",
        "In September euro area countries would have to present their multi-year budgetary plans.",
        "Markets would then start analysing how compliant these plans were with the fiscal rules, the credibility of which depended on early and serious compliance efforts.",
        "Promotion of a sound fiscal regime called for being vocal about the need for structural reforms as well, since weak economic growth implied a higher risk of slippages in complying with the fiscal rules.",
        "In this context, it was also suggested that in the implementation of the NGEU programme the emphasis should be more on effectiveness than on speediness, given the risk of inefficiencies associated with limited administrative capacity on the part of the implementation authorities.",
        "Members assessed that the risks to economic growth were tilted to the downside.",
        "A weaker world economy or an escalation in trade tensions between major economies would weigh on euro area growth.",
        "Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East were major sources of geopolitical risk.",
        "This might result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted.",
        "Growth could also be lower if the effects of monetary policy turned out stronger than expected.",
        "Growth could be higher if inflation came down more quickly than expected and rising confidence and real incomes meant that spending increased by more than anticipated, or if the world economy grew more strongly than expected.",
        "The point was made that the continuous presence of macro risks, such as geopolitical fragmentation and a lack of fiscal discipline, might fuel uncertainty and hamper planning, although it appeared that, thus far, the economy had shown resilience to this type of uncertainty.",
        "With regard to price developments, members concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane that the incoming information broadly confirmed the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Annual inflation had eased slightly to 2.5% in June, with both goods price inflation and services price inflation unchanged, at 0.7% and 4.1% respectively.",
        "While some measures of underlying inflation had ticked up in May owing to one-off factors, most measures had either been stable or edged down in June.",
        "Inflation was expected to fluctuate around current levels for the rest of the year, partly owing to energy-related base effects.",
        "It was then expected to decline towards target over the second half of next year, owing to weaker growth in labour costs, the effects of restrictive monetary policy and the fading impact of the past inflation surge.",
        "Members considered that the short-term inflation outlook had remained broadly in line with the June projections, although pointing to somewhat higher profiles for services inflation and core inflation, partly associated with increases in tourism-related prices.",
        "It was also emphasised that the disinflationary process in headline HICP inflation over the shorter-term horizon was more evident when adjusting for the impact of energy-related base effects that were causing some volatility in the latter part of this year.",
        "It was noted that surveys and markets were somewhat more optimistic about inflation over the short term than the June projections, while they were somewhat more pessimistic about economic growth.",
        "The persistence in services inflation remained the central element shaping the inflation outlook.",
        "A remark was made that the risk of seeing high services inflation for a longer period had not been mitigated by the tepid recovery.",
        "This was not just an issue for the euro area but seemed to hold true more broadly.",
        "For the euro area, in June services inflation had been higher than expected and a string of consecutive upward surprises had been observed.",
        "Services inflation had dropped fairly quickly from its peak in mid-2023 to 4% in November 2023, but since then it had hovered around that level.",
        "In contrast to goods price inflation, where the decline had proceeded very quickly, progress in reducing services inflation appeared to have stalled.",
        "At current levels, services inflation was almost twice as high as its average before the global financial crisis.",
        "Moreover, the persistence of services inflation was broad-based across euro area countries and components rather than being driven by individual categories, and momentum remained high despite its recent decline.",
        "As disinflation in non-energy industrial goods was flattening out and high freight costs and rising protectionism might put upward pressure on goods price inflation in the future, a further decline in core inflation would need to rely on disinflation in services.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that services inflation was a sluggish and lagging element in the inflation process.",
        "For some items, in particular, the latest observations may have reflected “laggards” – delayed backward-looking repricing in some specific subsectors – rather than a generalised forward-looking price resetting.",
        "Members agreed that the triangular relationship between wages, productivity and profits remained central to assessing domestic price pressures and the inflation outlook more generally.",
        "It was argued that the expected disinflationary trend was based on dynamics in these three variables, which were quite aligned with historical patterns.",
        "However, it was cautioned that the evolution of these variables remained surrounded by a high level of uncertainty.",
        "Developments thus warranted close monitoring and the data for the second quarter would be important inputs for the Governing Council’s next monetary policy meeting in September.",
        "Concerning wages specifically, in the first quarter of this year all available measures had pointed to continued elevated growth, but this had been largely anticipated in the June projections.",
        "While the latest data showed that wages in the euro area were still rising at an elevated pace, it was maintained that the most recent aggregate developments to a large extent reflected developments in specific sectors and countries rather than a broad-based trend.",
        "The profile for wage growth embedded in the latest projections was downward-sloping for 2025 and 2026, and this expectation was supported by results from a number of surveys.",
        "While survey indications of lower wage growth were favourable news for the inflation outlook, caution was expressed that this decline still needed to appear in the data, which, so far, had remained exceptionally high by historical standards.",
        "In this context, it was considered useful to look at decompositions of wage growth into its main drivers, such as the catch-up component, forward-looking inflation expectations, labour market tightness and compensation for higher productivity.",
        "Reference was made to evidence from the CTS, where more than half of respondents had indicated that recruiting had become harder at prevailing wages.",
        "In case labour scarcity turned out to be a structural phenomenon caused, for example, by demographic factors or changes in preferences for leisure, it was important to assess how far wage increases reflected the increased negotiation power of workers, whether individual or collective, and how far they merely reflected real wage catch-up in the wake of the inflation surge.",
        "The staggered process of collective wage bargaining implied a deferred impact of inflation on real wage catch-up.",
        "Real wages of a very large share of workers in some countries still fell short of their pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Looking ahead, this provided for some protractedness in wage dynamics.",
        "While from an inflation perspective it was desirable for the catch-up to proceed in a contained manner, it was also a healthy element underpinning real income growth and benefiting the euro area economy.",
        "At the same time, concerns were expressed that wages might continue to grow more strongly than would be consistent with the inflation target – even after the catch-up process had been completed.",
        "However, the more real wages caught up, the lower the incentives for workers to claim higher wage increases and for firms to pass on those wage increases in the current environment of weak demand.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, members took note of the latest developments in market-based measures of inflation compensation and survey-based indicators.",
        "Measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained broadly stable, with most standing at around 2%.",
        "Current inflation expectations were well anchored, but suggested that inflation was unlikely to undershoot the target as distributions were still skewed to the upside.",
        "This was generally valid for expectations derived from the Consumer Expectations Survey, the SAFE, the SPF and the SMA.",
        "The option-implied probabilities for five-year forward inflation-linked swap rates five years ahead were higher for outcomes above 2.5% than for outcomes below 1.5%.",
        "However, analysts’ longer-term inflation expectations as reported in the SMA did not show the same asymmetry.",
        "It was suggested that, in principle, larger upside than downside risks could be reconciled with expectations of more frequent adverse supply shocks in the future.",
        "Regarding risks, members assessed that inflation could turn out higher than anticipated if wages or profits increased by more than expected.",
        "Upside risks to inflation also stemmed from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade.",
        "Moreover, extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices.",
        "By contrast, inflation might surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampened demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsened unexpectedly.",
        "The point was made that downside risks to aggregate demand would come with downside risks to inflation over the medium term.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that there were still good reasons to remain watchful of upside risks to inflation.",
        "First, incoming data, particularly for services inflation, had been above earlier expectations.",
        "Second, key building blocks of the disinflation narrative, such as the expected pick-up in productivity and moderation in wage growth, had yet to appear in the actual data.",
        "At present, unit labour costs were still growing fast.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members underlined that the policy rate cut in June had been transmitted smoothly to money market interest rates.",
        "Market interest rates had edged down since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting in June, although they had been fluctuating to some extent since then in response to data releases.",
        "On average market participants were currently pricing in almost two additional 25 basis point cuts by the end of the year, but had attached almost no probability to a cut at the July monetary policy meeting.",
        "Overall, broader financial conditions had changed little since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting in June, but they had been somewhat volatile in the meantime.",
        "Financial markets had been affected by political uncertainty in the euro area, although the overall effects and increase in volatility had remained muted and had largely been reversed.",
        "Financing costs had remained broadly stable at restrictive levels, as previous policy rate increases continued to work their way through the transmission chain.",
        "The average interest rate on new loans to firms had edged down in May, while mortgage rates had remained unchanged.",
        "Lending conditions had remained tight.",
        "According to the latest BLS, credit standards for lending to firms had tightened slightly in the second quarter, while standards for mortgages had eased moderately.",
        "The BLS also highlighted continued sluggish demand from firms for loans and credit lines, though expected growth in loan demand had turned positive.",
        "Moreover, households’ demand for mortgages and consumer loans had risen.",
        "The view was expressed that, overall, the BLS results suggested that the transmission of monetary policy restriction was likely to have passed its peak.",
        "Credit growth also remained subdued.",
        "Growth of bank lending to firms and households had remained at low levels in May and had only marginally increased from the previous month.",
        "The annual growth rate of M3 had continued its gradual recovery while remaining relatively subdued.",
        "It was largely being driven by inflows of funds from outside the euro area.",
        "Turning to the monetary policy stance, members assessed the data that had become available since the last monetary policy meeting in accordance with the three main elements that the Governing Council had communicated in 2023 as shaping its reaction function.",
        "Starting with the inflation outlook, members broadly concurred with the assessment that had been presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The incoming information and forward-looking indicators had generally supported the Governing Council’s previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Recent developments and the latest data were still broadly consistent with the June staff projections.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to fluctuate around current levels for the rest of the year, partly owing to energy-related base effects.",
        "But inflation was expected to decline towards the target over the second half of next year and then stabilise around the target in 2026.",
        "It was also important to note that inflation expectations had remained firmly anchored, with most measures of longer-term inflation expectations standing at around 2%.",
        "At the same time, the current distribution of inflation expectations was still skewed to the upside.",
        "In addition, services inflation had continued to be more persistent than expected.",
        "With regard to underlying inflation, members noted that while some measures of underlying inflation had ticked up in May owing to one-off factors, most measures had either been stable or edged down in June.",
        "Still, the signals from the different measures of underlying inflation remained mixed.",
        "Domestic inflation continued to be elevated, at the top of the range of these measures, and appeared to be stickier than expected.",
        "Core inflation also remained relatively high.",
        "It had been higher than expected, showing some persistence, and was still subject to upside risks given the repeated upside surprises in services inflation.",
        "More generally, many measures of underlying inflation were likely to be fairly flat for the remainder of the year.",
        "Interpreting these data had become trickier because, as inflation approached the target, these measures would naturally adjust more slowly.",
        "It was therefore becoming harder to determine whether or not the slower decline signalled a genuine stalling of the disinflation process.",
        "Labour cost dynamics would continue to be a key concern, with the interaction between wages, productivity and profits likely to be particularly important for the evolution of domestic inflation, as captured by the GDP deflator.",
        "In this respect, it was comforting to see that domestic cost pressures from high wage growth, including in the services sector, had been increasingly buffered by unit profits.",
        "Finally, members generally agreed that monetary policy transmission was unfolding according to expectations.",
        "Monetary policy was keeping financing conditions restrictive and the transmission of past policy rate hikes remained strong.",
        "Tight financing conditions partly explained the sluggishness in domestic demand and would continue to weigh on activity in the coming months.",
        "The view was taken that the ongoing contraction of the Eurosystem balance sheet added to that restrictiveness.",
        "At the same time, the continued growth of profits in the services sector, albeit at lower rates, and the strength of services demand suggested a weaker transmission of monetary policy to the part of the economy that was exerting the strongest inflationary pressures.",
        "That said, monetary policy would probably take longer to be transmitted to the services sector.",
        "And even if transmission to services inflation was relatively weaker, this should not be seen in isolation from the relatively low goods price inflation.",
        "Against this background, all members agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to maintain the three key ECB interest rates at their current levels.",
        "Members concurred that the incoming information broadly supported the Governing Council’s previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "While some measures of underlying inflation had ticked up in May owing to one-off factors, most measures had either been stable or edged down in June.",
        "In line with expectations, the inflationary impact of high wage growth had been buffered by profits.",
        "Monetary policy was keeping financing conditions restrictive.",
        "At the same time, domestic price pressures were still high, services inflation was elevated and headline inflation was likely to remain above the target well into 2025.",
        "It was remarked that these developments suggested that the last mile of disinflation was more challenging and that the task of bringing inflation down sustainably to the 2% target was not yet assured, despite the significant progress made.",
        "With inflation coming down only gradually, it was seen as natural that the Governing Council’s policy response should be cautious.",
        "This supported a pause at the current meeting.",
        "Such a cautious approach was particularly warranted given the prevailing uncertainties about the evolution of wages, profits, productivity and services inflation.",
        "All of these would need further monitoring and assessment as new data arrived in order to gain further confidence in the inflation outlook.",
        "By the time of the September meeting extensive new data would be available, such as the July and August inflation data; national account information on the second quarter, including compensation per employee, profits and productivity; an update on monetary data; and a new set of staff projections.",
        "In terms of timing, it was argued that the Governing Council could afford to be patient and wait for more data to confirm that disinflation was indeed on track.",
        "A cautious approach would also allow the Governing Council to respond by following a more gradual path of reducing policy rates if inflation was more persistent than currently foreseen.",
        "The importance of bringing inflation down sustainably to the target in a timely manner was reiterated.",
        "It mattered both for credibility and because a further delay could entail high costs, with inflation expectations being more fragile than usual owing to inflation having been above target for so long.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that a gradual attenuation of policy restriction was a balancing act, as it was also important not to unduly harm the economy by keeping rates at a restrictive level for too long.",
        "Members emphasised that they remained determined to ensure inflation would return to the 2% medium-term target in a timely manner and that they would keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim.",
        "It was also seen as important to maintain a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction.",
        "There should be no pre-commitment to a particular rate path, since the exact pace at which inflation would return to target remained uncertain.",
        "It was nonetheless also important to keep an eye on the real economy.",
        "The September meeting was widely seen as a good time to re-evaluate the level of monetary policy restriction.",
        "That meeting should be approached with an open mind, which also implied that data dependence was not equivalent to being overly focused on specific, single data points.",
        "Finally, policy should continue to be based on the established elements of the reaction function.",
        "Members also agreed with the Executive Board proposal to continue applying flexibility in the partial reinvestment of redemptions falling due in the pandemic emergency purchase programme portfolio.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Please note that related topic tags are currently available for selected content only.",
        "Ms Schnabel noted that since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 17-18 July 2024 there had been repeated periods of elevated market volatility, as growth concerns had become the dominant market theme.",
        "The volatility in risk asset markets had left a more persistent imprint on broader financial markets associated with shifting expectations for the policy path of the Federal Reserve System.",
        "The reappraisal of expectations for US monetary policy had spilled over into euro area rate expectations, supported by somewhat weaker economic data and a notable decline in headline inflation in the euro area.",
        "Overnight index swap (OIS) markets were currently pricing in a steeper and more frontloaded rate-cutting cycle than had been anticipated at the time of the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "At the same time, survey expectations had hardly changed relative to July.",
        "Volatility in US equity markets had shot up to levels last seen in October 2020, following the August US non-farm payroll employment report and the unwinding of yen carry trades.",
        "Similarly, both the implied volatility in the euro area stock market and the Composite Indicator of Systemic Stress had spiked.",
        "However, the turbulence had proved short-lived, and indicators of volatility and systemic stress had come down quickly.",
        "The sharp swings in risk aversion among global investors had been mirrored in equity prices, with the weaker growth outlook having also been reflected in the sectoral performance of global equity markets.",
        "In both the euro area and the United States, defensive sectors had recently outperformed cyclical ones, suggesting that equity investors were positioning themselves for weaker economic growth.",
        "Two factors could have amplified stock market dynamics.",
        "One was that the sensitivity of US equity prices to US macroeconomic shocks can depend on prevailing valuations.",
        "Another was the greater role of speculative market instruments, including short volatility equity funds.",
        "The pronounced reappraisal of the expected path of US monetary policy had spilled over into rate expectations across major advanced economies, including the euro area.",
        "The euro area OIS forward curve had shifted noticeably lower compared with expectations prevailing at the time of the Governing Council’s July meeting.",
        "In contrast to market expectations, surveys had proven much more stable.",
        "The expectations reported in the most recent Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) had been unchanged versus the previous round and pointed towards a more gradual rate path.",
        "The dynamics of market-based and survey-based policy rate expectations over the year – as illustrated by the total rate cuts expected by the end of 2024 and the end of 2025 in the markets and in the SMA – showed that the higher volatility in market expectations relative to surveys had been a pervasive feature.",
        "Since the start of 2024 market-based expectations had oscillated around stable SMA expectations.",
        "The dominant drivers of interest rate markets in the inter-meeting period and for most of 2024 had in fact been US rather than domestic euro area factors, which could partly explain the more muted sensitivity of analysts’ expectations to recent incoming data.",
        "At the same time, the expected policy divergence between the euro area and the United States had changed signs, with markets currently expecting a steeper easing cycle for the Federal Reserve.",
        "The decline in US nominal rates across maturities since the Governing Council’s last meeting could be explained mainly by a decline in expected real rates, as shown by a breakdown of OIS rates across different maturities into inflation compensation and real rates.",
        "By contrast, the decline in euro area nominal rates had largely related to a decline in inflation compensation.",
        "The market’s reassessment of the outlook for inflation in the euro area and the United States had led to the one-year inflation-linked swap (ILS) rates one year ahead declining broadly in tandem on both sides of the Atlantic.",
        "The global shift in investor focus from inflation to growth concerns may have lowered investors’ required compensation for upside inflation risks.",
        "A second driver of inflation compensation had been the marked decline in energy prices since the Governing Council’s July meeting.",
        "Over the past few years the market’s near-term inflation outlook had been closely correlated with energy prices.",
        "Market-based inflation expectations had again been oscillating around broadly stable survey-based expectations, as shown by a comparison of the year-to-date developments in SMA expectations and market pricing for inflation rates at the 2024 and 2025 year-ends.",
        "The dominance of US factors in recent financial market developments and the divergence in policy rate expectations between the euro area and the United States had also been reflected in exchange rate developments.",
        "The euro had been pushed higher against the US dollar owing to the repricing of US monetary policy expectations and the deterioration in the US macroeconomic outlook.",
        "In nominal effective terms, however, the euro exchange rate had depreciated mildly, as the appreciation against the US dollar and other currencies had been more than offset by a weakening against the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen.",
        "Sovereign bond markets had once again proven resilient to the volatility in riskier asset market segments.",
        "Ten-year sovereign spreads over German Bunds had widened modestly after the turbulence but had retreated shortly afterwards.",
        "As regards corporate borrowing, the costs of rolling over euro area and US corporate debt had eased measurably across rating buckets relative to their peak.",
        "Finally, there had been muted take-up in the first three-month lending operation extending into the period of the new pricing for the main refinancing operations.",
        "As announced in March, the spread to the deposit facility rate would be reduced from 50 to 15 basis points as of 18 September 2024.",
        "Moreover, markets currently expected only a slow increase in take-up and no money market reaction to this adjustment.",
        "Mr Lane started by reviewing inflation developments in the euro area.",
        "Headline inflation had decreased to 2.2% in August (flash release), which was 0.4 percentage points lower than in July.",
        "This mainly reflected a sharp decline in energy inflation, from 1.2% in July to -3.0% in August, on account of downward base effects.",
        "Food inflation had been 2.4% in August, marginally up from 2.3% in July.",
        "Core inflation – as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) excluding energy and food – had decreased by 0.1 percentage points to 2.8% in August, as the decline in goods inflation to 0.4% had outweighed the rise in services inflation to 4.2%.",
        "Most measures of underlying inflation had been broadly unchanged in July.",
        "However, domestic inflation remained high, as wages were still rising at an elevated pace.",
        "But labour cost pressures were moderating, and lower profits were partially buffering the impact of higher wages on inflation.",
        "Growth in compensation per employee had fallen further, to 4.3%, in the second quarter of 2024.",
        "And despite weak productivity unit labour costs had grown less strongly, by 4.6%, after 5.2% in the first quarter.",
        "Annual growth in unit profits had continued to fall, coming in at -0.6%, after -0.2% in the first quarter and +2.5% in the last quarter of 2023.",
        "Negotiated wage growth would remain high and volatile over the remainder of the year, given the significant role of one-off payments in some countries and the staggered nature of wage adjustments.",
        "The forward-looking wage tracker also signalled that wage growth would be strong in the near term but moderate in 2025.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to rise again in the latter part of this year, partly because previous falls in energy prices would drop out of the annual rates.",
        "According to the latest ECB staff projections, headline inflation was expected to average 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026, notably reaching 2.0% during the second half of next year.",
        "Compared with the June projections, the profile for headline inflation was unchanged.",
        "Inflation projections including owner-occupied housing costs were a helpful cross-check.",
        "However, in the September projections these did not imply any substantial difference, as inflation both in rents and in the owner-occupied housing cost index had shown a very similar profile to the overall HICP inflation projection.",
        "For core inflation, the projections for 2024 and 2025 had been revised up slightly, as services inflation had been higher than expected.",
        "Staff continued to expect a rapid decline in core inflation, from 2.9% this year to 2.3% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026.",
        "Owing to a weaker economy and lower wage pressures, the projections now saw faster disinflation in the course of 2025, resulting in the projection for core inflation in the fourth quarter of that year being marked down from 2.2% to 2.1%.",
        "Turning to the global economy, Mr Lane stressed that global activity excluding the euro area remained resilient and that global trade had strengthened in the second quarter of 2024, as companies frontloaded their orders in anticipation of shipping delays ahead of the Christmas season.",
        "At the same time downside risks were rising, with indicators signalling a slowdown in manufacturing.",
        "The frontloading of trade in the first half of the year meant that trade performance in the second half could be weaker.",
        "The euro had been appreciating against the US dollar (+1.0%) since the July Governing Council meeting but had been broadly stable in effective terms.",
        "As for the energy markets, Brent crude oil prices had decreased by 14%, to around USD 75 per barrel, since the July meeting.",
        "European natural gas prices had increased by 16%, to stand at around €37 per megawatt-hour amid ongoing geopolitical concerns.",
        "Euro area real GDP had expanded by 0.2% in the second quarter of this year, after being revised down.",
        "This followed 0.3% in the first quarter and fell short of the latest staff projections for real GDP.",
        "It was important not to exaggerate the slowdown in the second quarter of 2024.",
        "This was less pronounced when excluding a small euro area economy with a large and volatile contribution from intangible investment.",
        "However, while the euro area economy was continuing to grow, the expansion was being driven not by private domestic demand, but mainly by net exports and government spending.",
        "Private domestic demand had weakened, as households were consuming less, firms had cut business investment and housing investment had dropped sharply.",
        "The euro area flash composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had risen to 51.2 in August from 50.2 in July.",
        "While the services sector continued to expand, the more interest-sensitive manufacturing sector continued to contract, as it had done for most of the past two years.",
        "The flash PMI for services business activity for August had risen to 53.3, while the manufacturing output PMI remained deeply in contractionary territory at 45.7.",
        "The overall picture raised concerns: as developments were very similar for both activity and new orders, there was no indication that the manufacturing sector would recover anytime soon.",
        "Consumer confidence remained subdued and industrial production continued to face strong headwinds, with the highly interconnected industrial sector in the euro area’s largest economy suffering from a prolonged slump.",
        "On trade, it was also a concern that the improvements in the PMIs for new export orders for both services and manufacturing had again slipped in the last month or two.",
        "After expanding by 3.5% in 2023, global real GDP was expected to grow by 3.4% in 2024 and 2025, and 3.3% in 2026, according to the September ECB staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "Compared to the June projections, global real GDP growth had been revised up by 0.1 percentage points in each year of the projection horizon.",
        "Even though the outlook for the world economy had been upgraded slightly, there had been a downgrade in terms of the export prices of the euro area’s competitors, which was expected to fuel disinflationary pressures in the euro area, particularly in 2025.",
        "The euro area labour market remained resilient.",
        "The unemployment rate had been broadly unchanged in July, at 6.4%.",
        "Employment had grown by 0.2% in the second quarter.",
        "At the same time, the growth in the labour force had slowed.",
        "Recent survey indicators pointed to a further moderation in the demand for labour, with the job vacancy rate falling from 2.9% in the first quarter to 2.6% in the second quarter, close to its pre-pandemic peak of 2.4%.",
        "Early indicators of labour market dynamics suggested a further deceleration of labour market momentum in the third quarter.",
        "The employment PMI had stood at the broadly neutral level of 49.9 in August.",
        "In the staff projections output growth was expected to be 0.8% in 2024 and to strengthen to 1.3% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026.",
        "Compared with the June projections, the outlook for growth had been revised down by 0.1 percentage points in each year of the projection horizon.",
        "For 2024, the downward revision reflected lower than expected GDP data and subdued short-term activity indicators.",
        "For 2025 and 2026 the downward revisions to the average annual growth rates were the result of slightly weaker contributions from net trade and domestic demand.",
        "Concerning fiscal policies, the euro area budget balance was projected to improve progressively, though less strongly than in the previous projection round, from -3.6% in 2023 to -3.3% in 2024, -3.2% in 2025 and -3.0% in 2026.",
        "Turning to monetary and financial analysis, risk-free market interest rates had decreased markedly since the last monetary policy meeting, mostly owing to a weaker outlook for global growth and reduced concerns about inflation pressures.",
        "Tensions in global markets over the summer had led to a temporary tightening of financial conditions in the riskier market segments.",
        "But in the euro area and elsewhere forward rates had fallen across maturities.",
        "Financing conditions for firms and households remained restrictive, as the past policy rate increases continued to work their way through the transmission chain.",
        "The average interest rates on new loans to firms and on new mortgages had stayed high in July, at 5.1% and 3.8% respectively.",
        "Monetary dynamics were broadly stable amid marked volatility in monthly flows, with net external assets remaining the main driver of money creation.",
        "The annual growth rate of M3 had stood at 2.3% in July, unchanged from June but up from 1.5% in May.",
        "Credit growth remained sluggish amid weak demand.",
        "Regarding the assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, Mr Lane concluded that confidence in a timely return of inflation to target was supported by both declining uncertainty around the projections, including their stability across projection rounds, and also by inflation expectations across a range of indicators that remained aligned with a timely convergence to target.",
        "The incoming data on wages and profits had been in line with expectations.",
        "The baseline scenario foresaw a demand-led economic recovery that boosted labour productivity, allowing firms to absorb the expected growth in labour costs without denting their profitability too much.",
        "This should buffer the cost pressures stemming from higher wages, dampening price increases.",
        "Most measures of underlying inflation, including those with a high predictive content for future inflation, were stable at levels consistent with inflation returning to target in a sufficiently timely manner.",
        "While domestic inflation was still being kept elevated by pay rises, the projected slowdown in wage growth next year was expected to make a major contribution to the final phase of disinflation towards the target.",
        "Based on this assessment, it was now appropriate to take another step in moderating the degree of monetary policy restriction.",
        "Accordingly, Mr Lane proposed lowering the deposit facility rate – the rate through which the Governing Council steered the monetary policy stance – by 25 basis points.",
        "This decision was robust across a wide range of scenarios.",
        "At a still clearly restrictive level of 3.50% for the deposit facility rate, upside shocks to inflation calling into question the timely return of inflation to target could be addressed with a slower pace of rate reductions in the coming quarters compared with the baseline rate path embedded in the projections.",
        "At the same time, compared with holding the deposit facility rate at 3.75%, this level also offered greater protection against downside risks that could lead to an undershooting of the target further out in the projection horizon, including the risks associated with an excessively slow unwinding of the rate tightening cycle.",
        "Looking ahead, a gradual approach to dialling back restrictiveness would be appropriate if the incoming data were in line with the baseline projection.",
        "At the same time, optionality should be retained as regards the speed of adjustment.",
        "In one direction, if the incoming data indicated a sustained acceleration in the speed of disinflation or a material shortfall in the speed of economic recovery (with its implications for medium-term inflation), a faster pace of rate adjustment could be warranted; in the other direction, if the incoming data indicated slower than expected disinflation or a faster pace of economic recovery, a slower pace of rate adjustment could be warranted.",
        "These considerations reinforced the value of a meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach that maintained two-way optionality and flexibility for future rate decisions.",
        "This implied reiterating (i) the commitment to keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to target; (ii) the emphasis on a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach in setting policy; and (iii) the retention of the three-pronged reaction function, based on the Governing Council’s assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "As announced in March, some changes to the operational framework for implementing monetary policy were to come into effect at the start of the next maintenance period on 18 September.",
        "The spread between the rate on the main refinancing operations and the deposit facility rate would be reduced to 15 basis points.",
        "The spread between the rate on the marginal lending facility and the rate on the main refinancing operations would remain unchanged at 25 basis points.",
        "These technical adjustments implied that the main refinancing operations and marginal lending facility rates would be reduced by 60 basis points the following week, to 3.65% and 3.90% respectively.",
        "In view of these changes, the Governing Council should emphasise in its communication that it steered the monetary policy stance by adjusting the deposit facility rate.",
        "Looking at the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane.",
        "Incoming data confirmed growth in global activity had been resilient, although recent negative surprises in PMI manufacturing output indicated potential headwinds to the near-term outlook.",
        "While the services sector was growing robustly, the manufacturing sector was contracting.",
        "Goods inflation was declining sharply, in contrast to persistent services inflation.",
        "Global trade had surprised on the upside in the second quarter, likely owing to frontloaded restocking.",
        "However, it was set to decelerate again in the third quarter and then projected to recover and grow in line with global activity over the rest of the projection horizon.",
        "Euro area foreign demand followed a path similar to global trade and had been revised up for 2024 (owing mainly to strong data).",
        "Net exports had been the main demand component supporting euro area activity in the past two quarters.",
        "Looking ahead, though, foreign demand was showing signs of weakness, with falling export orders and PMIs.",
        "Overall, the September projections had shown a slightly improved growth outlook relative to the June projections, both globally and for the major economies, which suggested that fears of a major global slowdown might be exaggerated.",
        "US activity remained robust, despite signs of rebalancing in the labour market.",
        "The recent rise in unemployment was due primarily to an increasing labour force, driven by higher participation rates and strong immigration, rather than to weakening labour demand or increased slack.",
        "China’s growth had slowed significantly in the second quarter as the persistent downturn in the property market continued to dampen household demand.",
        "Exports remained the primary driver of growth.",
        "Falling Chinese export prices highlighted the persisting overcapacity in the construction and high-tech manufacturing sectors.",
        "Turning to commodities, oil prices had fallen significantly since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "The decline reflected positive supply news, dampened risk sentiment and the slowdown in economic activity, especially in China.",
        "The futures curve suggested a downward trend for oil prices.",
        "In contrast, European gas prices had increased in the wake of geopolitical concerns and localised supply disruptions.",
        "International prices for both metal and food commodities had declined slightly.",
        "Food prices had fallen owing to favourable wheat crop conditions in Canada and the United States.",
        "In this context, it was argued that the decline in commodity prices could be interpreted as a barometer of sentiment on the strength of global activity.",
        "With regard to economic activity in the euro area, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Lane and acknowledged the weaker than expected growth outcome in the second quarter.",
        "While broad agreement was expressed with the latest macroeconomic projections, it was emphasised that incoming data implied a downward revision to the growth outlook relative to the previous projection round.",
        "Moreover, the remark was made that the private domestic economy had contributed negatively to GDP growth for the second quarter in a row and had been broadly stagnating since the middle of 2022.",
        "It was noted that, since the cut-off for the projections, Eurostat had revised data for the latest quarters, with notable changes to the composition of growth.",
        "Moreover, in earlier national account releases, there had already been sizeable revisions to backdata, with upward revisions to the level of activity, which had been broadly taken into account in the September projections.",
        "With respect to the latest release, the demand components for the second quarter pointed to an even less favourable contribution from consumption and investment and therefore presented a more pessimistic picture than in the September staff projections.",
        "The euro area current account surplus also suggested that domestic demand remained weak.",
        "Reference was made to potential adverse non-linear dynamics resulting from the current economic weakness, for example from weaker balance sheets of households and firms, or originating in the labour market, as in some countries large firms had recently moved to lay off staff.",
        "It was underlined that the long-anticipated consumption-led recovery in the euro area had so far not materialised.",
        "This raised the question of whether the projections relied too much on consumption driving the recovery.",
        "The latest data showed that households had continued to be very cautious in their spending.",
        "The saving rate was elevated and had rebounded in recent quarters in spite of already high accumulated savings, albeit from a lower level following the national accounts revisions to the backdata.",
        "This might suggest that consumers were worried about their economic prospects and had little confidence in a robust recovery, even if this was not fully in line with the observed trend increase in consumer confidence.",
        "In this context, several factors that could be behind households’ increased caution were mentioned.",
        "These included uncertainty about the geopolitical situation, fiscal policy, the economic impact of climate change and transition policies, demographic developments as well as the outcome of elections.",
        "In such an uncertain environment, businesses and households could be more cautious and wait to see how the situation would evolve.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that an important factor boosting the saving ratio was the high interest rate environment.",
        "While the elasticity of savings to interest rates was typically relatively low in models, the increase in interest rates since early 2022 had been very significant, coming after a long period of low or negative rates.",
        "Against this background, even a small elasticity implied a significant impact on consumption and savings.",
        "Reference was also made to the European Commission’s consumer sentiment indicators.",
        "They had been showing a gradual recovery in consumer confidence for some time (in step with lower inflation), while perceived consumer uncertainty had been retreating.",
        "Therefore, the high saving rate was unlikely to be explained by mainly precautionary motives.",
        "It rather reflected ongoing monetary policy transmission, which could, however, be expected to gradually weaken over time, with deposit and loan rates starting to fall.",
        "Surveys were already pointing to an increase in household spending.",
        "In this context, the lags in monetary policy transmission were recalled.",
        "For example, households that had not yet seen any increase in their mortgage payments would be confronted with a higher mortgage rate if their rate fixation period expired.",
        "This might be an additional factor encouraging a build-up of savings.",
        "Reference was also made to the concept of permanent income as an important determinant of consumer spending.",
        "If households feared that their permanent income had not increased by as much as their current disposable income, owing to structural developments in the economy, then it was not surprising that they were limiting their spending.",
        "Overall, it was generally considered that a recession in the euro area remained unlikely.",
        "The projected recovery relied on a pick-up in consumption and investment, which remained plausible and in line with standard economics, as the fundamentals for that dynamic to set in were largely in place.",
        "Sluggish spending was reflecting a lagged response to higher real incomes materialising over time.",
        "In addition, the rise in household savings implied a buffer that might support higher spending later, as had been the case in the United States, although consumption and savings behaviour clearly differed on opposite sides of the Atlantic.",
        "Particular concerns were expressed about the weakness in investment this year and in 2025, given the importance of investment for both the demand and the supply side of the economy.",
        "It was observed that the economic recovery was not expected to receive much support from capital accumulation, in part owing to the continued tightness of financial conditions, as well as to high uncertainty and structural weaknesses.",
        "Moreover, it was underlined that one of the main economic drivers of investment was profits, which had weakened in recent quarters, with firms’ liquidity buffers dissipating at the same time.",
        "In addition, in the staff projections, the investment outlook had been revised down and remained subdued.",
        "This was atypical for an economic recovery and contrasted strongly with the very significant investment needs that had been highlighted in Mario Draghi’s report on the future of European competitiveness.",
        "Turning to the labour market, its resilience was still remarkable.",
        "The unemployment rate remained at a historical low amid continued robust – albeit slowing – employment growth.",
        "At the same time, productivity growth had remained low and had surprised to the downside, implying that the increase in labour productivity might not materialise as projected.",
        "However, a declining vacancy rate was seen as reflecting weakening labour demand, although it remained above its pre-pandemic peak.",
        "It was noted that a decline in vacancies usually coincided with higher job destruction and therefore constituted a downside risk to employment and activity more generally.",
        "The decline in vacancies also coincided with a decline in the growth of compensation per employee, which was perceived as a sign that the labour market was cooling.",
        "Members underlined that it was still unclear to what extent low productivity was cyclical or might reflect structural changes with an impact on growth potential.",
        "If labour productivity was low owing to cyclical factors, it was argued that the projected increase in labour productivity did not require a change in European firms’ assumed rate of innovation or in total factor productivity.",
        "The projected increase in labour productivity could simply come from higher capacity utilisation (in the presence of remaining slack) in response to higher demand.",
        "From a cyclical perspective, in a scenario where aggregate demand did not pick up, this would sooner or later affect the labour market.",
        "Finally, even if demand were eventually to recover, there could still be a structural problem and labour productivity growth could remain subdued over the medium term.",
        "On the one hand, it was contended that in such a case potential output growth would be lower, with higher unit labour costs and price pressures.",
        "Such structural problems could not be solved by lower interest rates and had to be addressed by other policy domains.",
        "On the other hand, the view was taken that structural weakness could be amplified by high interest rates.",
        "Such structural challenges could therefore be a concern for monetary policy in the future if they lowered the natural rate of interest, potentially making recourse to unconventional policies more frequent.",
        "Reference was also made to the disparities in the growth outlook for different countries, which were perceived as an additional challenge for monetary policy.",
        "Since the share of manufacturing in gross value added (as well as trade openness) differed across economies, some countries in the euro area were suffering more than others from the slowdown in industrial activity.",
        "Weak growth in the largest euro area economy, in particular, was dragging down euro area growth.",
        "While part of the weakness was likely to be cyclical, this economy was facing significant structural challenges.",
        "By contrast, many other euro area countries had shown robust growth, including strong contributions from domestic demand.",
        "It was also highlighted that the course of national fiscal policies remained very uncertain, as national budgetary plans would have to be negotiated during a transition at the European Commission.",
        "In this context, the gradual improvement in the aggregated fiscal position of the euro area embedded in the projections was masking considerable differences across countries.",
        "Implementing the EU’s revised economic governance framework fully, transparently and without delay would help governments bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis.",
        "The effect of an expansionary fiscal policy on the economy was perceived as particularly uncertain in the current environment, possibly contributing to higher savings rather than higher spending by households (exerting “Ricardian” rather than “Keynesian” effects).",
        "Against this background, members called for fiscal and structural policies aimed at making the economy more productive and competitive, which would help to raise potential growth and reduce price pressures in the medium term.",
        "Mario Draghi’s report on the future of European competitiveness and Enrico Letta’s report on empowering the Single Market stressed the urgent need for reform and provided concrete proposals on how to make this happen.",
        "Governments should now make a strong start in this direction in their medium-term plans for fiscal and structural policies.",
        "In particular, it was argued that Mario Draghi’s report had very clearly identified the structural factors explaining Europe’s growth and industrial competitiveness gap with the United States.",
        "The report was seen as taking a long-term view on the challenges facing Europe, with the basic underlying question of how Europeans could remain in control of their own destiny.",
        "If Europe did not heed the call to invest more, the European economy would increasingly fall behind the United States and China.",
        "Against this background, members assessed that the risks to economic growth remained tilted to the downside.",
        "Lower demand for euro area exports, owing for instance to a weaker world economy or an escalation in trade tensions between major economies, would weigh on euro area growth.",
        "Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East were major sources of geopolitical risk.",
        "This could result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted.",
        "Growth could also be lower if the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening turned out stronger than expected.",
        "Growth could be higher if inflation came down more quickly than expected and rising confidence and real incomes meant that spending increased by more than anticipated, or if the world economy grew more strongly than expected.",
        "With regard to price developments, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction and underlined the fact that the recent declines in inflation had delivered good news.",
        "The incoming data had bolstered confidence that inflation would return to target by the end of 2025.",
        "Falling inflation, slowing wage growth and unit labour costs, as well as higher costs being increasingly absorbed by profits, suggested that the disinflationary process was on track.",
        "The unchanged baseline path for headline inflation in the staff projections gave reassurance that inflation would be back to target by the end of 2025.",
        "However, it was emphasised that core inflation was very persistent.",
        "In particular, services inflation had continued to come in stronger than projected and had moved sideways since November of last year.",
        "Recent declines in headline inflation had been strongly influenced by lower energy prices, which were known to be very volatile.",
        "Moreover, the baseline path to 2% depended critically on lower wage growth as well as on an acceleration of productivity growth towards rates not seen for many years and above historical averages.",
        "Conversely, it was stressed that inflation had recently been declining somewhat faster than expected, and the risk of undershooting the target was now becoming non-negligible.",
        "With Eurostat’s August HICP flash release, the projections were already too pessimistic on the pace of disinflation in the near term.",
        "Moreover, commodity prices had declined further since the cut-off date, adding downward pressure to inflation.",
        "Prices for raw materials, energy costs and competitors’ export prices had all fallen, while the euro had been appreciating against the US dollar.",
        "In addition, lower international prices not only had a short-term impact on headline euro area inflation but would ultimately also have an indirect effect on core inflation, through the price of services such as transportation (e.g.",
        "However, in that particular case, the size of the downward effect depended on how persistent the drop in energy prices was expected to be.",
        "From a longer perspective, it was underlined that for a number of consecutive rounds the projections had pointed to inflation reaching the 2% target by the end of 2025.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the current level of headline inflation understated the challenges that monetary policy was still facing, which called for caution.",
        "Given the current high volatility in energy prices, headline inflation numbers were not very informative about medium-term price pressures.",
        "Overall, it was felt that core inflation required continued attention.",
        "Upward revisions to projected quarterly core inflation until the third quarter of 2025, which for some quarters amounted to as much as 0.3 percentage points, showed that the battle against inflation was not yet won.",
        "Moreover, domestic inflation remained high, at 4.4%.",
        "It reflected persistent price pressures in the services sector, where progress with disinflation had effectively stalled since last November.",
        "Services inflation had risen to 4.2% in August, above the levels of the previous nine months.",
        "The outlook for services inflation called for caution, as its stickiness might be driven by several structural factors.",
        "First, in some services sectors there was a global shortage of labour, which might be structural.",
        "Second, leisure services might also be confronted with a structural change in preferences, which warranted further monitoring.",
        "It was remarked that the projection for industrial goods inflation indicated that the sectoral rate would essentially settle at 1%, where it had been during the period of strong globalisation before the pandemic.",
        "However, in a world of fragmentation, deglobalisation and negative supply shocks, it was legitimate to expect higher price increases for non-energy industrial goods.",
        "Even if inflation was currently low in this category, this was not necessarily set to last.",
        "Members stressed that wage pressures were an important driver of the persistence of services inflation.",
        "While wage growth appeared to be easing gradually, it remained high and bumpy.",
        "The forward-looking wage tracker was still on an upward trajectory, and it was argued that stronger than expected wage pressures remained one of the major upside risks to inflation, in particular through services inflation.",
        "This supported the view that focus should be on a risk scenario where wage growth did not slow down as expected, productivity growth remained low and profits absorbed higher costs to a lesser degree than anticipated.",
        "Therefore, while incoming data had supported the baseline scenario, there were upside risks to inflation over the medium term, as the path back to price stability hinged on a number of critical assumptions that still needed to materialise.",
        "However, it was also pointed out that the trend in overall wage growth was mostly downwards, especially when focusing on growth in compensation per employee.",
        "Nominal wage growth for the first half of the year had been below the June projections.",
        "While negotiated wage growth might be more volatile, in part owing to one-off payments, the difference between it and compensation per employee – the wage drift – was more sensitive to the currently weak state of the economy.",
        "Moreover, despite the ongoing catching-up of real wages, the currently observed faster than expected disinflation could ultimately also be expected to put further downward pressure on wage claims – with second-round effects having remained contained during the latest inflation surge – and no sign of wage-price spirals taking root.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, market-based measures had come down notably and remained broadly anchored at 2%, reflecting the market view that inflation would fall rapidly.",
        "A sharp decline in oil prices, driven mainly by benign supply conditions and lower risk sentiment, had pushed down inflation expectations in the United States and the euro area to levels not seen for a long time.",
        "In this context it was mentioned that, owing to the weakness in economic activity and faster and broader than anticipated disinflation, risks of a downward unanchoring of inflation expectations had increased.",
        "Reference was made, in particular, to the prices of inflation fixings (swap contracts linked to specific monthly releases for euro area year-on-year HICP inflation excluding tobacco), which pointed to inflation well below 2% in the very near term – and falling below 2% much earlier than foreseen in the September projections.",
        "The view was expressed that, even if such prices were not entirely comparable with measured HICP inflation and were partly contaminated by negative inflation risk premia, their low readings suggested that the risks surrounding inflation were at least balanced or might even be on the downside, at least in the short term.",
        "However, it was pointed out that inflation fixings were highly correlated with oil prices and had limited forecasting power beyond short horizons.",
        "Against this background, members assessed that inflation could turn out higher than anticipated if wages or profits increased by more than expected.",
        "Upside risks to inflation also stemmed from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade.",
        "Moreover, extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices.",
        "By contrast, inflation might surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampened demand more than expected or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsened unexpectedly.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessment provided by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane in their introductions.",
        "Market interest rates had declined significantly since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting in July.",
        "Market participants were now fully pricing in a 25 basis point cut in the deposit facility rate for the September meeting and attached a 35% probability to a further rate cut in October.",
        "In total, between two and three rate cuts were now priced in by the end of the year, up from two cuts immediately after the June meeting.",
        "The two-year OIS rate had also decreased by over 40 basis points since the July meeting.",
        "More generally it was noted that, because financial markets were anticipating the full easing cycle, this had already implied an additional and immediate easing of the monetary policy stance, which was reflected in looser financial conditions.",
        "The decline in market interest rates in the euro area and globally was mostly attributable to a weaker outlook for global growth and the anticipation of monetary policy easing due to reduced concerns about inflation pressures.",
        "Spillovers from the United States had played a significant role in the development of euro area market rates, while changes in euro area data – notably the domestic inflation outlook – had been limited, as could be seen from the staff projections.",
        "In addition, it was noted that, while a lower interest rate path in the United States reflected the Federal Reserve’s assessment of prospects for inflation and employment under its dual mandate, lower rates would normally be expected to stimulate the world economy, including in the euro area.",
        "However, the concurrent major decline in global oil prices suggested that this spillover effect could be counteracted by concerns about a weaker global economy, which would naturally reverberate in the euro area.",
        "Tensions in global markets in August had led to a temporary tightening of conditions in some riskier market segments, which had mostly and swiftly been reversed.",
        "Compared with earlier in the year, market participants had generally now switched from being concerned about inflation remaining higher for longer in a context of robust growth to being concerned about too little growth, which could be a prelude to a hard landing, amid receding inflation pressures.",
        "While there were as yet no indications of a hard landing in either the United States or the euro area, it was argued that the events of early August had shown that financial markets were highly sensitive to disappointing growth readings in major economies.",
        "This was seen to represent a source of instability and downside risks, although market developments at that time indicated that investors were still willing to take on risk.",
        "However, the view was also expressed that the high volatility and market turbulence in August partly reflected the unwinding of carry trades in wake of Bank of Japan’s policy tightening following an extended period of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "Moreover, the correction had been short-lived amid continued high valuations in equity markets and low risk premia across a range of assets.",
        "Financing costs in the euro area, measured by the interest rates on market debt instruments and bank loans, had remained restrictive as past policy rate increases continued to work their way through the transmission chain.",
        "The average interest rates on new loans to firms and on new mortgages had stayed high in July, at 5.1 and 3.8% respectively.",
        "It was suggested that other elements of broader financing conditions were not as tight as the level of the lending rates or broader indicators of financial conditions might suggest.",
        "Equity financing, for example, had been abundant during the entire period of disinflation and credit spreads had been very compressed.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that this could simply reflect weak investment demand, whereby firms did not need or want to borrow and so were not prepared to issue debt securities at high rates.",
        "Against this background, credit growth had remained sluggish amid weak demand.",
        "The growth of bank lending to firms and households had remained at levels not far from zero in July, with the former slightly down from June and the latter slightly up.",
        "The annual growth in broad money – as measured by M3 – had in July remained relatively subdued at 2.3%, the same rate as in June.",
        "It was suggested that the weakness in credit dynamics also reflected the still restrictive financing conditions, which were likely to keep credit growth weak through 2025.",
        "It was also argued that banks faced challenges, with their price-to-book ratios, while being higher than in earlier years, remaining generally below one.",
        "Moreover, it was argued that higher credit risk, with deteriorating loan books, had the potential to constrain credit supply.",
        "At the same time, the June rate cut and the anticipation of future cuts had already slightly lowered bank funding costs.",
        "In addition, banks remained highly profitable, with robust valuations.",
        "It was also not unusual for price-to-book ratios to be below one and banks had no difficulty raising capital.",
        "Credit demand was considered the main factor holding back loan growth, since investment remained especially weak.",
        "On the household side, it was suggested that the demand for mortgages was likely to increase with the pick-up in housing markets.",
        "Turning to the monetary policy stance, members assessed the data that had become available since the last monetary policy meeting in accordance with the three main elements of the Governing Council’s reaction function.",
        "Starting with the inflation outlook, the latest ECB staff projections had confirmed the inflation outlook from the June projections.",
        "Inflation was expected to rise again in the latter part of this year, partly because previous sharp falls in energy prices would drop out of the annual rates.",
        "It was then expected to decline towards the target over the second half of next year, with the disinflation process supported by receding labour cost pressures and the past monetary policy tightening gradually feeding through to consumer prices.",
        "Inflation was subsequently expected to remain close to the target on a sustained basis.",
        "Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations stood at around 2%, and the market-based measures had fallen closer to that level since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "Members agreed that recent economic developments had broadly confirmed the baseline outlook, as reflected in the unchanged staff projections for headline inflation, and indicated that the disinflationary path was progressing well and becoming more robust.",
        "Inflation was on the right trajectory and broadly on track to return to the target of 2% by the end of 2025, even if headline inflation was expected to remain volatile for the remainder of 2024.",
        "But this bumpy inflation profile also meant that the final phase of disinflation back to 2% was only expected to start in 2025 and rested on a number of assumptions.",
        "It therefore needed to be carefully monitored whether inflation would settle sustainably at the target in a timely manner.",
        "The risk of delays in reaching the ECB’s target was seen to warrant some caution to avoid dialling back policy restriction prematurely.",
        "At the same time, it was also argued that monetary policy had to remain oriented to the medium term even in the presence of shocks and that the risk of the target being undershot further out in the projection horizon was becoming more significant.",
        "Turning to underlying inflation, members noted that most measures had been broadly unchanged in July.",
        "Domestic inflation had remained high, with strong price pressures coming especially from wages.",
        "Core inflation was still relatively high, had been sticky since the beginning of the year and was continuing to surprise to the upside.",
        "Moreover, the projections for core inflation in 2024 and 2025 had been revised up slightly, as services inflation had been higher than expected.",
        "Labour cost dynamics would continue to be a central concern, with the projected decline in core and services inflation next year reliant on key assumptions for wages, productivity and profits, for which the actual data remained patchy.",
        "In particular, productivity was low and had not yet picked up, while wage growth, despite gradual easing, remained high and bumpy.",
        "A disappointment in productivity growth could be a concern, as the capacity of profits to absorb increases in unit labour costs might be reaching its limits.",
        "Wage growth would then have to decline even further for inflation to return sustainably to the target.",
        "These factors could mean that core inflation and services inflation might be stickier and not decline as much as currently expected.",
        "These risks notwithstanding, comfort could be drawn from the gradual decline in the momentum of services inflation, albeit from high levels, and the expectation that it would fall further, partly as a result of significant base effects.",
        "The catching-up process for wages was advanced, with wage growth already slowing down by more than had previously been projected and expected to weaken even faster next year, with no signs of a wage-price spiral.",
        "If lower energy prices or other factors reduced the cost of living now, this should put downward pressure on wage claims next year.",
        "Finally, members generally agreed that monetary policy transmission from the past tightening continued to dampen economic activity, even if it had likely passed its peak.",
        "Financing conditions remained restrictive.",
        "This was reflected in weak credit dynamics, which had dampened consumption and investment, and thereby economic activity more broadly.",
        "The past monetary policy tightening had gradually been feeding through to consumer prices, thereby supporting the disinflation process.",
        "There were many other reasons why monetary policy was still working its way through the economy, with research suggesting that there could be years of lagged effects before the full impact dissipated completely.",
        "For example, as firms’ and households’ liquidity buffers had diminished, they were now more exposed to higher interest rates than previously, and banks could, in turn, also be facing more credit risk.",
        "At the same time, with the last interest rate hike already a year in the past, the transmission of monetary policy was expected to weaken progressively from its peak, also as loan and deposit rates had been falling, albeit very moderately, for almost a year.",
        "The gradually fading effects of restrictive monetary policy were thus expected to support consumption and investment in the future.",
        "Nonetheless, ongoing uncertainty about the transmission mechanism, in terms of both efficacy and timing, underscored the continuing importance of monitoring the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Against this background, members considered the proposal by Mr Lane to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which the Governing Council steered the monetary policy stance – by 25 basis points.",
        "As had been previously announced on 13 March 2024, some changes to the operational framework for implementing monetary policy would also take effect from 18 September.",
        "In particular, the spread between the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the deposit facility rate would be set at 15 basis points.",
        "The spread between the rate on the marginal lending facility and the rate on the main refinancing operations would remain unchanged at 25 basis points.",
        "Accordingly, the deposit facility rate would be decreased to 3.50% and the interest rates on the main refinancing operations and the marginal lending facility would be decreased to 3.65% and 3.90% respectively.",
        "Based on the updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it was now appropriate to take another step in moderating the degree of monetary policy restriction.",
        "The recent incoming data and the virtually unchanged staff projections had increased members’ confidence that disinflation was proceeding steadily and inflation was on track to return towards the 2% target in a sustainable and timely manner.",
        "Headline inflation had fallen in August to levels previously seen in the summer of 2021 before the inflation surge, and there were signs of easing pressures in the labour market, with wage growth and unit labour costs both slowing.",
        "Despite some bumpy data expected in the coming months, the big picture remained one of a continuing disinflationary trend progressing at a firm pace and more or less to plan.",
        "In particular, the Governing Council’s expectation that significant wage growth would be buffered by lower profits had been confirmed in the recent data.",
        "Both survey and market-based measures of inflation expectations remained well anchored, and longer-term expectations had remained close to 2% for a long period which included times of heightened uncertainty.",
        "Confidence in the staff projections had been bolstered by their recent stability and increased accuracy, and the projections had shown inflation to be on track to reach the target by the end of 2025 for at least the last three rounds.",
        "It was also noted that the overall economic outlook for the euro area was more concerning and the projected recovery was fragile.",
        "Economic activity remained subdued, with risks to economic growth tilted to the downside and near-term risks to growth on the rise.",
        "These concerns were also reflected in the lower growth projections for 2024 and 2025 compared with June.",
        "A remark was made that, with inflation increasingly close to the target, real economic activity should become more relevant for calibrating monetary policy.",
        "Against this background, all members supported the proposal by Mr Lane to reduce the degree of monetary policy restriction through a second 25 basis point rate cut, which was seen as robust across a wide range of scenarios in offering two-sided optionality for the future.",
        "Looking ahead, members emphasised that they remained determined to ensure that inflation would return to the 2% medium-term target in a timely manner and that they would keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim.",
        "They would also continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction.",
        "There should be no pre-commitment to a particular rate path.",
        "Accordingly, it was better to maintain full optionality for the period ahead to be free to respond to all of the incoming data.",
        "It was underlined that the speed at which the degree of restrictiveness should be reduced depended on the evolution of incoming data, with the three elements of the stated reaction function as a solid anchor for the monitoring and decision-making process.",
        "However, such data-dependence did not amount to data point-dependence, and no mechanical weights could be attached to near-term developments in headline inflation or core inflation or any other single statistic.",
        "Rather, it was necessary to assess the implications of the totality of data for the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "For example, it would sometimes be appropriate to ignore volatility in oil prices, but at other times, if oil price moves were likely to create material spillovers across the economy, it would be important to respond.",
        "Members broadly concurred that a gradual approach to dialling back restrictiveness would be appropriate if future data were in line with the baseline projections.",
        "This was also seen to be consistent with the anticipation that a gradual easing of financial conditions would support economic activity, including much-needed investment to boost labour productivity and total factor productivity.",
        "It was mentioned that a gradual and cautious approach currently seemed appropriate because it was not fully certain that the inflation problem was solved.",
        "It was therefore too early to declare victory, also given the upward revisions in the quarterly projections for core inflation and the recent upside surprises to services inflation.",
        "Although uncertainty had declined, it remained high, and some of the key factors and assumptions underlying the baseline outlook, including those related to wages, productivity, profits and core and services inflation, still needed to materialise and would move only slowly.",
        "These factors warranted close monitoring.",
        "The real test would come in 2025, when it would become clearer whether wage growth had come down, productivity growth had picked up as projected and the pass-through of higher labour costs had been moderate enough to keep price pressures contained.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that continuing uncertainty meant that there were two-sided risks to the baseline outlook.",
        "As well as emphasising the value of maintaining a data-dependent approach, this also highlighted important risk management considerations.",
        "In particular, it was underlined that there were alternative scenarios on either side.",
        "For example, a faster pace of rate cuts would likely be appropriate if the downside risks to domestic demand and the growth outlook materialised or if, for example, lower than expected services inflation increased the risk of the target being undershot.",
        "It was therefore important to maintain a meeting-by-meeting approach.",
        "Conversely, there were scenarios in which it might be necessary to suspend the cutting cycle for a while, perhaps because of a structural decline in activity or other factors leading to higher than expected core inflation.",
        "Turning to communication, members agreed that it was important to convey that recent inflation data had come in broadly as expected, and that the latest ECB staff projections had confirmed the previous inflation outlook.",
        "At the same time, to reduce the risk of near-term inflation data being misinterpreted, it should be explained that inflation was expected to rise again in the latter part of this year, partly as a result of base effects, before declining towards the target over the second half of next year.",
        "It should be reiterated that the Governing Council would continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach, would not pre-commit to a particular rate path and would continue to set policy based on the established elements of the reaction function.",
        "In view of the previously announced change to the spread between the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the deposit facility rate, it was also important to make clear at the beginning of the communication that the Governing Council steered the monetary policy stance through the deposit facility rate.",
        "Members also agreed with the Executive Board proposal to continue applying flexibility in the partial reinvestment of redemptions falling due in the pandemic emergency purchase programme portfolio.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Please note that related topic tags are currently available for selected content only.",
        "Ms Schnabel noted that since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 10-11 April 2024, the narrative in financial markets had converged across major advanced economies.",
        "It had moved towards a more gradual easing cycle and high-for-longer interest rates, owing to a more protracted “last mile” of disinflation.",
        "The key drivers of financial market developments had been a stronger euro area economy, signs of a cooling US economy and strong investor risk appetite.",
        "Euro area macroeconomic data had continued to turn out better than expected over the past four months, strengthening investors’ view that the economic recovery was on track.",
        "By contrast, macroeconomic data surprises in the United States had become less favourable.",
        "Tentative signs of the US labour market cooling and inflation in line with expectations had eased investors’ concerns that the Federal Reserve System might have to hike interest rates again.",
        "Looking at how the incoming data had affected expectations for ECB monetary policy, the expected timing of the first rate cut had remained unchanged.",
        "Markets and survey participants were almost certain there would be a first cut of 25 basis points in June.",
        "Yet the overnight index swap (OIS) forward curve had edged higher beyond June.",
        "It was cumulatively pricing in around 20 basis points less in rate cuts by the end of 2024 than it had before the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting in April.",
        "In the June Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) the median participant expected three rate cuts of 25 basis points each by the end of 2024.",
        "This was more than the cuts embedded in market pricing, but one cut less than survey participants had expected before the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "With US inflation having repeatedly surprised on the upside since the Federal Reserve’s pivot in December 2023, market pricing in the United States had also gradually shifted towards fewer and later rate cuts in 2024.",
        "Most recently, however, more subdued US economic data and an inflation release broadly in line with expectations had caused market participants to again price in a slightly steeper easing cycle.",
        "As a result, the narrative of monetary policy divergence across the Atlantic had not played out strongly so far.",
        "By the end of 2024 policy rate cuts were expected to diverge modestly, as the ECB was expected to start its easing cycle ahead of the Federal Reserve, but that divergence was expected to vanish by the end of 2025.",
        "Hence, monetary policy was expected to remain relatively synchronised, with markets anticipating a more gradual and cautious easing cycle across both economies.",
        "Yet the uncertainty around this gradual easing cycle remained high on both sides of the Atlantic.",
        "Market expectations of a more gradual easing cycle and elevated uncertainty around the rate path rested upon anticipation of a more protracted and bumpier disinflation path.",
        "At the start of 2024, investors had expected swift and continuous disinflation.",
        "At that time markets had priced in euro area headline inflation (excluding tobacco) returning to the 2% target by June 2024 and subsequently staying around that level.",
        "Since then, markets had gradually priced in a bumpier inflation profile.",
        "While investors still expected inflation to be close to 2% by June 2025, they expected it to hover in a range of 2.3% to 2.5% until at least the end of 2024.",
        "At the same time, the medium and longer-term inflation profile had also edged up, suggesting that investors did not anticipate a scenario in which inflation would return to below-target levels, as seen during the “low-for-long” period.",
        "The reconvergence in policy rate expectations between the euro area and the United States had also been reflected in longer-term risk-free yields.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, the spread between US and euro area nominal yields had narrowed from its peak in April.",
        "Movements in yield differentials between the euro area and the United States had been mirrored in the euro-US dollar exchange rate, with the euro recently having recovered some of its losses against the US dollar.",
        "Euro area financial conditions had been mixed in recent weeks.",
        "One important driver of these conditions had been risk asset prices.",
        "After the downward correction in equity markets in mid-April 2024, when US rate cuts had been pushed out in time, stock markets had recovered across major economies, temporarily even reaching new all-time highs in the euro area and the United States.",
        "The combination of buoyant risk sentiment globally and recovering domestic growth momentum had also continued to contain sovereign bond spreads.",
        "At the same time, market absorption in euro area government bond markets had remained smooth, supported by benign liquidity conditions.",
        "The smooth market absorption was even more remarkable when considering the further increase in the net issuance of euro area government bonds in 2024.",
        "Together with the reduction in the Eurosystem’s market footprint, this had resulted in record levels of net supply in 2024.",
        "Strong investor risk appetite had fostered low corporate bond spreads, which had narrowed further for high-yield bonds since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting in April.",
        "Therefore, risks of price corrections continued to be elevated, especially in the high-yield segment.",
        "Overall, asset price configurations in equity markets and in the sovereign and corporate bond space pointed to stretched valuations in riskier market segments and to risks of price corrections if the historically buoyant risk sentiment turned.",
        "Pricing in risk asset markets continued to be supported by still abundant central bank liquidity.",
        "Euro area excess liquidity had continued to decline and stood 33% or €1.6 trillion below its peak of €4.7 trillion in November 2022.",
        "The spread between the euro short-term rate (€STR) and the deposit facility rate showed few signs of a lift-off from its floor.",
        "At -9.3 basis points, it remained close to the levels seen over the past year.",
        "Starting with the global economy, Mr Lane stressed that 2023 had still been part of the post-pandemic normalisation process.",
        "The supply side had been a big driver of the strong performance of global growth, while euro area competitors’ export prices had fallen.",
        "The carry-over from that was partly responsible for the low levels of goods inflation now observed in the euro area.",
        "Developments in global activity were looking favourable up to April, mainly because of the soft data, but the outlook for global trade in the second quarter was mixed.",
        "Looking ahead, the June 2024 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections were built on a stable external environment.",
        "In annual terms, world GDP excluding the euro area was projected to grow at 3.3% in 2024 and 2025.",
        "Growth in euro area foreign demand was set to recover this year, rising to 2.1% from 0.8% last year.",
        "It was subsequently expected to grow at rates of around 3%.",
        "The euro had remained broadly stable both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms since the last monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council.",
        "From a longer-term perspective too, the EUR/USD exchange rate had been broadly stable, though the euro had appreciated since the start of the year in trade-weighted terms.",
        "Oil prices had shown sizeable fluctuations over the past year and had decreased by 16% to USD 78 per barrel since the April Governing Council meeting.",
        "Looking ahead, they were expected to remain volatile, which was also linked to geopolitical risks.",
        "Gas prices meanwhile had gone in the other direction: since the last Governing Council meeting, European gas prices had increased by 32% to €36 per megawatt, although demand remained subdued and gas storage levels were high.",
        "Turning to the euro area, headline inflation had been 2.6% in May according to the flash estimate, 0.2 percentage points higher than in April.",
        "Energy inflation had increased to 0.3% from -0.6% in April, mainly driven by upward base effects, while food inflation had receded to 2.6% in May from 2.8% in April.",
        "Inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation) had risen to 2.9% in May from 2.7% in April.",
        "The decline in goods inflation by 0.1 percentage points to 0.8% had been offset by a rebound in services inflation.",
        "This had increased to 4.1% in May after having slowed in April – for the first time in five months – to 3.7%.",
        "Most measures of underlying inflation had eased further, reflecting the fading impact of past large supply shocks and weaker demand, and were drifting lower towards 2%.",
        "At the same time, some underlying inflation indicators remained relatively high, reflecting the lagged unwinding of past inflationary shocks, strong ongoing labour cost increases and/or the one-off repricing in some services items.",
        "Wage growth was still elevated, driven by the ongoing adjustment to the past inflation surge.",
        "Negotiated wage growth had increased to 4.7% in the first quarter of 2024, 0.2 percentage points higher than in the last quarter of 2023.",
        "The stronger growth in the first quarter included very large one-off payments in the public sector of the euro area’s largest economy.",
        "More broadly, the design of some multi-year wage settlements in that economy specified large increases in 2024 – to compensate for the lack of earlier adjustments to the inflation surge – but much smaller increases in 2025.",
        "Forward-looking wage trackers signalled that wage dynamics would remain strong in 2024 but decelerate in 2025.",
        "For this year many wage contracts had already been concluded.",
        "The Indeed wage tracker had declined to 3.4% in April.",
        "Similarly, firms participating in the Corporate Telephone Survey in April expected wages to grow by 4.3% in 2024, compared with 5.4% in 2023.",
        "Therefore wage growth would continue to be a key driver of inflation in 2024, even though the net impact of labour cost increases on prices was being buffered by a lower contribution from profits.",
        "The GDP deflator was expected to still come in high for the first quarter of 2024, but to decelerate significantly compared with the fourth quarter of 2023, when it had stood at 5.3%.",
        "The deceleration in domestic price pressures was therefore continuing and the projections foresaw a further moderation.",
        "This relied on the ongoing compression of profits and a continued decline in unit labour costs, linked to the scale of the procyclical improvement in productivity.",
        "Inflation was projected to fluctuate around current levels in the coming months.",
        "The headline inflation profile in 2024 was affected by the rolling back of fiscal measures and upward energy base effects.",
        "Headline inflation was then expected to decline towards the target over the second half of the following year, owing to weaker growth in labour costs in 2025 than in 2024, the lagged impact of past monetary policy tightening gradually feeding through to consumer prices, and the fading impact of the energy crisis and the pandemic on price and wage dynamics.",
        "The June Eurosystem staff projections saw inflation averaging 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026.",
        "Compared with the March ECB staff projections, headline inflation had been revised up by 0.2 percentage points for both 2024 and 2025 and was unchanged for 2026.",
        "For core inflation, staff projected an average of 2.8% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026.",
        "This implied an upward revision of 0.2 percentage points in 2024 and 0.1 percentage points in 2025, while the projection for 2026 remained unchanged.",
        "A central element in this projection was the gradual easing of nominal wage growth from initially elevated levels.",
        "The upward impact of inflation compensation pressures in a tight labour market was seen as fading in the period ahead.",
        "A recovery in productivity growth should support the moderation in labour cost pressures.",
        "Moreover, profit growth should weaken and partially buffer the pass-through of labour costs to prices.",
        "Measures of shorter-term inflation expectations had declined since the previous year, while longer-term inflation expectations had remained broadly stable, with most standing at around 2%.",
        "With some uncertainty surrounding the staff projections, it was useful to compare projections for the fourth quarter of each year.",
        "The fourth quarter was less affected by carry-over effects.",
        "Relative to the outlook in September 2023, the projected timely return of inflation to target had been reconfirmed in the December, March and June staff projections.",
        "The stability of projected inflation at the end of 2025 over the last four rounds of projections had been remarkable.",
        "In addition, the inflation outlook for 2026 had been reconfirmed over the last two rounds.",
        "Turning to economic activity, after five quarters of stagnation, euro area GDP had grown by 0.3% over the first quarter of 2024.",
        "Preliminary aggregates for national GDP figures available so far showed that economic growth in the first quarter had mainly been driven by net exports, and domestic demand had only played a fairly limited role.",
        "Incoming information suggested continued growth in the short run, driven by a pick-up in consumption growth amid rising real disposable income and improving confidence.",
        "Over the medium term the negative impact of the past monetary policy tightening was seen to fade gradually.",
        "Growth would also benefit from a resilient labour market, with the unemployment rate declining further from historically low levels.",
        "The services sector had been expanding at a solid pace, with accommodation and food services contributing to the dynamism.",
        "Manufacturing activity had also improved significantly in May, according to the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) survey, but it remained in contractionary territory.",
        "With regard to consumption, surveys signalled strong developments in contact-intensive services, while for goods – both retail and durable goods such as motor cars – surveys pointed to figures well below normal levels.",
        "There had clearly been a recovery in consumer confidence in the course of 2023 as the terms of trade improved, but confidence had been fairly flat for several months now.",
        "Consumer uncertainty had come down but was still relatively high.",
        "Housing investment had increased in the first quarter – helped by temporary factors in the largest euro area economy, such as the mild weather.",
        "Business investment was projected to grow over the year.",
        "For most of 2023 global imports had grown more strongly than euro area exports, leading to a loss in market share for the euro area.",
        "Since the start of 2024 euro area exports had been growing more quickly than global imports, but global imports were decelerating.",
        "Forward-looking PMIs remained muted for exports, but an expansion of activity in the tourism sector was expected, although not on the same scale as in the previous two years.",
        "The unemployment rate had edged down to 6.4% in April, the lowest level since the start of the euro.",
        "Employment had increased in line with economic activity in the first quarter and was expected to grow moderately in the second quarter.",
        "Some indicators suggested a marginal softening of labour market conditions.",
        "The job vacancy rate had declined by 0.1 percentage points to 2.8% in the first quarter of the year, which was still high but continued the gradual easing from its peak in the second quarter of 2022.",
        "The Indeed job postings suggested that this trend would continue in the second quarter.",
        "Developments in fiscal policies pointed to an improvement in the budget balance over the next few years.",
        "Active fiscal adjustment in 2024 was seen as easier than in the austerity years because a large part related to the reversal of fiscal subsidies, and this was considerably less painful than cutting pay or reducing employment.",
        "The fiscal multipliers were also smaller.",
        "In terms of dynamics, there was only a limited revision of fiscal plans compared with the March projections.",
        "The recovery should strengthen in the coming quarters.",
        "The latest staff projections saw economic growth at 0.9% in 2024, 1.4% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.",
        "Compared with the March projections, the outlook for GDP growth had been revised up by 0.3 percentage points for 2024, owing to the positive surprise at the start of the year and improved forward-looking information.",
        "For 2025 it had been revised down marginally by 0.1 percentage points, while it was unrevised for 2026.",
        "Risk-free market interest rates had increased for most maturities since the previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "The market had priced in higher real rates on the back of higher than anticipated inflation readings and the stronger economy.",
        "Financing costs had plateaued at restrictive levels as the past policy rate increases had worked their way through the financial system.",
        "The average interest rates on new loans to firms and new mortgages had been unchanged in April, at 5.2% and 3.8% respectively.",
        "Credit dynamics remained weak.",
        "Bank lending to firms had grown at an annual rate of 0.3% in April, down slightly on the previous month.",
        "Growth in loans to households had been unchanged at 0.2% on an annual basis.",
        "The annual growth in broad money as measured by M3 had risen to 1.3% in April, from 0.9% in March, as the euro area’s growing current account surplus and non-resident demand for euro-denominated securities gave rise to monetary inflows from outside the euro area.",
        "Overall, the updated joint assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission (the three elements of the ECB’s “reaction function”) supported increased confidence that inflation was converging to target in a timely and sustained manner.",
        "In particular, inflation was projected by staff to fall from 5.4% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2024, on average, and to decline towards target over the second half of 2025.",
        "Reflecting higher energy and non-energy commodity prices and the recent upside surprises in services inflation, this disinflation was somewhat slower in the updated projections.",
        "At the same time, the incoming data suggested that the economic recovery was proceeding only at a moderate pace (which, in turn, pointed to contained risks of demand-driven inflation pressures).",
        "A granular analysis of the drivers of domestic inflation, services inflation and wage growth indicated that these should see a marked deceleration in 2025 relative to 2024.",
        "The partial data already available for the first quarter of 2024 also showed that the compression of unit profits was helping to absorb wage growth, thus giving grounds for increased confidence about the assumption that profits would be playing an important buffering role.",
        "Over time, disinflation would be supported by the restrictive monetary policy stance and the fading impact of past inflation on ongoing price pressures, while the countervailing impact of the reversal of fiscal support measures would fall out of the data.",
        "Relative to the start of the holding period in September 2023, when the ECB had brought the policy rates to their current levels, the projected timely return of inflation to target had been reconfirmed in the December, March and June projection rounds.",
        "For instance, the inflation rate projected for the end of 2025 had been remarkably stable over the last four projection rounds.",
        "In particular, between the September 2023 and the June 2024 rounds, the projected HICP inflation rate for the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with a year earlier had fluctuated within a very narrow interval of 1.9-2.0%.",
        "The inflation outlook for 2026 had been confirmed over the last two projection rounds.",
        "Moreover, the overall speed of disinflation had been faster than expected.",
        "Over this period, inflation had come down by 2.6 percentage points.",
        "Whereas, at the start of the holding period, staff had seen inflation averaging 5.6% in 2023 and 3.2% in 2024, inflation had actually averaged 5.4% in 2023 and the inflation rate for 2024 had been marked down to 2.5% in the latest projection exercise.",
        "The set of underlying inflation indicators also showed considerable progress compared with the start of the holding period, with most gauges drifting lower towards 2%.",
        "This improvement in the inflation profile had reduced the risk that “too high for too long” inflation posed to the stability of inflation expectations, including through its impact on future wage settlements.",
        "Measures of shorter-term inflation expectations had declined over recent months, while measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained broadly stable, with most standing at around 2%.",
        "Meanwhile, the transmission side of the reaction function remained strong.",
        "Mortgage rates were measurably lower than their autumn peak, but indices of the affordability of mortgage loans still pointed to restrictive conditions.",
        "Rates on corporate loans had been moving sideways in nominal terms (and therefore upwards in real terms), dampening demand for external finance.",
        "Activity was recovering, although less so in the segments of demand most sensitive to interest rates, such as construction activity – abstracting from temporary factors – and non-construction business investment.",
        "Overall, the incoming data on financing conditions signalled that the monetary stance remained restrictive, and this would help maintain the disinflationary process.",
        "In particular, compared with the start of the holding period, real lending rates for firms and households had risen markedly.",
        "An interest rate decision should be robust across a wide range of scenarios.",
        "At a still clearly restrictive level of 3.75% for the deposit facility rate, even large upside shocks to inflation (including more persistent than expected services inflation or weaker than expected monetary transmission) could be addressed by a slower pace of rate cuts than in the baseline rate path embedded in the projections.",
        "At the same time, a policy rate level of 3.75% offered greater protection against downside shocks than if it remained at 4.0%.",
        "Based on this assessment, it was now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady.",
        "Accordingly, Mr Lane proposed that the three key ECB interest rates be lowered by 25 basis points.",
        "At the same time, Mr Lane underlined that the high level of uncertainty and the still elevated price pressures evident in the domestic inflation, services inflation and wage growth indicators meant that a restrictive monetary stance would still need to be maintained, following a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction.",
        "Over time, the incoming data would provide information about the balance between one-off elements and the persistent component in inflation, while the evolution of cost dynamics (including the interplay between compensation and productivity) and domestic pricing power would depend on the strength and composition of the cyclical recovery.",
        "In charting the future course of policy, the Governing Council should also maintain its three-part evaluation framework based on the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the state of monetary policy transmission.",
        "The Governing Council should also confirm its previously communicated intention to reduce the PEPP portfolio by €7.5 billion per month, on average, over the second half of the year, and reiterate its intention to discontinue reinvestments under the PEPP at the end of 2024.",
        "The operational modalities for partial reinvestments of PEPP redemptions should closely follow the precedent of the APP partial reinvestment phase, which would help ensure that the process remained transparent and as neutral as possible to the pricing in financial markets.",
        "Furthermore, Mr Lane proposed that flexibility continue to be allowed in the remaining PEPP reinvestments as an effective first line of defence against fragmentation risks, but to be exercised only if market conditions deteriorated.",
        "Finally, in line with the monetary policy strategy, staff had assessed the links between monetary policy and financial stability.",
        "The analysis suggested that euro area banks remained resilient.",
        "The improving economic outlook had fostered financial stability, but heightened geopolitical risks clouded the horizon.",
        "An unexpected tightening of global financing conditions could prompt a repricing of financial and non-financial assets, with negative effects on the wider economy.",
        "Macroprudential policy remained the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities.",
        "The measures that were currently in place or would soon take effect were helping to keep the financial system resilient.",
        "As regards the external environment, the latest data, both soft and hard, pointed to sustained momentum in global activity and a strengthening of global trade in the first half of 2024.",
        "Members pointed to uncertainty related to political and economic developments in the world’s two largest economies and their potential spillovers to the euro area.",
        "A question was raised regarding growth policies adopted in China and their impact on activity and inflation in the euro area.",
        "Strong expansion of manufacturing capacity would boost Chinese exports and likely imply a loss of export market share and lower economic growth for the euro area, associated with stronger disinflationary forces.",
        "At the same time, if a large part of European production capacity were to be driven out of the market, it would mean costly write-offs of investment with possibly inflationary consequences.",
        "Concern was expressed that the global trading system could see increased fragmentation into separate economic blocs if authorities engaged in reciprocal tariff-raising.",
        "While deglobalisation was, as yet, not clearly visible in the data, it was considered an important risk for the future.",
        "However, quantifying this risk was difficult and possible outcomes could lie anywhere between limited sector-specific consequences and a wider breakdown of trade links.",
        "The view was put forward that deglobalisation, greater protectionism and the rising costs of climate change were global trends affecting the supply side of the economy and giving rise to longer-term inflation pressures.",
        "With regard to the euro area economy, members widely noted that the June 2024 Eurosystem staff projections entailed upward revisions to both economic growth and inflation.",
        "Inflation was likely to stay above target well into next year.",
        "Headline and core inflation had both been revised up for 2024 and 2025 compared with the March projections.",
        "On economic activity, the latest data lent support to the recovery that had been anticipated in previous projection rounds.",
        "After five quarters of stagnation, the euro area economy had grown by 0.3% over the first quarter of 2024.",
        "The upward surprise in first quarter growth was seen as allaying fears of a materialisation of the downside risks that had been identified in previous discussions.",
        "Concerns that monetary policy would unduly hold back growth were also diminishing.",
        "However, it was argued that the better than expected outcome had relied on a pick-up in construction and net exports, in part reflecting temporary factors.",
        "Nonetheless, the surprise had prompted staff to revise up their growth expectations significantly for 2024 as a whole, following a succession of projection rounds with downward revisions.",
        "In this context, some doubts were raised about whether the recovery would take place as expected, since this depended on a pick-up in private consumption for which there was no convincing evidence as yet in the data.",
        "It was also noted that the staff projections entailed an upward revision to the saving ratio.",
        "In addition, the concern was raised that, in the presence of both domestic political and geopolitical uncertainties, the saving ratio could go even higher than expected.",
        "If this were to happen, consumption could be curtailed for longer.",
        "However, as the upward revision to household savings came at the same time as a more favourable growth outlook – and the revision kept the ratio well above pre-pandemic levels – a higher propensity to consume could also be envisaged, with the associated upside risk to consumption growth in the baseline.",
        "Like consumption, investment had also remained weak in the first quarter.",
        "It was argued that it likely reflected a fair amount of replacement investment, which could not be expected to provide a strong impulse for the recovery.",
        "Business investment was being held back by weak final demand and high borrowing costs.",
        "At the same time it was suggested that, from a sectoral perspective, the expected recovery in activity was well on track.",
        "The weakness in manufacturing appeared to have bottomed out and the latest survey data supported the notion of a services-led recovery.",
        "While the impact of restrictive monetary policy was seen to be gradually fading, the services sector had anyway been affected less strongly.",
        "This sector was less capital-intensive and thus less interest rate-sensitive, while still responding to the indirect influence of monetary policy through a general dampening of aggregate demand.",
        "Tourism was seen as an important component in the growth of services and was driven to a large extent by domestic real incomes in the euro area and, to a lesser extent, by foreign demand.",
        "Turning to the labour market, members considered that, overall, it had remained persistently robust.",
        "This was a key element in the soft landing of the economy.",
        "It was seen as puzzling that the market indicators of labour hoarding were still relatively unchanged and that there was not more labour shedding and unemployment – at least in industry and construction.",
        "Shortages of labour persisted, especially in the services sector.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that, coming from historically high employment and low unemployment, the market could realistically only be expected to slacken.",
        "Moreover, net employment gains concealed much larger numbers for turnover and new contracts, suggesting that firms were using this churning to foster productivity gains and thus help absorb a rising wage bill.",
        "With respect to fiscal and structural policies, members reiterated that national policies should aim at making the economy more productive and competitive.",
        "This would help raise potential growth and reduce price pressures in the medium term.",
        "An effective, speedy and full implementation of the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme, progress towards capital markets union and the completion of banking union, and a strengthening of the Single Market would help foster innovation and increase investment in the green and digital transitions.",
        "Implementing the EU’s revised economic governance framework fully and without delay would help governments bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis.",
        "It was stressed that a speedy and full implementation of NGEU programmes for innovation and green transitioning would also help reduce price pressures in the medium term.",
        "Some concern was expressed that, in a period of political uncertainty and multiple elections, fiscal policy might show less consolidation by the end of this year than was factored into the current projections.",
        "Against this background, members assessed that the risks to economic growth were balanced in the near term but remained tilted to the downside over the medium term.",
        "A weaker world economy or an escalation in trade tensions between major economies would weigh on euro area growth.",
        "Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East were major sources of geopolitical risk.",
        "Adverse geopolitical developments could result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted.",
        "Growth could also be lower if the effects of monetary policy turned out stronger than expected.",
        "Growth could be higher if inflation came down more quickly than expected and rising confidence and real incomes meant that spending increased by more than anticipated, or if the world economy grew more strongly than expected.",
        "It was suggested that risks to growth could also emerge from wage increases if these decoupled from the pace that firms could realistically absorb in productivity increases, implying a loss of competitiveness and market share, and ultimately a fall in investment and activity.",
        "Seen from a different angle, a weaker than expected economic recovery would curtail the expected productivity increases and lead to lower profit margins.",
        "This would reduce the economy’s capacity to absorb the increases in real wages already embedded in wage contracts and the projection baseline.",
        "With regard to price developments, members concurred with the assessment by Mr Lane that the latest data were a reflection of the bumpy profile of headline inflation expected in 2024.",
        "On the one hand, the fact that the latest figures for headline and, in particular, services inflation had been higher than in the March 2024 projections was seen to increase the uncertainty surrounding the further disinflation path.",
        "On the other hand, it was argued that the upward surprise in the latest data had been incorporated by staff into the June projections without subsequent offsetting, which was a prudent approach.",
        "It was underlined that the upward revision of inflation in 2024 and 2025 had pushed the return to target to the end of 2025.",
        "While the projection for 2026 was unchanged, it was pointed out that this rested on the assumption that energy and food inflation would move below their longer-term averages.",
        "In view of the notoriously volatile nature of these two components and their exposure to the effects of geopolitics as well as climate change and transition policies, these benign assumptions were seen to be highly uncertain.",
        "In the shorter term, the projected inflation path was bumpy for the remainder of 2024, which was mainly due to base effects and was thus anticipated.",
        "When the inflation path was corrected for base effects, both the recent actual outcomes and the projected trend over the short-term horizon were seen to point clearly downwards.",
        "It was widely underlined that, despite the upward inflation surprises in April and May, the bigger picture remained one of ongoing disinflation.",
        "Members noted that the May inflation numbers had been released after the cut-off date for the projections.",
        "Services inflation, at 4.1% in May, had surprised on the upside, had shown persistence, and was demonstrating strong momentum.",
        "However, a lot of persistence was already embedded in the projections and it was therefore argued that recent outcomes should not be viewed unambiguously as an upside risk to the current baseline inflation path.",
        "The strength of services inflation in the past few months stemmed, to a large extent, from the resetting of infrequently changed prices in areas such as insurance and healthcare.",
        "The wage-sensitive part of services inflation had continued to moderate.",
        "It was noted that, for core inflation, the persistence of services inflation had so far been broadly offset by the strong disinflation in the goods sector.",
        "This could not be expected to continue, in view of the fading impact of the reversal of past supply side shocks.",
        "Moreover, new headwinds could emerge for goods inflation in a world that was more prone to frequent supply chain disruptions, geopolitical fragmentation, protectionism and climate change dynamics.",
        "Hence, in the future low goods inflation would not always reliably compensate for an overshooting in services inflation.",
        "Turning to domestic price pressures, wages were still rising strongly, making up for the past inflation surge, and were now the main determinant of inflation persistence.",
        "Owing to the staggered nature of the wage-adjustment process and the important role of one-off payments, the process of wages catching up with prices would likely feed into inflation for a considerable time, as seen in the pick-up in the growth of negotiated wages in the first quarter.",
        "All labour cost indicators, including Eurostat’s new labour cost index, were at very high levels, and the anticipated moderation still had to materialise.",
        "At the same time, forward-looking indicators signalled that wage growth would moderate over the course of the year.",
        "Profits were absorbing part of the pronounced rise in unit labour costs, which reduced its inflationary effects.",
        "It was reiterated that wages were a key element in the assessment of the inflation outlook.",
        "This was related in particular to their prominent role in the setting of services prices, but a range of indicators needed to be considered to form a holistic assessment.",
        "Growth in negotiated wages had increased to 4.7% in the first quarter of 2024.",
        "Moreover, data already available for a number of euro area countries suggested that growth in compensation per employee for the euro area as a whole was likely to remain in the first quarter at the elevated levels recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023.",
        "The point was made that most of the latest wage information had already been incorporated in the baseline of the June staff projections and thus did not indicate upside risk.",
        "The same data, however, had already contributed to upward revisions of wage growth compared with the March projections, which was a warning not to underestimate the strength of wage dynamics and the scope for further surprises in the course of 2024.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that, taking into account available country-based estimates, the euro area GDP deflator, unit labour costs and unit profits had probably increased more slowly in the first quarter of 2024 than had been embedded in the June projections.",
        "High current wage growth was considered to reflect to a large extent workers seeking compensation for past purchasing power losses.",
        "Wage dynamics were therefore likely to slow once this process was complete and inflation was normalising.",
        "It was cautioned that the catching up could nonetheless imply a drawn-out process and bumpy wage path, depending on when contracts came up for renewal in the staggered wage-setting process and for which period of inflation they were compensating.",
        "Attention was drawn to one-off payments, which played an important role, particularly in light of fiscal incentives that were set to expire.",
        "However, there were indications from unions that such one-off payments might not be transitory but in future be factored into regular pay rises.",
        "More generally, a view was expressed that the catching up could lead real wages to exceed their pre-war or pre-pandemic levels or trends in an environment of protracted labour scarcity and possible shifts in bargaining power between capital and labour.",
        "In addition, it was remarked that the scope for buffering higher wages via a compression of profit margins was more limited in the services sector, which was also less exposed to international competition and was experiencing robust demand.",
        "However, there were also risks going in the opposite direction for the wage growth profile.",
        "It was argued that some of the recent high wage settlements had taken place in sectors which had made substantial profits over the past three years.",
        "This allowed employers to grant generous wage increases and to absorb them without passing them on to final prices.",
        "Incoming data on the critical relationship between wages, productivity and profits was seen, overall, as supporting prudent inflation projections and an ongoing disinflation process.",
        "However, it was also cautioned that uncertainty surrounding the outlook was very high and that, in the transition to lower inflation after a period of large shocks and possible structural changes, such relationships might start evolving differently from historical patterns.",
        "Hence, continued prudence was warranted with respect to relying on standard projection models, and more actual data was needed to provide sufficient confidence that disinflation would continue and not stall on the last mile.",
        "At the same time, diminishing projection errors were seen to give grounds for renewing confidence in the projections.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, measures had, overall, remained broadly stable, with most standing at around 2%.",
        "Somewhat higher rates for market-based measures essentially reflected higher inflation risk premia, while “genuine” inflation expectations remained anchored at the inflation target.",
        "While the anchoring of expectations across indicators could be taken as a sign of the credibility of monetary policy, the literature on “experience effects” warned that extended periods of high inflation could have a lasting impact on the formation of inflation expectations, making them more fragile and anchoring more difficult in the future.",
        "In this context, however, comfort was drawn from the gradual lowering of consumer inflation expectations, even if levels in household surveys typically remained above the ECB’s inflation target.",
        "This was seen as signalling trust in the disinflation process and would have a self-fulfilling element if it contributed to a moderation in wage claims and firms’ pricing power.",
        "Members assessed that inflation could turn out higher than anticipated if wages or profits increased by more than expected.",
        "Upside risks to inflation also stemmed from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade.",
        "Moreover, extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices.",
        "By contrast, inflation could surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampened demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsened unexpectedly.",
        "It was suggested that there could be further risk factors for inflation, related for instance to the extent of the expected pick-up in productivity growth or the evolution of the fiscal stance underpinning the inflation outlook.",
        "However, these elements could develop in either direction and were therefore not decisive elements in the balance of risks.",
        "Against this background, members expressed different views regarding directional changes in the balance of risks.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that, all other things being equal, the staff’s upward revisions to the baseline implied a reduction in remaining upside risks and made the risks more balanced.",
        "On the other hand, it was maintained that the downside risk related to a stronger transmission of monetary policy was gradually receding, while continued upside risks such as from higher labour costs shifted the balance to the upside.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, market interest rates had risen since the Governing Council’s previous meeting and real interest rates had also recently increased.",
        "Market participants were fully pricing in a 25 basis point cut in the key ECB interest rates at the June meeting, with between one and two further cuts priced in by the end of the year.",
        "A shallower easing cycle was now expected on both sides of the Atlantic amid similarities in recent inflation trends globally.",
        "Financial markets were supported by strong risk appetite, which contrasted with the limited risk appetite among euro area consumers and firms.",
        "This suggested either that financial market sentiment would weaken at some point or that the real economy would catch up.",
        "Market sentiment was also buoyant despite heightened geopolitical risks and uncertainties.",
        "The risk of mispricing in financial markets was therefore being monitored, also from a financial stability perspective.",
        "Financing costs had plateaued at restrictive levels as the past policy rate increases had worked their way through the financial system.",
        "The average interest rates on new loans to firms and on new mortgages had been unchanged in April.",
        "But lending rates had increased in real terms since the time of the last rate hike in September 2023. Credit dynamics remained weak.",
        "Credit flows to firms had been broadly stable at low levels in both March and April, taking bank lending and debt securities together.",
        "Firms’ demand for loans for investment remained very weak, owing to both low aggregate demand and continuing high borrowing costs.",
        "Growth in loans for house purchase remained stagnant, while consumer credit growth was more resilient, yet still weak.",
        "The annual growth in broad money – as measured by M3 – continued its gradual recovery while remaining relatively subdued.",
        "Looking ahead, loan growth was likely to gradually pick up.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that banks had not reduced their liquid asset holdings as targeted longer-term refinancing operations had matured and appeared to have a strong preference for liquidity.",
        "The lower supply of central bank liquidity in the system could therefore reduce the appetite of banks to lend.",
        "In this respect, the view was also expressed that as long as banks benefited from ample excess reserves remunerated at the deposit facility rate, they had a limited incentive to expand risky lending to the real economy.",
        "In their biannual structured exchange on the links between monetary policy and financial stability, members concurred that euro area banks had remained resilient and continued to have robust capital and liquidity positions.",
        "The improving economic outlook had fostered financial stability, as also highlighted in the recently published Financial Stability Review.",
        "At the same time, geopolitical factors could increase risks in the period ahead.",
        "An unexpected tightening of global financing conditions could prompt a repricing of financial and non-financial assets, with negative effects on the wider economy.",
        "Macroprudential policy remained the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities, and the measures currently in place or soon to take effect were helping to keep the financial system resilient.",
        "Turning to the monetary policy stance, members assessed the data that had become available since the last monetary policy meeting in accordance with the three main elements that the Governing Council had communicated in 2023 as shaping its reaction function.",
        "These comprised the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Starting with the inflation outlook, members broadly concurred with the assessment that had been presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The June staff projections for headline inflation had been revised up for 2024 and 2025 compared with the March projections.",
        "Inflation was expected to fluctuate around current levels for the rest of the year, including due to energy-related base effects.",
        "But it was still expected to decline towards the ECB’s 2% target over the second half of next year, owing to weaker growth in labour costs, the unfolding effects of the ECB’s restrictive monetary policy, and the fading impact of the energy crisis and the pandemic.",
        "Subsequently, inflation was expected to remain close to the target in a sustainable manner.",
        "Measures of longer-term inflation expectations had also remained broadly stable, with most anchored at around the 2% target, even though market-based expectations had moved up in the most recent period.",
        "The inflation expectations of consumers and firms had continued to decline gradually as well.",
        "Together, these developments in inflation expectations gave an indication of public trust and confidence in the disinflation process and the return of inflation to the 2% target.",
        "Members generally expressed confidence in the inflation outlook confirming an ongoing disinflation process, as also reflected in the staff projections, although recent data suggested inflation could be stickier than had previously been expected and the exact speed at which it would return to target was uncertain.",
        "At the same time and from a longer-term perspective, it was highlighted that different vintages of projections made over the past year for inflation in 2025 had fluctuated in a narrow range of between 2% and 2.2%.",
        "This renewed stability could give rise to greater confidence in the reliability and robustness of the projections, and showed inflation remaining on track to meet the target in the medium term, notwithstanding the upward revisions in the inflation projections for 2024 and 2025.",
        "Smaller projection errors for headline inflation also supported confidence in this inflation outlook.",
        "Members also broadly concurred that further progress had been made in terms of the dynamics of underlying inflation.",
        "Most measures of underlying inflation had declined further in April, the last month for which data were available, confirming the picture of gradually diminishing price pressures.",
        "At the same time, domestic price pressures remained strong, as wage growth was elevated.",
        "The staff projections for core inflation had also been revised up for 2024 and 2025 compared with the March projections, and momentum in both services and core inflation remained fairly strong.",
        "It would therefore still take time for more clarity to be obtained on the dynamics of important inflation drivers.",
        "Moreover, further evidence was required on both the extent to which unit profits would absorb the inflationary pressures from higher wages and whether productivity growth would rebound as expected.",
        "Finally, members generally agreed that monetary policy transmission remained strong.",
        "Real interest rates stood close to their peak in this cycle.",
        "Monetary policy clearly remained in restrictive territory and would continue to do so for some time even if interest rates were cut further.",
        "This remained true even allowing for an upward shift in the natural rate of interest.",
        "The view was expressed that ongoing quantitative tightening also needed to be taken into account in the assessment of the policy stance.",
        "The restrictiveness of policy was reflected in weak credit dynamics and subdued aggregate demand.",
        "This had helped to lower inflation but also weighed on growth.",
        "Transmission would probably continue to unfold for some time, given that monetary policy affected the economy with long and variable lags.",
        "While the peak impact of restrictive monetary policy on financing conditions and GDP had probably already occurred, lags between the effect on output and the effect on prices could imply that the peak impact on inflation was still to come.",
        "Within that process, the transmission to services inflation could be weaker and slower than the transmission to goods inflation.",
        "Overall, most members expressed continued or increased confidence that inflation was on track to decline sustainably to the 2% inflation target in a timely manner and by the end of 2025 at the latest.",
        "Some of the most recent data had been slightly less favourable than anticipated or hoped for in March and April.",
        "But it had been expected that the disinflationary path would be bumpy and noisy, with surprises likely in either direction.",
        "It was important to recognise that a smooth, linear disinflation process in 2024 was not a prerequisite for confidence in a timely return of inflation to the target.",
        "In addition, different indicators were providing contrasting signals on the future disinflation path.",
        "More generally, it was important to step back and focus on the bigger picture.",
        "An excessive focus on individual observations and the details of developments between meetings ran the risk of not being able to see the wood for the trees.",
        "Being data-dependent meant not only looking at the most recent data but also assessing and being driven by all three reaction function elements, which included considering the wider inflation outlook.",
        "Recent developments and noise should not detract from the longer-term perspective indicating consistent disinflation and a timely and sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.",
        "Despite recent volatility, the overall disinflation process had been proceeding well, with substantial progress made since the Governing Council last raised interest rates in September 2023.",
        "This was evident in the significant and greater than expected decline in both headline and core inflation since 2022 and since the time of the last rate hike.",
        "Headline inflation had halved since the time of the last hike, from 5.2% to 2.6%.",
        "The inflation outlook, especially for 2024, had also improved in the latest staff projections compared with the September and December 2023 rounds, even if the pace of disinflation was somewhat slower than had been anticipated in March and inflation projections for 2025 were slightly higher than they had been in September 2023.",
        "Market participants had remained confident in the medium-term disinflation process, even if volatility in nearer-term rate expectations reflected uncertainty over the pace of disinflation.",
        "It was important, therefore, not to overreact to adverse data or inflation numbers for a single month, since these did not necessarily imply a new trend and could reflect one-off factors, in the same way that it had been important not to overreact to positive numbers in previous months.",
        "On balance, in the discussion of the inflation outlook and of the assessment of risks increased confidence was expressed that inflation would decline towards the 2% target over the second half of 2025 and subsequently remain sustainably at around that level.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that decisions about the future always had to be taken in the face of uncertainty.",
        "So a key question was to assess when there was enough confirmation and confidence that inflation would return to target in a timely manner.",
        "At some point, it was necessary to make a judgement call based on the information available, even if that information was less conclusive than might be preferred.",
        "Such an approach should not be seen as conflicting with data-dependence, as waiting for full confirmation would almost certainly imply cutting interest rates too late, potentially creating a significant risk of undershooting the target.",
        "It was also highlighted that the degree of restrictiveness needed to reduce inflation from 2.6% to 2% was likely to be lower than that in place since September 2023.",
        "Moreover, even following a 25 basis point cut, interest rates would remain in restrictive territory in relation to any current estimate of the natural or neutral rate of interest.",
        "This meant that stronger demand should not endanger the return of inflation to target and that upside shocks to inflation could be addressed by opting for a slower pace of rate reductions compared with the baseline rate path embedded in the projections.",
        "So there appeared to be little risk of needing to reverse policy unless large external shocks occurred, in which case such a policy reversal could be convincingly justified.",
        "Moreover, cutting interest rates by 25 basis points offered greater protection against downside shocks than keeping them at their current levels.",
        "Cutting interest rates now was thus robust across a wide range of scenarios and still maintained a cautious approach.",
        "Some members felt that the data available since the last meeting had not increased their confidence that inflation would converge to the 2% target by 2025 but instead pointed to greater uncertainty in the outlook.",
        "For these members, even if the general disinflation trend remained intact in the bigger picture, the relevant point of comparison was with the data at the time of the last monetary policy meeting, or at most with the previous staff projections.",
        "At the time of the April meeting, interest rates had been kept on hold because there had not been sufficient confidence that inflation would return sustainably to the 2% target in a timely manner.",
        "Since then, however, wage growth had surprised to the upside and inflation seemed to be stickier, mainly on account of services inflation.",
        "Services inflation momentum was very high, and the pace of domestic disinflation had been overestimated in the recent period.",
        "Wage growth had also strengthened, and it was suggested that further significant wage pressures were in the pipeline.",
        "This pointed to greater stickiness ahead, which could increase price pressures for some time, even if wages themselves were a lagging indicator.",
        "In addition, the June staff projections for both headline and core inflation in 2024 and 2025 had been revised up compared with the March projections, with the latest projections for core inflation in 2024 barely changed from last September.",
        "Moreover, the projected return of headline inflation to the 2% target had been pushed out to the final quarter of 2025, after an already lengthy period of high inflation.",
        "Therefore, any further delay in bringing inflation back to target could make it more difficult to continue to anchor inflation expectations in the future.",
        "All of this suggested that the last mile, as the final phase of disinflation, was the most difficult.",
        "These members also viewed risks to the inflation outlook as being tilted to the upside, partly because downside risks to inflation had diminished since the last meeting owing to the ongoing economic recovery but also owing to heightened geopolitical risks.",
        "It was argued that a small undershooting of inflation would be much less costly than a continued overshooting, especially as the anchoring of inflation expectations should not be taken as given.",
        "Together, these considerations suggested that cutting interest rates was not fully in line with the principle of data-dependence, and that there was a case for keeping interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Nevertheless, a willingness to support Mr Lane’s proposal was expressed, notwithstanding the reservations put forward.",
        "Against this background, almost all members agreed with the proposal by Mr Lane to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points.",
        "Based on the updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it was seen as appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady.",
        "Since the meeting in September 2023 inflation had fallen by more than 2.5 percentage points and the inflation outlook had improved markedly.",
        "The inflation projection for the fourth quarter of 2025 had fluctuated in a very narrow range of between 1.9% and 2% over that period, increasing confidence in the reliability, solidity and robustness of the projection showing that inflation would return to the 2% target in a timely manner.",
        "Underlying inflation had also eased, reinforcing the signs that price pressures had weakened, and over this period inflation expectations had broadly declined at all horizons.",
        "Monetary policy had kept financing conditions restrictive.",
        "By dampening demand and keeping inflation expectations well anchored, this had made a major contribution to bringing inflation back down.",
        "A dissenting view was upheld, maintaining that the incoming data since the last meeting and upside risks to inflation did not support the case for a rate cut.",
        "In particular, current inflationary pressures evident in the recent data showed stickiness in inflation.",
        "This stickiness could be exacerbated by several different geopolitical risks.",
        "In addition, a decoupling from the path of US interest rates would risk adding to inflationary pressures via exchange rate effects.",
        "With regard to future meetings, members emphasised that they remained determined to ensure that inflation returned sustainably to the 2% medium-term target in a timely manner and affirmed that they would keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim.",
        "In view of continuing uncertainty surrounding the disinflationary process and the bumpy path ahead, it was seen as important to maintain a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and there should be no pre-commitment to a particular rate path, so that full optionality could be retained.",
        "Members also reiterated that monetary policy should continue to be based on the established elements of the reaction function.",
        "Turning to communication, members agreed that it was important to convey the increased confidence in the disinflationary process that had justified the policy decision, while highlighting the need for continued caution and patience regarding the future disinflation path and continued determination to bring inflation back to target in a timely manner.",
        "Members agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to confirm the reduction of the Eurosystem’s holdings of securities under the PEPP by €7.5 billion per month on average over the second half of the year, with the modalities for reducing the PEPP holdings to be broadly in line with those followed under the APP.",
        "They also agreed to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the PEPP portfolio.",
        "In this context, it was noted that the earlier announcement of the intended PEPP run-off had been absorbed very smoothly by the markets.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel noted that, since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 24-25 January 2024, monetary policy expectations had retracted further from the early and large interest rate cuts initially foreseen at the turn of the year.",
        "More favourable news on the global economy and less favourable news on inflation had both been key factors in shaping financial market developments.",
        "In the case of the first factor, macroeconomic data surprises had moved into positive territory in the euro area, the United States and China for the first time since May 2023.",
        "As a result, investors attached a discernibly lower probability to the scenario of a hard landing for the global economy.",
        "The second factor related to a reassessment of the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Higher than expected inflation releases in the euro area and the United States, especially for core inflation, had dented investors’ hopes of rapid and smooth disinflation.",
        "Looking at the path of headline and core inflation in the euro area (as measured, respectively, by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices – HICP – and the overall index excluding energy and food) over 2024, inflation-linked bond markets were pricing in somewhat higher headline inflation rates throughout the year, compared with expectations at the time of the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting in January.",
        "In response to investors’ expectations of lower downside tail risks to economic activity and a slightly bumpier path of disinflation, rate markets had priced in a substantially shallower easing cycle in the euro area, with expected cumulative interest rate cuts by the end of 2024 having declined notably from around 160 basis points in late December to around 90 basis points at present.",
        "After the latest repricing, the gap between expectations in interest rate markets and those reported by market analysts had largely disappeared.",
        "In the United States, strong labour market data, higher than expected inflation figures and more cautious communication by the Federal Reserve System had triggered an even greater repricing of policy rate expectations.",
        "As a result, overnight index swap (OIS) forward curves were also pricing in a substantially shallower easing cycle in the United States.",
        "A key explanatory factor for expectations of a synchronised monetary policy easing cycle across advanced economies was the common component in global inflation.",
        "Markets anticipated that the disinflationary momentum would continue unfolding synchronously over the coming year.",
        "Spillovers from the United States were another factor explaining the close co-movement of monetary policy expectations across jurisdictions.",
        "US data releases continued to exert a significant influence on yields in other advanced economies.",
        "A decomposition of euro area and US OIS rates across different maturities into inflation compensation and real rates showed that, in the euro area, inflation compensation had increased notably across the curve.",
        "At the same time, real rates had declined, in particular at the longer end, implying a mild loosening of financing conditions through risk-free rates.",
        "In the United States, the rise in inflation compensation was slightly less pronounced, with real rates remaining firm across the curve.",
        "The widening yield differential had been mirrored by a slight depreciation in the euro’s exchange rate against the US dollar.",
        "In nominal effective terms, the euro had remained broadly unchanged, while the US dollar had appreciated.",
        "Despite the repricing of the near-term inflation outlook, risks to the longer-term inflation outlook had not materially changed since January 2024, as the five-year forward inflation-linked swap (ILS) rate five years ahead had remained broadly unchanged.",
        "Compared with the close-to-peak levels at the September 2023 Governing Council meeting, ILS forward rates had come down materially, driven mostly by a decline in inflation risk premia.",
        "The sharp past tightening seemed to have been effective in containing and eventually lowering risks to the longer-term inflation outlook.",
        "Nevertheless, the five-year forward ILS rate five years ahead still stood markedly above its historical mean.",
        "Consistent with ILS rates, euro area option prices also indicated that risks of high inflation had come down but remained somewhat elevated compared with historical averages.",
        "Risk asset markets appeared to have looked through the tightening impulse stemming from expectations of a later and shallower easing cycle, supported by improved risk sentiment.",
        "The benchmark stock market indices across all major advanced and emerging economies, including China, had followed a bullish trend since the Governing Council’s January meeting.",
        "The buoyant risk sentiment had also been visible in corporate bond markets.",
        "The same was true for sovereign bond markets, where spreads over German Bunds had continued to narrow, with the differential between Italian and German ten-year government bond yields at its smallest since March 2022.",
        "Investors appeared to remain keen on locking in attractive returns amid expectations that the peak of the tightening cycle had been reached.",
        "Bid-to-cover ratios continued their gradual upward trend, pointing to strong demand for bonds despite record high sovereign issuance for the year to date.",
        "Despite the benign price developments across risk asset markets, some pockets of risk were emerging, for example related to the commercial real estate market, but these had not had broader repercussions for financial intermediaries and markets.",
        "Moreover, the continued rally in riskier market segments – despite the repricing of monetary policy expectations – and stretched valuations of some assets could point to complacency in financial markets.",
        "Starting with the global outlook, Mr Lane noted that global economic activity was still subdued but there were some signs of improvement.",
        "Trade momentum in goods and services was expected to strengthen in the first quarter of the year.",
        "The March ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresaw a significant pick-up in euro area foreign demand, in line with previous exercises.",
        "Euro area foreign demand was projected to grow by 2.4% in 2024, 3.1% in 2025 and 3.2% in 2026, reflecting expectations of a normalisation in demand for goods, which would benefit European producers.",
        "As for commodities, since the last meeting oil prices had increased, while gas prices had declined further.",
        "International metal prices had also declined, although food prices had edged up.",
        "Turning to the euro area, Mr Lane recalled that, according to the recent Eurostat flash release, euro area headline inflation had declined to 2.6% in February from 2.8% in January.",
        "While energy inflation had become less negative, partly owing to the withdrawal of some fiscal support, food inflation had fallen strongly to 4.0% in February from 5.6% in January.",
        "This reflected an easing in both processed and unprocessed food inflation.",
        "Core inflation had decreased to 3.1% in February from 3.3% in January.",
        "Over the same period, the rate of non-energy industrial goods inflation had decelerated to 1.6% from 2.0%.",
        "Services inflation had edged down by 0.1 percentage points to 3.9%.",
        "Inflation in wage-sensitive services remained higher than in non-wage-sensitive services, supporting the view that high wage growth was playing an important role in elevated services inflation.",
        "Most measures of underlying inflation had declined further in January, as the impact of past adverse supply shocks continued to fade, lower energy prices reduced cost pressures and tighter monetary policy weighed on demand.",
        "At the lower end of the range, the indicator of the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation had been close to 2% since November.",
        "However, the annual growth rate of the indicator of domestic inflation was unchanged at 4.5%.",
        "Domestic price pressures as measured by growth in the GDP deflator were still high, although the deflator was projected to continue to decrease gradually.",
        "Profit growth offered a first buffer against high labour cost pressures and would recover thereafter.",
        "According to the March ECB staff projections, growth in compensation per employee was estimated to have slowed to 4.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023, from 5.3% in the third quarter.",
        "Based on already available country data, the forthcoming release of euro area data on 8 March for the growth in compensation per employee in the fourth quarter of 2023 was expected to turn out slightly lower than projected.",
        "Negotiated wage growth including one-off payments had declined in the fourth quarter by 0.2 percentage points to 4.5%.",
        "The latest signals from the ECB forward-looking wage trackers also indicated a gradual slowing of negotiated wage growth in the euro area.",
        "Additionally, the contribution from wage drift – the most cyclically sensitive element of compensation – had declined visibly, having been around 2 percentage points at the start of 2022.",
        "Both the Indeed tracker and feedback from firms participating in the ECB’s Corporate Telephone Survey pointed to lower wage growth this year compared with 2023.",
        "Moreover, profits seemed to be absorbing part of the rising labour costs, which would reduce their inflationary effects.",
        "Inflation was expected to continue its downward path in the coming months.",
        "In the near term, there would likely be some volatility in headline inflation owing to base effects in the energy component and to the timing of Easter.",
        "Thereafter, headline inflation was expected to decline to the ECB’s target as labour cost dynamics moderated and past energy shocks, supply bottlenecks and pandemic reopening effects dissipated.",
        "Headline inflation was projected to average 2.3% in 2024, 2.0% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026.",
        "Relative to the December projections, headline inflation had been revised down by 0.4 percentage points for 2024 and 0.1 percentage points for 2025, while remaining unchanged for 2026.",
        "Core inflation projections had been revised down across the projection horizon to 2.6% for this year, 2.1% for 2025 and 2.0% for 2026.",
        "This implied downward revisions to core inflation of 0.1 percentage points for this year, 0.2 percentage points for next year and 0.1 percentage points for 2026.",
        "Upside risks to inflation included the heightened geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade.",
        "Inflation could also turn out higher than anticipated if wages increased by more than expected or profit margins proved more resilient.",
        "By contrast, inflation could surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampened demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsened unexpectedly.",
        "Economic activity in the euro area had remained weak in the first two months of 2024.",
        "Consumers continued to hold back on spending, housing investment had remained subdued and companies had exported less, reflecting a slowdown in external demand and some losses in competitiveness.",
        "Business investment had also remained weak, reflecting the impact of restrictive monetary policy, the depletion of order backlogs and subdued demand.",
        "Forward-looking indicators such as Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) were improving but remained at low levels overall.",
        "While surveys pointed to a gradual recovery in economic activity over the course of the year, the recovery was expected to proceed at a slower pace than previously anticipated.",
        "This reflected the carry-over from the recent weaker data outturns for 2023 and the still-subdued level of survey indicators.",
        "As inflation fell and wages kept growing, real incomes would rebound, supporting growth.",
        "Further ahead, both housing and business investment should be supported by an easing of financing conditions.",
        "Business investment was also expected to pick up as demand strengthened.",
        "In addition, demand for euro area exports should improve as global demand rebounded and price competitiveness pressures eased.",
        "With respect to domestic demand components, the projections saw a significant pick-up in consumption in 2024.",
        "Investment was expected to contract as a result of the ongoing transmission of monetary policy tightening and was hence not expected to contribute to the recovery this year.",
        "The recovery would instead be led by consumption and exports, with goods consumption playing a key role.",
        "This was, in turn, interconnected with the projection for labour costs.",
        "Unit labour costs were seen as decelerating more quickly than compensation per employee over the projection horizon, owing to the expected pick-up in productivity.",
        "Manufacturing output, especially, had been depressed, but labour had not yet been shed, which resulted in a higher ratio of employment to output and hence lower labour productivity.",
        "The projections suggested that a recovery in output – and especially manufacturing output – would be achieved through a recovery in productivity.",
        "Taken together, these factors explained the glide path back to the inflation target.",
        "Employment had grown by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2023, again outpacing economic activity.",
        "The unemployment rate had edged down to a historical low of 6.4% in January from 6.5% in December, which itself had been revised up.",
        "Meanwhile, employers were announcing fewer job vacancies and fewer firms were reporting that their production was being limited by labour shortages.",
        "As for the labour market, the construction and manufacturing sectors remained basically in stagnation or even contraction, with the latest employment PMIs remaining well below 50.",
        "Looking at services, in the high-tech sector employment PMIs remained at levels slightly above 50, while in the low-tech sector they had recovered strongly and stood above 55.",
        "There was also a noticeable decline in the number of firms reporting that labour was limiting their production possibilities – especially in services.",
        "The new ECB staff projections indicated subdued growth in the near term, followed by a recovery thanks to rising real incomes, the fading impact of past monetary policy tightening on financing conditions and improving foreign demand.",
        "Output growth was expected to average 0.6% in 2024, 1.5% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.",
        "Relative to the December projections, growth had been revised down by 0.2 percentage points for 2024, while it was unchanged for 2025 and had been revised up by 0.1 percentage points for 2026.",
        "The fiscal outlook in the March 2024 projections was little changed from the December 2023 projections.",
        "The risks to economic activity remained tilted to the downside.",
        "Growth could be lower if the effects of monetary policy turned out stronger than expected.",
        "A weaker world economy or a further slowdown in global trade would also weigh on euro area growth.",
        "Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East were major sources of geopolitical risk.",
        "This could result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted.",
        "Growth could be higher if inflation came down more quickly than expected, if rising real incomes meant that spending increased by more than anticipated, or if the world economy grew more strongly than expected.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, market interest rates had increased since the last monetary policy meeting.",
        "The transmission of past policy rate hikes to broader financing conditions remained strong.",
        "Lending rates on business loans had broadly stabilised, while mortgage rates had declined in December and January.",
        "Nevertheless, lending rates remained elevated at 5.2% for business loans and 3.9% for mortgages.",
        "High bank lending rates, tight credit standards and lower business investment continued to dampen demand for loans with longer maturities.",
        "The annual growth rate of bank lending to firms, which had turned positive and stood at 0.5% in December, had edged lower again in January, reaching 0.2% owing to a negative flow in the month.",
        "The year-on-year growth in loans to households had continued to weaken, slowing to 0.3% in January.",
        "The annual growth rates of M3 – the broad monetary aggregate – and M1 – the narrow monetary aggregate of currency in circulation and overnight deposits – had remained weak in January, standing at 0.1% and -8.6% respectively.",
        "After standing in negative territory until November, the annual growth rate of M3 had been marginally positive in December and January.",
        "The increase in M3 was mostly explained by the strengthening of net inflows from the rest of the world, driven mainly by the strong trade surplus amid weak imports.",
        "Weak deposit creation continued to underpin a shift in bank funding composition towards more expensive funding sources.",
        "Based on the assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, at the meeting Mr Lane proposed keeping the three key ECB interest rates unchanged.",
        "The three elements of the Governing Council’s reaction function supported an unchanged policy at the meeting.",
        "Headline inflation was now projected to be markedly lower in 2024 compared with previous expectations, returning to target by mid-2025 and slightly undershooting 2% in subsequent quarters.",
        "Growth was expected to recover only gradually through most of 2024.",
        "The overall trend in underlying inflation continued to soften.",
        "At the same time, some key measures including domestic inflation remained elevated, while further confirmation was still needed concerning the projected outlook for wage inflation and unit margins.",
        "The third criterion, namely the ongoing strong transmission of monetary policy, was confirmed, albeit with some signs of stabilisation owing to the anticipation of future rate cuts.",
        "Based on those three criteria, the key ECB interest rates were at levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, would make a substantial contribution to the ECB’s goal of returning inflation to its medium-term target in a timely manner.",
        "This warranted continuing to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, while ensuring that policy rates would be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.",
        "An overall evaluation of the policy trajectory could be obtained from the joint evolution of the inflation outlook (including the new staff projections), underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission in recent months.",
        "The developments here should increase confidence that the monetary policy decisions already taken would deliver the ECB’s medium-term inflation target, especially in view of the projected narrowing of the distance to the target already in 2024.",
        "At the same time, only further along in the disinflation process could the ECB be sufficiently confident that inflation would hit the target in a timely manner and settle at target sustainably.",
        "Mr Lane also proposed preserving the option to apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.",
        "As regards the external environment, while global GDP growth remained subdued, there were early signs of improvement.",
        "A broad set of early indicators suggested that global growth had declined throughout 2023, reflecting tight monetary policy working its way through the global economy and fading tailwinds for consumption, such as from pandemic-related excess savings.",
        "Indicators had improved at the turn of the year, so global growth was expected to pick up in the first quarter of 2024 following a moderation in the last quarter of 2023.",
        "Global trade had also showed early signs of improvement at the start of 2024.",
        "The post-pandemic factors that had caused a period of weak trade in 2023, for example owing to the rotation of demand from goods to services, should ease in the period ahead.",
        "As regards key global economies, growth in the United States had been above expectations in the last quarter of 2023 and the labour market had been robust.",
        "At the same time, the Chinese economy continued to struggle with a weakening housing sector.",
        "Overall, it was underlined that the global economic outlook was still uncertain.",
        "Turning to energy commodities, oil prices were expected to decline because of the supply surplus in the global market, which was expected to persist in 2024 despite OPEC+ producers having announced production cuts.",
        "European gas prices had fallen further since the Governing Council’s last monetary policy meeting, as demand remained subdued and gas storage levels were relatively high.",
        "Nevertheless, it was highlighted that gas prices were volatile.",
        "With respect to the international determinants of consumer price inflation, price pressures were limited – despite the tensions in the Red Sea area – as demand for goods was still weak and inventory levels remained high.",
        "With regard to economic activity in the euro area, members concurred with Mr Lane that the economy remained weak.",
        "Consumers continued to hold back on their spending, investment had moderated and companies were exporting less, reflecting a slowdown in external demand and some losses in competitiveness.",
        "However, surveys pointed to a gradual recovery over the course of the year.",
        "As inflation was falling and wages continued to grow, real incomes would rebound, supporting growth.",
        "In addition, the dampening impact of past interest rate increases would gradually fade and demand for euro area exports should pick up.",
        "The unemployment rate was at its lowest since the start of the euro.",
        "Employment had grown by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2023, again outpacing economic activity.",
        "As a result, output per person had declined further.",
        "Meanwhile, employers were posting fewer job vacancies and fewer firms were reporting that their production was being limited by labour shortages.",
        "Members widely acknowledged the weaker than expected growth in the short term.",
        "Economic activity had stagnated for five quarters in a row and was expected to remain weak for two more quarters.",
        "Moreover, risks were seen to be on the downside, as mechanical nowcasting tools still showed lower numbers than those in the March projections for the first and second quarters of 2024.",
        "Consequently, the euro area economy was so far not showing convincing signs of improvement, which would likely imply six quarters of economic stagnation.",
        "Across sectors, there was also no indication of a recovery in manufacturing or construction, while private consumption, investment and external demand had remained weak overall throughout 2023.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that data available since the last Governing Council meeting had confirmed the bottoming-out of the euro area economy, which was being supported by foreign demand recovering and the continued solid growth in the United States, as well as recently some more positive news about China.",
        "The most recent PMIs for the euro area had been stronger than expected, with services moving back into expansionary territory, while manufacturing remained weak but stood significantly above the trough of last summer.",
        "New orders had also been steadily increasing in the manufacturing and services sectors since November.",
        "Members expressed broad agreement with the latest macroeconomic staff projections.",
        "It was emphasised that the March projections had seen the fifth consecutive downward revision to growth and the second downward revision to inflation for 2024, with also a downward revision to inflation for 2025.",
        "The macroeconomic projections had now broadly converged with the Consensus Economics forecasts, both for 2024 and for 2025.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that the projections for growth and inflation, as well as credit developments, were pointing to a benign outlook, in which both a hard landing and a credit crunch would be avoided.",
        "The macroeconomic projections overall showed an encouraging picture, with an outlook that was well on track to bring inflation back to target.",
        "Revisions were becoming smaller, so there was reason to have more confidence in the baseline projections, although the risks to the growth outlook were still tilted to the downside, at least in the short term.",
        "Moreover, the contributions of cyclical and structural factors to growth and longer-term potential were hard to disentangle in real time.",
        "The main drivers of the expected recovery were increasing real incomes, higher government consumption, improving terms of trade and monetary policy becoming less restrictive.",
        "Private consumption was expected to pick up once real household income started to gradually improve, supporting a concomitant recovery in business investment.",
        "In this context, it would be important for investment to resume in line with what was necessary for the digital and green transformations, which would ultimately also reduce medium-term price stability risks and benefit monetary policy by increasing the robustness of the supply side of the economy.",
        "In addition, fiscal policy was seen as a key driver of economic growth over the projection horizon, in terms of both government consumption and public investment, in particular through the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme.",
        "The release of the final 2023 deficit figures in the coming weeks should enable a clearer assessment of the fiscal policy stance.",
        "Several countries were running excessively high deficits, which might pose challenges further down the road.",
        "However, it was mentioned that in some countries the fiscal imbalances stemmed to a large extent from shortfalls in tax receipts, reflecting the weak economy, rather than from spending overruns.",
        "It was reiterated that governments should continue to roll back energy-related support measures to allow the disinflation process to proceed sustainably.",
        "Fiscal and structural policies should be strengthened to make the euro area economy more productive and competitive, expand supply capacity and gradually bring down high public debt ratios.",
        "A speedier implementation of the NGEU programme and more determined efforts to remove national barriers to deeper and more integrated banking and capital markets could help increase investment in the green and digital transitions and reduce price pressures in the medium term.",
        "The EU’s revised economic governance framework should be implemented without delay.",
        "Turning to the labour market, it was widely stressed that a thorough understanding of the market remained crucial for assessing the outlook for wages and inflation.",
        "This applied not just to wage dynamics but also to labour productivity.",
        "It was pointed out that the share of firms citing labour shortages as a constraint on output remained high but had been falling, pointing to less labour market tightness.",
        "However, firms continued to hoard labour, which could be interpreted as a sign that they were trying to avoid shortages in the future.",
        "Labour hoarding would allow them to meet a future resurgence in demand with the workforce already in place, which had positive implications for labour productivity.",
        "Additionally, it was remarked that monetary policy transmission remained strong, with a significant portion of recent downward revisions to the growth outlook seeming to stem from monetary policy having a more forceful effect on growth than expected.",
        "Looking ahead, the projected improvement in economic activity was also based on rate cuts as embedded in the market rate assumptions underpinning the projections.",
        "Against this background, members assessed that the risks to economic growth remained tilted to the downside.",
        "Growth could be lower if the effects of monetary policy turned out stronger than expected.",
        "A weaker world economy or a further slowdown in global trade would also weigh on euro area growth.",
        "Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East were major sources of geopolitical risk.",
        "This could result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted.",
        "Growth could be higher if inflation came down more quickly than expected and rising real incomes meant that spending increased by more than anticipated, or if the world economy grew more strongly than expected.",
        "The point was made that two scenarios could unfold if downside risks to economic activity materialised.",
        "In one possible scenario, weak demand would lead to a slowdown in profit and wage growth and inflation would be dampened.",
        "In an alternative downside scenario, however, the projected recovery in productivity would not materialise.",
        "Given the ongoing strength of wage developments, weaker economic growth could translate into higher unit labour costs, contributing to upside domestic price pressures and slowing down the disinflation process.",
        "With regard to price developments, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction and welcomed the recent decline in inflation, reflecting a faster than anticipated disinflationary process.",
        "This was partly due to the unwinding of past supply shocks but was also a sign that monetary policy was working.",
        "Over the past year both headline and core inflation had fallen by several percentage points, and even services inflation had declined over the past six months.",
        "The latest staff projections suggested that inflation would, at least temporarily, already reach a trough close to target in the second half of 2024, which was much earlier than previously expected.",
        "On this basis, the view was expressed that the disinflation process was making good progress.",
        "At the same time, it was mentioned that the disinflationary process remained bumpy and fragile, and that a timely and sustainable return to target as foreseen in the projections still relied on a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "Inflation momentum, as measured by the annualised three-month-on-three-month rate, had jumped for all HICP components except food.",
        "This was consistent with the latest PMIs showing that the share of services firms indicating rising selling prices had steadily increased since November, which posed upside risks to the inflation outlook, especially for core inflation.",
        "One important upside risk was associated with energy prices, which had recently eased significantly.",
        "For gas prices, in particular, risks were strongly tilted to the upside, as shown by option-implied distributions.",
        "It was important to keep in mind that wrong assumptions on energy prices would eventually feed through to all inflation components, either through input prices or indirectly, via wages.",
        "That implied that the benign inflation outlook in the latest projections depended critically on the favourable energy price assumptions.",
        "Moreover, the combination of El Niño and La Niña, in conjunction with the impact of global warming and climate change, was creating upside risks for food prices.",
        "It was added that month-on-month figures showed that core inflation had again been on the rise for the last couple of months, which called for continued caution on the inflation outlook.",
        "Services inflation, with the latest figure at 3.9%, had barely moved from the 4% recorded for November, which lent further support to the picture of “last mile” persistence in that component of inflation.",
        "In January, around 90% of the services consumption basket had still been growing at an annual rate above 2%.",
        "The turnaround in services inflation had started late, only from July 2023, and services inflation had lost a mere 1.7 percentage points of the 4 percentage point increase observed since the start of the pandemic.",
        "Given the large and rising weight of services in euro area value added, this stickiness had significantly restrained the overall disinflation process.",
        "At the same time, monetary policy transmission to services inflation might be weaker and slower than in manufacturing, as services tended to be less capital-intensive and hence less exposed to changes in external financing conditions.",
        "In the October 2023 Corporate Telephone Survey, services firms had reported hardly any impact of financing conditions on their past or future activity, in part reflecting their large cash buffers.",
        "Moreover, less exposure to global competition meant there was less pressure on services firms to absorb rising costs by curtailing their margins.",
        "Overall, this evidence was consistent with the notion that monetary policy transmission to services inflation worked mainly indirectly, through the effect of monetary policy on inflation expectations and wages, as well as through a general dampening of aggregate demand.",
        "Furthermore, the rotation of consumption from goods back to services and the resilience of the labour market might have weakened even this indirect transmission channel.",
        "All this argued for perseverance in keeping monetary policy sufficiently restrictive.",
        "While the progress on inflation had indeed been encouraging, the February inflation figure was a warning sign that the last mile was likely to be more uncertain, slower and bumpier.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that services inflation had always been more persistent.",
        "Although it had indeed remained stubbornly high for the last four months, that was to be expected and had already been incorporated in the projections.",
        "Moreover, owing to weaker productivity growth in the services sector, services inflation had traditionally been higher on average than the overall inflation rate.",
        "While the annual growth rate of services inflation in February had still been too high, its momentum had been on a falling trend since April 2023 and had been close to 2% in January 2024, although it had picked up again in February to 3.1%.",
        "In this context, it was also mentioned that between November and January services inflation had been pushed up by developments in transport, insurance services and package holidays.",
        "These components were not classified as wage-sensitive.",
        "More generally, it was argued that wage-sensitive components had not exerted particular upward pressure on services inflation since last June.",
        "Services inflation had mainly been higher than goods inflation because of the rotation of demand from goods to services after the pandemic, with the result that it had started to increase later, had peaked later and had started to decrease later.",
        "The point was made that services inflation had also been higher than in a normal disinflation episode because wages had responded at a slower pace to the supply shock from energy prices.",
        "Given the price level gap between goods and services, it was at present not clear whether services prices would converge to goods prices or the other way round.",
        "Turning to wage and profit developments, members recalled that information on the nexus of wages, profits and productivity remained a key element in building confidence around the inflation outlook.",
        "There were still several question marks over all three elements of this nexus, so more evidence was needed before it could be concluded that inflation had durably turned the corner.",
        "The March 2024 staff projections foresaw a significant decline in the growth of unit labour costs, which had been revised down for 2025 and 2026 compared with the December 2023 projections.",
        "But convincing evidence was yet to emerge that nominal wage growth was coming down as expected and, in particular, that firms were absorbing the higher unit labour costs through their profits.",
        "Revisions compared with the December staff projections implied significantly stronger contributions from unit profits to domestic inflation than had been expected, and the GDP deflator had so far remained stubbornly above 5%.",
        "While the most recent data on profits in 2023 were encouraging, a much stronger absorption of higher labour costs by lower profit margins needed to materialise over 2024.",
        "Furthermore, the projections envisaged a steady recovery of productivity growth over the projection horizon.",
        "This might not materialise if the observed slowdown in productivity growth was due not only to cyclical factors such as labour hoarding, but also to factors such as a change in the composition of the labour force, structurally higher sick leave or a shift in employment towards the services sector, which could make the productivity slowdown more persistent.",
        "More generally, a significant part of the current weakness in manufacturing was likely to be of a structural nature, which would have different implications for the evolution of inflation, particularly as previous downward revisions to potential output growth might prove insufficient.",
        "At the same time, it was mentioned that labour productivity was procyclical in the euro area, so that when economic activity was subdued, weak productivity developments could also be interpreted as a sign of excessive monetary policy tightening.",
        "Incoming information on wages in many countries suggested that wage developments continued to deserve special attention.",
        "While the data for the whole euro area on compensation per employee for the fourth quarter of 2023 were not yet available, information had already been received for 15 euro area countries.",
        "That information suggested wage growth had slowed significantly in the fourth quarter of last year.",
        "As regards the GDP deflator, the headline figure for the fourth quarter had already been released for some countries and incorporated in the March ECB staff projections.",
        "The incoming wage growth figures for the first quarter of 2024 from the Indeed tracker based on job adverts could be seen as a leading indicator for negotiated wages.",
        "These figures suggested that negotiated wage increases could slow further.",
        "Especially when comparing with the inflation outlook contained in the September 2023 staff projections, the subsequent downside inflation surprises had diminished the need for nominal wages to catch up with past inflation.",
        "The question was also raised whether, in the near future, profit margins would be able to keep absorbing the rise in unit labour costs.",
        "Otherwise, businesses might increasingly pass on higher unit labour costs by raising prices.",
        "In 2022 the level of profits had been atypically high, which suggested that there was sufficient room for margins to compress and that profits would likely be affected by weak demand.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, members took note of the assessments by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane of the latest developments in market-based measures of inflation compensation and survey-based indicators.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation compensation had come down notably and remained broadly anchored at 2%.",
        "Upside risks to inflation included the heightened geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade.",
        "Inflation could also turn out higher than anticipated if wages increased by more than expected or profit margins proved more resilient.",
        "By contrast, inflation could surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampened demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsened unexpectedly.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessments provided by Mr Lane and Ms Schnabel in their introductions.",
        "Market interest rates had risen since the Governing Council’s previous meeting.",
        "These had converged towards the views of analysts and now priced in three fewer interest rate cuts in 2024, with an 85% probability of a first rate cut in June.",
        "It was argued that this repricing reflected a recognition that disinflation was going to be slower and less certain than previously expected.",
        "In addition, spillovers from higher market interest rates in the United States were also mentioned.",
        "Market expectations for future interest rates were seen as broadly in line with macroeconomic fundamentals, including the inflation outlook and interest rate assumptions as embedded in the latest staff projections.",
        "Financial markets had continued to function well but might be underpricing risk in some asset categories.",
        "Spreads on high-yield corporate bonds in the euro area had narrowed to levels not seen for the past 15 years but could widen if defaults picked up.",
        "Sovereign bond spreads had also continued to narrow but could increase as a result of fiscal risks.",
        "Equity markets appeared buoyant, especially in the United States.",
        "Meanwhile, the euro exchange rate had changed little, both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms.",
        "Members agreed that the ECB’s restrictive monetary policy had been transmitted strongly to broader financing conditions for firms and households and that these conditions remained tight.",
        "It was remarked that a reduced supply of liquidity was also contributing to monetary tightening, owing to ongoing and prospective reductions in the asset purchase programme (APP) and PEPP portfolios, as well as maturing targeted longer-term refinancing operations.",
        "Interest rates on business loans had broadly stabilised and mortgage rates had declined in December and January.",
        "This had contributed to a slight easing in financing conditions, but lending rates remained elevated in historical terms.",
        "Furthermore, continued repricing of the outstanding stock of loans was also contributing to a strong transmission of the past rate hikes.",
        "Bank funding costs were high, and banks were tightening lending standards and increasingly favouring safer assets as the riskiness of borrowers increased.",
        "This had negative implications for credit supply.",
        "It was also contended that because new loans were less risky their risk-adjusted cost was actually still rising.",
        "There were signs that annual growth in bank loans to firms was stabilising at low levels, notwithstanding some volatility in monthly flows around the turn of the year.",
        "Meanwhile the growth in loans to households continued to weaken in annual terms.",
        "Broad money, as measured by M3, was growing at a subdued annual rate, with the three-month annualised growth rate momentum rebounding somewhat since mid-2023.",
        "It was also argued that the impact of credit tightening had been stronger than expected, especially on mortgage lending.",
        "Additionally, the outlook for credit remained moderate, owing to the substantial impact of high interest rates and tight credit standards over the projection horizon.",
        "Caution was expressed about assuming that a turning point in lending growth had been reached.",
        "Attention was drawn to analysis suggesting that the ratio of corporate bank loans to GDP was projected to fall to historical lows of below 35% in the coming quarters.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that the staff projections did not entail a credit crunch.",
        "Also, credit dynamics still appeared to suggest a soft landing, given increasing evidence that loan growth had reached a trough.",
        "Moreover, declining bank funding costs should also support slightly lower lending rates on new loans.",
        "In that context, it was argued that the peak of monetary policy transmission to bank lending volumes might have been reached.",
        "Some concerns were expressed that financial stability risks were emerging, given signs of financial distress among low income households.",
        "The proportion of mortgage holders struggling to meet payments was rising rapidly to historical highs, which would probably persist for an extended period.",
        "The risks facing some non-financial firms and the risks from the commercial real estate sector were also highlighted.",
        "Against this background, banks’ non-performing and underperforming loans were increasing, which could make it tougher for non-financial corporates to access bank credit.",
        "Narrow spreads on high-yield bonds were currently a mitigating factor, but if spreads were to increase owing to higher default rates, non-financial corporates’ access to debt financing could suffer.",
        "At the same time, bank equity prices remained elevated overall, suggesting that asset quality risks remained contained.",
        "Turning to the monetary policy stance, members assessed the data available since the last monetary policy meeting in accordance with the three main elements that the Governing Council had communicated in 2023 as shaping its reaction function.",
        "These comprised (i) the implications of the incoming economic and financial data for the inflation outlook, (ii) the dynamics of underlying inflation, and (iii) the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Overall, there had been further progress on all three elements, which warranted increased confidence that inflation was on track to reach the ECB’s target in a timely and sustainable manner.",
        "However, more data and evidence were needed for the Governing Council to be sufficiently confident of this.",
        "Starting with the inflation outlook, members broadly concurred with the assessment that had been presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Inflation was continuing to decline towards the 2% target broadly as expected, and this good progress was seen as encouraging.",
        "The fact that inflation had been slightly higher than anticipated in February was not seen as changing this general picture.",
        "Nevertheless, it was argued that the associated increase in momentum for all HICP components except food, as measured by the annualised three-month-on-three-month rate of inflation, was a warning.",
        "A more uncertain, slower and bumpier disinflation process could lie ahead.",
        "Still, inflation was expected to continue its downward trend in the coming months – near-term projections having been revised down compared with the December staff projections – and to show continued moderation in 2024.",
        "A bumpy profile and a trough were expected after the summer, driven by base effects.",
        "Further ahead, inflation was on track to decline to the 2% target as a result of moderating labour costs and the fading effects of past energy shocks, supply bottlenecks and the post-pandemic reopening of the economy.",
        "According to the latest staff projections, inflation was expected to be back at target – or even slightly below target – in the medium term, and earlier than had been previously anticipated, especially compared with the September 2023 staff projections.",
        "Members agreed that most measures of underlying inflation had declined further since the last monetary policy meeting, owing to the indirect effects of lower energy prices receding, the impact of past supply shocks fading and tight monetary policy weighing on demand.",
        "The staff projections for core inflation had also been revised down.",
        "It was now expected to fall to 2% in 2026.",
        "However, domestic price pressures were still elevated, owing to a combination of robust wage growth, falling labour productivity and sticky services inflation.",
        "It remained to be seen whether unit labour costs would decline in line with the projections, which relied on a recovery in productivity growth together with moderating wage growth.",
        "Further uncertainty surrounded both the projected continued decline in the contribution of unit profits to the GDP deflator as well as the extent to which firms would absorb higher labour costs, rather than passing them on to consumers.",
        "It was also noted that, over the entire horizon, the March ECB staff projections for core inflation were at the lower end of a range of other forecasts.",
        "Continuing uncertainty about the effects of the wage-profits-productivity nexus on domestic inflation highlighted the need for caution and for more evidence that core inflation would continue to decline.",
        "At the same time, there were signs that wage growth was starting to moderate.",
        "In addition, profits were absorbing part of the rising labour costs, reducing their inflationary effects.",
        "Moreover, services inflation could be expected to be more persistent and lag behind other components of inflation.",
        "Finally, members generally agreed that monetary policy transmission was working well, with less uncertainty about the strength of transmission than when interest rates were still rising.",
        "Monetary policy was being transmitted robustly to financial markets, financing conditions, credit conditions and aggregate demand.",
        "This had helped to lower inflation but had also weighed on growth – potentially more than had been expected and with measurable effects on small and young enterprises.",
        "It was recalled that a significant part of policy transmission remained in the pipeline, as the coming quarters would see the impact of past policy tightening continuing to be transmitted to bank funding conditions, broader financing conditions, credit volumes and the real economy.",
        "It was also argued that there would be some tightening in financing conditions in 2024 stemming from the contraction of the Eurosystem balance sheet.",
        "At the same time, it was contended that the tightening impulse from monetary policy was gradually fading.",
        "The point was made that financial and financing conditions – and thereby the effective monetary policy stance – had already eased and might continue to ease as markets repriced their rate expectations.",
        "Moreover, transmission was seen as weaker and slower for services inflation, which tended to be less capital-intensive and therefore less reliant on external financing.",
        "Overall, members expressed increased confidence that inflation was on track to decline sustainably to the 2% inflation target in a timely manner.",
        "However, patience and caution were still needed, and more evidence and data were required for the Governing Council to be sufficiently confident that the task had been accomplished.",
        "It was therefore important not to be complacent, as the disinflationary process remained fragile and conditional on a number of benign assumptions about wages, profits and productivity.",
        "Furthermore, a smooth and sustainable return of inflation to target, as implied by the projections, was also contingent on the monetary policy stance remaining restrictive enough for long enough.",
        "At the same time, it was widely felt that, while there were clearly risks to the outlook, monetary policy was working and the disinflation process remained solid and robust.",
        "The view was taken that the risks of overshooting versus undershooting the ECB’s symmetric inflation target in the medium term were broadly balanced or becoming more balanced.",
        "All members agreed with the proposal by Mr Lane to maintain the three key ECB interest rates at their current levels.",
        "There was consensus that it would be premature to discuss rate cuts at the present meeting.",
        "Instead, it was affirmed that it was important to be further along in the disinflation process and accumulate additional evidence for the Governing Council to be sufficiently confident that inflation was set to return to target in a timely and sustainable manner.",
        "It was reiterated that, based on its current assessment, the Governing Council considered the key ECB interest rates to be at levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, would make a substantial contribution to returning inflation to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner.",
        "Future decisions would ensure that policy rates would be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.",
        "Members underlined the need for policy to remain data-dependent and to continue to be based on the elements of the reaction function already communicated.",
        "While it was wise to await incoming data and evidence, the case for considering rate cuts was strengthening.",
        "This was based on the latest ECB staff projections, the further progress on the three criteria specified by the Governing Council in 2023, more contained projection errors and a more balanced risk assessment, with the date of a first rate cut coming more clearly into view.",
        "It was also recalled that the ECB’s focus and mandate were price stability in the euro area, although spillovers from other major policy areas would naturally be taken into account.",
        "It was highlighted that, in addition to new staff projections, the Governing Council would have significantly more data and information by the June meeting, especially on wage dynamics.",
        "By contrast, the new information available in time for the April meeting would be much more limited, making it harder to be sufficiently confident about the sustainability of the disinflation process by then.",
        "Questions remained about the sustainability of the disinflationary process, particularly in services and domestic inflation, on account of the uncertain outlook for wage growth, productivity growth and profit margins.",
        "In order to increase confidence that inflation would sustainably return to the ECB’s target, incoming data needed to confirm that important assumptions and predictions about these indicators in the March ECB staff projections would indeed hold true.",
        "Members also agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the PEPP portfolio, in line with the Executive Board proposal presented by Ms Schnabel in her introduction.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel noted that, since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 13-14 December 2023, the rapid easing of financial conditions observed after the 25-26 October meeting had levelled off and been pared back slightly.",
        "Financial conditions had eased sharply in November and December, as the narrative in financial markets had shifted from “high for longer” to swift disinflation and imminent monetary policy easing.",
        "After the Governing Council’s 13-14 December meeting, financial conditions had continued to ease until late December but had tightened slightly thereafter.",
        "This followed ECB communication that had countered the aggressive market pricing of a rate-cutting cycle starting as early as March 2024.",
        "While the probability of a 25 basis point cut in April still stood at around 60%, a first cut was now fully priced in only for June.",
        "Expected cumulative rate cuts by the end of the year had declined slightly since the December meeting, to around 130 basis points.",
        "Policy rate expectations in US forward markets had also been scaled back, although to a slightly lesser extent.",
        "US interest rate markets were positioned for an initial 25 basis point cut in May, with a 40% probability of a March cut.",
        "Moreover, investors expected almost the same magnitude of cumulative cuts as in the euro area in the course of 2024, anticipating a globally synchronised normalisation cycle.",
        "However, the uncertainty around this policy path was high, as reflected in the persistent volatility in bond markets.",
        "The easing of global financial conditions in November and December 2023 had gone hand-in-hand with lower volatility in risk asset markets.",
        "Implied volatility in euro area equity markets had dropped to its lowest level since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in February 2020, despite significant geopolitical tensions and risks of protracted economic weakness.",
        "Yet, lower implied volatility in risk asset markets was not accompanied by meaningfully lower implied volatility in bond markets, which had decoupled from equity market volatility.",
        "There were two potential sources of heightened monetary policy uncertainty.",
        "The first was the timing and pace of the policy adjustment, while the second was the extent of the required policy adjustment.",
        "Respondents to the January 2024 ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) had raised their expectations for the pace of rate cuts over the year but remained more cautious than financial market pricing.",
        "While markets foresaw a cumulative easing of around 130 basis points, SMA respondents expected total cuts of 100 basis points by the end of the year.",
        "Differences in the outlook for inflation could explain the discrepancy between market pricing and analysts’ expectations for the future path of monetary policy.",
        "Investors trading in financial markets were discernibly more optimistic about the inflation outlook than the median SMA respondent.",
        "Another explanation could be different speeds in adjusting to new information.",
        "During the interest rate tightening cycle in 2022 and 2023, rate markets had consistently led survey expectations, often by several months.",
        "The second source of uncertainty about the medium-term policy rate path concerned the extent of adjustment required to return to a neutral policy rate and the uncertainty surrounding estimates of such a rate.",
        "SMA participants had raised, noticeably, their median longer-run expectations for policy rates compared with levels during the period before the start of the ECB’s hiking path.",
        "The expected reversal of the 2023 tightening was also visible in longer tenors of the yield curve.",
        "The euro area ten-year real overnight index swap (OIS) rate remained close to early 2023 levels and slightly below its September 2023 level, when the ECB had last hiked interest rates.",
        "The corresponding nominal OIS interest rate had even fallen below early 2023 levels.",
        "In the United States, the ten-year real OIS interest rate had fallen to a similar degree since late October but remained above early 2023 levels.",
        "The reappraisal of the monetary policy outlook had been the dominant driver of the decline in bond yields since the Governing Council’s October monetary policy meeting, along with news on the growth outlook and fiscal developments.",
        "The rescaling of the earlier aggressive market pricing had also affected risk asset markets.",
        "Yet, euro area equity markets remained broadly unchanged since the December meeting.",
        "A longer perspective, since the start of 2023, revealed that developments in equity markets, as in other risk asset markets, had been robust, providing an easing impulse to financial conditions.",
        "The somewhat stronger repricing of monetary policy expectations in the euro area than in the United States had been reflected in a slight appreciation of the euro, with the US dollar moving lower against a broad set of currencies.",
        "Intra-euro area sovereign bond spreads had declined further, as the announcement regarding the phasing-out of reinvestment under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) had been well absorbed by the market and some government bonds had seen record demand.",
        "The announcement on the PEPP and the ongoing gradual and predictable unwinding of the Eurosystem’s bond portfolios under the asset purchase programme (APP) had not amplified the sensitivity of spreads to changes in risk-free rates, suggesting that fragmentation risks remained muted.",
        "Absorption in euro area government bond markets had been supported by benign liquidity conditions, underpinned by the return of foreign investors and investment funds.",
        "The prospects for smooth and healthy market absorption remained largely in place for 2024.",
        "Benign market conditions had also been evident in 2023 year-end trading and repo market functioning.",
        "Repo rate declines in general collateral and non-general collateral markets had been substantially more contained than at the 2021 and 2022 year-ends.",
        "Reviewing the global environment, Mr Lane noted that global economic activity had moderated in the fourth quarter of 2023.",
        "At the same time, global trade growth was improving as post-pandemic patterns normalised.",
        "However, the recent tensions in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden were a downside risk to trade, since these could adversely affect delivery times and maritime shipping costs, especially on routes between China and Europe.",
        "Since the end of December, there had been a big drop in transit volumes, with some shipping re-routing around Africa.",
        "So far, the rental price for container vessels was relatively unaffected, likely owing to spare capacity, while shipping prices had already increased.",
        "Oil production was not expected to be affected by the developments in the Red Sea area.",
        "The latest projections from the International Energy Agency estimated that oil supply and demand would remain broadly in balance in the first quarter of 2024 and that the market would move into surplus in the remainder of the year.",
        "However, there had been notable movements in energy prices.",
        "Oil futures prices were significantly above levels at the time of the Governing Council’s December meeting but gas futures prices were significantly lower.",
        "Mr Lane noted that, when analysing energy prices, it was also important to look at the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) market.",
        "Emissions allowance prices had fallen 22% within the first three weeks of January, reflecting weak demand from the industry and power sectors.",
        "In the case of the power sector, this was due to the increased use of renewables.",
        "Turning to the euro area, Mr Lane recalled that inflation had risen to 2.9% in December, from 2.4% in November, owing to energy-related base effects.",
        "However, the increase was less than expected.",
        "While services inflation had remained steady at 4.0%, food and non-energy industrial goods inflation had continued to decline.",
        "Looking ahead, headline inflation and core inflation – as measured, respectively, by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) and the HICP excluding energy and food – were expected to continue their downward trajectory.",
        "Domestic inflation remained high at 4.5%, owing to the elevated pace of wage increases and falling labour productivity, but it too had started to ease.",
        "Indicators of momentum in headline inflation and all of its components had eased further.",
        "The annualised three-month-on-three-month growth rate of seasonally adjusted core inflation had fallen below 1.5%, with momentum in goods inflation at zero and momentum in services and food inflation close to 2%.",
        "A broad range of underlying inflation measures had also fallen in December.",
        "This reflected the fading impact of past shocks, as well as weaker demand that was, in part, the result of the ongoing strong transmission of tighter monetary policy.",
        "Among the different measures, the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation, which was the best predictor of inflation one and two years ahead, had eased to 2% in December.",
        "Overall, the December inflation data provided further evidence that the disinflationary process was well on track and in fact might be running faster than previously expected.",
        "However, several headwinds were expected to increase inflation momentum again, as embedded in the December Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "This was largely due to the increasing role of wage pressures in explaining the dynamics of core inflation and also to the fading out of some of the energy price falls and the disinflationary pressures coming from the removal of supply bottlenecks.",
        "Historically, the Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) for prices had not been able to capture developments in goods and services inflation very well.",
        "Since 2020, however, the correlation had improved, with the PMIs showing a six-month leading property for goods and a nine-month leading property for services.",
        "On this basis, the PMIs suggested that downward pressures on goods and services inflation were likely to continue in the near term.",
        "However, the latest readings showed a small reversal, suggesting that these pressures were set to weaken.",
        "Looking ahead, the expected slowdown in the disinflationary process was also evident from a decomposition of services inflation into “wage-intensive” and “not wage-intensive” components.",
        "So far, the declines in services inflation observed earlier had been driven by the not wage-intensive component, while the contribution from the wage-intensive component had declined only very gradually.",
        "The pace of wage growth remained elevated but there were some initial signs of a deceleration.",
        "Unit labour costs had grown by 6.7% and compensation per employee by 5.3% in the third quarter of 2023.",
        "Negotiated wage growth had decreased from 4.8% in September to 4.6% in October.",
        "The forward-looking wage trackers signalled wage dynamics that were broadly in line with the December staff projections.",
        "Mr Lane also recalled that the wage tracker contained both old and new contracts, renegotiated at different points in time.",
        "New agreements signed at the end of 2023, if one-off payments were included, showed increases still above 5%.",
        "Moreover, many negotiations taking place in the first quarter of 2024 were expected to be concluded in February or March.",
        "Survey-based measures of wage expectations showed that firms and professional forecasters expected a decline in wage growth in 2024.",
        "According to the January Corporate Telephone Survey, wage growth was expected to fall from 5.3% in 2023 to 4.4% in 2024.",
        "These expectations were a bit lower than in previous rounds.",
        "Similarly, in the latest Survey of Professional Forecasters, expectations for the annual growth in compensation per employee pointed to easing wage growth from 2024 onwards and had been revised down for the longer-term horizon.",
        "In particular, as of 2026, expected wage growth was below 3%, which was generally seen as the trend increase consistent with the ECB’s 2% medium-term inflation target.",
        "The contribution of unit profits to domestic price pressures had continued to decrease in the third quarter of 2023, suggesting that – as expected – profit margins were absorbing some of the price pressures coming from wage increases.",
        "The January Corporate Telephone Survey suggested that firms had adjusted their profit margins during 2023.",
        "Although reported profit margins had edged up somewhat at the end of the year, they remained below the long-term average after being above it from early 2021 to mid-2023.",
        "This further confirmed that profits had started to mitigate the inflationary effects of wage increases.",
        "Looking ahead, inflation was expected to ease further over the course of 2024, as the effects of past energy shocks, supply bottlenecks and the post-pandemic reopening of the economy faded and tighter monetary policy constrained demand.",
        "Measures of shorter-term inflation expectations had come down markedly, while longer-term inflation expectations mostly stood around 2%.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation compensation implied by fixings contracts – measures extracted from swap contracts linked to very near-term euro area inflation releases – indicated that investors were expecting inflation to fall to 2% as early as April and to stay at or below 2% for most of the remainder of 2024.",
        "The Consumer Expectations Survey showed that perceptions about inflation had finally declined in recent months.",
        "Households’ expectations one year ahead had declined considerably between October and December, whereas three-year ahead expectations had moved sideways since October.",
        "As regards professional forecasters, their inflation expectations had shifted down over the entire horizon, with longer-term expectations now standing at 2%.",
        "Upside risks to inflation included the heightened geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and hamper global trade.",
        "Inflation could also turn out higher than anticipated if wages increased by more than expected or profit margins remained resilient.",
        "By contrast, inflation might surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampened demand by more than expected or the economic environment in the rest of the world worsened unexpectedly.",
        "Moreover, inflation could decline more quickly in the near term if energy prices evolved in line with the recent downward shift in market expectations for the future path of oil and gas prices.",
        "The euro area economy had likely stagnated in the final quarter of 2023, following a mild contraction in real GDP in the third quarter.",
        "The latest statistical releases for services and industrial production indicated a drop relative to the third quarter, and survey indicators including the PMIs remained at levels consistent with falling activity.",
        "However, in January, forward-looking indicators signalled some pick-up in growth further ahead.",
        "Turning to the components of demand, private consumption was estimated to have remained subdued at the end of 2023.",
        "Mr Lane recalled that the December staff projections entailed a significant recovery in private consumption during 2024.",
        "Indicators were not yet available for the first quarter.",
        "However, firms’ expectations had remained contained for retail trade, while they continued to be above historical averages for contact-intensive services.",
        "Moving on to housing investment, this was the GDP demand component most visibly affected by monetary policy transmission.",
        "Housing investment had been contracting over the past two years and was estimated to have also declined in the final quarter of 2023.",
        "The December projections entailed a slower rate of decline.",
        "At the same time, the PMI for housing output remained in deeply negative territory but with some signs of bottoming out.",
        "Regarding business investment, the picture was mixed.",
        "Business investment had still been growing in 2023, but the expectation in the December projections was that it would decline in the fourth quarter.",
        "There had been an accumulation of stocks of finished capital goods that might have cushioned the decline in investment in the recent past.",
        "Additionally, the existing order books for capital goods were helping to keep investment growth in positive territory.",
        "However, new orders were still falling sharply, which suggested a period of weak investment ahead.",
        "On the trade side, in spite of the recovery in global trade, euro area exports had remained subdued as 2023 drew to a close.",
        "Imports also continued to be weak, owing to an unfavourable composition of demand and to the inventory destocking cycle, both at the global level and in the euro area.",
        "The labour market continued to be robust.",
        "The unemployment rate had fallen back to 6.4% in November, even as more workers entered the labour force.",
        "Labour market conditions had benefited from the 2022 surge in profit margins, which enabled firms to hoard labour despite demand tailing off.",
        "At the same time, momentum in demand for labour was decelerating, with fewer vacancies being advertised.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, news on fiscal measures had been limited.",
        "The few measures taken were cancelling each other out at the euro area aggregate level, as some countries had implemented new measures and others were rolling back their previous plans.",
        "The risks to economic growth remained tilted to the downside.",
        "Growth could be lower if the effects of monetary policy turned out to be stronger than expected.",
        "A weaker world economy or a further slowdown in global trade would also weigh on euro area growth.",
        "Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East were key sources of geopolitical risk.",
        "This might result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted.",
        "Growth could be higher if rising real incomes led to a greater increase in spending than anticipated, or the world economy grew more strongly than expected.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, market interest rates had moved broadly sideways since the previous Governing Council meeting.",
        "Similarly, at the longer end of the yield curve, risk-free rates and sovereign bond yields were little changed overall, despite some fluctuations in the intervening period.",
        "Monetary aggregates had continued to decline in annual terms and remained close to historical lows.",
        "M3 – the broad monetary aggregate – had declined by 0.9%, year on year, in November 2023.",
        "This decline was consistent with the lack of aggregate growth in bank lending and, if measured in real terms, the decline was much larger.",
        "M1 – the narrow monetary aggregate of currency in circulation and overnight deposits – had continued to fall very sharply in November, against a background of portfolio shifts.",
        "The transmission of the restrictive monetary policy stance to broader financing conditions remained exceptionally strong.",
        "Lending rates on business loans had declined slightly to 5.2% in November but remained close to their historical highs.",
        "Mortgage rates had increased further to 4.0%.",
        "The January bank lending survey suggested that higher borrowing rates, with the associated cutbacks in investment plans and house purchases, had led to a further drop in credit demand in the fourth quarter.",
        "Against this background, credit dynamics had improved somewhat but, overall, remained weak in November, despite an increase in short-term loans to firms likely associated with their greater working capital needs.",
        "At the same time, the further tightening in credit standards for loans to companies reported in January was quite moderate, in a sign that the trend towards ever more restrictive credit conditions observed over the last two years might be flattening out.",
        "Overall, the incoming information had broadly confirmed the Governing Council’s previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Inflation was heading towards the 2% target, possibly at a faster pace than previously expected.",
        "The current levels of the policy interest rates would make a substantial contribution to reaching that goal if maintained for a sufficiently long duration.",
        "In terms of an overall evaluation of the policy rate trajectory, the disinflationary process needed to be further along for the Governing Council to be sufficiently confident that inflation would hit the target in a timely manner and settle sustainably at that level.",
        "Therefore, Mr Lane proposed keeping the three key ECB interest rates unchanged.",
        "The three elements of the Governing Council’s reaction function gave a robust framework for assessing the data and guiding decisions over the upcoming policy meetings.",
        "The Governing Council should continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction.",
        "In particular, the Governing Council’s interest rate decisions should remain based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Finally, Mr Lane proposed preserving the option to apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism still related to the pandemic.",
        "As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane that, while global GDP growth was seen to have decelerated in the fourth quarter of 2023, incoming trade data suggested that goods trade momentum was turning positive again.",
        "This was in line with the assessment that a normalisation of the inventory cycle and consumption patterns between goods and services should support trade.",
        "Moreover, the impact on global trade from recent developments in the Red Sea area was seen as contained so far.",
        "Looking at key global economies, the United States was on course for a soft landing, while in China GDP growth had slowed in the last quarter of 2023.",
        "In the context of weaker Chinese domestic demand, it was argued that Chinese exports would put additional negative pressure on international prices.",
        "The weakness in China had also been negatively affecting euro area exports, increasing uncertainty around the economic outlook.",
        "Turning to energy commodities, oil prices had increased since the December Governing Council meeting, while European gas prices had declined further as demand remained subdued and gas storage facilities were relatively full.",
        "The euro area economy was seen as particularly exposed to geopolitical risk, which was likely to remain elevated for years to come.",
        "First, the war in Ukraine remained an important risk factor.",
        "Second, the conflict in the Middle East had resulted in rising freight costs and a lengthening of delivery times owing to the recent attacks on freight ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.",
        "So far there had been no major disruption of trade and the main impact had come from ships taking longer routes around Africa, resulting in higher shipping rates and longer delivery times.",
        "However, this had, anecdotally, already led to some euro area companies halting production because of a lack of components.",
        "In this context of heightened global uncertainty, it was seen as puzzling that international energy price developments had remained overall very benign.",
        "With regard to economic activity, members concurred with Mr Lane that the euro area economy was likely to have stagnated in the final quarter of 2023.",
        "The incoming data continued to signal weakness in the near term.",
        "However, some forward-looking survey indicators pointed to a pick-up in growth further ahead.",
        "The labour market had remained robust.",
        "The unemployment rate, at 6.4% in November, had fallen back to its lowest level since the start of the euro and more workers had entered the labour force.",
        "At the same time, demand for labour was slowing, with fewer job vacancies being advertised.",
        "Governments should continue to roll back energy-related support measures to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures.",
        "Fiscal and structural policies should be designed to make the euro area economy more productive and competitive, as well as to gradually bring down high public debt ratios.",
        "Structural reforms and investments to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity – which would be supported by the full implementation of the Next Generation EU programme – could help reduce price pressures in the medium term, while supporting the green and digital transitions.",
        "Following the recent ECOFIN Council agreement on the reform of the EU’s economic governance framework, the legislative process should be concluded swiftly so that the new rules could be implemented without delay.",
        "Moreover, it was imperative that progress towards capital markets union and the completion of banking union be accelerated.",
        "Members widely acknowledged that growth would likely be weaker than expected in the short term.",
        "So far, however, the decline in inflation was coming at a relatively mild cost in terms of economic activity.",
        "On the one hand, survey indicators suggested that the economy might have bottomed out.",
        "PMI indicators had plateaued and were even showing an uptick, feeding into the view that there would be a soft landing.",
        "Looking at the flash PMIs for January, manufacturing activity, although still firmly in negative territory, was on an upward path.",
        "The forward-looking PMIs for services had increased notably and employment expectations had also edged up moderately.",
        "On the other hand, it was pointed out that the economy was now likely to have stagnated for the fifth quarter in a row and the next staff projections would most likely shift the start of the recovery by one or two quarters again.",
        "Consumer confidence remained low and the PMI indicator for services had come in below analysts’ expectations in January.",
        "The ECB’s contacts with non-financial corporations showed that the business environment was perceived as not worsening, but also not improving.",
        "The Governing Council therefore still needed to see clearer signs that the recovery was on track.",
        "Looking ahead, the main factor behind the expected recovery – according to the December 2023 staff projections – was consumption, which was seen picking up as real household income gradually improved.",
        "Investment was seen as another potential driver.",
        "Housing investment had been quite weak for almost two years, but it might gradually recover with mortgage rates coming off their peak.",
        "Reference was made to the bank lending survey, which foresaw an increase in households’ demand for loans for house purchase in the first quarter of 2024. Business investment had held up better than anticipated, and it might continue to do so given the still high stock of orders for capital goods and profits remaining above pre-pandemic trends, especially if financial conditions loosened further.",
        "This was seen as posing an upward risk to the economic outlook, notably in the short term, in view of the weak investment trajectory that the December projections anticipated.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that monetary transmission remained very strong, particularly in the housing sector, as reflected in weak developments for housing loans.",
        "Turning to the labour market, conditions there were seen as persistently very tight.",
        "Unemployment was still at an all-time low, so it could be argued that the “sacrifice ratio” of bringing down inflation had been virtually zero.",
        "Given the very tight labour market, it was prudent for the Governing Council to exercise caution on wage prospects and to await evidence that wage growth was actually moderating as projected for 2024.",
        "It was argued that the Governing Council would need to see some hard data confirming that wages had turned the corner.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that the labour market was clearly showing signs of cooling, and that was likely to have a dampening effect on future wage growth.",
        "Given significant labour hoarding, either economic activity would have to recover soon or employment and wage growth had to fall.",
        "Some softening of labour market conditions was already visible in a decline in job vacancies, which was typically the first variable that started to adjust.",
        "Against this background, members assessed that the risks to economic growth remained tilted to the downside.",
        "Growth could be lower if the effects of monetary policy turned out stronger than expected.",
        "A weaker world economy or a further slowdown in global trade would also weigh on euro area growth.",
        "Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East were key sources of geopolitical risk.",
        "This might result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted.",
        "Growth could be higher if rising real incomes meant spending increased by more than anticipated, or if the world economy grew more strongly than expected.",
        "In this context, the view was expressed that the risks surrounding growth and inflation in the December staff projections were, overall, increasingly on the downside.",
        "It was remarked that a lower figure for activity in the fourth quarter, with the economy stagnating or even contracting, would mechanically imply substantially lower growth for 2024 owing to a carry-over effect.",
        "Moreover, the growth rate in both 2023 and 2024 would remain far below potential, mainly as a result of tighter financial conditions, weak sentiment, the withdrawal of fiscal support and the lagged effect of monetary policy tightening.",
        "As euro area growth remained disappointing, also from a medium-term perspective, it was regarded as important to stress the need for structural reforms to address low productivity and impediments on the supply side.",
        "Low potential growth in Europe highlighted the importance of making progress towards capital markets union, as well as improving the functioning of the Single Market and other factor and product markets.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that national governments were faced with several structural challenges, including an ageing population and the green and digital transitions, all to be tackled against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical risks.",
        "Even if activity and sentiment in the manufacturing sector were slowly improving, firms continued to face structural headwinds that were unrelated to the ECB’s monetary policy and needed to be tackled first and foremost by governments via structural reforms.",
        "On the reform of the EU’s fiscal governance framework, it was stressed that the European Commission and the European Council should implement the new rules as transparently and as efficiently as possible, and in a way that permitted further progress towards fiscal consolidation and could simultaneously create headroom for investment.",
        "It was also recalled that governments needed to bring down high public debt ratios while being ready to contribute to closing the investment gap for the green transition and adaptation to climate change.",
        "This implied that they also had to adjust not only the path of “headline” fiscal policies but also the composition of budgets, to be able to pursue truly sustainable levels of economic activity that were resilient to the increasingly plausible scenario that the world would fall short of the objectives of the Paris Agreement.",
        "With regard to price developments, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Inflation had risen to 2.9% in December as some of the past fiscal measures to cushion the impact of high energy prices dropped out of the annual inflation rate, although the rebound was weaker than expected.",
        "Aside from this base effect, the overall trend of declining inflation had continued.",
        "Food price inflation had eased to 6.1% in December.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food had also declined again, to 3.4%, owing to goods inflation falling to 2.5%.",
        "Services inflation was stable at 4.0%.",
        "Inflation was expected to ease further over the course of 2024 as the effects of past energy shocks, supply bottlenecks and the post-pandemic reopening of the economy faded, and tighter monetary policy continued to weigh on demand.",
        "Almost all measures of underlying inflation had declined further in December.",
        "The elevated rate of wage increases and falling labour productivity were keeping domestic price pressures high, although these too had started to ease.",
        "At the same time, lower unit profits had started to moderate the inflationary effect of rising unit labour costs.",
        "Measures of shorter-term inflation expectations had come down markedly, while measures of longer-term inflation expectations mostly stood around 2%.",
        "Members stressed that the recent decline in inflation was good news.",
        "Headline and underlying inflation figures had recently been continuously below the predicted levels, suggesting a faster than anticipated disinflationary process.",
        "It was therefore likely that in March, with the new projections, there would be a downward revision to inflation for 2024.",
        "In this context, it was highlighted that the staff projections tended to underestimate changes in inflation momentum in both directions.",
        "Moreover, downside inflation surprises were currently occurring in parallel with downside growth surprises and repeated signs of a stronger than expected transmission of monetary policy.",
        "Additionally, market participants were expecting a lower inflation profile, notably for 2024.",
        "The view was expressed that this suggested the risks to the inflation projections might be moving to the downside, especially for the short term.",
        "However, it was emphasised that the outlook for inflation remained particularly clouded over the short term.",
        "Seasonality could play a disproportionate role, with many firms posting new prices at the start of the year.",
        "This was likely to complicate the interpretation of incoming inflation numbers.",
        "Moreover, it was underlined that extracting a signal from the month-by-month data on how inflation would evolve over the medium term was subject to considerable uncertainty.",
        "In this regard, the medium-term component of wage dynamics and the evolution of inflation expectations remained crucial.",
        "It also remained an open issue as to how the pandemic-related changes in the prices of services would unwind relative to goods prices.",
        "There could be either more protracted deflation in goods prices or an extended period of services inflation above normal levels, with services prices typically stickier and more heavily determined by wages.",
        "While headline inflation was generally seen as being on track towards the ECB’s 2% inflation target, this path remained surrounded by considerable uncertainty, especially with respect to the medium term.",
        "The prospect of inflation returning to target in a timely and sustained manner therefore remained fragile and depended on a number of benign assumptions materialising.",
        "In particular, emphasis was placed on the projected decline of record high unit labour cost growth, which was predicated on a rebound in productivity alongside a moderation in wage growth in 2024.",
        "Moreover, it was assumed that higher labour costs would continue to be absorbed by profits, as indicated by a projected smaller contribution from unit profits to domestic inflation.",
        "Reference was again made to the “last mile” difficulties, with the final stretch to the inflation target seen as more challenging than earlier phases.",
        "This was seen as a risk because the swift disinflation following the reversal of supply shocks and the forceful monetary tightening would soon start to wane, and the domestic components of inflation might prove more persistent or new shocks might derail progress.",
        "For example, although the momentum of services inflation had slowed, the annual growth rate had remained high, at 4% in December.",
        "Similarly, domestic inflation had come down but remained above other measures of underlying inflation.",
        "Moreover, the absorption of higher input costs by lower profit margins was not assured, as was suggested by the increase in selling price expectations over three successive months.",
        "Turning to wage developments in more detail, members recalled that wage pressures were key to the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "So far, wage growth had remained strong and, together with negative productivity growth, had led to a historically large increase of 6.7% in unit labour costs in the third quarter of 2023.",
        "The distance between current wage growth of around 5% and a trend increase of 3% or 2½% that was compatible with the 2% inflation target, assuming 1% or ½% trend productivity growth, was regarded as quite significant and likely to diminish only gradually over time.",
        "It remained to be seen whether unit labour cost growth would decline sharply in 2024 as assumed in the December staff projections, which relied partly on a rather strong recovery in productivity growth combined with a moderation in wage growth.",
        "Despite stagnation, it was underlined that the economy continued to add jobs.",
        "The unemployment rate was clearly below all available estimates of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) for the euro area.",
        "Hence trade unions would probably still see themselves as being in quite a powerful negotiating position.",
        "It should also be kept in mind that the backloading of wage increases in some countries implied more persistent pressure on wage growth, stretching well into 2025.",
        "At the same time, the reason why unit labour costs were expected to improve significantly this year was because the economy was expected to recover strongly according to the December projections.",
        "So, under the baseline scenario, firms could increase output this year without necessarily adding to employment, and an improvement in productivity ensured that unit labour costs would decline more quickly than wages.",
        "If the economy were to grow by less, unit labour costs might not retrench and inflation pressure might persist.",
        "However, it was also argued that this was unlikely to happen, as firms would face weaker demand and pricing power and would thus eventually respond with layoffs, which would pre-empt a further decline in labour productivity.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that nominal wage growth of around 5% – according to the latest available data for compensation per employee (for the third quarter of 2023) – was not necessarily an excessive number during a “catching-up” phase, taking into account that real wages had declined by about 7% since the beginning of the inflation surge.",
        "A recovery in real wages, as also embodied in the December projections, could be regarded as necessary for the euro area economy to recover from its current period of stagnation.",
        "In a context of weak demand, this should not be expected to put upward pressure on inflation.",
        "Conversely, if employment and wages were to weaken too much, there was a risk that the economy could quickly find itself back in a situation of low growth and low inflation.",
        "Moreover, in a context of rapid disinflation, it also seemed likely that trade unions would accept lower nominal wage increases to achieve the same real wage increases.",
        "Finally, caution was expressed against overinterpreting the signal from current wage growth, as the labour market typically lagged output dynamics and the impact of monetary policy tightening should therefore also become visible in wage growth with a lag.",
        "Against this background, it was widely felt that the signal from wage growth in the first quarter of this year would be important, as many wage contracts were scheduled to be settled in the coming months.",
        "At the moment it was an open question as to how workers would react to the new environment of falling inflation, with the level of prices still high compared with wage levels.",
        "The incoming information from the wage trackers was broadly in line with the baseline in the December staff projections.",
        "Hence the question was raised as to whether new wage agreements would corroborate recent first signs of moderation in line with the projections, and whether firms would continue to compress margins.",
        "These were two elements which would be consistent with inflation returning to target in the medium term.",
        "Finally, it was also recalled that, while negotiated wages were typically a lagging indicator of economic growth, the wage drift – the other component of total wage growth – was more immediately responsive to the overall business cycle.",
        "In the context of an economy that had been stagnating for nearly one and a half years, it was thus likely that this component of wage growth would turn out to be weaker than suggested by the information in the wage tracker for negotiated wages.",
        "Attention was drawn to another reason why inflation could be falling in spite of increasing wages.",
        "Since wages amounted to only around 40% of firms’ total costs and most indicators of intermediate costs were currently falling, when wages and intermediate costs were taken together, pressure on inflation from total costs was declining.",
        "As changes in producer prices typically led changes in consumer prices by a few quarters, this decline in cost pressure could be expected to be transmitted to consumer prices in the next couple of quarters.",
        "Now that intermediate costs were moving in the opposite direction to wages, wage growth was not a sufficient indicator to capture overall cost pressures in the economy, given that prices were typically set as a mark-up over total costs, not just wage costs.",
        "The question was also raised as to whether, in the near future, profit margins would have enough scope to continue absorbing the rise in unit labour costs.",
        "If not, businesses might increasingly pass high unit labour costs through to prices.",
        "Firms’ profits were far from the exceptional levels of 2022, a time when firms purportedly took advantage of high inflation to increase profit margins.",
        "In fact, profit margins had already come down to the point where anecdotal evidence suggested that some firms were now starting to cut back on investment because they felt constrained by a lack of profitability.",
        "The performance of the manufacturing sector was weaker and the sector was also exposed to global competition, so profits might continue to buffer unit labour costs.",
        "By contrast, the services sector was largely shielded from global competition and demand was still robust.",
        "Therefore, the high unit labour costs in this sector were likely to be passed through to prices more easily.",
        "In this context, it was also noted that stock returns suggested that corporate profitability was, overall, still high.",
        "Moreover, there was significant uncertainty surrounding the link between wages and price-setting, and it was underlined that the Governing Council needed to monitor a broad set of variables to understand how the current state of the labour market would ultimately affect inflation, rather than relying on only a few indicators.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, market-based measures had come down notably and remained broadly anchored at 2%, reflecting the market’s view that inflation would fall rapidly and stabilise around 2%.",
        "In this context, reference was made to risks of a downward unanchoring of inflation expectations, as a result of the weakness in economic activity and of a faster and broader disinflation than anticipated.",
        "At the same time, the view was expressed that there were no indications that expectations would become unanchored to the downside, with the inflation expectations of households and firms instead being skewed to the upside.",
        "Overall, developments were widely seen as going in the right direction.",
        "Against this background, upside risks to inflation included the heightened geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and hamper global trade.",
        "Inflation could also turn out higher than anticipated if wages increased by more than expected or profit margins proved more resilient.",
        "By contrast, inflation could surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampened demand by more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsened unexpectedly.",
        "Moreover, inflation could decline more quickly in the near term if energy prices evolved in line with the recent downward shift in market expectations for the future path of oil and gas prices.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, market interest rates were broadly unchanged compared with the levels at the time of the Governing Council’s previous meeting but had shown substantial volatility.",
        "The rapid fall in market interest rates until around the turn of the year had subsequently reversed on the back of communication by Governing Council members that had curbed expectations of imminent policy rate cuts.",
        "This had led markets to price in a lower probability of policy rate cuts at the upcoming meetings of the Governing Council.",
        "Nevertheless, expected cumulative rate cuts for 2024 were currently nearly double the 75 basis points that had been embedded in the December staff projections.",
        "In addition, it was argued that the markets were expecting lower interest rates because they were expecting lower growth and inflation than projected, especially in 2024.",
        "In this respect, it was widely felt that the current market pricing of future interest rates was not a sign that markets did not understand the ECB’s reaction function.",
        "Instead, it appeared that markets simply expected inflation to be lower than foreseen in the December staff projections, notably for 2024.",
        "Given that market expectations for inflation and for the future path of nominal interest rates had moved lower in tandem, the profile of expected real interest rates had remained broadly unchanged.",
        "It was important not to dismiss the markets’ assessment, and it was advisable to exercise humility when judging market expectations for inflation and rates.",
        "However, this did not mean that the Governing Council had to follow or validate these expectations.",
        "Market pricing would likely respond both to incoming data and to the Governing Council’s communication of its own assessment.",
        "Euro area equity markets were assessed to have been quite buoyant in 2023 and also to have remained robust into 2024, despite the weaker outlook for economic growth.",
        "It was argued that this could, in part, reflect the repricing of the outlook for interest rates by financial markets, which might be underpricing the risk of a shallower monetary policy easing cycle.",
        "An alternative interpretation of the strength in equity markets was that financial market participants might be expecting profits to remain resilient, which could justify current stock market valuations, notably of globally active firms.",
        "Members also pointed out that euro area financial markets had continued to function well, with sovereign and corporate bond spreads generally contained and mostly narrowing.",
        "There was no evidence of market fragmentation amid the normalisation of the Eurosystem balance sheet, which was a welcome development.",
        "Overall, there had been a significant loosening of financial conditions since the October monetary policy meeting, when the Governing Council had first paused the hiking cycle after the series of interest rate increases implemented since July 2022.",
        "Financial conditions were broadly unchanged from the time of the December meeting and had tightened only slightly since the trough around the end of 2023.",
        "Members agreed that the ECB’s restrictive monetary policy had been strongly transmitted to financing conditions for firms and households, while some evidence had recently emerged that borrowing costs might have reached a peak.",
        "Bank lending rates for firms had fallen in November 2023 for the first time in a long period and, although mortgage rates had increased further, the bank lending survey suggested some flattening-out in the tightening of credit standards and an easing in the terms and conditions for housing loans.",
        "However, it was recalled that, even if rates on new lending might be reaching a turning point, much of the repricing of the existing stock of loans at higher rates remained in the pipeline.",
        "Credit dynamics had improved somewhat but remained weak overall.",
        "This weakness reflected the impact of past monetary policy tightening, which, as reported in the latest bank lending survey, had also contributed to a further drop in credit demand in the fourth quarter of 2023.",
        "On the credit supply side, it was argued that weak incentives for bank lending might also have played a role.",
        "Banks had attractive alternative ways of putting their liquidity to work, including by investing in bond markets and placing funds in the ECB’s deposit facility.",
        "Anecdotal evidence nevertheless suggested that loan supply was not seen as a major problem by firms, who cited other issues, such as regulation and the lack of qualified labour, as being more important.",
        "Overall, it was assessed that the monetary policy transmission to credit volumes had remained strong, especially for mortgages.",
        "At the same time, credit dynamics appeared to be in line with the narrative of a soft landing for the economy.",
        "Moreover, the fact that monthly lending flows to firms had reached their highest level in more than a year and loans to households had picked up could be an indication that credit dynamics might be close to a turning point, and that the peak of monetary transmission to bank lending volumes might have been reached.",
        "Finally, it was remarked that, in response to changes in the monetary policy stance, banks’ funding strategies were gradually normalising in terms of both the configuration of bank interest rates and their recourse to the Eurosystem balance sheet.",
        "Banks had benefited from being able to draw on well-functioning funding markets with stable and sustainable spreads.",
        "While more diversified funding strategies might imply an increase in aggregate bank funding costs, they contributed to robust bank balance sheets and therefore increased the resilience of banks to shocks in the prevailing uncertain macro-financial environment.",
        "This would also support an orderly and smooth transmission of monetary policy if shocks were to materialise.",
        "Turning to the monetary policy stance, members assessed the incoming data since the last Governing Council meeting in accordance with the three main elements that the Governing Council had communicated in 2023 to be important in shaping its reaction function.",
        "These elements were (i) the implications of the incoming economic and financial data for the inflation outlook, (ii) the dynamics of underlying inflation, and (iii) the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Overall, members saw the latest developments in economic activity and inflation as being consistent with the current monetary policy stance.",
        "There had been further progress on all three elements of the reaction function, which gave grounds to be confident that monetary policy was working.",
        "Starting with the inflation outlook, data releases issued since the previous meeting suggested that disinflation was broadly proceeding as envisaged, or even at a slightly faster pace than previously expected.",
        "It was argued that, on the basis of current information and updated assumptions, and in particular lower energy prices, the new staff projections due in March were likely to show a downward revision to inflation for 2024.",
        "However, it was underlined that the important question from a policy perspective was the extent to which the news on near-term inflation would be translated into changes in the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "While the incoming information had broadly confirmed the previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook, it would be premature to draw any firm conclusions in this regard, as a more complete evaluation was needed when the March projections were available.",
        "While inflation had been decreasing faster than expected, this could partly be attributed to one-off factors and energy price developments that might easily reverse.",
        "For an assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook, a wide range of variables needed to be considered, in particular the extent to which disinflation would lead to lower wage claims.",
        "For the new staff projections, the prevailing market expectations regarding interest rates were also important as conditioning assumptions.",
        "Market expectations were currently significantly lower than those underlying the December projections.",
        "Since the lower path for interest rates currently expected by markets was in part an endogenous reaction to lower inflation, the extent to which lower nominal rates would translate into higher growth and inflation in the future needed to be carefully assessed.",
        "This should include looking at how the expected path of real rates would change in the projections with new assumptions.",
        "Members noted that measures of underlying inflation had passed their peak, having fallen since the summer, and HICP inflation excluding energy and food had been weaker than predicted in recent data releases.",
        "Momentum had also come down in those measures of underlying inflation that remained relatively high, including services inflation and domestic inflation.",
        "Yet, wage growth had remained strong, with only limited indications of a turnaround thus far.",
        "Moreover, unit labour costs had risen sharply, in part reflecting weak productivity growth, and it remained to be seen whether they would grow as slowly as foreseen in the projections, which were predicated on a recovery in productivity growth together with moderating wage growth.",
        "Further uncertainty pertained to how much the contribution of unit profits to domestic inflation would continue to decline as projected, with firms absorbing higher labour costs rather than passing them on to consumers.",
        "Turning to the assessment of monetary policy transmission, members noted that there was solid evidence that monetary policy was being transmitted to financial markets, financing conditions and credit conditions, with the impact most likely having been stronger than expected.",
        "However, uncertainty remained about the timing of the peak impact, as well as the ultimate overall effect of monetary policy tightening on the real economy and inflation.",
        "All in all, members signalled that continuity, caution and patience were still needed, since the disinflationary process remained fragile and letting up too early could undo some of the progress made.",
        "While the initial inflation shock had largely reversed, the task that lay ahead was the reversal of second-round effects, which might prove to be more stubborn.",
        "At the same time, members expressed increased confidence that inflation would be brought back towards the 2% inflation target in a timely manner.",
        "The point was made that, for the first time in many meetings, the risks to reaching the inflation target were seen as broadly balanced or at least becoming more even.",
        "At the same time, the view was also expressed that, after several years of significantly overshooting the inflation target, the costs of another overshooting were likely higher than the costs of undershooting.",
        "In this context, members underlined the fact that the ECB’s inflation target was symmetric, implying the need to avoid both an undershooting and an overshooting, unless policy rates were close to the effective lower bound.",
        "At the same time, there was likely to be some volatility in inflation on the path to achieving the 2% target, and new shocks could materialise.",
        "Even if the projections foresaw a temporary period of inflation below 2%, as long as such a deviation was neither large nor persistent, the policy conclusion, in keeping with the ECB’s medium-term orientation, was that the Governing Council did not necessarily have to act.",
        "However, it was recalled that, since the ECB’s monetary policy strategy did not prescribe an average inflation target, the Governing Council should not aim at any such undershooting and all persistent deviations from the inflation target in either direction required a policy response.",
        "Against this background, all members agreed with the proposal by Mr Lane to maintain the three key ECB interest rates at their current levels.",
        "It was affirmed that further progress needed to be made in the disinflationary process before the Governing Council could be sufficiently confident that inflation was set to hit the ECB’s target in a timely manner and in a sustainable way.",
        "At the present juncture it was regarded as important for monetary policy to stay the course and for the Governing Council to proceed with a steady hand.",
        "At the same time, members underlined the fact that monetary policy remained data-dependent.",
        "It was reiterated that, based on its current assessment, the Governing Council considered the key ECB interest rates to be at levels that, if maintained for a sufficiently long duration, would make a substantial contribution to returning inflation to the medium-term target in a timely manner.",
        "Future decisions would ensure that policy rates would be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.",
        "There was broad consensus among members that it was premature to discuss rate cuts at the present meeting and members widely referred to risk management considerations to support this view.",
        "The risk of cutting policy rates too early was still seen as outweighing that of cutting rates too late.",
        "Having to reverse course, in the event that economic activity picked up more strongly than expected, wage growth accelerated or renewed inflationary pressures emerged, could entail high reputational costs.",
        "The point was also made that the risk of an inadvertent overtightening of monetary policy was mitigated by the fact that financial markets were already pricing in a number of rate cuts in 2024, contributing to a loosening of both financial and financing conditions.",
        "However, it was also argued that such a loosening might be premature and could possibly derail or delay a timely return of inflation to target.",
        "In any case, members agreed that following a data-dependent rather than a calendar-based approach was important, in line with the elements of the reaction function that the Governing Council had communicated in 2023.",
        "Members also agreed with the Executive Board proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the PEPP portfolio.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel noted that since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 25-26 October 2023 the narrative in financial markets had entirely turned around, proving once again its high sensitivity to incoming data and central bank communication.",
        "Markets had turned bullish, driven by expectations of quick and “immaculate” disinflation and an early and sharp monetary policy reversal.",
        "This repricing had supported risk asset prices, with equity markets soaring and sovereign and corporate credit spreads narrowing amid continued smooth market absorption.",
        "Buoyant risk asset markets and a stronger euro exchange rate were consistent with investors pricing in a bottoming-out rather than a deterioration in the euro area’s economic growth momentum.",
        "Looking at the key drivers of financial market developments and monetary policy expectations, the first and dominant factor had been the downward surprise in inflation worldwide.",
        "Second, other macroeconomic data, excluding inflation, had also come in better than expected in the euro area, alleviating fears of a “hard landing” of the economy.",
        "The third factor supporting investor risk appetite had been diminishing impact of geopolitical tensions, accompanied by lower oil prices.",
        "The pronounced swing in market pricing over recent months had resulted in strong movements in financial conditions indices.",
        "The tightening in euro area financial conditions seen in September and October on the back of expectations that interest rates would be high for longer, as well as a decompression of term premia, had more than reversed in November and early December when investors had positioned for rapid disinflation.",
        "Almost all components of the standard financial conditions indices pointed towards a substantial loosening of financial conditions to levels last seen at the start of the year.",
        "Investors had substantially revised their assessment of both the near-term and longer-term inflation outlook since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "They now expected inflation to come down much more quickly and to stand close to the ECB’s 2% inflation target thereafter.",
        "The inflation-linked swap (ILS) forward curve pointed to three features of markets’ pricing of annual inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) beyond 2024.",
        "First, market-based measures of compensation for headline inflation in the euro area had moved lower over the entire maturity spectrum.",
        "Second, investors did not foresee a scenario in which inflation would return to below-target levels.",
        "Third, compared with the period before the global financial crisis, the ILS forward curve was currently more upward-sloping, driven by inflation risk premia that were gradually increasing over the horizon.",
        "In other words, in the new global economic and geopolitical landscape, upside risks to longer-term inflation were seen as more prominent than before the global financial crisis.",
        "The disinflation narrative, which had first emerged in the United States, had found fertile ground in the euro area, spilling over into euro area short-term rate markets, especially after the flash estimate of euro area inflation in November had come in lower than expected.",
        "Markets were currently pricing in an earlier first rate cut by the ECB and a swifter rate-cutting cycle than they had at the time of the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "A 25 basis point cut in April 2024 had been fully priced in by markets as of 13 December, even prior to the release of the policy rate decision by the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).",
        "Expected cumulative rate cuts in the euro area by the end of 2024 had increased to nearly 140 basis points, from around 60 basis points at the time of the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "One important factor behind the sharp downward adjustment in forward rates had been the pricing-out of further rate hikes.",
        "At the time of the October Governing Council meeting, option prices had pointed, under the assumption of risk neutrality, to a 25% probability of a further 25 basis point rate hike.",
        "As of 13 December, markets attached only an 8% probability to a further rate hike.",
        "By contrast, the most likely outcomes reported by survey respondents were less affected by changes in the tails of the distribution of responses.",
        "This could partly explain the substantial divergence between survey-based and market-based expectations, with analysts expecting later and fewer rate cuts than market participants.",
        "Participants in the Survey of Monetary Analysts expected a cumulative cut of 75 basis points, starting only in July 2024.",
        "Another factor that could explain this divergence was that analysts tended to be more sluggish in revising their expectations, waiting for firmer central bank guidance.",
        "Similar developments had been seen at the start of the tightening cycle, when survey results had lagged the forward curves in the euro area and the United States for several months.",
        "As a result of the inflation and monetary policy repricing, real rates at the very short end of the curve had risen measurably as investors reappraised the near-term inflation outlook, while nominal short-term rates had been more “sticky”, reflecting the ECB’s communication.",
        "Looking beyond the short term, however, real forward rates had dropped markedly over the entire maturity spectrum as the decline in nominal interest rates had been greater than the downward revision to the inflation outlook over the medium and longer term.",
        "In other words, the previous tightening had been partly reversed.",
        "A decomposition of euro area equity price movements showed that the strong rise in share prices since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting had been driven by the accommodative monetary policy repricing, with a small countervailing effect from earnings expectations.",
        "Developments in fixed income markets were consistent with market participants positioning for a bottoming-out rather than a further deterioration in the growth momentum of the euro area economy.",
        "The reappraisal of the policy rate outlook, in combination with somewhat better macroeconomic news for the euro area, had reversed the widening of spreads for corporate and sovereign bonds that had been observed in September and October.",
        "Regarding possible adjustments to reinvestments in the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) portfolio, the December results of the Survey of Monetary Analysts suggested that markets were already expecting a partial run-down of PEPP reinvestments from the middle of 2024 and a full run-off after December 2024.",
        "Moreover, the sustained demand for bonds in primary and secondary markets amid the ongoing run-down of the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio was likely to support the smooth market absorption of an earlier end to full PEPP reinvestments.",
        "Private investors had stepped in as the Eurosystem had reduced its footprint in sovereign and corporate bond markets.",
        "The smooth absorption had also been supported by debt managers tapping into retail demand and reducing somewhat the maturity of newly issued debt.",
        "Banks’ funding conditions had also benefited from the monetary policy repricing and improved risk sentiment.",
        "Euro area bank bond spreads had narrowed, most notably for riskier bonds.",
        "Investor appetite for bank bonds had led to healthy primary market issuance activity, even in the Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bond segment.",
        "The increased recourse to market-based funding by banks amid more favourable funding conditions suggested that banks were able to smoothly absorb repayments of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), as also suggested by notable voluntary repayments.",
        "Year-end dynamics in funding markets were expected to be calm.",
        "The generally smaller Eurosystem footprint in bond markets and lower excess liquidity should help to reduce distortions in the repo markets on reporting dates.",
        "Turning to exchange rate developments, the euro had initially appreciated markedly against the US dollar after the Governing Council’s October monetary policy meeting.",
        "This appreciation had been stronger than suggested by movements in interest rate differentials and had been partly the result of improved investor sentiment on the back of the global repricing of monetary policy, which had weighed on the US dollar.",
        "Since late November the euro had partly reversed its gains.",
        "However, speculative positions pointed to a future appreciation of the euro against the dollar, consistent with expectations of a “soft landing” of the euro area economy.",
        "Reviewing the global economy, Mr Lane noted that in 2023 world real GDP had been stronger, while global trade had turned out weaker, than had been projected in December 2022.",
        "One reason for the drop in the elasticity of trade to global growth was related to the post-pandemic normalisation of the composition of demand from more trade-intensive goods to less trade-intensive services.",
        "The most recent data showed that consumption of goods and services was approaching the respective pre-pandemic trends, suggesting that the process of change in the composition of demand was coming to an end.",
        "The global inventory cycle was also returning to more normal fluctuations.",
        "During the pandemic, trade had been pushed higher by a strong build-up of inventories, much of which were imported inventories, because of global supply chain problems.",
        "As the supply chain disruptions unwound and new orders declined, the historically high stock of inventories had been run down.",
        "The normalisation of the inventory cycle was expected to contribute to a strengthening in trade growth and a normalisation of trade elasticities in the period ahead.",
        "Turning to the euro area, Mr Lane recalled that the November flash estimate for inflation had been substantially lower than expected, with headline inflation falling to 2.4%, from 2.9% in October.",
        "All of the main components of the HICP had contributed to the decline.",
        "excluding the energy and food components) had decreased to 3.6% in November, from 4.2% in October.",
        "The decline in non-energy industrial goods inflation to 2.9%, from 3.5%, reflected easing supply chain bottlenecks and slowing demand growth.",
        "Services inflation had declined to 4.0% in November, from 4.6% in October.",
        "All measures of underlying inflation had fallen in October.",
        "While the annual rate of domestic inflation had remained elevated at 5%, the momentum in this indicator had declined markedly over the last three months.",
        "Compared with one year ago, there had been very strong disinflation.",
        "Headline inflation had fallen by around 8 percentage points over the last year owing, in particular, to the massive declines in the energy component.",
        "When looking back at the inflation projections of December 2022, staff had been correct in foreseeing the major disinflation process a year ahead.",
        "This disinflationary process over the course of 2023 was due not only to base effects from the large energy price increases in 2022 but also to lower energy inflation in 2023.",
        "Food prices had also contributed to this disinflation – as had core inflation more recently.",
        "Looking ahead, the current assessment was that inflation had reached the end of the strongest phase of the disinflationary cycle.",
        "While core inflation and food inflation were expected to continue their gradual decline, upward energy-related base effects and the expiry of the fiscal measures introduced to compensate for the effects of inflation were pushing up headline inflation.",
        "In terms of inflation momentum, as measured by the annualised three-month-on-three-month percentage changes in inflation, goods inflation had fallen to below 1% in November.",
        "However, momentum in services inflation, while declining, remained strong.",
        "Focusing on the measures of underlying inflation, Mr Lane recalled that these measures were supposed to capture the persistent component of inflation, which was the component of inflation that was expected to persist one or two years ahead.",
        "During the past two years all measures of underlying inflation had first increased and then fallen significantly, giving only a blurred signal on the underlying inflationary forces.",
        "Measures that were adjusted for energy and supply bottleneck shocks had seen a less steep increase and decrease.",
        "So, while the decline in underlying inflation was also evident in these adjusted measures, they pointed to a smaller improvement from a lower peak level.",
        "The decline in the adjusted measures of underlying inflation could be partly attributed to the effects of monetary policy.",
        "In other words, without the action of monetary policy, underlying inflation would have stayed higher.",
        "An analysis of price dynamics for individual items in the core inflation basket showed that items accounting for almost half of core inflation were sensitive to monetary policy, and that these were the items that had lately declined more.",
        "This helped to explain the decline in underlying inflation and demonstrated that monetary policy was working its way through the economy as envisaged.",
        "Short-term selling price expectations of firms, as reported in the European Commission’s latest business survey, pointed to a normalisation in manufacturing, as the share of firms expecting to charge higher prices three months ahead was close to its long-term average.",
        "The latest Eurostat release showed that the rate of increase in compensation per employee had declined by 0.3 percentage points to stand at 5.2% in the third quarter, with the contribution of unit profits to the GDP deflator also falling substantially.",
        "This suggested that, as expected, moderating growth in profits was beginning to absorb some of the inflationary effects of wage increases.",
        "However, wage growth remained strong.",
        "Negotiated wage growth including one-off payments had increased to 4.7% in the third quarter, from 4.4% in the second quarter.",
        "Forward-looking wage trackers continued to signal high pressures, although there had been some deceleration in the Indeed wage tracker.",
        "As regards inflation expectations, the October round of the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey showed that consumers had still not adjusted their perception of past inflation downwards, which was a risk factor for upcoming wage negotiations.",
        "On the side of professional forecasters, by contrast, the latest Survey of Monetary Analysts showed a sizeable drop in inflation expectations for 2024.",
        "Longer-term inflation expectations reported in the survey remained stable at 2%.",
        "In the near term, headline inflation was set to pick up again, owing to energy-related base effects and the expiry of fiscal measures aimed at limiting the repercussions of the energy price shock.",
        "For 2024, the staff projections saw inflation declining only gradually – as a result of upward base effects and the phasing-out of past compensatory fiscal measures – before approaching the Governing Council’s target in 2025.",
        "Nonetheless, the strength of the ongoing disinflation process was reflected in the December projections: staff had revised down their projections for headline inflation by 0.2 percentage points to 5.4% for 2023 and by 0.5 percentage points to 2.7% for 2024.",
        "The 2025 projection was unchanged at 2.1%, while for 2026 inflation was projected to be 1.9%.",
        "Core inflation was projected to be 5.0% in 2023, 2.7% in 2024, 2.3% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026.",
        "Mr Lane focused on the fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter growth rates, as these were free from carry-over effects.",
        "Starting with HICP inflation, the December projections showed a growth rate of 2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023 over the fourth quarter of 2022, which was expected to slow very gradually to 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024.",
        "Thus the evolution of inflation during 2024 would be fairly flat.",
        "However, the slowdown in core inflation, which was less affected by base effects, was projected to be faster – with the rate falling from 3.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 2.7% in the fourth quarter of 2024.",
        "Upside risks to inflation included the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could raise energy prices in the near term, and extreme weather events, which could drive up food prices.",
        "Inflation could also turn out higher than anticipated if inflation expectations were to move above the target, or if wages or profit margins increased by more than expected.",
        "By contrast, inflation could surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampened demand by more than expected or the economic environment in the rest of the world worsened unexpectedly, potentially owing in part to the recent rise in geopolitical risks.",
        "Turning to economic activity in the euro area, in the third quarter real GDP had fallen marginally, as rising domestic demand had been offset by the further run-down of inventories.",
        "Survey indicators suggested that activity was set to weaken in the services sector and construction would contract again in the fourth quarter, while there were tentative signs that activity in the manufacturing sector was bottoming out.",
        "Moving to demand components, private consumption had increased by 0.3% in the third quarter, driven by consumption of services and durable goods.",
        "While the consumption of services was still being supported by the remaining effects from the post-pandemic reopening of the economy, durable goods consumption was being boosted by the delivery of previously ordered motor vehicles, as supply bottlenecks were being resolved.",
        "Thus the upward movement in durable goods consumption observed in the third quarter was a lagging indicator of overall consumption.",
        "As regards near-term expectations, demand for goods that were more sensitive to interest rate changes – chiefly durable goods – was declining, while the consumption of services was still being supported by the remaining reopening effects.",
        "The recovery in private consumption embedded in the December Eurosystem staff projections was predicated on falling inflation and rising wages, which were expected to boost real disposable income.",
        "Housing and business investment were set to remain weak in view of tight lending conditions.",
        "Business investment had been stronger than housing investment during 2023, largely owing to the reduction in the outstanding stock of orders.",
        "However, this factor would not support business investment in 2024, which would be increasingly affected by the monetary tightening.",
        "Euro area goods export growth had remained negative in September and the growth of import volumes had declined further.",
        "Export prospects remained subdued amid increasing competitiveness challenges.",
        "According to the European Commission’s business survey, European firms perceived themselves to have become less competitive in the global market, owing to both price factors and, increasingly, non-price factors.",
        "Employment had so far been resilient.",
        "The unemployment rate had stood at 6.5% in October and employment had increased by 0.2% in the third quarter.",
        "However, short-term indicators pointed to a cooling of the labour market and weaker economic activity was dampening the demand for workers, with firms advertising fewer vacancies in recent months.",
        "Moreover, the total number of hours worked had edged down by 0.1% in the third quarter.",
        "The sequence of subdued growth followed by the expected recovery based on rising real incomes and improving foreign demand was reflected in the new staff projections.",
        "Staff expected annual real GDP growth to be 0.6% in 2023, rising to 0.8% in 2024 and 1.5% in both 2025 and 2026.",
        "Compared with the September staff projections, real GDP growth had been revised down by 0.1 percentage points for 2023 and 0.2 percentage points for 2024, while it was unchanged for 2025.",
        "The risks to economic growth remained tilted to the downside.",
        "Growth could be lower if the effects of monetary policy turned out stronger than expected.",
        "A weaker world economy or a further slowdown in global trade would also weigh on euro area growth.",
        "Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East were key sources of geopolitical risk.",
        "This could result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future.",
        "Conversely, growth could be higher if rising real incomes led to spending increasing by more than anticipated or the world economy grew more strongly than expected.",
        "As regards fiscal policies, the December staff projections entailed relatively small revisions to the main fiscal balances compared with the September projections.",
        "For 2024, the budget deficit was expected to decline to 2.8% of GDP and the fiscal stance was expected to tighten.",
        "It was important to continue monitoring whether governments would stick to their budgetary plans.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, market interest rates had fallen markedly since the October Governing Council meeting, more than reversing the significant increases observed earlier in the autumn.",
        "Initially, the declines had mainly affected medium to longer maturities, amid spillovers from other major economies.",
        "More recently, shorter-term market rates had also declined measurably, mostly in response to inflation falling faster than expected in November.",
        "This had resulted in a market forward curve that embedded an earlier and stronger easing of the monetary policy stance than incorporated in the staff projections.",
        "Monetary policy transmission remained exceptionally strong.",
        "Bank lending to firms and households continued to be weak.",
        "The decline in the annual growth rate of bank lending to firms reflected both weaker credit demand and tighter credit standards.",
        "The softening of loan demand was mostly due to higher interest rates and slowing nominal fixed investment.",
        "For its part, the slowing pace of lending to households was driven by mortgage loans, consistent with the weakness in the housing market and tighter credit conditions.",
        "Bank composite funding costs had risen further.",
        "The deposit base available to banks continued to contract, with the annual growth rates of M3 (the broad monetary aggregate) and M1 (currency in circulation and overnight deposits) in October standing at -1.0% and -10.0% respectively, close to their recent historical lows.",
        "An important question was to what extent pressures from the transmission of monetary policy were still in the pipeline.",
        "ECB staff analysis showed that a sizeable increase in policy rates over a short period of time tended to lead to a stronger and faster transmission to credit volumes, and the impact of the tightening cycle on credit growth tended to peak earlier than implied by standard relationships.",
        "Such non-linearities seemed to be relevant in the current setting, with a substantial part of the extra interest rate effect attributable to a greater strength of the policy rate adjustments relative to historical regularities.",
        "Mr Lane also showed that, from a historical perspective, financing conditions had tightened very strongly over the current hiking cycle.",
        "On the basis of the assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, Mr Lane proposed keeping the three key ECB interest rates unchanged.",
        "Notwithstanding the recent downside surprises in inflation and the substantial downward revision of projected inflation for 2024, headline inflation was set to return to target only by the second half of 2025.",
        "The remaining distance of inflation from the ECB’s target, the waning of disinflationary supply-side tailwinds and, overall, still-high levels of domestic inflation continued to call for maintaining a sufficiently restrictive stance.",
        "The Governing Council should therefore maintain its current strategic orientation, namely that its future decisions should ensure that the key ECB interest rates would be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary, and that it would continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction.",
        "In particular, the Governing Council’s interest rate decisions should continue to be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "It was an appropriate time to review the schedule of PEPP reinvestments.",
        "With the fading impact of the pandemic and the reduction in fragmentation risks, Mr Lane proposed advancing the normalisation of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet at a measured and predictable pace.",
        "In particular, while full reinvestments should be maintained in the first half of 2024, the PEPP portfolio should be allowed to run off by €7.5 billion per month on average in the second half, with reinvestments fully discontinued at the end of the year.",
        "This proposal was broadly in line with market expectations, as reflected in the Survey of Monetary Analysts, and would be in line with the Governing Council's guidance that any “future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance”.",
        "For the partial reinvestments until the end of 2024, operational modalities similar to those used during the partial reinvestments of the APP could be applied.",
        "Finally, in line with the ECB’s monetary policy strategy, it was again time for the Governing Council to thoroughly assess the links between monetary policy and financial stability.",
        "Euro area banks had demonstrated their resilience.",
        "They had high capital ratios and had become significantly more profitable over the past year.",
        "However, the outlook for financial stability remained fragile in the current environment of tightening financing conditions, weak growth and geopolitical tensions.",
        "In particular, the situation could worsen if banks’ funding costs were to increase by more than expected and if more borrowers were to struggle to repay loans.",
        "At the same time, the overall impact on the economy of such a scenario should be contained if financial markets reacted in an orderly fashion.",
        "Macroprudential policy remained the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities, and the measures in place contributed to preserving the resilience of the financial system.",
        "As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane that euro area foreign demand had generally remained weak in 2023, despite an upward revision in the December staff projections compared with September.",
        "One important reason for this was the post-pandemic normalisation of demand away from more trade-intensive goods and towards less trade-intensive services.",
        "The fallout from the heightened geopolitical risks had so far remained contained and energy prices had come down from their recent elevated levels.",
        "The prices of both oil and gas had declined significantly since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "With regard to economic activity in the euro area, members concurred with Mr Lane that tighter financing conditions and subdued foreign demand were likely to continue weighing on economic activity in the near term.",
        "Members widely acknowledged the weaker than expected growth in the short term.",
        "Survey indicators suggested, however, that the economy might have hit its trough, both globally and in the euro area.",
        "The Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) were bottoming out and even showing a small uptick, supporting the prospect of a soft landing.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that it would be premature to think that the weakness in activity had run its course.",
        "There were several drivers of growth that were unlikely to sustain the euro area economy in the near term.",
        "First, there were no clear signals of an upcoming improvement in global trade, while geopolitical risks might be adding to the global weakness, at least in manufacturing.",
        "Second, the cash buffers of firms and households had so far delayed the impact of monetary policy on aggregate demand, but as these buffers declined, in tandem with the contraction of the balance sheet of the Eurosystem, the impact of tighter financing conditions was likely to become stronger.",
        "As corporate profitability was an important driver of business investment, declining corporate profitability was also seen as a downward risk for investment.",
        "Third, a generalised tightening of the fiscal stance was to be expected, possibly in part related to the EU economic governance review, which would put further downward pressure on the economy.",
        "Finally, the exceptionally strong monetary policy transmission to lending to firms and households risked having a stronger negative impact on growth and inflation than had been incorporated in the December baseline projection by Eurosystem staff.",
        "On this basis, it was argued that the December staff projections for growth in the near term might be too optimistic overall, also considering that mechanical nowcasting tools continued to point to slower economic activity and the possibility of a technical recession.",
        "While it was also recalled that there had recently been a disconnect between hard and soft data – such as PMIs – the Consensus Economics forecast for GDP growth was also significantly lower for 2024 than the equivalent staff projection.",
        "Most of the expected growth in 2024 hinged on an increase in consumption, which in turn was dependent on the dynamics of labour income.",
        "While productivity growth was currently weak, the strong growth in labour income in the staff projections was seen to be simultaneously driven by continued strength in employment and the catching-up of real wages.",
        "Moreover, the removal of fiscal measures implemented to support households in response to increases in energy prices would have a distributional effect and be borne more by low-income households, which had the highest propensity to consume.",
        "This would further weigh on consumption.",
        "Finally, the recent increase in real interest rates for maturities shorter than one year should also have a negative impact on private consumption.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that the evidence that monetary policy transmission was working was to be welcomed and remained consistent with a soft landing.",
        "The impact of monetary policy tightening was increasingly visible and was broadly proceeding as intended: financing and credit conditions had tightened, lending had been slowing, aggregate demand had been weakening and underlying inflation had been easing.",
        "Since inflation was coming down, the euro area economy was set to recover gradually in 2024 owing to rising real incomes, stronger consumption and higher foreign demand.",
        "Investment had remained resilient thus far in 2023 and was now projected to stagnate in 2024.",
        "However, it could perform better than projected if financial conditions loosened and business confidence improved.",
        "Especially in jurisdictions with a high prevalence of adjustable interest rates, mortgage interest rates had already started to decline, which could soon support housing investment again, as this was one of the demand components that had also been the first to react in response to higher interest rates.",
        "More broadly, owing to the variability in the lags and strength of the transmission process, there were several reasons why the transmission of monetary policy remained uncertain and might be less powerful than suggested by historical patterns and models.",
        "While the first leg in the transmission of monetary policy, to financing conditions, had been rapid and strong, transmission to the real economy was more uncertain and might be weaker.",
        "Several factors played a role here: the strong labour market, the relatively strong balance sheets of firms, households and banks, and the greater weight of less interest-sensitive sectors, such as services, in overall value added.",
        "The staff projections therefore remained subject to significant uncertainty with respect to the medium-term outlook for economic activity and prices.",
        "This also reflected the lack of clarity about the interplay between cyclical factors and structural changes in the wake of the pandemic and other supply shocks, as well as the possibility of new shocks hitting the economy.",
        "Turning to the labour market, it was noted that employment had remained resilient and had even edged up further, while hours worked was more subdued.",
        "At the same time, current levels of indicators should not lead to complacency about the strength of the labour market, which could change abruptly and had to be monitored carefully.",
        "Reference was made to potential non-linear changes in macroeconomic conditions if firms were to adjust employment in a synchronised way or if the present high degree of labour hoarding should become more costly, particularly at a time when profits were weakening, albeit from high levels.",
        "As the labour market was the main mechanism supporting the projected economic recovery in the period ahead, a potential non-linear response of the labour market posed downside risks to the economic outlook.",
        "A broader question was raised regarding the extent to which the economic slowdown was cyclical or structural in nature.",
        "It was highlighted that, on the basis of the regular annual review of the supply side undertaken by staff, potential output had been revised down in the staff projections, albeit moderately, partly reflecting structurally higher energy prices and weaker capital formation.",
        "Many euro area corporations found it hard to compete internationally, owing to the high energy costs in Europe.",
        "As investment in renewables was running into capacity problems, the energy transition was not going to provide much relief from high energy prices in the near term.",
        "The downward revision to potential output also had implications for the implied output gap and for inflationary dynamics.",
        "Overall, the outlook for both productivity growth and potential output growth was seen as weak.",
        "Regarding fiscal and structural policies, members reiterated that, as the energy crisis faded, governments should continue to roll back the related support measures.",
        "This was essential to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would otherwise call for even tighter monetary policy.",
        "Fiscal policies should be designed to make the economy more productive and to gradually bring down high public debt.",
        "Structural reforms and investments to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity could help reduce price pressures in the medium term, while supporting the green and digital transitions.",
        "It was argued that the fiscal stance was likely to become tighter overall in the years ahead, which would imply a drag on economic activity.",
        "However, automatic stabilisers working in the opposite direction in a context of lower growth and lower inflation were likely to impede any meaningful improvement in the fiscal balance, thus complicating the fiscal outlook.",
        "It was stressed that a well-functioning monetary union with a stability-oriented monetary policy required a set of clear and simple fiscal rules.",
        "Against this background, members assessed the risks to economic growth as remaining tilted to the downside.",
        "Growth could be lower if the effects of monetary policy turned out to be stronger than expected.",
        "A weaker world economy or a further slowdown in global trade would also weigh on euro area growth.",
        "Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East were key sources of geopolitical risk.",
        "This could result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future.",
        "Conversely, growth could be higher if rising real incomes led to spending increasing by more than anticipated or the world economy grew more strongly than expected.",
        "With regard to price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "They underlined that the recent decline in inflation was good news, as it suggested a faster than anticipated disinflationary process.",
        "The decline was not just driven by the fading out of the energy shocks but was broad-based and also reflected developments in core components.",
        "In the short run, however, inflation was expected to pick up again in the coming months, mainly owing to energy-related base effects.",
        "Inflation numbers also remained affected by the unwinding of past shocks to the food and non-energy industrial goods components, as well as by the reversal of fiscal measures, which made it harder to discern an underlying trend.",
        "The latest inflation numbers were therefore to be treated with caution, and it was too early to be fully confident that inflation would return to target.",
        "More data were needed to confirm the decline, in particular data on wage growth, which were only expected in the spring of next year.",
        "In this context, it was also highlighted that market-based measures of inflation expectations had only started to decline significantly after inflation data had come in lower than expected.",
        "This underscored the importance of inflation outturns over the coming months as drivers of inflation expectations, particularly given that household expectations had remained sticky.",
        "At the same time, measures of inflation momentum – namely seasonally adjusted three-month-on-three-month growth rates – suggested that both headline and core inflation had essentially been back at target in November.",
        "While such measures were volatile, it was argued that these were often better predictors of future inflation than annual growth rates.",
        "However, it was also pointed out that price adjustments were typically more frequent at the start of the year and therefore at the end of the year the signals from such measures on future inflation had to be interpreted with particular caution, in part owing to statistical difficulties with seasonal adjustments in the present conditions.",
        "More broadly, it was pointed out that the envisaged decline in inflation also interacted with the strength of economic activity, which in turn determined the scale and speed at which price-setters were able to pass on their costs to final prices.",
        "On the one hand, as the outlook for economic activity in the staff projections seemed too optimistic, it was argued that the strength of disinflation was likely to be underestimated.",
        "This concern seemed to be confirmed by recent market expectations, which embodied a notably lower inflation path than the staff projections – for 2024 in particular.",
        "On the other hand, scepticism was expressed about whether the recent downward trend in inflation would be confirmed in the coming quarters, particularly as fiscal policy would probably remain loose for some time and a tight labour market would keep pushing up wages and, indirectly, services inflation.",
        "Moreover, renewed stronger price increases for energy and food could not be ruled out.",
        "Turning to wage developments, members recalled that the wage outlook was key in understanding medium-term inflation pressures.",
        "Labour remained scarce and wage growth was still strong, with compensation per employee growing at an elevated rate and only limited signals of stabilisation coming from negotiated wages and the ECB wage trackers.",
        "Coupled with falling productivity growth, unit labour costs had been growing at a record pace of 6.6% in the third quarter, which was contributing to persistence in domestic inflation at levels not consistent with medium-term price stability.",
        "This called for remaining vigilant.",
        "Moreover, the projected strong pick-up in productivity growth might not materialise if part of its decline proved to be structural or if labour hoarding persisted for longer.",
        "It would therefore be important to monitor future rounds of wage negotiations.",
        "As negotiations on many wage agreements would only be concluded early next year, members did not expect substantial hard evidence corroborating the projected moderation of wage growth to be available before the middle of the year.",
        "While stronger wage growth therefore constituted an upward risk to the staff inflation projections, it was also acknowledged that the recently observed – and projected – further drop in inflation should lead to lower wage demands.",
        "If inflation continued to be particularly low, this might also make second-round effects less likely.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that lower inflation was so far not fully reflected in the perceptions of firms and the general public, so it should not be taken for granted that lower inflation figures would immediately translate into lower wage demands.",
        "One of the reasons why domestic inflation had started to stabilise recently, in spite of the continued rapid increase in wages, might be that firms were moderating their markups.",
        "While already embedded in previous staff projections, an important assumption in the December projections had been a declining contribution from unit profits to the GDP deflator measure of inflation.",
        "This underpinned the convergence of medium-term inflation trends back towards the target.",
        "The significant downward adjustment in the contribution of unit profits seen in the latest national accounts data for the third quarter had lent support to these expectations.",
        "It appeared consistent with the return of unit profits to their previous trend, as assumed in the projections.",
        "This return to trend was partly of a cyclical nature, but it could well proceed more or less quickly than currently projected, which underlined the particularly high uncertainty surrounding this component of the ongoing and projected disinflation.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, members took note of the assessments by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane of the latest developments in market-based measures of inflation compensation and survey-based indicators.",
        "Market-based inflation expectations remained broadly anchored at 2% and had come down recently, reflecting the market view that inflation would fall rapidly and stabilise at 2%.",
        "At the same time, professional forecasters continued to be more cautious.",
        "It was also underlined that the inflation expectations of households and firms remained sticky and well above the ECB’s target.",
        "More broadly, it was felt that the exceptionally large gap that had formed between the interest rate path derived from financial market prices and the interest rate assumptions embodied in the staff projections pointed to upside risks to the inflation path projected by staff.",
        "However, it was hard to establish to what extent the equally substantial fall in the price of energy since the cut-off date for the projections would provide further downward impetus to inflation in the months to come.",
        "Against this background, members highlighted a number of risks to the medium-term inflation outlook, going in both directions.",
        "Upside risks to inflation included the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy prices higher in the near term, and extreme weather events, which could drive up food prices.",
        "Inflation could also turn out higher than anticipated if inflation expectations were to move above the target, or if wages or profit margins increased by more than expected.",
        "By contrast, inflation could surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampened demand by more than expected or the economic environment in the rest of the world worsened unexpectedly, potentially owing in part to the recent rise in geopolitical risks.",
        "Overall, risks were mostly seen as broadly balanced, with some members assessing risks as pointing to the upside and other members judging them as having shifted to the downside, consistent with prevailing downside risks to economic activity.",
        "In this context, members debated the notion of the “last mile” in the disinflation trajectory being the hardest to cover.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that the notion was a useful way to summarise the challenges facing the Governing Council in determining the persistence of inflation pressures and the required duration of monetary policy restriction.",
        "From the beginning, it had been understood that bringing inflation all the way down from levels exceeding 10% to 2% would hardly be possible without incurring side effects, such as lower employment and lower output.",
        "Surprisingly, so far, progress on the inflation front was advancing at a relatively mild cost in terms of economic activity, with the prospect of a soft landing remaining in place.",
        "Therefore, with services inflation still running at 4% and continued strong wage growth, a potentially challenging “last mile” was still looming.",
        "In this respect, it was reiterated that the staff projections were predicated on a moderation of wage growth, a buffering of wage growth by lower unit profits and a sustained rebound in productivity growth helping to bring down the growth rate of unit labour costs.",
        "Further progress in disinflation thus rested on a number of benign assumptions and on inflation expectations remaining well anchored.",
        "In addition, potential rigidities in prices and wages – stemming for example from backward-looking features of wage negotiations – and the impact of structural shocks on the economy and inflation dynamics could well contribute to “last mile”-type delays in disinflation.",
        "There was also a risk of new shocks, such as further energy or food price shocks, and effects of climate change on food prices, as well as climate-related measures such as higher carbon taxes, which could render inflation more persistent and more easily unanchor inflation expectations after a long period of above-target inflation.",
        "On the other hand, the view was expressed that the notion of a difficult “last mile” might undermine confidence in the ECB’s inflation target being achieved in a timely manner.",
        "More fundamentally, it was not clear why the nature of the disinflationary process would change as the target drew closer.",
        "Looking at the annual inflation data for the last few years, it appeared that disinflation to date had actually been faster than the previous surge in inflation, questioning the empirical relevance of the “last mile” narrative.",
        "It was argued that inflation depended on the state of the economy and on monetary policy.",
        "With a weaker economy, tighter monetary policy and the world economy losing momentum, it should not be surprising to see inflation falling rapidly.",
        "Finally, it was argued that the main condition that would make inflation more persistent in the proximity of the inflation target was if inflation expectations became unanchored, which ultimately depended on the credibility of monetary policy.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The most significant development since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting had been the marked fall in market interest rates, which had intensified following the FOMC’s policy decisions and press conference on 13 December, as evident in the update on market developments provided by Ms Schnabel.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation expectations had also declined considerably across horizons, to approach 2%, reflecting the view of market participants that inflation would fall rapidly and stabilise at that level.",
        "Nevertheless, real interest rates had fallen significantly beyond the near term because nominal interest rates had dropped by more than the corresponding inflation expectations embedded in market prices.",
        "Overall, the decline in market interest rates and the rise in risk asset prices had led to looser financial conditions according to most measures.",
        "However, the recent appreciation of the euro was going in the opposite direction.",
        "Members generally agreed that this repricing in financial markets could, at least partially, be attributed to recent good news on the broad-based slowdown in inflation in the euro area and other major advanced economies.",
        "However, it was widely felt that market expectations reflected significant optimism and were inconsistent with the outlook in the staff projections, with respect to both the inflation outlook and the rate path embodied in the technical assumptions.",
        "Reflecting the forward curve at the time of the cut-off date, the projections had incorporated only about 75 basis points of rate cuts for 2024.",
        "In addition, it was recalled that analysts, including those participating in the Survey of Monetary Analysts, remained much more cautious.",
        "It was also recalled that market expectations were volatile.",
        "Market perceptions and narratives had shifted dramatically since the Governing Council’s last monetary policy meeting, more than reversing the earlier move which, between September and October, had pushed rates higher on the back of a high-for-longer narrative.",
        "This suggested that there might well be another reversal in sentiment over the coming months.",
        "Concern was expressed that the sharp market repricing threatened to loosen financial conditions excessively, which could derail the disinflationary process.",
        "Against this background, it was widely regarded as important not to accommodate market expectations in the post-meeting communication.",
        "Overall, some humility was advised with respect to judging market expectations given prevailing uncertainties, including the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for growth and inflation.",
        "It was also noted that, if and when inflation fell further, the current level of interest rates would become increasingly tight over time.",
        "Members agreed that, thus far, monetary policy had continued to be transmitted strongly into broader financing conditions.",
        "The average interest rates for business loans and mortgages had risen again in October.",
        "Higher borrowing rates, subdued loan demand and tighter loan supply had further weakened credit dynamics.",
        "With weaker lending and the reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet, broad money – as measured by annual growth in M3 – had continued to contract for the fourth consecutive month and M1 growth had remained negative for the tenth consecutive month.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that the recent financial market repricing had already started to translate into lower interest rates on new mortgage lending and that, in some jurisdictions with a greater prevalence of floating rate mortgages, the average rate on the outstanding stock of housing loans could start to decline within the coming quarter.",
        "The overall transmission of monetary policy to loan growth remained very strong.",
        "The annual growth rate of bank loans to non-financial corporations had fallen into negative territory for the first time since July 2015 and growth in loans to households also remained subdued.",
        "It was contended that there were signs of “over-tightening” in the banking sector, reflecting the dual effect of higher policy rates and lower deposits amid a declining supply of liquidity, although it was also argued that there was no serious risk in the present environment in which excess liquidity was still abundant.",
        "Furthermore, it was recalled that the decline in liquidity in the system had had a limited impact and banks had continued to repay the TLTROs voluntarily.",
        "The Governing Council held its biannual structured exchange on the links between monetary policy and financial stability.",
        "Members concurred that euro area banks had demonstrated their resilience, had high capital ratios and had become significantly more profitable over the past year.",
        "However, the situation could worsen if banks’ funding costs or credit risk were to increase by more than expected, but these risks were assessed to be contained if the market reaction to such scenarios were orderly.",
        "It was reiterated that macroprudential policy remained the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities, and that the measures in place contributed to preserving the resilience of the financial system.",
        "Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members highlighted that, if maintained for a sufficiently long duration, the current monetary policy stance was sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back to target in a timely manner.",
        "Based on the interest rates embedded in the staff projections – which lay above market interest rates – the projections suggested that the rate path was in line with reaching the inflation target in the second half of 2025.",
        "Against this background, members assessed the data that had become available since the last monetary policy meeting in accordance with the three main elements of the “reaction function” that the Governing Council had communicated earlier in 2023.",
        "These comprised the implications of the incoming economic and financial data for the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Overall, the view was held that all three elements of the reaction function were moving in the right direction, providing clear evidence that monetary policy was working as intended.",
        "Starting with the inflation outlook, members broadly concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Overall, the process of disinflation seemed to be proceeding well and probably more strongly than had been anticipated, with the November flash estimates coming in significantly lower than expected.",
        "The fall in inflation was encouraging and had been broad-based, spanning all main components, including core items.",
        "This was indicative of weak demand and reflected the impact of monetary policy as well as diminishing effects from other factors that had been pushing inflation up.",
        "It gave grounds for increased confidence that inflation would be brought back to target in a timely manner.",
        "But it was highlighted that inflation would likely pick up in the very near term on account of an upward base effect for the cost of energy and would decline only slowly in the course of 2024.",
        "Furthermore, projected inflation for 2025 was largely unchanged in the December projections from the September round and remained slightly above target, especially for core inflation.",
        "However, it was noted that services inflation had started to ease and that, more generally, inflationary pressures were receding in all components.",
        "This was indicative of weak demand, affected in part by monetary policy.",
        "It was underlined that future wage dynamics remained highly uncertain, with many new agreements to be negotiated early in 2024.",
        "Convincing evidence of a sustained turnaround in wages had yet to emerge, and this was necessary for sufficient confidence to be gained that inflation would continue to fall back to the ECB’s 2% target.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that quarter-on-quarter inflation rates had plunged over the past year and the new Eurosystem staff projections contained a large downward revision in inflation for 2024.",
        "Moreover, there were some signs of wage growth stabilising or coming down, and it was argued that wages were a lagging indicator.",
        "However, it was stressed that the projection for 2025 had been broadly unchanged in the December round, and core inflation remained above 2% at that horizon.",
        "Upside risks to inflation from the outlook for fiscal policy, including higher carbon taxes, and for energy and food prices were also seen as elevated, as were the prevailing geopolitical risks.",
        "If such upside risks to inflation materialised or clearer adverse structural changes were to emerge, inflation pressures might become more persistent.",
        "Members agreed that indicators of underlying inflation appeared to have passed their peak and continued to decline.",
        "However, the dynamics of underlying inflation remained strong from a historical perspective, including when looking at the measures adjusted for energy shocks and supply bottlenecks.",
        "In particular, domestic inflation remained elevated and was edging lower at a slow pace, with sticky wage growth and services inflation in particular reflecting the still strong labour market.",
        "It was also pointed out that base effects and fiscal measures made it more challenging to ascertain the true dynamics of underlying inflation.",
        "Turning to the assessment of monetary policy transmission, members generally agreed that transmission was proceeding strongly and helping to dampen inflationary pressures for both goods and services.",
        "Moreover, it was argued that a significant part of the interest rate pass-through was still pending, with the overall peak impact on activity seen in early 2024 and the bulk of the impact on inflation still expected over the next two years.",
        "The view was expressed that transmission to financing conditions and lending activity was working more strongly than initially expected and non-linearities or financial amplification could be at work.",
        "Such effects were typically not included in standard models and the projection baseline and could bolster the strength of transmission to economic activity and prices.",
        "Reference was made to the wide range of estimates for the impact of monetary policy normalisation since December 2021, with large differences as to the extent and persistence of the effects depending on the various models used for policy analysis and in the projections as well as on different underlying assumptions.",
        "In this context, the argument was made that the observed disinflation did not validate the notion that the surge in inflation had been transitory but rather supported the view that decisive policy action by the ECB had been instrumental in achieving this outcome.",
        "Looking ahead, it was also emphasised, however, that further transmission was still in the pipeline and that firms’ cash buffers and households’ excess savings, which had to some extent limited the impact of monetary policy on aggregate demand, could decline alongside the contraction of the Eurosystem balance sheet.",
        "This was seen as suggesting that the impact of tight financing conditions might be stronger than expected in the coming quarters.",
        "However, it was argued that there was limited evidence of the effects of policy tightening having strengthened, since economic activity was developing broadly according to expectations, the labour market remained tight and downward adjustments in inflation expectations appeared to follow downward inflation surprises more than weakness in the economy.",
        "All in all, on the basis of the December Eurosystem staff projections, members expressed increased confidence that inflation would be brought back towards the 2% target in 2025, although there were different views as to whether there were grounds for sufficient confidence that the target would be reached in a timely manner.",
        "Hence a need was seen for continued vigilance and patience, and for the maintenance of a restrictive stance for some time.",
        "It was stressed that there was no room for complacency and that it was not the time for the Governing Council to lower its guard.",
        "Caution was warranted, as inflation would probably pick up in the near term and there were continued uncertainties in relation to wages and underlying inflation dynamics.",
        "This suggested that it was still too early to be confident that the task had been accomplished.",
        "Against this background, all members agreed with the proposal by Mr Lane to maintain the three key ECB interest rates at their current level.",
        "All three elements of the Governing Council’s reaction function were considered to support the case for this decision.",
        "Confidence was expressed that the monetary policy stance continued to be sufficiently restrictive, which gave the Governing Council the opportunity to hold rates at current levels and take time to assess the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Restating the Governing Council’s data-dependent approach was seen to be important, with a focus on the three elements of the reaction function, which provided a structured approach to monetary policy decision-making and communication.",
        "This also was seen as an integral part of the Governing Council’s meeting-by-meeting orientation and offered the necessary flexibility.",
        "Turning to the policies affecting the size and composition of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, a very large majority of members agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to advance the normalisation of the balance sheet at a measured and predictable pace.",
        "This was viewed as a proportionate response in view of the initial objectives of the PEPP, which was an instrument designed to counter the serious risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the outlook for the euro area posed by the pandemic.",
        "As the pandemic, or at least its emergency dimension, was over, maintaining full reinvestments was no longer appropriate.",
        "In addition, markets were currently functioning smoothly and fragmentation concerns were limited.",
        "This meant that the risks from ending full reinvestments were contained, especially since moving to partial reinvestments still allowed flexible reinvestments if necessary.",
        "Hence it was an opportune time to take this decision, which would be another logical step in the normalisation of the Eurosystem balance sheet.",
        "The proposal was also broadly in line with market expectations, so it would not surprise market participants.",
        "Moreover, the approach would allow a smooth adjustment, in particular since redemptions in the PEPP portfolio were very small relative to other sources of balance sheet shrinkage in 2024.",
        "At the same time, it was seen as crucial that any decision to end full reinvestments earlier than originally planned should be fully delinked from monetary policy stance decisions relating to level of the policy interest rates.",
        "This meant it was important to stress that interest rate decisions were the main instrument of the Governing Council’s monetary policy.",
        "While some members favoured an earlier end to full reinvestments than had been proposed, suggesting that tapering could start earlier and be more gradual, other members argued that full reinvestments should continue until the end of 2024.",
        "In this context, it was argued that the difference between starting tapering or ending reinvestments a couple of quarters sooner or later would not affect the proportionality assessment.",
        "Members unanimously agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the PEPP portfolio.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting."

    "2023": [
        "Ms Schnabel noted that, since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 26-27 July 2023, investors’ growth outlook for the euro area and for the United States had continued to diverge, widening the gap in both nominal and real yields between the two economies and driving the euro lower against the dollar.",
        "Despite the expected deceleration in the euro area’s growth momentum, market expectations for inflation in the medium and longer term had edged up further.",
        "Torn between the perception of a weakening euro area economy and stubborn inflation, expectations for the peak deposit facility rate and the shape of the forward rate curve had remained broadly unchanged.",
        "Long-term sovereign yields had risen across major advanced economies, but the increase had been more muted in economies where there had been negative macroeconomic surprises, such as in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the impact of these developments on exchange rate markets, the euro had depreciated markedly against the US dollar but only slightly in nominal effective terms, on account of the widespread weakness of other currencies.",
        "A decomposition of nominal one-year yields in the euro area and the United States into real rates and the inflation component showed that the difference in the macroeconomic outlook had been reflected in a stark divergence of real rates across the two economies.",
        "Investors priced future one-year euro area real rates lower over the next four years, while the strength of the US economy had pushed investor expectations of future one-year US real rates significantly higher.",
        "At the same time, despite the weakening cyclical outlook, euro investors had increased the inflation compensation they demanded over the near and medium-term horizons.",
        "Rising inflation-linked swap (ILS) rates partly reflected an upward revision of investors’ core inflation expectations.",
        "Market-implied pricing of euro area genuine synthetic core inflation expectations – that is synthetic core expectations adjusted for risk premia – suggested that market participants had revised up their core inflation expectations from May 2023.",
        "Market-based measures of longer-term headline inflation compensation in the euro area had also continued to edge higher.",
        "While the continued rise in inflation risk premia accounted for most of the increase in inflation compensation, genuine long-term inflation expectations had also shown a small uptick.",
        "With weakening domestic economic activity and sticky inflation, monetary policy rate expectations in the euro area had remained by and large unchanged since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "Respondents to the ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts continued to expect a peak deposit facility rate of 4%, to be reached only in October 2023.",
        "For September 2023, respondents were almost evenly split, with a slight majority of 53% expecting a pause and 47% expecting another interest rate hike.",
        "The overall amount of rate-cutting priced in from the peak over the course of 2024 was only slightly higher than that expected at the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "The weakening economic developments had hence not prompted investors to expect a quicker reversal of monetary policy.",
        "Instead, investors remained positioned for policy rates to stay at peak levels for an extended period of time.",
        "In other words, the shape of the forward curve suggested market participants did not seem to expect a severe recession, which was consistent with the resilience of most risk assets during the current tightening cycle.",
        "Sovereign bond spreads had largely withstood the downward revision of the near-term growth momentum and had widened only slightly since the previous meeting.",
        "Greek sovereign bonds had outperformed on the back of expected and materialising rating upgrades.",
        "Corporate bond spreads had also ticked up but remained below 2022 levels.",
        "In contrast, euro area equity prices had generally declined since the Governing Council’s July meeting, driven, to a significant degree, by a decompression of risk premia over recent weeks.",
        "Still, stock prices had been very resilient since the beginning of the tightening cycle, with diverging drivers for non-financial and financial firms.",
        "While the shares of non-financial corporations had benefited mostly from a compression of risk premia consistent with improving investor risk sentiment, as well as from dividend pay-outs and share buybacks, their longer-term earnings expectations and higher interest rates had had a dampening effect.",
        "For financial firms, stock prices had benefited from higher earnings expectations, as well as from strong dividend pay-outs and share buybacks.",
        "The general resilience of risk assets had been supported by the gradual decline in volatility, on the back of perceptions that the global tightening cycle might be nearing its end.",
        "A second explanation for the resilience of risk assets could be that markets were pricing in an increasing probability that the pass-through from tighter financial conditions to growth could be nearing its peak.",
        "Financial conditions had tightened sharply in 2022 but had since tightened only moderately.",
        "Considering standard lags in the transmission of financial conditions to economic activity, this would suggest that the drag on growth from the tighter conditions was currently likely to be large but could start receding relatively soon.",
        "A third explanation of the resilience in risk assets was related to the less pronounced tightening of long-term rates.",
        "Nominal longer-term yields had hovered around 3% since October 2022, suggesting that there had been hardly any tightening impulse from the longer end of the curve for almost a year, with term premia remaining compressed.",
        "Euro area real rates had also remained by and large unchanged since December 2022 and stood visibly below the peak reached in October 2022.",
        "Developments in commodity markets since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting illustrated the upside risks to inflation.",
        "Oil prices, at USD 91 per barrel, had reached their highest level in ten months after OPEC+ producers agreed to extend their supply cuts for the rest of the year.",
        "European gas prices had also increased markedly since the July meeting and had shown increased sensitivity to supply outages.",
        "Finally, upside risks to inflation could also emanate from food prices, which could react with a lag to this year’s extreme weather events caused by climate change and amplified by El Niño.",
        "In money markets, non-monetary policy deposits had continued to decline since the 26-27 July meeting.",
        "Secured money market rates had been broadly unchanged amid limited volatility, suggesting that there was no downward pressure in repo markets from scarcity concerns.",
        "Three-month asset swap spreads had narrowed notably since May 2023, as collateral scarcity concerns had receded amid increasing sovereign debt issuance and more balanced positioning.",
        "The unsecured money market had also been broadly stable after the change to the remuneration of minimum reserves.",
        "Mr Lane then went through the latest economic, monetary and financial developments in the global economy and the euro area.",
        "The present meeting offered the opportunity to take stock of what had been learnt over the summer.",
        "Starting with the international environment, global growth had been supported by services during spring 2023.",
        "Its momentum had then started to soften in the second quarter, owing to a growth slowdown in both China, which had slipped back after its post-pandemic reopening, and Japan.",
        "Global economic activity had slowed further in the third quarter, but this did not result in a huge slump.",
        "It had rather fallen back towards its long-term average.",
        "However, the importance of global activity for the euro area was primarily through trade, and global trade in goods had seen a protracted period of decline owing to the ongoing rotation from goods to services, which were less trade-intensive.",
        "Turning to the euro area economic outlook, Mr Lane recalled that in August the flash estimate for annual Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) inflation had remained unchanged at its July level of 5.3%.",
        "The decline in inflation had been interrupted owing to the recent jump in energy prices, as the annual inflation rate for energy had risen to -3.3% in August from -6.1% in July.",
        "The upward shift in energy price expectations would affect the dynamics of headline inflation in the coming months.",
        "Food price inflation had come down from its peak of 15.5% in March but had still been almost 10% in August.",
        "Annual inflation excluding energy and food had fallen to 5.3% in August from 5.5% in July.",
        "The non-energy industrial goods inflation rate had declined to 4.8%, since past energy price surges were receding and supply bottlenecks were being resolved.",
        "Services inflation had edged down to 5.5% but remained elevated in August, owing to still strong dynamics in tourist-related services and wage pressures.",
        "Overall, the moderation in core inflation was in line with a continued softening in underlying inflation, which reflected the fading impact of previous supply side shocks, a fall in demand-supply mismatches and the gradual pass-through of energy price disinflation.",
        "In the coming months, the sharp price increases recorded in the autumn of 2022 would drop out of the yearly rates, thus pulling inflation down.",
        "The momentum of HICP inflation, measured as the annualised rate of the three-month-over-three-month change in the HICP, had been around 3% in August 2023.",
        "In other words, the 5.3% outcome was largely the legacy of carry-over effects.",
        "This 3% momentum had been helped by still negative momentum for energy inflation.",
        "For food inflation, the momentum had been 4%, significantly lower than the annual rate of inflation of around 10%.",
        "For the core components, it was possible to observe a significant drop in the momentum of goods inflation during 2023 but a much smaller decline in the momentum of services inflation.",
        "Most indicators of underlying inflation continued to fall, reflecting the fading impact of previous shocks and supply bottlenecks.",
        "measures of underlying inflation corrected for past supply shocks, also showed a further, small decline in recent months.",
        "While, overall, not all the measures of underlying inflation showed a further, substantial downward adjustment, those that were the best predictors of future inflation were at the lower range of all the measures and continued to decline considerably, with the exception of domestic inflation.",
        "The analysis of pipeline pressures showed a continued downward adjustment upstream in the production chain for both food and goods inflation.",
        "It remained the case that the reduction in consumer food inflation had been minor compared with the evolution of the producer price index.",
        "The downward pressures from producer prices were expected to start kicking in more substantially as of autumn.",
        "However, climate change events and the succession of natural disasters were increasing the risks of price increases in food commodities, feeding into risks of higher food inflation.",
        "For goods, the significant downward correction in pipeline pressures, in particular in import prices for intermediate and non-food consumer goods, was also expected to exert further downward pressure on HICP goods inflation in the coming months.",
        "Services inflation had remained persistently high, largely reflecting the effects of past energy shocks and the post-pandemic reopening.",
        "Inflation in the contact-intensive and energy-sensitive categories was still making the largest contribution to total services inflation and had not yet shown signs of a turnaround, with annual price changes remaining around 8%.",
        "By contrast, inflation in the non-contact-intensive services categories was significantly lower.",
        "In line with projections from previous rounds, wage pressures had remained elevated in the second quarter of the year.",
        "With some decline in the accumulated real wage loss and lower inflation, wage growth should decelerate over time.",
        "Mr Lane noted that there was a seasonal pattern in wages, as most contracts were renewed at the start of the year.",
        "In other words, the compensation per employee data for the first quarter of 2024 would give an important signal as to whether or not the euro area was on a disinflationary wage path.",
        "Until then, it was likely that any additional data would provide little information on the expected path of wages, with uncertainty expected to remain large for some time.",
        "The contribution of unit profits to annual inflation, as defined by the GDP deflator, in the first half of 2023, had moderated relative to its contribution in 2022, suggesting that the rising wage pressures were starting to be absorbed by firms.",
        "Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stood at around 2%, although some indicators had increased and needed to be monitored closely.",
        "The September ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area saw headline inflation higher than previously expected for 2023 and 2024, driven by higher energy prices, but lower for 2025 owing to the appreciation of the euro, tighter financing conditions and greater economic slack.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to decrease from 8.4% in 2022 to an average of 5.6% for 2023, 3.2% for 2024 and 2.1% for 2025.",
        "At the same time, staff had revised down their projections for inflation excluding energy and food for 2024 and 2025, in line with the weaker growth prospects and the appreciation of the euro over the last year.",
        "They now saw it reaching 5.1% in 2023, before falling to 2.9% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025.",
        "After the cut-off date, part of the appreciation of the euro embedded in the September projections had reversed.",
        "However, the past appreciation was still feeding through into the euro area economy owing to its lagged impact.",
        "Focusing on the fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter percentage changes, which allowed the impact of carry-over effects to be cleaned from the data, it was possible to see that the HICP was only revised upwards in the fourth quarter of 2023.",
        "HICP inflation was projected to be 0.4 percentage points higher in the fourth quarter of 2023 than in the fourth quarter of 2024, and no extra inflation momentum was expected in 2024.",
        "Upside risks to inflation included potential renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food.",
        "Adverse weather conditions, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could push food prices up by more than expected.",
        "A lasting rise in inflation expectations above the 2% target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term.",
        "By contrast, weaker demand – for example owing to a stronger transmission of monetary policy or a worsening of the economic environment outside the euro area – would lead to lower price pressures, especially over the medium term.",
        "Euro area economic growth had broadly stagnated over the first half of 2023, while the composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had fallen in August – at the fastest rate in nearly three years – to a level of 46.7.",
        "Manufacturing output was set to remain weak in view of the further moderation in export demand and tight financing conditions, while the past support from order backlogs was declining.",
        "Services had so far contributed positively to growth owing to higher demand in contact-intensive categories, but there had been clear signs of a slowdown since June.",
        "The worsening of survey indicators had led to a reassessment of the GDP outlook for the second half of 2023.",
        "According to the September staff projections, real GDP was expected to stagnate in the third quarter of 2023 and to increase by 0.1% in the fourth quarter.",
        "As regards domestic demand, private consumption had stagnated, while housing investment had contracted in the second quarter, having been on a declining path for most of the past year.",
        "Residential building permits, a leading indicator of housing investment, had also fallen in the second quarter and firms’ assessment of their order books had become more downbeat for the third quarter, pointing to a further contraction in housing investment in the period ahead.",
        "Higher interest rates had already had a visible impact on this demand component.",
        "Business investment growth excluding volatile Irish intellectual property products had moderated significantly in the second quarter, and survey indicators from the European Commission and the PMI for capital goods output were indicating a decline in the second half of the year.",
        "In the near term, private consumption was expected to remain weak, while housing investment and business investment were expected to decline, driven in part by the monetary policy tightening.",
        "Over time, economic momentum was expected to pick up, as real incomes were expected to rise, supported by falling inflation, rising wages and a strong labour market, and this would underpin consumer spending.",
        "However, activity levels would be dampened as the monetary policy tightening and adverse credit supply conditions increasingly fed through to the real economy.",
        "The expected gradual withdrawal of fiscal support was also likely to weigh on economic growth in the coming quarters.",
        "The labour market had so far remained resilient in the face of the slowing economy but showed signs of losing momentum.",
        "The unemployment rate had stayed at its historical low of 6.4% in July.",
        "While employment had grown by 0.2% in the second quarter, the latest survey data suggested that it had come close to stalling.",
        "The strong demand for labour had also started to moderate, with indicators of job vacancy rates edging down over recent months.",
        "The growth of the labour force, which had been the main source of employment growth, had slowed in the past few months.",
        "Owing to the weaker economic activity, the September projections embedded a lower increase in employment and an increase in unemployment over the projection horizon, which had still been expected to decline further in the June projections.",
        "Recent PMI indicators confirmed the slowing of momentum in employment growth, which was particularly notable in the services sectors.",
        "Turning to the fiscal outlook, the September projections incorporated relatively limited changes, with fiscal projections highly uncertain as governments had yet to decide on budgets for next year.",
        "Still, on the basis of governments’ intentions, the fiscal projections implied a significant improvement from 2023 to 2024 in the cyclically adjusted primary balance.",
        "In the September staff projections annual average real GDP growth was projected at 0.7% for 2023 (down from 3.4% in 2022), 1.0% for 2024 and 1.5% for 2025.",
        "In particular, the September staff projections embedded a significant downward revision in both housing and business investment for 2024 and 2025, in view of the tighter financing conditions and credit supply effects.",
        "Economic growth could be slower if the effects of monetary policy were more forceful than expected, or if the world economy weakened, for instance owing to a further slowdown in China.",
        "Conversely, growth could be higher than projected if the strong labour market, rising real incomes and receding uncertainty meant that people and businesses became more confident and spent more.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, euro area banks had remained well capitalised over the second quarter of 2023 and had recorded good net interest income and moderate provisioning costs.",
        "The improvement in capital/asset ratios was on account of lower total assets, the latter driven by weakening loan dynamics and shrinking liquidity.",
        "Bank funding costs continued to increase, mainly on account of higher deposit and money market rates.",
        "The gradual shift of funds away from overnight deposits and towards time deposits was exerting further upward pressure on funding costs.",
        "The ECB’s interest rate hikes had increased the attractiveness of longer-term deposits relative to overnight deposits.",
        "At the same time, the reduction in central bank funding was leading banks to increasingly rely on debt security issuance.",
        "The monetary policy tightening continued to be transmitted strongly to financing conditions and was increasingly affecting the broader economy.",
        "For new business, lending rates had increased and credit volumes had contracted further.",
        "For firms, the cost of bank borrowing had continued to increase steeply, reaching 4.9% in July, the highest level since 2008.",
        "For households, the composite mortgage rate remained on an upward trajectory and had exceeded 3.7% in July, the highest level since early 2012.",
        "The credit supply channel remained active.",
        "The latest bank lending survey pointed to differences in transmission across corporate sectors, with real estate and construction firms experiencing a more substantial tightening of credit standards and weakening of demand than manufacturing and services firms.",
        "Lending to firms and households had remained weak in June and July amid a further tightening of credit standards and higher bank funding costs.",
        "July had seen a negative flow of €7 billion in loans to households, which was the lowest on record.",
        "Substantial monetary policy tightening was still expected to be passed through to bank rates in the coming months, as more fixed rate loans would expire and banks would face rising funding costs as more savers migrated to term deposits and higher-yielding bank bonds.",
        "In line with the decrease in credit creation, the annual growth rate of M3 had turned negative in July (-0.4%) for the first time since 2010 and was expected to decline further in the coming months.",
        "On the basis of the assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission, Mr Lane proposed that the Governing Council raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, in order to reinforce progress towards the 2% medium-term inflation target.",
        "The incoming data had largely validated the Governing Council’s previous assessment of the inflation outlook, while most measures of underlying inflation had started to ease.",
        "Furthermore, the evidence indicated that the transmission of monetary policy to broader financing conditions and the real economy was firmly taking hold.",
        "The economic slowdown since mid-2022 was set to continue in the near term, and the level of GDP at the end of the projection horizon would be considerably lower than previously expected.",
        "The resulting additional economic slack would further contribute to the disinflation process, while a significant portion of the tightening from past rate hikes was still in the pipeline.",
        "A range of model-based simulations suggested that a deposit facility rate in the region of 3.75% to 4.00%, so long as it was understood as being maintained for a sufficiently long duration, should be consistent with a return of inflation to target within the projection horizon.",
        "The views of external experts were also clustered in this interval, which also matched market pricing.",
        "In view of the uncertainty surrounding model-based simulations, expert surveys and market indicators, the choice between holding the deposit facility rate at 3.75% and moving to 4.00% was finely balanced.",
        "However, at the margin, it was safer to decide on an additional hike, given the highly uncertain environment and the significant disinflation that was still required to return to the inflation target in a timely manner.",
        "An additional hike would reinforce progress towards the target for two basic reasons.",
        "First, if the economy evolved in line with the staff baseline case, the decision to hike would bolster confidence that inflation would return to target within the projection horizon.",
        "Second, a higher interest rate would more strongly limit the amplification of any upside shocks to the inflation path.",
        "In consequence, a more secure pace of disinflation and greater insurance against upside risks would also reinforce the anchoring of inflation expectations, which remained a precondition for the disinflation process to keep up its pace.",
        "With this decision, the key policy rates would have been raised by a cumulative 450 basis points over the last ten meetings.",
        "On the basis of the current assessment, the Governing Council should consider that the key policy rates were in a range of levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, would make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target.",
        "The Governing Council’s future decisions would ensure that the key ECB interest rates would be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.",
        "At the same time, the high level of two-sided uncertainty around the baseline meant that the Governing Council should remain data-dependent in determining the appropriate level and duration of restrictiveness in its monetary stance.",
        "Finally, preserving the option to apply flexibility to pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) reinvestments as a first line of defence against fragmentation risks continued to be warranted.",
        "As regards the external environment, members took note of the downward revision of the ECB staff projection for euro area foreign demand, with negative economic surprises for China partly offset by positive surprises in the United States.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that the growth performance of the Chinese economy would likely have repercussions for global commodity prices and was thus a risk factor for the euro area inflation outlook.",
        "Attention was also drawn to continued high geopolitical risks, which implied an exceptional degree of uncertainty around the outlook for global economic activity and inflation, notably with respect to energy and food.",
        "Turning to commodity markets, oil prices had increased significantly following Saudi Arabia’s and Russia’s extension of their production cuts for the rest of the year.",
        "At the same time, different views were expressed as to how persistent the impact of these shocks would be.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that a real transformation was taking place in energy markets, as suppliers were trying to maximise their revenues through production cuts, in view of the global energy transition.",
        "This could put persistent upward pressure on energy prices for years to come.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that climate change could bring with it a series of new adverse supply-side shocks, with a much greater frequency of extreme weather events resulting in the destruction of harvests and agricultural land.",
        "This would likely affect mostly energy and food prices, which tended to be particularly salient for consumers, implying an outsized effect on households’ inflation expectations and, hence, wage negotiations.",
        "On the other hand, the view was expressed that the increase in oil prices, or at least part of the increase, might turn out to be temporary, for three reasons.",
        "First, the increase was due to a supply cut by Russia and Saudi Arabia, in an attempt to avoid a fall in revenues due to a possible weakening of global oil demand.",
        "Second, global trade in goods was decelerating, and the production of goods was more energy-intensive than the provision of services.",
        "Third, demand for oil was likely to weaken significantly in light of the deceleration of the Chinese economy.",
        "Moreover, the latest energy shock could also be seen as an aftershock following a larger disruption.",
        "It was clearly much smaller than the energy shock in 2021-22, which had very much been a reflection of two main issues: the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine.",
        "In this context, caution was expressed about developments in the European gas markets, where volatility had increased and price levels were higher and more vulnerable to upside moves than in other major economies.",
        "It was also recalled that in a context in which energy and food supply shocks were dominating, irrespective of their persistence, differentiating between price-level and inflation shocks was important.",
        "With regard to economic activity in the euro area, members concurred with Mr Lane that growth was likely to remain subdued in the coming months.",
        "It had broadly stagnated over the first half of the year, and recent indicators suggested it had also been weak or even contracted in the third quarter.",
        "Lower demand for the euro area’s exports and the impact of tight financing conditions were dampening activity, including through lower investment.",
        "The services sector, which had so far been resilient, was now also weakening.",
        "Over time, economic momentum should pick up, as real incomes were expected to rise – supported by falling inflation, rising wages and a strong labour market – and this would underpin consumer spending.",
        "The labour market had so far remained resilient despite the slowing economy.",
        "However, the services sector, which had been a major driver of employment growth since mid-2022, was now creating fewer jobs.",
        "Members widely acknowledged the weaker than expected growth prospects in the short term.",
        "Business sentiment indicators, namely the PMIs, were signalling a fragile economic outlook, with the slowdown in China and higher energy prices likely to exert downward pressure on economic activity.",
        "The weakening in activity implied that the economy was flirting with a recession.",
        "While soft indicators had become less reliable than in the past, the sheer size of their deterioration was such that the information content about the outlook was still significant.",
        "Hard data had also clearly been disappointing, even if they were assessed as being more resilient than the early estimates for the third quarter.",
        "Since the fourth quarter of 2022 quarterly GDP growth had essentially been flat.",
        "The preliminary indications for the third quarter of 2023 were that GDP growth would again be much lower than foreseen.",
        "Financial market expectations for growth were also deteriorating, as indicated by the negative slope of the yield curve.",
        "Weak incoming data were also the main reason why the ECB staff projections had been revised downwards.",
        "The size of the revision in the growth projections was seen as very significant, with a cumulative downward revision of close to 1% in the level of GDP at the end of the projection horizon.",
        "This was nearly as large as the downward revision in June 2022, when the estimated effect of Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine (-1.2%) was first incorporated into the projections.",
        "The latest revisions were mainly concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of 2023, as the projections for quarterly growth in 2024 and 2025 were basically the same as in the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Taking into account Eurostat’s downward revision, to 0.1%, of growth in the second quarter of 2023 – compared with the initial estimate of 0.3% included in the September ECB staff projections – would mechanically lead to lower growth for the current year.",
        "In addition, nowcasting models were suggesting a lower growth rate than contained in the baseline for the third quarter of the year, so the risks to growth in 2023 were seen as being on the downside.",
        "It was widely felt that, with hindsight, the June projections had been too optimistic about the strength of the economic recovery in 2023.",
        "Notably, it was maintained that the projections for consumption and investment seemed too optimistic at a time when the contribution of net trade to economic growth was close to zero.",
        "According to the PMIs, the contraction in manufacturing had spread to the services sector.",
        "This was noteworthy, as during the summer the services sector had appeared to be very buoyant as far as tourism was concerned, but it suggested that other parts of the services sector might now experience weaker activity.",
        "In addition, it was argued that stronger than expected monetary transmission could explain part of the downward revision to growth, as it seemed that the sectors that could be expected to be more affected by monetary policy were those that were indeed growing less.",
        "Looking ahead, optimism about a rebound in private consumption embodied in the baseline beyond 2023 might be questioned, given a prolonged deceleration in annual credit growth.",
        "The credit channel was seen as especially relevant for housing and business investment, where activity had been decelerating significantly over the past quarters and had indeed been revised down sharply over the projection horizon.",
        "The weakening outlook for investment incorporated into the projections was seen as worrying, given the need for public and private investment in Europe related to the green transition and digitalisation.",
        "However, it was also argued that the projected weakening in investment was largely explained by staff judgement on the effects of tighter credit supply conditions, the importance of which could be questioned.",
        "The adverse effects on investment from ever tighter monetary policy could also weigh on productivity growth and ultimately push up unit labour costs in a vicious circle.",
        "In addition, there was evidence that a large share of monetary tightening was still in the pipeline, and it was argued that this could compress demand more than was currently projected.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that most of the financial tightening had already happened in 2022, which could imply that the tightening impact could soon reach its peak.",
        "Overall, it was nevertheless felt that it remained reasonable to expect a gradual economic recovery to take hold, thanks to a recovery in people’s real incomes from rising wages and a strong labour market, and this would underpin consumer spending.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that the projected economic recovery was not inconsistent with a growing impact of monetary tightening next year, as this was still a recovery from essentially five quarters of near-zero growth.",
        "The question was also raised as to what extent the current economic slowdown was purely of a cyclical nature.",
        "There were signs that the trend in productivity had shifted downwards, which could, at least in part, be permanent.",
        "It was also conceivable that the higher level and volatility of energy prices might be permanently scarring parts of the economy.",
        "Distinguishing between energy-intensive and non-energy-intensive industries, the weakening in growth was mostly coming from the energy-intensive parts of the economy, which could point to underlying structural drivers.",
        "A structural slowdown of this nature would affect potential output and the assessment of economic slack, and ultimately have an upward impact on inflation.",
        "In this context, it was mentioned that, while the latest revisions to the outlook for activity and inflation could be labelled as stagflationary, labour market conditions were much more favourable than in the 1970s, when the term had been coined.",
        "Turning to the labour market, it was noted that the September projections now entailed a limited increase in the unemployment rate, in contrast to the continued decline that had still been embedded in the June projections, with labour markets nonetheless remaining relatively tight throughout the horizon.",
        "Looking at the sacrifice ratio, which measures the cost of reducing inflation in terms of output and employment, implicit in the projections, the cost of bringing down a significant inflation surge in the form of an increase in unemployment looked remarkably favourable.",
        "Overall, it seemed fair to say that the projections were still in line with a soft landing.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that current indicators and a benign outlook of a (nearly) “immaculate disinflation” should not lead to complacency about the strength of the labour market.",
        "The point was made that, during recessions, the decline in employment was typically achieved through a reduction in hiring, not through increased firing.",
        "The current slowdown in new hires should thus be seen as a negative signal, requiring further attention.",
        "Moreover, it was remarked that, while employment had remained strong so far, this was in part due to the continued presence of job retention schemes.",
        "These schemes made it convenient for firms to hold on to cheap and less productive labour.",
        "However, this would not last if economic activity failed to pick up, in which case firms would shift from labour hoarding to labour shedding.",
        "For the time being, the labour market was, overall, still seen as tight from a cyclical perspective.",
        "However, it was arguably also being affected by structural changes, such as a reduction in the average number of hours worked.",
        "As for the real estate market, it was highlighted that, following the tightening of monetary policy, the number of transactions had fallen significantly, while the adjustment in real estate prices had so far remained fairly muted.",
        "In this context it was pointed out that, in some countries, real estate transactions had already started to pick up again, presumably owing to reduced uncertainty about the future interest rate path.",
        "Indeed, while there had been a massive adjustment of mortgage rates earlier on, they had remained more or less stable at this higher level for quite some time, so households again felt confident in entering the housing market.",
        "Against this background, members assessed that the risks to economic growth were tilted to the downside.",
        "Growth could be slower if the effects of monetary policy were more forceful than expected or if the world economy weakened, for instance owing to a further slowdown in China.",
        "Conversely, growth could be higher than projected if the strong labour market, rising real incomes and receding uncertainty meant that people and businesses became more confident and spent more.",
        "With regard to price developments, members broadly concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Lane and underlined that, while headline inflation had declined, inflation was still expected to be too high for too long, with headline inflation for 2023 and 2024 in the September staff projections being revised upwards from the June projections.",
        "The first time inflation was foreseen to fall below 2% was only at the end of 2025, which was regarded as very late and appeared to be driven by a base effect for energy inflation.",
        "Moreover, the gradual disinflation path entailed in the September projections was seen as still being fragile and conditional on a number of benign assumptions, namely a turnaround in wage pressures, a compression of unit profits and a declining path for energy prices.",
        "It was also observed that a mechanical update to the projections to include the higher oil prices and weaker euro observed since the cut-off date suggested that headline inflation would no longer fall below the ECB’s target by the end of the horizon.",
        "In a context of recurrent underestimations of inflation over the past year, and despite a more clouded outlook for the real economy, there still appeared to be significant upward pressures on inflation.",
        "Especially in view of recent developments in the energy market, it was too early to consider the projected disinflation process as being entrenched.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, headline inflation had surprised to the upside in August, remaining at a still very high level.",
        "This had contributed to an upward revision in the September staff inflation projections, together with other factors such as less favourable energy price assumptions.",
        "Despite the weakening of the economy, the inflation data did not yet give sufficient comfort that inflation would return to target in a timely manner, with the “last kilometre” expected to be particularly challenging.",
        "At the same time, indicators of inflation momentum were much lower than annual inflation rates, for both headline and core inflation.",
        "However, it was pointed out that momentum for several inflation components had rebounded somewhat recently and remained well above the medium-term inflation target.",
        "It was argued that core inflation continued to be sticky and that the previous quick progress on headline inflation was increasingly fading as energy base effects vanished or even reversed.",
        "Turning to pipeline pressures, as reflected in the evolution of producer prices and input costs, including world food commodity prices, the picture of receding “upstream” price pressures remained broadly intact.",
        "However, it was pointed out that there was evidence of an asymmetry in the pass-through of rising and falling input costs to consumer prices.",
        "Reference was made to evidence from some countries which indicated that the share of firms that had lowered prices was increasing now that input costs were falling and this share – for the first time in the current inflation cycle – had exceeded the share of firms that were raising prices, indicating that the disinflation process was progressing.",
        "However, it was remarked that the share of firms lowering prices was – while growing – still falling far short of the share of firms that had increased prices when input costs had been going up.",
        "This asymmetry in the pass-through also had implications for the sacrifice ratio, i.e.",
        "that the Phillips curve would be flatter when inflation fell than when inflation was rising.",
        "The fact that prices were changing less frequently slowed down the pass-through of falling input costs.",
        "With regard to the impact of the latest energy price increase on inflation, it was generally felt that this was becoming harder to assess.",
        "On the one hand, the rebound in oil prices, in particular, could be a more permanent shock, and therefore could affect wages and prices more persistently.",
        "On the other hand, since demand was weak and monetary policy in restrictive territory, the overall effects of the energy shock on headline inflation would likely differ from recent experience and be transitory or less persistent.",
        "In a context of volatile inflation due to frequent food and energy supply shocks, the key question was to what extent those shocks would feed into the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In the short term, they would clearly raise inflation.",
        "However, as they weighed on real incomes they would also lead to more subdued demand and lower capacity utilisation, implying a disinflationary impact in the medium term.",
        "It was thus seen as crucial to distinguish between one-off shocks to the price level and the effect of such shocks translating into inflation dynamics with relevance for the medium term.",
        "It was also noted that there was particular uncertainty about the outlook for the fiscal stance in the coming year due to the uncertainties surrounding the European fiscal governance framework.",
        "Evidence from some countries suggested that fiscal deficits could well be larger than expected in the projection baseline, which would have implications for the inflation outlook.",
        "The latest developments in core inflation were described as encouraging.",
        "In the last few months core inflation had largely developed as projected.",
        "More broadly, most indicators of underlying inflation appeared to have peaked or were stabilising.",
        "However, this was not the case for the indicator of domestic inflation, which remained strong and was likely to reflect more persistent pressures on services prices, which had a high wage content.",
        "Members recalled that wage pressures were key in understanding medium-term inflation pressures.",
        "It was generally acknowledged that recent wage developments had remained in line with recent staff projections and that there were tentative signs of an imminent peak in wage pressures.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that there was no firm evidence of a turnaround in wage dynamics yet, and sufficient hard data on wage agreements and employee compensation would only emerge in the course of spring 2024.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that labour markets, and wage-setting in particular, very much relied on national institutional frameworks.",
        "In some countries, wage-setting had a very strong backward-looking component, for example through wage indexation or cost of living allowances.",
        "In other countries, the backward-looking component was much weaker, which would inevitably lead to wage differentials across countries.",
        "In the last two quarters there had been no significant projection errors for wages, which was very important because one of the main risks to inflation was that wage growth might be even higher or more persistent than incorporated in the projections.",
        "So far, wage data had broadly confirmed the indications obtained from forward-looking indicators such as the ECB wage trackers.",
        "It was also remarked that most recently unit profits appeared to have been lower than predicted.",
        "This was important because one of the main assumptions in the projection of a downward trajectory for inflation was that, over time, a lower contribution from unit profits to the GDP deflator would compensate for a recovery in real wages and robust growth in unit labour costs.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that recent increases in unit labour costs had been driven not only by higher wages but also by lower than expected labour productivity growth.",
        "On the one hand, the view was expressed that low labour productivity growth should largely be of a temporary nature, owing to labour hoarding.",
        "It was not surprising that labour productivity growth was low, given the ongoing economic slowdown and the procyclicality of labour productivity.",
        "But labour hoarding was necessarily a temporary phenomenon.",
        "If the economy remained weak, firms would start to shed jobs, which would lead to higher productivity, lower unit labour costs and lower inflationary pressures.",
        "If GDP growth were instead to accelerate, a cyclical improvement in labour productivity could be expected.",
        "All in all, it would be plausible to expect productivity growth to rebound in the near future, which would contain unit labour costs and inflation.",
        "On the other hand, structural changes in the labour market, such as the fall in average hours worked, should also be acknowledged as potentially having a permanent impact on labour productivity, unit labour costs and, ultimately, prices.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, members took note of the assessments by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane of the latest developments in market-based measures of inflation compensation and survey-based indicators.",
        "It was widely acknowledged that, on the basis of ILS rates adjusted for inflation risk premia, long-term market-based genuine inflation expectations had remained broadly stable since the middle of 2022, which was seen as a great achievement of the Governing Council’s monetary policy decisions.",
        "This estimated measure of genuine inflation expectations had hardly increased despite the high inflation numbers, although there was no room for complacency.",
        "With the renewed commodity price shocks, it was clear that monetary policy was now in a completely different situation from when the initial energy shocks had hit in 2021-22.",
        "At the same time, there were some warning signs, both in surveys and in financial markets, with certain indicators – such as the measure of expectations for inflation five years forward five years ahead – edging up in spite of the weakening economy.",
        "This suggested that lower economic growth may not be sufficient to tame underlying price pressures, which could be seen as a warning sign that risks of an unanchoring of inflation expectations remained elevated.",
        "The rise in market-based inflation compensation could be due to the risk of supply shocks becoming more prevalent in the future.",
        "It mostly reflected risk premia, thus signalling investor concern that inflation would turn out to be higher than the ECB’s target.",
        "Moreover, in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the balance of risk indicator was still clearly tilted to the upside.",
        "So even if average expected headline inflation remained flat, there were still upside risks in the inflation expectations surveys.",
        "This asymmetric distribution of expected inflation, together with elevated inflation risk premia, suggested that a continued anchoring of inflation expectations should not be taken for granted.",
        "If people expected repeated shocks pushing inflation above 2%, it was likely that this would eventually become embedded in inflation expectations, which would in turn affect wages, pushing inflation away from the target.",
        "Against this background, members assessed that there were still upside risks to inflation due to potential renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food.",
        "Adverse weather conditions, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could push food prices up by more than expected.",
        "A lasting rise in inflation expectations above the 2% target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term.",
        "By contrast, weaker demand – for example due to a stronger transmission of monetary policy or a worsening of the economic environment outside the euro area – would lead to lower price pressures, especially over the medium term.",
        "At the same time, the view was also expressed that inflation risks had become balanced, as most analyses suggested that inflation was broadly evolving as projected, or that they had even moved to the downside.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Monetary policy tightening continued to be transmitted strongly to broader financing conditions.",
        "Funding had again become more expensive for banks, as savers were replacing overnight deposits with time deposits that paid more interest and the ECB’s targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) were being phased out.",
        "Average lending rates for business loans and mortgages continued to increase.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that credit dynamics had weakened further, with the annual growth rate of loans to both firms and households declining.",
        "Amid weak lending and the reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet, money growth was falling sharply.",
        "In particular measures of momentum (i.e.",
        "annualised growth rates over the past three months) showed monetary and credit aggregates to be decelerating very fast, in a manner that had only previously been seen during the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis.",
        "The decline in lending likely reflected a combination of weaker loan demand and banks tightening the credit supply, with the respective contributions of the two factors hard to disentangle.",
        "The view was expressed that credit developments primarily reflected weak loan demand and remained broadly in line with historical patterns of monetary policy transmission, while there was little evidence of credit supply constraints playing a role.",
        "In addition to the past effects of monetary policy and a deteriorating macroeconomic outlook, lower demand could also reflect the fact that firms still had large cash buffers that they had accumulated in periods of heightened uncertainty related, first, to the pandemic and, more recently, to the energy crisis.",
        "This could suggest they had less need for external financing.",
        "It was stressed that banks were in a strong position to lend more if loan demand rose.",
        "In particular, banks with a duration mismatch on their balance sheet – which had locked in low rates on their loan books before funding costs increased – also had strong incentives to satisfy an eventual increase in demand from creditworthy borrowers to support future profitability.",
        "Moreover, it was emphasised that banks’ balance sheets were solid, as reflected in their elevated capital ratios, low levels of non-performing loans and resilient profitability.",
        "From a microprudential perspective, banks’ net interest income had adjusted favourably to higher rates, thus mitigating concerns that rate increases were detrimental to banks.",
        "This raised the question of why banks were tightening credit standards, as was emerging from the bank lending survey.",
        "On the basis of anecdotal evidence, it was suggested that, despite strong fundamentals, banks had become cautious about extending credit owing to worries about liquidity, especially in view of the turmoil that had occurred in the banking sector in March 2023.",
        "While banks were not liquidity-constrained, expectations for overall levels of excess liquidity had declined throughout the year.",
        "Banks were faced with the movement from overnight to term deposits, which required higher remuneration, as well as with the run-off of the TLTROs.",
        "These developments could have been making banks more careful.",
        "Moreover, it was argued that, even if a large part of the credit slowdown could thus far be attributed to demand factors, there was a risk that credit conditions could tighten further once supply restrictions came into play more forcefully.",
        "Against this background, it was argued that the transmission of monetary policy tightening via prices (loan rates) and quantities (credit volumes) since the first rate hike in July 2022 was both much stronger and faster than expected, and much stronger and faster than typically taken into account by macroeconomic models.",
        "It was remarked that the pass-through of past interest rate decisions differed greatly across countries.",
        "Countries with a large share of floating rate mortgages and a sizeable construction sector had experienced a very rapid pass-through and a sustained weakening of economic activity.",
        "Elsewhere, where fixed rate mortgages were prevalent or home ownership more limited, transmission was likely to be more sluggish.",
        "This suggested that a large part of the pass-through of past interest rate increases was still in the pipeline.",
        "However, it was argued that the tightening cycle had started long before interest rates were increased, and taking this and the end of net asset purchases into account suggested a transmission that was more in line with historical averages.",
        "It was also maintained that, while the impact on loan rates and volumes indeed appeared exceptionally strong, this simply reflected the regular transmission of exceptionally large and rapid interest rate changes, rather than a change in historical regularities in relation to each unit of rate increment.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the fact that the pass-through to bank deposit rates was currently still sluggish.",
        "Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members assessed overall financing conditions as having tightened further since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 26-27 July, with the transmission of monetary policy to broader financing conditions and the real economy firmly taking hold.",
        "The risk-free forward curve had remained broadly unchanged relative to the levels prior to the previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "This could reflect market participants’ assessment that growth was weakening amid still elevated inflation.",
        "Real long-term rates had also remained broadly stable in the euro area.",
        "It was underlined that uncertainty about the outlook remained exceptionally high.",
        "Against this background, members assessed the data that had become available since the last monetary policy meeting in accordance with the three main elements of the “reaction function” that the Governing Council had communicated earlier in the year.",
        "These comprised the implications of the incoming economic and financial data for the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Starting with the inflation outlook, members broadly concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Overall, the process of disinflation seemed to be proceeding largely as expected.",
        "Headline inflation had declined in July but stalled in August on the back of higher energy prices.",
        "At the same time, comfort was drawn from the fact that core inflation figures had no longer surprised to the upside over the past few months.",
        "Although the staff projections for inflation had been revised upwards in September for 2023 and 2024, there was a downward revision for 2025, albeit with inflation expected to reach the target only in the last quarter of that year.",
        "However, it was recalled that the Governing Council’s focus was on medium-term inflation, so that the small upward revision of the inflation projections in the shorter term should not be a large concern, as long as the deviation from the target did not spill over into inflation expectations and second-round effects on wages and profits.",
        "In a similar vein, base effects on inflation in the coming months were likely to temporarily push inflation down, without implications for the medium-term inflation outlook, although this profile might raise some communication challenges.",
        "Overall, the risks to inflation had become more balanced, as demand had weakened significantly and monetary policy was clearly in restrictive territory.",
        "This notwithstanding, a further increase in energy prices and the possibility of upward energy price shocks occurring more often in the future could push inflation up.",
        "Moreover, the risk of underestimating the persistence of inflation and of second-round effects from wages remained present.",
        "Members saw most indicators of underlying inflation now more clearly on a moderately declining path and closer together.",
        "An exception was domestic inflation, which was still rising.",
        "As regards wage growth, there were limited signs that this was starting to turn, although hard evidence of an inflection point still needed to emerge.",
        "At the same time, unit profits had been lower than implied by earlier projections, suggesting that rising wage pressures could in part be absorbed by firms over time, which was an important assumption underlying the moderation in the GDP deflator projected by staff, despite an upward revision for 2023 owing to higher unit labour costs.",
        "Turning to the assessment of monetary policy transmission, members noted that ample evidence could now be found that this was proceeding strongly, more so than expected.",
        "While this could in part reflect the exceptionally strong increase in the key ECB interest rates, staff analysis suggested that the impact went beyond the usual pattern of transmission.",
        "Moreover, a significant part of the interest rate pass-through was still pending and likely to restrain economic activity and inflation over the projection horizon.",
        "On the one hand, it was remarked that the effects of the monetary policy tightening could still increase over time and extend well beyond 2025.",
        "On the other hand, since the tightening cycle had started a long time previously (before the raising of policy rates in July 2022), its impact could also be expected to recede over time, on the basis of typical transmission lags.",
        "It was underlined that an important channel of monetary transmission was via inflation expectations.",
        "Having been able to keep inflation expectations anchored, despite the long period in which inflation had been above target, was seen as a major achievement.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that market-based measures of inflation compensation were still elevated, so this achievement was fragile.",
        "There was still a risk of inflation staying above target for too long, which called for humility and caution.",
        "Overall, members concurred that inflation was still expected to remain too high for too long.",
        "At the same time, the monetary policy cycle had reached a stage where the risks of tightening too much and the risks of tightening too little had become more balanced.",
        "In particular, the key ECB interest rates were in a range of levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, would make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the ECB’s target.",
        "This assessment was supported by model-based simulations, expert surveys and market pricing, which suggested that constellations with a deposit facility rate in the region of 3.75% to 4.00%, as long as it was understood as being maintained for a sufficiently long duration, should be consistent with a return of inflation to target within the projection horizon.",
        "In view of the considerable uncertainty, members highlighted that the decision between raising rates and pausing was a close call, and that tactical considerations also played a role.",
        "This situation was also reflected in the forward rate curve, which suggested that the probability of a rate increase versus a pause at the September meeting had been relatively evenly split for some time, as had been the case with analysts’ expectations, such as those reported in the Survey of Monetary Analysts.",
        "Against this background, while the decision was generally seen as a close call, a solid majority of members expressed support for the 25 basis point rate increase proposed by Mr Lane.",
        "These members emphasised the still high levels of inflation and the fact that a rate increase would signal a strong determination on the part of the Governing Council to bring inflation back to the target in a timely manner.",
        "The horizon over which inflation would be brought back to 2% should not extend beyond 2025.",
        "According to the latest ECB staff projections this was expected to be the case, although by that time inflation would have exceeded the target for more than four years in a row.",
        "Hence erring on the side of pausing the first time the decision was a close call could risk being interpreted as a weakening of the ECB’s determination, especially at a time when headline and core inflation were above 5%.",
        "Emphasis was also placed on the upward revisions to the headline inflation projections for the first two years of the projection horizon and the fact that the projections were conditioned on market interest rates, which embodied a further rate increase by the end of the year.",
        "Moreover, although there was tentative evidence suggesting that wage growth was close to a peak, further evidence was required to be sure it was turning.",
        "An additional consideration was the risk that the inflation path embedded in the projections was fragile and additional supply shocks could push inflation further above the target for longer, which could feed into inflation expectations.",
        "Further climate-related events also risked pushing up food prices.",
        "Hence, raising rates further also contained an element of insurance, against the continued elevated risk of inflation remaining above target for too long.",
        "It was seen as safer to confront such a situation with interest rates at 4.00% than at 3.75%, since higher rates could reduce the amplification of further shocks and thus lessen the probability of having to raise rates again in the future.",
        "In this context, it was argued that when monetary policy had been close to the effective lower bound and inflation low, there had had been a strong case for looking through supply shocks, whereas at present the situation was very different.",
        "These members also argued that a pause could give rise to speculation that the tightening cycle was over, which increased the risk of a rebound in inflation.",
        "This situation would require another wave of monetary tightening later on, which could have adverse consequences for real estate markets and financial stability more generally.",
        "Not hiking could also send a signal of the Governing Council being more concerned about the economy and a potential recession than too high inflation.",
        "Some members expressed a preference for maintaining rates at their current levels.",
        "These members underlined the fact that the Governing Council had made clear its decisions were data-dependent.",
        "They viewed the data that had become available since July as, on balance, not supporting a further rate hike: the economy had weakened substantially and inflation was projected to return to around 2% by the end of the projection horizon, while the risks to the inflation outlook were now balanced.",
        "Although oil prices had increased, this could turn out to be temporary.",
        "The 425 basis point increase in rates that had already taken place since the start of the tightening cycle was seen as sufficiently demonstrating the Governing Council’s commitment to deliver on its mandate of price stability.",
        "These members also maintained that a lot of the pass-through of past rate hikes was still pending, and not all of this was likely to be included in the central scenario, implying that downside risks to economic growth could be significant.",
        "They saw little room for upside risks to the growth outlook.",
        "Pausing at this meeting would also have the advantage of providing time to assess the impact of previous decisions on the economy and to evaluate whether the slowdown was deeper than expected and whether inflation was actually coming down as projected without requiring a further increase in interest rates.",
        "Another consideration was that a further rate hike risked repeating the situation that had occurred in 2011, when interest rate increases had had to be reversed quickly in the face of the economic consequences of the sovereign debt crisis.",
        "Against this background, it was recalled that the ECB also had secondary objectives.",
        "If the inflation target could be reached at the end of 2025 via a lower interest rate path, thereby increasing the likelihood of a soft landing, this would be preferable.",
        "The Governing Council also needed to take into account the economic and social costs of a possible hard landing.",
        "From a risk management perspective, the point was made that the risks of hiking at the present time, and later having to reverse course should the economy weaken by more than expected, were larger than those of introducing a pause in the tightening cycle and having to increase rates at one of the coming meetings.",
        "Members also agreed with the Executive Board proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the PEPP portfolio.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel noted that since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 26-27 October 2022 the narrative in financial markets had shifted from inflation concerns to expectations that central banks worldwide would slow down, halt and ultimately reverse interest rate hikes.",
        "The data on the US consumer price index (CPI) for October, interpreted as an early sign of an easing of inflation pressures, had prompted a market repricing of policy rate expectations for the United States.",
        "This had been further reinforced by the US CPI inflation figures for November, which had again surprised on the downside.",
        "The resulting rebound in investor risk appetite had led to a broad-based easing of global financial conditions, showing up in lower nominal and real yields, tighter credit spreads and buoyant equity markets in the euro area – all of which worked against the ECB’s intention to withdraw monetary policy accommodation.",
        "These developments had occurred in an environment in which news about the euro area economy had turned more positive.",
        "At the same time, there had been a notable upward repricing by markets of the near-term inflation outlook, and the risk of longer-term inflation expectations becoming unanchored remained elevated.",
        "Market conditions remained challenging as uncertainty about monetary policy and volatility in market interest rates continued to be high, amid low liquidity and collateral scarcity.",
        "Market hopes of a turning point in inflation developments and a change in direction, or “pivot”, of global monetary policy appeared to have spilled over into euro area interest rate expectations.",
        "The euro area overnight index swap (OIS) forward curve had become inverted, signalling expectations of moderate cuts in the ECB’s key policy rates over the next two to three years.",
        "By contrast, near-term market pricing remained broadly unchanged.",
        "The expected “terminal rate” at the peak of the present hiking cycle continued to stand at around 2.8% and market participants expected the key ECB interest rates to increase by 50 basis points both at the present meeting and at the meeting in February 2023, with a final 25 basis point increment expected in March 2023.",
        "Spillovers from the United States had been the predominant driver of recent movements in euro area risk-free yields, as reflected in their sensitivity to macroeconomic news from the United States.",
        "The reappraisal of rate expectations in the euro area beyond the near term seemed to be at odds with domestic developments, such as incoming data on the macroeconomy, energy prices and the market-based inflation outlook.",
        "In particular, economic data releases in the euro area had recently turned positive after a period of weaker than expected outcomes, pointing to waning risks of a deep and protracted recession, which market participants had previously considered a key factor putting downward pressure on euro area inflation.",
        "At the same time, natural gas prices had rebounded sharply from the lows recorded in late October owing to mild weather conditions and full storage facilities, and they were now at levels comparable to those seen in early summer, pointing to renewed tightness in the European gas market.",
        "On the back of receding downside tail risks to economic growth and higher energy prices, there had been a notable upward repricing of market-based expectations for inflation in the near term.",
        "Looking at the evolution of longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area, signals of upside risks were observed both in market-based indicators and in surveys.",
        "In the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters and the ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) the distribution of responses had shifted markedly over the course of the past few months, with a significant and rising share of respondents expecting a sustained period of inflation above the ECB’s 2% target.",
        "Despite higher near-term inflation expectations and upside risks to the longer-term inflation outlook, the global repricing of monetary policy rate expectations had led to an easing of broader financial conditions in the euro area.",
        "Market participants’ expectations that central banks would cut policy rates soon after reaching the terminal rate had led to a decline in longer-term yields relative to short-term yields.",
        "The recent repricing of policy rate expectations had led to a decrease in euro area real GDP-weighted sovereign bond yields across the maturity spectrum since the peak reached in mid-October.",
        "Real rates were again in negative territory across all maturities up to ten years.",
        "Moreover, yield spreads had continued to narrow in euro area sovereign and corporate bond markets.",
        "Market expectations of a global monetary policy pivot had had the most pronounced effect on equity markets, which had seen a renewed “relief” rally.",
        "The downward trend in cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratios had been reversed just when they had been approaching their long-run averages.",
        "Developments in exchange rates had closely reflected the drivers of recent broader market developments.",
        "The sustained rally of the US dollar appeared to have come to an end, in line with an unwinding of long positions in US dollars.",
        "The change in the monetary policy outlook for the United States, the return to a “risk-on” environment and a comparatively better economic outlook for the euro area had been the main drivers of the appreciation of the euro since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "Conditions remained challenging in euro area money and repo markets, although there had been significant improvements lately.",
        "Year-end tensions arising from collateral scarcity in jurisdictions with high credit ratings had decreased, as illustrated by the significant increase in the respective repo rates for the turn of the year.",
        "These positive dynamics had to be seen in the light of the decisions taken by authorities, including the Eurosystem and national debt management offices, over the last few weeks to alleviate collateral scarcity.",
        "Overall, however, pricing in the repo market remained expensive, as various factors such as market positioning, interest rate volatility and valuation effects continued to exacerbate the structural factors behind collateral scarcity in the secured money market.",
        "Looking ahead, the repayment of funds under the ECB’s targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and the prospective future reduction of the Eurosystem’s portfolios of securities held for monetary policy purposes, together with the expected significant new issuance activity, were expected to support the availability of collateral in 2023.",
        "In the unsecured money market segment, the observed downward pressure on bank borrowing rates reflected the availability of excess cash to be invested at a time when policy rates were rising quickly.",
        "This had led to EURIBOR rates being persistently lower than the equivalent OIS rates for maturities of up to three months since the start of the policy rate hiking cycle last summer.",
        "Starting with the international environment, Mr Lane highlighted that global trade momentum had softened significantly towards the end of 2022.",
        "Looking ahead, the global Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) indicator for new export orders was well below the threshold of 50, pointing to continued weakness in global trade.",
        "The weakening in trade had reduced the pressures on supply chains.",
        "Indeed, the PMI indicator for suppliers’ delivery times had continued to improve up to November.",
        "This suggested that this factor that had been holding back production and pushing up prices for a long time was diminishing and could be expected to disappear next year.",
        "The euro had appreciated in nominal effective terms since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting in October, after depreciating for almost two years.",
        "Regarding commodity prices, the oil futures curve had declined since the October meeting.",
        "By contrast, gas spot prices had rebounded strongly, while futures prices had remained broadly unchanged at elevated levels since October.",
        "Turning to the euro area, real GDP growth had slowed to 0.3% in the third quarter of 2022.",
        "This reflected a record increase in investment in Ireland, which, on an annualised basis, had grown by 850% compared with the previous quarter.",
        "Excluding Ireland, real GDP in the euro area had grown by 0.2%.",
        "With regard to the demand components of GDP, private consumption had grown strongly in the second and third quarters of 2022, particularly in Germany, Spain and Italy, as the growth of nominal consumer income and the use of accumulated savings had compensated for the high rate of inflation.",
        "In the final quarter of 2022, however, private consumption was projected to have stagnated on account of declining real incomes, while households were expected to have become more reluctant to dip into savings.",
        "After continuously declining since the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine, consumer confidence had improved somewhat in October and November, but remained low from a historical perspective.",
        "Moving to investment, residential investment growth had been in negative territory since the spring, while the growth of non-construction investment (excluding the contribution from intellectual property products in Ireland) had decelerated in the third quarter of 2022 and was expected to contract in the final quarter.",
        "Turning to trade, the significant decline in the goods trade balance that had started in mid-2021 had been interrupted in September owing to a small improvement in energy import prices and European firms being able to charge higher prices and sell more non-energy goods to the rest of the world.",
        "These developments had helped to partially offset the higher energy bill.",
        "Short-term economic activity indicators and mechanical short-term GDP forecasting continued to suggest a contraction in economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2022.",
        "At the sectoral level, PMI indicators for the manufacturing sector continued to point to weak output but had improved somewhat owing to the continued easing of supply bottlenecks, which had allowed firms to work through their order backlogs.",
        "In the services sector, forward-looking indicators of economic activity were declining, in line with a normalisation following the boost from the reopening of the economy in the first part of the year.",
        "Labour markets had seen a significant recovery in employment in the wake of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.",
        "However, total hours worked per person employed had recovered to a much more limited extent.",
        "Looking ahead, PMI indicators were pointing to a deceleration in employment growth across sectors.",
        "Regarding measures of labour market tightness, countries with low unemployment also had a high vacancy rate, while countries with high unemployment had a low vacancy rate.",
        "Looking ahead, according to the December 2022 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, annual average real GDP growth was projected to slow down markedly from 3.4% in 2022 to 0.5% in 2023, and then to rebound to 1.9% in 2024 and 1.8% in 2025.",
        "Compared with the September 2022 ECB staff projections, the outlook for growth had been revised up by 0.3 percentage points for 2022, owing to positive surprises over the summer, and down by 0.4 percentage points for 2023.",
        "The GDP growth outlook had remained unchanged for 2024.",
        "Risks to the growth outlook were on the downside, especially in the near term.",
        "Russia’s war in Ukraine remained a significant downside risk to the economy.",
        "Energy and food costs could also remain persistently higher than expected.",
        "There could be an additional drag on growth in the euro area if the world economy were to weaken more sharply than expected.",
        "In the downside scenario in the December projections – which assumed a complete cut-off of Russian gas – real GDP would contract by 0.6% in 2023 before recovering to grow by 0.2% in 2024 and 2.0% in 2025.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, in 2022 the size of fiscal measures to compensate for the energy crisis had increased from 1.2% of GDP, as embedded in the September ECB staff projections, to 1.9% of GDP according to the December Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "The December projections also implied a strong upward revision to the fiscal support measures for 2023, which were now estimated at 1.9% of GDP, with some of these measures expected to remain in place in 2024 (0.5% of GDP) and in 2025 (0.2% of GDP).",
        "The cyclically adjusted primary balance, which had deteriorated to -3.4% of GDP in 2020, was seen reaching -1.3% in 2022, as pandemic-related measures were progressively withdrawn.",
        "It was projected to deteriorate again in 2023, to -1.6% of GDP, before improving by almost 1 percentage point in 2024 to -0.7% of GDP.",
        "Moving to the latest inflation developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, headline inflation had declined to 10.0% in November, from 10.6% in October, owing to lower energy inflation, which was partly offset by an increase in food inflation.",
        "The decline in energy inflation in November mainly reflected lower crude oil and gas price inflation.",
        "Energy inflation was expected to drop further in December as a result of the fiscal measures taken in some euro area countries.",
        "However, in January and February 2023 it was expected to increase again, as many utility companies adjusted their prices in January or February.",
        "Subsequently the December staff projections foresaw a decline in energy inflation.",
        "However, this was much more gradual than had been projected earlier, reflecting a delayed pass-through of wholesale gas and electricity prices to customers with long-term contracts.",
        "Food inflation had increased to 13.6% in November and was projected to continue its upward trend into early 2023 before declining from mid-year.",
        "The expected increase until early 2023 was due to the fact that the large increases seen in international food commodity prices had not yet fully passed through to retail prices.",
        "For goods inflation, there had been a slowdown in price rises at the early stages of the production chain, which had not yet passed through to retail prices.",
        "The observed significant slowdown in intermediate goods inflation should start to be visible in retail goods inflation in the course of 2023.",
        "Indicators of underlying inflation had remained at high levels in October, with most measures still increasing but some stabilising – notably those affected by the lower month-on-month energy inflation.",
        "The momentum in domestic inflation had been slowing down since mid-2022, which could be related to the easing of the indirect effects of energy prices and supply bottlenecks.",
        "At the same time, inflation in wage-intensive components of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had been picking up over the past few months.",
        "Negotiated wage growth had continued to increase in the third quarter and the experimental ECB wage tracker pointed to a substantial further rise in the growth of negotiated wages in the next few quarters.",
        "In the seven countries covered by the wage tracker, agreements signed so far in the fourth quarter of 2022 implied wage increases of around 5%, both in 2022 and in 2023, which was broadly in line with the December staff projections.",
        "The November round of the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey reported that perceptions of current inflation had stabilised at 10%, clearly showing that consumers were paying attention to the level of inflation.",
        "One-year ahead inflation expectations showed the first signs of a reversal, declining from 5.4% in October to 5.0% in November, while three-year ahead inflation expectations remained stable at around 3%.",
        "Turning to the key features of the December 2022 projections, inflation had been revised up significantly to an average of 8.4% for 2022, 6.3% for 2023 and 3.4% for 2024.",
        "Inflation was projected to average 2.3% in 2025.",
        "The upward revisions had been driven by a combination of repeated inflation surprises in recent months (with the exception of November), more persistent pipeline price pressures and faster wage growth.",
        "The annual averages masked the strong downward base effects in energy inflation, which were projected to bring headline inflation down from 10.0% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 3.6% in the last quarter of 2023.",
        "Inflation was then projected to ease further to 3.3% in the last quarter 2024 and 2.0% from the third quarter of 2025 onwards.",
        "The somewhat unusual time profile of inflation over 2023 and 2024 was due to the fact that the fiscal measures designed to tackle the energy price crisis were expected to dampen inflation in 2023, but push it up in 2024, when many of these measures were scheduled to be unwound.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food) was projected to average 3.9% in 2022 and 4.2% in 2023, before falling to 2.8% in 2024 and 2.4% in 2025.",
        "Strong wage growth amid robust labour market dynamics was a primary contributor to the persistence of core inflation, but the indirect effects of higher energy and food costs on core inflation remained substantial in 2023 and in 2024, and also played a role in explaining core inflation in 2025.",
        "The past depreciation of the euro would also push up core inflation in 2023 and 2024.",
        "The projected core inflation rates in 2024 and 2025 would have been significantly lower without the estimated indirect effects of energy inflation and the effect of the exchange rate.",
        "Risks to the inflation outlook were primarily on the upside.",
        "In the near term existing pipeline pressures could lead to stronger than expected rises in retail prices for energy and food.",
        "Over the medium term risks stemmed primarily from domestic factors, such as a persistent rise in inflation expectations above the ECB’s target or higher than anticipated wage rises.",
        "By contrast, a decline in energy costs or a further weakening of demand would lower price pressures.",
        "The updated downside scenario in the December projections that reflected these risks pointed to higher inflation than in the baseline in 2023 and 2024 (at 7.4% and 3.6% respectively) as energy prices spiked, whereas in 2025 inflation was seen dropping below the baseline, to 2.0%, as the downward impact from the demand channel started to dominate.",
        "Uncertainty about the impact of monetary policy tightening also constituted a risk to the inflation projections, with a wide range of estimates across different modelling approaches.",
        "To reflect the high uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook, the December baseline projection had been accompanied by sensitivity analysis as well as a downside scenario.",
        "The mechanical impact of the technical assumptions used in the baseline would have implied slightly lower GDP growth for 2023 and significantly lower GDP growth for 2024 than in the September projections.",
        "The technical assumptions would also have implied significantly lower inflation for 2023 and a higher inflation rate for 2024 than projected in September.",
        "At the same time, an extension of the current fiscal measures into 2024, which was not an unrealistic assumption in view of governments’ attempts to buffer the energy price shock, could lift inflation measurably in 2025.",
        "The downside scenario, which assumed a complete halt of Russian gas and oil supplies leading to disruptions in production and trade, resulted in higher inflation than in the baseline for 2023 and 2024 – indicating the prevalence of upside risks to inflation – while pointing to lower inflation for 2025.",
        "Turning to monetary and financial developments, Mr Lane recalled that in the December SMA respondents had expected the path of the key ECB interest rates to have a more pronounced hump shape than had been expected in the October round of the survey.",
        "The deposit facility rate had been expected to peak in March 2023 at 2.75%, which was 25 basis points higher than expected in the previous survey round.",
        "In the long run the deposit facility rate was still expected to be 2.0%, unchanged from the October SMA.",
        "SMA respondents had expected the run-off of the asset purchase programme (APP) to start after March 2023.",
        "Nevertheless, Mr Lane noted that long-term risk-free interest rates and sovereign yields had declined on the back of lower term premia and revised policy expectations, thereby supporting risk assets.",
        "Real interest rates had also declined since the Governing Council’s October monetary policy meeting, although, compared with a year ago, there had been a big upward shift in the term structure of real forward rates.",
        "Indeed, while current real spot rates continued to be negative across maturities, reflecting the very high rate of inflation compared with late 2021, real forward rates had risen by at least 150 basis points across horizons.",
        "Therefore, beyond the very short term, the continued increase in interest rates implied that a firm needing to refinance itself over time would face a much higher real rate.",
        "Indices of financial conditions in the euro area had been sending mixed signals since the Governing Council’s October monetary policy meeting, as the shift resulting from higher equity prices and lower risk-free rates was counterbalanced by a stronger euro.",
        "That said, financial conditions remained tighter than assumed in the September 2022 staff projections.",
        "Looking at financing conditions for firms, in the latest round of the Survey on the access to finance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SAFE), firms had reported a widening “financing gap” – the difference between the change in demand for external financing and the (perceived) change in its supply – in a deteriorating economic environment.",
        "This was accompanied by an increasing share of firms being considered “vulnerable”, defined as firms simultaneously reporting lower turnover, declining profits, higher interest expenditure and a non-decreasing debt-to-asset ratio.",
        "The reported larger financing gap and increase in firms’ vulnerability had both typically been associated with a subsequent fall in GDP in the euro area.",
        "Mr Lane reported that the transmission of the tightening of monetary policy was affecting money and credit developments in line with what had happened in the past.",
        "He noted that, in previous tightening cycles, the rate on time deposits had closely followed the policy rate, while the rate on overnight deposits had been systematically well below the policy rate.",
        "With the return of positive policy rates, banks were currently restoring the past pricing structure by more strongly increasing those rates that were furthest from their “normal” distance vis-à-­­­­vis the policy rate, with rates on overnight deposits recording only minor increases so far.",
        "Lending rates on household mortgages had increased markedly, contributing to a moderation in new lending to households driven mainly by lower mortgage lending growth.",
        "Rates on loans to firms had also increased substantially.",
        "However, this increase had not yet translated into a significant moderation in bank lending to firms, as firms had significantly reduced bond issuance when faced with an increase in the cost of issuing debt securities that outpaced more sluggish bank lending rates.",
        "Moreover, firms were facing higher borrowing needs in nominal terms, as inflation had increased operating costs and investment financing needs.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane highlighted that, amid exceptional uncertainty, the substantial upward revision to the inflation profile over the entire projection horizon called for a monetary policy response that significantly reduced the inflation rate within the projection horizon.",
        "The stronger inflation dynamic in the revised projections meant that the estimated range for the terminal rate that would ensure a return of inflation to target in a timely manner had risen markedly.",
        "Raising policy rates to sufficiently restrictive levels and keeping them there would, over time, reduce inflation by dampening demand and would also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations.",
        "Against this backdrop, Mr Lane proposed that the three key ECB interest rates should be raised by 50 basis points at the present meeting.",
        "He also proposed that it should be made clear that interest rates would still have to rise significantly at a steady pace to reach levels that were sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target.",
        "At the current juncture, taking into account the cumulative 200 basis point increase in the key ECB interest rates since July, a 50 basis point increment should be viewed as a sustainable pace at which monetary policy could be tightened in an expeditious manner.",
        "An increase of this magnitude would acknowledge the uncertainties surrounding the state of the economy and the inflation outlook, the lags with which the Governing Council’s past policy actions were being transmitted and the overall tightening impulse being delivered across its portfolio of instruments, including the reimbursement of TLTROs.",
        "Under conditions of significant uncertainty, a steady pace would allow the Governing Council to learn more about the impact of its decisions on financial conditions and the broader economy thus far and to reassess, on a meeting-by-meeting basis, the level of interest rates that would be sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to its target.",
        "The key ECB interest rates were the primary tool for setting the monetary policy stance.",
        "The Governing Council should reinforce the impact of its rate hikes throughout the yield curve by announcing principles for normalising the Eurosystem’s monetary policy securities holdings.",
        "Mr Lane therefore proposed communicating that, from March 2023 onwards, the APP portfolio would decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem would not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities.",
        "Mr Lane proposed announcing that the decline would average €15 billion per month until the end of the third quarter of 2023 and that the Governing Council would determine its subsequent pace over time.",
        "In addition, the Governing Council should signal that the review of its operational framework for steering short-term interest rates, which was to be concluded by the end of 2023, would provide information regarding the endpoint of the balance sheet normalisation process.",
        "In line with the ECB’s monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council should also use the present meeting to assess in depth the interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability.",
        "The financial stability environment had deteriorated since the Governing Council’s last review in June 2022, owing to a weaker economy and rising credit risk.",
        "In addition, sovereign vulnerabilities had risen amid the weaker economic outlook and weaker fiscal positions.",
        "Tighter financing conditions would mitigate the build-up of financial vulnerabilities and reduce tail risks to inflation over the medium term, at the cost of a higher risk of systemic stress and greater downside risks to growth in the short term.",
        "In addition, the liquidity needs of non-bank financial institutions could amplify market volatility.",
        "At the same time, euro area banks had comfortable levels of capital, which helped to reduce the side effects of tighter monetary policy on financial stability.",
        "Macroprudential policy remained the first line of defence in preserving financial stability and addressing medium-term vulnerabilities.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks to the outlook provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The euro area economy was expected to contract in the current quarter and the first quarter of next year, owing to the energy crisis, high uncertainty, weakening global economic activity and tighter financing conditions.",
        "According to the latest Eurosystem staff projections, however, a recession would be relatively short-lived and shallow.",
        "Growth was nonetheless expected to be subdued in 2023 and had been revised down significantly since the September ECB staff projections.",
        "Beyond the near term, growth was projected to recover as the current headwinds faded.",
        "As regards the external environment, members generally shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane that the world economy was slowing, in a context of continued geopolitical uncertainty, especially owing to Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people, and tighter financing conditions worldwide.",
        "Weakening global activity would also weigh on global trade and euro area foreign demand, despite improvements in global supply chain pressures.",
        "Attention was drawn to the risks surrounding the Chinese economy, which could lead to renewed bottlenecks in global supply chains.",
        "It was underlined that the euro area continued to be confronted by an exceptional degree of global uncertainty, of both an economic and a geopolitical nature, the impact of which still had to be fully understood.",
        "Turning to euro area developments, members concurred with Mr Lane that the euro area was likely to experience a mild recession in the last quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023.",
        "Economic growth in the euro area had slowed to 0.3% in the third quarter of 2022.",
        "High inflation and tighter financing conditions were dampening spending and production by reducing real household incomes and pushing up costs for firms.",
        "The past deterioration in the terms of trade, reflecting a faster rise in import prices than in export prices, continued to weigh on purchasing power in the euro area.",
        "On the positive side, employment had increased by 0.3% in the third quarter and unemployment had fallen to a new historical low of 6.5% in October.",
        "Rising wages were set to restore some of the lost purchasing power, supporting consumption.",
        "As the economy weakened, however, job creation was likely to slow, and unemployment could rise over the coming quarters.",
        "Looking ahead, it was noted that Eurosystem staff had revised down their economic growth projection for 2023.",
        "At the same time, members highlighted the so far stronger than expected resilience of economic activity.",
        "Domestic demand had clearly remained more robust in response to higher energy prices than previously feared, reflecting the strong rebound in the demand for consumer services following the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions.",
        "The labour market, in particular, remained robust, in turn supporting domestic demand, with the result that employment had barely been revised at all in the new projections.",
        "While this outcome was seen as good news, it would also contribute to higher inflation in the medium term.",
        "It was acknowledged that growth was expected to be very close to zero in the coming year, so the euro area was facing a very significant economic slowdown compared with 2022.",
        "While domestic demand had so far been resilient in the face of higher energy prices, there was considerable uncertainty about the dampening impact of tighter monetary policy.",
        "Reference was made to structural models with forward-looking or rational expectations that suggested a significantly stronger impact of monetary policy on aggregate demand than was embedded in the staff projections.",
        "Those models also implied more balanced risks to the medium-term outlook for inflation.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that the underlying empirical evidence did not appear to point to a high interest rate sensitivity of aggregate demand and inflation in large parts of the euro area, notwithstanding significant heterogeneity in the transmission of monetary policy.",
        "In any case, the forceful fiscal response to the energy crisis was an important factor behind the resilience of aggregate demand and the labour market, even as measures adopted during the pandemic were being phased out.",
        "Concern was therefore expressed as to how domestic demand would hold up in the face of an expected eventual withdrawal of fiscal support.",
        "Given the performance of economic activity and labour markets, it was noted that there was currently less need to revise down estimates of potential output growth, at least to the extent that the resilience of the euro area economy was not just driven by fiscal support.",
        "However, it was possible that the impact of the war­­ – in particular the energy price shock – and the pandemic on the productive capacity of the economy would turn out to be greater and last longer than expected, with the result that demand would have to be reduced more strongly to curb inflation.",
        "A smaller output gap would be more consistent with the observed strong dynamics of core inflation.",
        "Regarding the fiscal policy response to higher energy prices, members reiterated that measures should be temporary and designed to help the most vulnerable households and firms, so as to limit the risk of fuelling additional inflationary pressures.",
        "Fiscal support measures should be temporary, targeted and tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy.",
        "Fiscal measures falling short of these principles were likely to exacerbate inflationary pressures, which would necessitate a stronger monetary policy response.",
        "Moreover, in line with the EU’s economic governance framework, fiscal policies should be oriented towards making the economy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt.",
        "Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, could help reduce price pressures in the medium term.",
        "To that end, governments should swiftly implement their investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme.",
        "The reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be concluded rapidly.",
        "Targeted income measures were generally perceived by members as more effective than price measures, as the latter hampered the necessary long-term adjustment of energy production and consumption.",
        "It was widely highlighted that the current fiscal response was not sufficiently targeted, which was creating challenges regarding the outlook for sound public finances and for monetary policy.",
        "With a continued relaxation of fiscal rules in 2023, fiscal deficits were seen as likely to be larger than currently projected on the basis of the standard assumptions.",
        "However, it was also stressed that energy prices remained very volatile and that fiscal policy was currently trying to smooth the effects on households and firms.",
        "As long as fiscal policy was mainly aiming to smooth the impact of higher energy prices over time, it would not necessarily be regarded as expansionary.",
        "Against this background, members assessed risks to the economic growth outlook as being on the downside, especially in the near term.",
        "Russia’s war in Ukraine continued to be a significant downside risk to the economy.",
        "Energy and food costs might also remain persistently higher than expected.",
        "There could be an additional drag on growth in the euro area if the world economy were to weaken more sharply than expected.",
        "With regard to price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Inflation had declined to 10.0% in November, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, mainly on the back of lower energy price inflation, while services inflation had also edged down.",
        "Food price inflation had risen further to 13.6%, however, as high input costs in food production were passed through to consumer prices.",
        "Price pressures remained strong across sectors, partly as a result of the impact of high energy costs throughout the economy.",
        "Inflation excluding energy and food had been unchanged in November at 5.0%, and other measures of underlying inflation were also high.",
        "Fiscal measures to compensate households for high energy prices and inflation were set to dampen inflation in 2023, but inflation would rise again once the measures were withdrawn.",
        "Supply bottlenecks were gradually easing, although their effects were still contributing to inflation, pushing up goods prices in particular.",
        "The same was true for the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions: while weakening, the effect of pent-up demand was still driving up prices, especially in the services sector.",
        "The depreciation of the euro in 2022 was also continuing to feed through to consumer prices.",
        "Wage growth was strengthening, supported by robust labour markets and some catch-up in wages to compensate workers for high inflation.",
        "Members underlined that, while headline inflation had slowed down in November, inflation was still far too high.",
        "Delays in the pass-through of energy price increases to consumer prices and the recent rebound in gas prices also implied that there was uncertainty as to whether headline inflation had already reached its peak.",
        "The latest data suggested that inflation was becoming much more broad-based and persistent.",
        "While the decline in headline inflation in November had been unexpected, inflation was still higher than projected in September.",
        "As higher inflation was projected to extend into 2024 and 2025, it was no longer driven solely by negative supply shocks, the pandemic and energy prices.",
        "Above-target inflation had now clearly reached the policy-relevant horizon for which the ECB was to be held accountable.",
        "Indeed, even if headline inflation numbers came down sharply in the course of 2023, largely owing to base effects, this was not likely to be the case for underlying inflation.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation continued to display very strong month-on-month dynamics.",
        "This was also reflected in the projections, which saw core inflation higher in 2023 than in 2022, more persistent and clearly above target in 2025.",
        "This implied an increased risk of inflation becoming entrenched in the euro area economy.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that the December staff projections for inflation had been revised up significantly, especially for the outer years of the projections, with an unprecedented revision of projected headline inflation in 2024.",
        "It was noted that the upward revision over that horizon reflected, to a large extent, revised judgement and the time profile of fiscal measures, as all relevant technical assumptions (e.g.",
        "oil prices, gas prices, the exchange rate and interest rates) had been revised since the September exercise in a direction that should have led to lower inflation.",
        "Consequently, the upward revision of the inflation projections largely reflected an upward revision to domestic cost pressures and an updated judgement on the speed and extent of the pass-through of costs to prices.",
        "The recent strengthening of the euro constituted a noteworthy change in the external environment and would likely imply somewhat lower inflationary pressures for the euro area in the period ahead, even though the lagged effects of the euro’s pronounced past depreciation would still be working their way through the economy.",
        "Finally, it was highlighted that the speed at which inflation was projected to come down had not been revised much from the September projections.",
        "In particular, the profile of a steep decline in core inflation when the current quarter was compared with the fourth quarter of 2024 had remained practically unchanged once the higher starting level was taken into account.",
        "Members recalled that wage pressures were key to understanding the risk of second-round effects on inflation.",
        "As wage developments in the euro area were accelerating, second-round effects through higher wages appeared to be starting to materialise.",
        "Labour markets continued to be historically tight and there were increasing pressures on wages.",
        "Compensation per employee, which had previously grown at a rate similar to that of negotiated wages, was now growing significantly faster.",
        "The growth in unit labour costs had picked up substantially and was expected, at the end of the projection horizon, to stand at levels that were not consistent with the ECB’s inflation target.",
        "This was also driven by a decline in labour productivity, which might be partly due to workers not having been reallocated since the pandemic.",
        "These factors could be considered to point to second-round effects becoming a reality.",
        "However, the view was also expressed that unit labour costs were still relatively contained over the projection horizon, even though they had to be monitored closely.",
        "Fiscal policies were also widely seen as playing a crucial role in determining the degree of persistence of medium-term inflation.",
        "In the sensitivity analysis carried out in the context of the projections, upside inflation risks stemming from fiscal policy were substantial.",
        "Fiscal policies were already more expansionary than previously expected, and they were likely to become even more expansionary.",
        "However, the view was also expressed that the fiscal measures would largely expire or reverse naturally, and therefore these could be “looked through” in the design of monetary policy.",
        "The higher inflation rates projected for the latter years of the projection period were, instead, a direct consequence of the assumptions made concerning fiscal plans, which might well turn out to overestimate the overall inflationary impact of the fiscal policy stance at that horizon.",
        "For example, longer-term price pressures might diminish if the energy-related fiscal measures were not implemented in full in 2023, or if the recession reduced the pass-through of costs to prices of goods and services.",
        "Against this background it was remarked that the inflation projections were surrounded by an unusual degree of uncertainty, particularly over the medium term.",
        "The confidence bands surrounding the inflation projections were vast and grew over the projection horizon.",
        "The precision of the inflation projections two to three years ahead was assessed as extremely low.",
        "According to this view, the current projection for 2025 could therefore be seen as not significantly different from 2%.",
        "This uncertainty had to be underlined in communication so as to avoid conveying a false sense of precision.",
        "In this context, it was also felt that the risks to the baseline inflation projections could be assessed as more balanced in the medium run and as representing less of an increase compared with the September exercise because in the current projections some of the earlier upside risks had been incorporated into the baseline.",
        "Looking at longer-term inflation expectations, members took note of the assessments, by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane, of the latest developments in market-based measures of inflation compensation and survey-based indicators.",
        "Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stood at around 2%, although further above-target revisions to some indicators warranted continued monitoring.",
        "Longer-term market and survey-based inflation expectations were generally judged as remaining well anchored.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that some indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were at risk of becoming unanchored.",
        "The point was made that this risk was elevated and was likely to rise non-linearly if inflation remained too high over an extended period of time, as suggested in the projections.",
        "The risks of unanchoring remained considerable given the very long time for which above-target inflation was projected and the importance of experience in shaping inflation perceptions, those of households in particular.",
        "In addition, the anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations was conditional on the Governing Council’s credibility in bringing inflation back to target in a timely manner.",
        "However, it was also noted that, in some of the latest indicators, there were signs of longer-term inflation expectations gradually retrenching.",
        "Households still had relatively high inflation expectations, which was not surprising given that these were backward-looking and gave more weight to inflation perceptions, or to the prices of goods that were increasing more in relative terms (e.g.",
        "In the ECB’s latest Consumer Expectations Survey, the median inflation expectations for three years ahead had remained fairly stable at 3%.",
        "But in the European Commission’s surveys, which admittedly were qualitative, there was already a clear downward trend.",
        "Against this background members, overall, assessed that the risks to the inflation outlook were primarily on the upside.",
        "In the near term existing pipeline pressures might lead to stronger than expected rises in retail prices for energy and food.",
        "With respect to the medium term views differed, with risks, however, generally seen as remaining to the upside.",
        "Risks stemmed primarily from domestic factors such as a persistent rise in inflation expectations above the Governing Council’s target or higher than anticipated wage rises.",
        "In this regard, it was reiterated that the sensitivity analysis conducted in the context of the projection exercise pointed mostly to upside risks to inflation, notably from energy and food prices.",
        "By contrast, a decline in energy costs, a further weakening of demand and tighter financing conditions would lower price pressures.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "In line with the ongoing normalisation of monetary policy, borrowing costs were rising for firms and households.",
        "Bank lending to firms had remained robust, as firms were replacing bonds with bank loans and using credit to finance the higher costs of production and investment.",
        "Meanwhile, the increase in the cost of borrowing and the weakening prospects for the housing market had translated into a lower growth rate of loans to households.",
        "Members agreed that, overall, the transmission of monetary policy normalisation to financing conditions was proceeding smoothly and broadly in line with what had happened in the past.",
        "However, the point was made that there were important differences across countries and that understanding them was relevant for transmission.",
        "For example, the transmission of market rates to time deposits and bank lending rates had been relatively limited and weaker than in the past in the fourth largest euro area economy, but more rapid than usual for lending rates in the largest economy.",
        "It was noted that two earlier concerns had diminished: first, banks had adjusted relatively smoothly to the change in the TLTRO conditions, which had also resulted in significant early repayments; second, tensions and the widening of spreads in the repo market had eased somewhat.",
        "At the same time, concerns were expressed that, since the Governing Council’s October monetary policy meeting, long-term risk-free rates and sovereign bond yields had declined on the back of lower term premia and revised policy expectations, resulting in lower real interest rates.",
        "These were now again in negative territory for maturities of up to ten years.",
        "Much of this decline could be linked to spillovers from the United States, reflecting the typically high correlation in yield changes across the two currency areas.",
        "In addition, markets seemed to transpose developments in the United States – where inflation was already coming down – to the euro area, notwithstanding differences in the outlook.",
        "Moreover, the argument was made that the financial markets’ reaction to the Governing Council’s October decision and communication had contributed to a loosening of financial conditions, which had reversed some of the tightening that had occurred in the wake of the September meeting.",
        "The decline in the euro area yield curve had also supported risk assets and contributed to a loosening of financial conditions overall.",
        "The loosening was seen as an unwelcome development and was judged inconsistent with the significantly more adverse euro area inflation outlook embedded in the staff projections.",
        "Against this background, a reversal of this downward shift in market pricing was called for, in particular by fostering a reassessment of the view embedded in financial markets as regards the ECB’s future interest rate path, including its peak or terminal rate.",
        "The Governing Council also held its regular biannual exchange on the interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability.",
        "Members concurred that financial stability conditions had deteriorated since the last review in June 2022, amid a weaker economy, rising credit risk and higher sovereign vulnerabilities in an environment of lower growth and weaker fiscal positions.",
        "They took note that sudden liquidity needs of non-bank financial institutions might amplify market volatility.",
        "At the same time, the comfortable levels of capital maintained by euro area banks would help to reduce possible negative side effects of tighter monetary policy on financial stability.",
        "The point was made that an insufficient or delayed monetary policy response might simply lead to deferred, and likely greater, repercussions on financial stability.",
        "Members also discussed potentially disorderly financial market reactions to various shocks, including different scenarios of quantitative tightening and adverse changes in fiscal policy.",
        "Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members noted that, in the December Eurosystem staff projections, the inflation outlook had been further revised up and inflation was clearly above the Governing Council’s target in the medium as well as the near term.",
        "As inflation was becoming more persistent and inflation pressures more broadly based, the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored was also seen as increasing.",
        "In addition, pipeline pressures remained elevated and core inflation, which was less volatile and seen as more responsive to monetary policy over time, was projected to remain persistently high, with underlying inflationary pressure strengthening further.",
        "The point was made that, with inflation seen as staying well above target for at least four consecutive years, it was becoming increasingly difficult to argue that high inflation could be attributed primarily to external shocks outside the control of monetary policy.",
        "In this context, wage developments were seen as adding to the risk of second-round effects, while expansionary fiscal policies were intensifying inflationary pressures, thereby interfering with the intended effect of ongoing monetary policy tightening.",
        "It was, however, also remarked that fiscal policy had a role to play in smoothing the inflation impact of the energy shock, which was within its domain of responsibility.",
        "It was underlined that the projected slowdown in economic growth, which in principle should lower inflation pressures, was shallow and could not be expected to dampen them to a significant extent.",
        "It was recalled that the quarterly macroeconomic projections exercises conducted by ECB and Eurosystem staff – comprising model-based analysis and considered judgement – constituted a key input into the Governing Council’s decision-making.",
        "It was underlined that the projections exercises were used by the markets and the broader public to judge the coherence of the Governing Council’s actions.",
        "Failing to react decisively to a worsening inflation outlook embodied in the current projections was argued to undermine their role, on the one hand, and as likely to lead to doubts about the Governing Council’s determination in pursuing and delivering on its price stability objective, on the other.",
        "It was reiterated that, in line with the outcome of the ECB’s strategy review, the Governing Council should react symmetrically and equally forcefully to inflation being below and above its medium-term target.",
        "Although monetary policy was unable to influence the inflation outlook in the short term, the projections now showed above-target inflation rates for 2024 and well into 2025, a prolonged period over which monetary policy did affect the inflation outlook.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that the inflation projections for the latter years of the projection period were subject to very high uncertainty and might underestimate the effect of a swift monetary policy tightening following a very long period of highly accommodative monetary policy.",
        "From this perspective, it was noted that the staff projections for inflation converged to target by mid-2025, and that the profile for core inflation continued to show a very pronounced deceleration, with risks around the baseline going in both directions.",
        "The elevated uncertainty was seen as suggesting a gradual approach and keeping a medium-term orientation, rather than unduly shortening the policy-relevant horizon.",
        "Moreover, in view of the significant increase in interest rates stemming from past monetary policy decisions, some of the effects had yet to feed through to the real economy.",
        "The Governing Council had to be careful not to dampen demand excessively as rates moved into restrictive territory, thereby exacerbating the projected recession.",
        "All in all, it was argued that the significant upward revision to the inflation projections, notably in the latter years of the projection period, would likely come as a surprise to market participants and would be perceived as inconsistent with market expectations for the interest rate path, on which the projections were based.",
        "The view was widely shared that the monetary policy stance had to be tightened decisively, as the current configuration of interest rates and expectations embodied in market pricing was not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back to target in a timely manner.",
        "Consequently, it was maintained that interest rates had to rise above the levels that market participants were currently expecting and had to remain at sufficiently restrictive levels for longer to reduce inflation and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations.",
        "Such an adjustment of the monetary policy stance was deemed to be also in line with the Governing Council’s communication of a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach to its monetary policy decisions.",
        "On the basis of these considerations, members agreed that tightening the monetary policy stance steadily and sustainably by both increasing interest rates and reducing the size of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet was warranted.",
        "A large number of members initially expressed a preference for increasing the key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points, as inflation was clearly expected to be too high for too long and prevailing market expectations and financial conditions were plainly inconsistent with a timely return to the ECB’s 2% inflation target.",
        "Hence, the worsened inflation outlook required an interest rate hike larger than that priced in by markets.",
        "Failing to exceed market expectations could be regarded as confirming market views on the future policy path, which could result in the yield curve not shifting upwards to the extent required to bring inflation back to target.",
        "It was argued that, given the unfavourable data and inflation outlook that had become available with the December projections, the Governing Council’s data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach required an interest rate increase of the same size as in October to counter an unwarranted loosening of financial conditions and the monetary policy stance.",
        "It was maintained that a 75 basis point increase would speak for itself and was preferable to relying on the alternative approach of a 50 basis point move accompanied by strengthened communication on the way forward.",
        "A risk management approach to addressing persistent inflation pressures was also seen as calling for decisions that erred on the side of determined action to prevent an unanchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "Raising interest rates by less than 75 basis points would send the wrong message and risked being perceived as inconsistent with the 2% inflation target in the medium term, thereby reinforcing the perception of an asymmetry in the Governing Council’s reaction function.",
        "Some of these members, nonetheless, expressed their willingness to agree on a 50 basis point rate rise if a majority were to support the proposal put forward by Mr Lane, taking into account the strengthened communication on the Governing Council’s policy intentions and the enhanced message that the Governing Council would continue raising rates significantly at a sustained pace, which were also part of the proposal.",
        "This was in some ways seen as broadly equivalent to raising rates by 75 basis points at the present meeting, because a less frontloaded but steadier approach to bringing interest rates to restrictive levels could be seen as consistent with the more persistent nature of the inflation process and continued elevated uncertainty.",
        "Taking all into account, a broad majority of members supported Mr Lane’s proposal to raise the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and to communicate that interest rates would still have to rise significantly at a steady pace to reach levels that were sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% medium-term target.",
        "A 50 basis point increase was judged to constitute an appropriate pace at which monetary policy could be tightened in a manner that was still expeditious, while recognising the uncertainties surrounding the state of the economy and the inflation outlook.",
        "It was noted that as interest rates were approaching estimates of a neutral level, the frontloading of interest rate increases and the speed of monetary tightening were becoming less relevant.",
        "Instead, the steadiness of rate hikes and the time over which interest rates remained in restrictive territory mattered more.",
        "The view was held that an increase of 50 basis points at the current meeting would allow the Governing Council to tighten monetary policy over a longer period, which was important given the increased persistence of high inflation.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that, by means of sustained 50 basis point increments, interest rates could reach sufficiently restrictive levels quickly over the course of a few meetings while allowing the Governing Council to evaluate the impact of its policies along the way.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that a 50 basis point interest rate hike was a significant increase by historical standards.",
        "Nevertheless, it was stressed that, in order to produce an upward shift in market expectations as regards the future path of interest rates, strong communication was required that highlighted three elements, namely that interest rates would still have to increase significantly, that they would be raised into restrictive territory, and that they would remain there for longer than the market currently expected.",
        "Communicating the prospect of a more sustained and higher interest rate path was judged as likely to have a material tightening impact on financial conditions.",
        "It was recalled that by increasing rates by 200 basis points since the summer the Governing Council had made a great deal of progress in removing monetary policy accommodation, with significant effects on the economy and the inflation outlook – some of which would become visible only with a lag.",
        "It was also stressed that the Governing Council would simultaneously announce the start of a reduction in reinvestments of maturing securities in the APP portfolio and that the ongoing TLTRO repayments were also contributing to an accelerated reduction in the size of the overall Eurosystem balance sheet.",
        "While such a move was broadly in line with market expectations, the implications for financial markets were uncertain.",
        "This was seen as calling for a cautious approach to raising interest rates.",
        "The concern was voiced that a larger interest rate rise could heighten the risks to financial stability and – together with the announcement of a reduction in APP reinvestments and the large early repayment of TLTRO borrowing – trigger financial market volatility.",
        "Finally, a 50 basis point interest rate increase was also seen as appropriate in view of the projected decline in inflation over the coming months, due in part to base effects and fiscal measures.",
        "Other members maintained their position in favour of a rate increase of 75 basis points, regarding it as the most straightforward response to financial conditions becoming inconsistent with the expectation of inflation remaining higher for longer, as embodied in the staff projections, with risks remaining tilted to the upside.",
        "Strengthening communication was deemed important in this environment but did not constitute a substitute for a larger rate increase or a remedy for an insufficiently large increase.",
        "The view was held that the proposed adjustment of the monetary policy stance was insufficient – even taking into account the combination of a 50 basis point interest rate hike with the announcement of a reduction in APP reinvestments.",
        "Turning to the policies affecting the size and composition of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, members widely agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to communicate the key principles for reducing the APP portfolio.",
        "From March 2023 the portfolio would decline at a measured and predictable pace of €15 billion per month on average, as the Eurosystem would not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities.",
        "This was seen as a welcome further step in the normalisation of the ECB’s monetary policy stance, in keeping with the Governing Council’s long-standing communication that it stood ready to flexibly adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returned to its medium-term target.",
        "It was recalled that interest rates were the Governing Council’s primary tool for setting the monetary policy stance.",
        "While all elements of the monetary policy stance needed to be considered together, it was cautioned that interest rates and balance sheet adjustments should not be regarded as substitutes that could be traded off against each other within the proposed policy package.",
        "A normalisation of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy securities holdings was seen as a necessary complement to the ongoing tightening of interest rate policy, signalling the Governing Council’s willingness to align all of its instruments so that they worked in the same direction.",
        "In the light of the current high inflation rates, with interest rates having moved away from their lower bound, accommodative liquidity conditions were no longer seen as required.",
        "Moreover, a timely announcement would reassure market participants that the reduction of the APP portfolio would take place in a measured and predictable way.",
        "Some members expressed a preference for reducing the APP portfolio at a faster pace or for terminating reinvestments altogether.",
        "It was recalled that the decision affected only part of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy portfolios, as it applied to the APP but not to the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).",
        "Moreover, a more rapid pace of portfolio reduction had to be seen in the context of the very fast monthly pace of net purchases when the portfolio was built up.",
        "The view was held that investors were able to absorb new issuances even without the Eurosystem’s presence in the market.",
        "Starting passive balance sheet reductions as part of the normalisation process was regarded as overdue, with markets having already expected the ECB to make announcements in this respect at the time of the October monetary policy meeting.",
        "An earlier or more significant reduction in the APP portfolio would also help policy space to be regained for the future.",
        "The view was also expressed that, while staff estimates of the impact of balance sheet reductions on economic output and inflation assumed symmetry – i.e.",
        "they assumed that the policy would work through the same channels as had been observed in the balance sheet expansion phase – there were reasons to believe that the effects of quantitative tightening would be asymmetric and weaker.",
        "It would therefore be better to regard the portfolio reduction as an element of normalisation operating in the background, with interest rates being the ECB’s primary tool for setting the monetary policy stance.",
        "It was cautioned, however, that too fast a pace of reduction could lead to the re-emergence of bond market fragmentation, which could make further interest rate increases more difficult to pursue.",
        "From that perspective, a moderate pace was seen as more appropriate, in particular as a reduction of the balance sheet was estimated as likely to have only a limited impact on the inflation outlook.",
        "On the basis of the foregoing discussion, it was agreed to announce an average pace for the reduction of the APP portfolio that would apply from the beginning of March 2023 and in the second quarter only, leaving the pace in subsequent periods to be decided on and communicated at a later point in time.",
        "This would allow the Governing Council to evaluate investors’ reactions in the coming months and to recalibrate the pace as necessary.",
        "A remark was made that the principles and modalities guiding the normalisation of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy securities holdings would always be consistent with the outcome of the Governing Council’s monetary policy strategy review, including with regard to the ECB’s obligation to support the general economic policies in the European Union without prejudice to the attainment of the primary objective of price stability.",
        "Members also agreed with the proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the PEPP portfolio.",
        "Maintaining the existing flexibility in PEPP reinvestments was seen as an efficient pre-emptive approach to countering a potential re-emergence of risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic and could be justified on the grounds of prudence.",
        "Members broadly agreed to communicate that inflation remained far too high and was projected to stay above the Governing Council’s 2% medium-term target for too long.",
        "It was emphasised that signalling an intention to move policy rates sufficiently into restrictive territory at a steady, sustained pace to bring inflation back to target in a timely manner was a necessary and powerful message in view of the revised inflation outlook.",
        "The view was held that, against the backdrop of the upward revision to the inflation outlook, explaining the reasoning behind the Governing Council’s decision was particularly important in the absence of more forceful policy action.",
        "Consistency and coherence in the Governing Council’s communication was called for, as this was seen as strengthening its impact on market expectations.",
        "At the same time, concern was expressed that communicating an expectation that interest rates would still have to rise significantly at a steady pace to reach levels that were sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to the Governing Council’s target could be perceived as a departure from the Governing Council’s data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach and as reintroducing a form of interest rate forward guidance.",
        "This could focus attention on future meetings and might give rise to problems of time inconsistency, as the appropriate path might, in the light of new information, turn out to be different from that currently envisaged.",
        "Instead, it was suggested that communication should acknowledge that, in view of the current inflation outlook, interest rates needed to be raised for longer to higher levels than were currently priced in by markets and taken into account in the Eurosystem staff inflation projections.",
        "It was also suggested that the Governing Council should strengthen its calls for fiscal policies to avoid exacerbating inflationary pressures by keeping measures temporary, targeted and tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy.",
        "In this context, fiscal vulnerabilities and the need to conclude the reform of the EU’s economic governance framework could also be addressed.",
        "Finally, it was seen as appropriate to reiterate that the Governing Council stood ready to flexibly adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returned to its medium-term target of 2%.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel started her presentation by noting that the market’s immediate response to the dramatic geopolitical upheaval in the Middle East, following the terrorist attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, had so far been contained.",
        "Bolstered by continued robust economic growth in the United States, the surge in global long-term bond yields that started over the summer had continued in recent weeks, as investors were increasingly internalising the prospect of interest rates staying high for longer.",
        "At the same time, expectations for the future path of short-term interest rates had remained broadly unchanged.",
        "Long-term sovereign bond yields had risen globally.",
        "Yields on both sides of the Atlantic were now approaching levels seen from 2005 to 2007 during the last monetary policy tightening cycle.",
        "The differential between US and euro area ten-year interest rates had fallen back to the levels observed when the ECB started increasing its key policy rates in July 2022.",
        "On aggregate, the recent rise in sovereign bond yields in the euro area had been predominantly driven by an increase in the risk-free rates.",
        "However, the rise in yields had not been uniform across euro area countries.",
        "Idiosyncratic factors had likely contributed to these developments, and there had been no signs of market fragmentation.",
        "The question arose as to why long-term risk-free rates had risen so sharply at a time when most central banks were nearing the end of the tightening cycle.",
        "A decomposition of the increase into real rates and the inflation component showed that the higher ten-year overnight index swap (OIS) rate since the beginning of September 2023 had entirely reflected a rise in the real interest rate.",
        "Furthermore, a substantial change could be seen in the term premium, which had increased by around 25 basis points since early September.",
        "ECB staff analysis suggested that the repricing of term premia was likely to have largely emanated from the United States as a result of policy and macro spillovers.",
        "Looking at the evolution of the ten-year term premia for the United States and the euro area since the last tightening cycle that started in 2005, the US term premium had remained exceptionally compressed.",
        "From a historical perspective, this was exceptional for periods in which interest rates were above the effective lower bound.",
        "In the euro area, the term premium had been rising continuously and persistently for over a year.",
        "This rise in risk compensation had been broadly expected, as uncertainty about the inflation and policy outlook had increased.",
        "However, in the euro area too, the term premium remained visibly below the levels observed during the previous tightening cycle.",
        "The timing of the rise in the global term premium could be explained by the coincidence of three broad factors.",
        "The first factor was that many investors had become convinced earlier this year that a global recession was imminent and that central banks worldwide would have to cut interest rates substantially in 2024.",
        "Policy expectations had changed substantially since then, however.",
        "Investors currently expected cumulative rate cuts of around 60 to 70 basis points in 2024 in the euro area, down from 100 basis points in May.",
        "In the latest ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts, median expectations regarding the timing of the first 25 basis point cut had been pushed out to September 2024, from June 2024 previously.",
        "At present, investors appeared less certain that the fight against inflation could be rapidly won.",
        "This was a global phenomenon extending to many advanced economies.",
        "It raised uncertainty about the entire future path of short-term interest rates, resulting in a higher term premium.",
        "The second factor that had likely contributed to the sudden rise in the term premium was related to changes in the supply of, and demand for, US Treasuries.",
        "By comparison, net issuance in the euro area was generally expected to be lower in 2024 than in 2023.",
        "This was happening as the odds of a policy pivot in Japan were increasing.",
        "The market was currently pricing in the Bank of Japan exiting negative rates by April 2024, with the potential for another adjustment in its Yield Curve Control framework as early as October 2023.",
        "The third factor that had likely reinforced the increase in the global term premium had been investors’ positioning in the US Treasury market.",
        "In the euro area, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations illustrated by the five-year forward index-linked swap rates five years ahead had finally started to come down from their cyclical highs, although they remained volatile and well above 2%.",
        "Measures of inflation compensation had declined across the curve, with most of the change at longer tenors reflecting a decline in the inflation risk premium.",
        "The decline in inflation compensation was particularly notable in the current environment, as the conflict in the Middle East implied that risks to energy prices were skewed to the upside.",
        "On aggregate, gas futures prices and oil prices were appreciably higher than they had been a few months ago.",
        "The fact that measures of inflation compensation had declined in this environment suggested that the tightening stemming from the ECB’s interest rate hike in September 2023, in combination with higher real rates as a result of global spillovers, had fostered the market’s confidence in the Governing Council’s commitment to bring inflation back to its 2% target in a timely manner.",
        "The speed and magnitude of the rise in real rates, together with the conflict in the Middle East, were also affecting risk assets by weighing on risk sentiment.",
        "Stock market volatility had increased visibly, although it remained well below the levels seen after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",
        "Global stock market valuations had declined considerably in recent weeks.",
        "That said, valuations in the euro area remained above the levels observed before the start of the monetary policy tightening cycle.",
        "One reason was the resilience of the equity risk premium.",
        "Although economic sentiment had deteriorated measurably, the risk premium had been constant.",
        "A similar phenomenon was observed in the corporate bond market.",
        "These marked deviations from past regularities suggested that, when interest rates went up, the risk-taking channel of policy transmission might work differently from when rates went down.",
        "Nevertheless, there were differences across rating categories.",
        "Credit spreads for higher-rated issuers had been largely insensitive to the rise in yields.",
        "In contrast, the spreads of riskier, high-yield issuers had widened more measurably in recent weeks, although even these were nearer the lows recorded during the current cycle than the highs.",
        "The speed of the bond market rout had also left a significant mark on foreign exchange markets.",
        "Since mid-July the euro had fallen by nearly 6% against the US dollar.",
        "This constituted a headwind to the Eurosystem’s efforts to reduce inflation in a timely manner.",
        "The appreciation of the US dollar during this time had been broad-based.",
        "So, from a foreign exchange perspective, real yields in the United States were likely seen as a sign of strength by investors, as growth was holding up better than expected.",
        "Mr Lane then went through the latest economic, monetary and financial developments in the global economy and the euro area.",
        "Starting with the global economy, Mr Lane pointed to global growth momentum continuing to slow.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had fallen for the fourth consecutive month in September, as the deterioration in the services sector converged towards the contractionary readings for manufacturing.",
        "In China, the real estate sector continued to be a drag on growth, but the GDP figure for the third quarter of the year suggested that the economy may be finding its footing again.",
        "In contrast, while the US economy had remained robust in the third quarter, it was now showing clearer signs of deceleration.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 13-14 September, the euro had depreciated both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms.",
        "Its previous appreciation was still adversely affecting euro area trade.",
        "The escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas was increasing uncertainty and posed upside risks to oil and gas prices over the near term.",
        "So far, however, the impact on futures prices further ahead had been limited.",
        "Oil prices were higher than both at the time of the September meeting and at the cut-off date for the September ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area.",
        "However, the negative slope of the current oil futures curve was steeper than in the projections.",
        "Mr Lane also recalled that, after a period of elevated levels, crack spreads (the difference between crude oil prices and prices for refined products such as petrol and diesel) had fallen by 36% since the September meeting, while gasoline crack spreads had even fallen by 90%.",
        "For the overall energy prices for consumers it was important to monitor the prices of both refined and crude oil.",
        "For its part, the gas market still faced a number of supply risks.",
        "Gas prices remained lower than at the cut-off date for the September staff projections but were higher than at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "As regards other commodities, the overall pattern remained one of declining prices for metals and food, which could be linked to the weaker global economy.",
        "The euro area economy had remained weak in the third quarter.",
        "The European Commission’s composite economic sentiment indicator and the PMI pointed to declining consumer confidence and business activity.",
        "Manufacturing output continued to fall in October, according to the flash release, owing to lower inventories, declining orders and tighter financing conditions.",
        "Housing and business investment contracted, as demand weakened in response to higher borrowing costs.",
        "The decline in housing investment had in fact already started in the second quarter of 2022, with a rebound at the start of 2023 driven by the positive impact of the mild winter.",
        "The PMI and the forward-looking indicators of the European Commission pointed to a further decline in housing investment in the fourth quarter of 2023.",
        "It was evident that the construction sector accounted for a large part of the weakness in overall activity.",
        "In contrast to housing investment, business investment had held up for a sustained period of time, helped by backlogs being worked through.",
        "In the second quarter of 2023, business investment had increased only marginally and new orders were pointing to a contraction in the second half of the year.",
        "The outlook for investment would have been significantly worse without the support of the Next Generation EU programme.",
        "Although demand in contact-intensive services sectors still exceeded pre-pandemic levels and activity in tourism remained supportive, the services sector was losing steam.",
        "This was due to the fact that weaker industrial activity had started to spill over to business-oriented services, the impetus from reopening effects was fading and the impact of higher interest rates was broadening across sectors.",
        "The services PMI had continued its decline in October, according to the flash release, and had been in contractionary territory since August.",
        "Private consumption was expected to have remained weak in the third quarter.",
        "Looking ahead, while the European Commission’s consumer confidence indicator had been improving until spring 2023, it had started to deteriorate again in the summer months and remained well below its historical average.",
        "Turning to trade, the outlook for exports was weakening.",
        "Survey data for September 2023 showed that new export orders for both goods and services remained in contractionary territory, indicating that the global weakness continued to weigh on euro area exports.",
        "Furthermore, firms had worked through their backlogs, suggesting that the support coming from this factor was fading.",
        "Another key factor dampening the demand for euro area goods was the loss of competitiveness as a result of persistently high energy prices and the past appreciation of the euro.",
        "The labour market was still resilient, with the unemployment rate at a historical low of 6.4% in August.",
        "Momentum was starting to soften, however, as the economy remained weak.",
        "Employment expectations had declined further in October for both services and manufacturing, according to the PMI flash release, with manufacturing employment expectations falling to their lowest level since August 2020.",
        "The labour force had expanded further in the second quarter of the year and was now 2.3% larger than before the pandemic, but fewer new jobs were currently being created.",
        "Turning to fiscal policy, the draft budgetary plans for 2024 indicated a significant decline in support measures, which would imply a restrictive fiscal stance.",
        "However, this restrictive stance was not reflecting austerity measures but the winding-down of energy subsidies.",
        "The risks to economic growth remained tilted to the downside.",
        "Growth could be lower if the effects of monetary policy turned out stronger than expected.",
        "A weaker world economy would also weigh on growth.",
        "Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict sparked by the terrorist attacks in Israel were key sources of geopolitical risk.",
        "This could result in firms and households becoming less confident about the resilience of the world economy and more uncertain about the future, and dampen growth further.",
        "Conversely, growth could be higher than expected if the still resilient labour market and rising real incomes meant that people and businesses became more confident and spent more, or the world economy grew more strongly than expected.",
        "Headline inflation had dropped markedly in September to 4.3%, in line with the September staff projections.",
        "It was also expected to come down further in the near term, before a temporary mechanical uptick around the turn of the year.",
        "The decline in September was visible across all the main components, confirming the general disinflationary process that was under way.",
        "Energy prices had fallen by 4.6% on account of negative base effects, and food inflation, while still high, had decreased to 8.8%.",
        "Inflation excluding energy and food, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICPX), had also dropped sharply in September, to 4.5%.",
        "This was 0.2 percentage points lower than expected in the September staff projections.",
        "The fall had been supported by improving supply conditions, the pass-through of previous declines in energy prices, the impact of tighter monetary policy on demand and corporate pricing power.",
        "Non-energy industrial goods inflation had fallen to 4.1% in September, with the monthly dynamics now reverting to historical averages.",
        "Services inflation had declined for the second consecutive month in September, to 4.7%.",
        "This had been driven in part by the discontinuation of the €9 public transport ticket in Germany last year and the reduction in the impact of changes in HICP weights.",
        "However, it might also have reflected some softening of activity in the travel and tourism sectors with the fading out of post-pandemic reopening effects.",
        "Most measures of underlying inflation continued to decline.",
        "Measures that adjusted for past energy and supply shocks had largely confirmed their downward trajectory in August.",
        "The adjusted Persistent and Common Component of Inflation measure – a good predictor of inflation developments in the past – was now close to 2%.",
        "At the same time, domestic inflation remained persistent and had hovered around 5.5% until August, before edging down to 5.2% in September.",
        "The still high level of this indicator underscored the significance of continuing wage pressures for underlying inflation.",
        "Moving to the latest wage developments, negotiated wage growth had remained robust in the third quarter.",
        "However, the Indeed wage tracker, which captured wage growth for new hires, showed continued evidence of an easing of wage pressures.",
        "Contacts in the corporate sector had reported ongoing strong wage growth, although Corporate Telephone Survey respondents expected some moderation next year.",
        "Overall, the available indicators continued to suggest that the wage forecast included in the September staff projections was broadly on track.",
        "Wage developments would need continuous monitoring in the months ahead, as most wage negotiations would only take place at the start of 2024.",
        "The Corporate Telephone Survey also suggested that profit margins had been squeezed during 2023 and would contract further in 2024.",
        "This evidence was in line with the expected decline in profit margins over the coming quarters, embedded in the September staff projections.",
        "Inflation expectations reported in the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters had remained broadly unchanged in October.",
        "Most of the distribution had remained concentrated around 2%.",
        "The ECB Consumer Expectations Survey showed that consumers had not yet adjusted downwards their perception of past inflation.",
        "This could suggest that willingness to revise perceived inflation downwards was not as sensitive to actual developments in inflation as willingness to revise it upwards.",
        "Consumer inflation expectations had moved up in September, particularly for the one-year ahead horizon.",
        "While these developments were in line with those in countries outside the euro area, such as the United States, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and appeared to be linked to the recent increase in energy prices, they needed close monitoring.",
        "The risks to inflation remained twofold.",
        "On the one hand, upside risks to inflation could come from higher energy and food costs.",
        "The heightened geopolitical tensions could drive up energy prices in the near term while making the medium-term outlook more uncertain.",
        "Extreme weather, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could push food prices up by more than expected.",
        "Additionally, a lasting rise in inflation expectations above the inflation target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term.",
        "On the other hand, weaker demand – for example owing to a stronger transmission of monetary policy or a worsening of the economic environment in the rest of the world amid greater geopolitical risks – would ease price pressures, especially over the medium term.",
        "Turning to monetary and financial developments, short-term risk-free rates had been stable since the September monetary policy meeting.",
        "Long-term rates had risen markedly, however, resulting in some additional tightening of financing conditions.",
        "The transmission of the ECB’s past monetary policy actions to financing conditions continued to be exceptionally strong and was increasingly affecting the broader economy and dampening demand, thereby helping push down inflation.",
        "The rise in bank lending rates for firms and for households for house purchase – to 5.0% and 3.9% respectively in August – had continued to outpace previous hiking cycles, and these costs had reached their highest levels in over a decade.",
        "According to the latest euro area bank lending survey, credit standards for loans to firms and households had tightened further in the third quarter, as banks were becoming more concerned about the risks faced by their customers and were less willing to take on risks themselves.",
        "Credit dynamics had weakened further.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to firms had dropped sharply, from 2.2% in July to 0.7% in August and 0.2% in September, when a positive monthly net flow only partially compensated for the large outflow registered in August.",
        "Loans to households remained subdued, with the growth rate slowing from 1.3% in July to 1.0% in August and 0.8% in September.",
        "The annual growth rate of M3 – the broad monetary aggregate – had remained negative in September, despite a considerable monthly inflow both from the rest of the world and from a partial reversal of the large net redemptions in loans to firms in August.",
        "With positive nominal GDP growth in 2023, the currently slightly negative growth in M3 on an annual basis implied that real money growth was strongly negative.",
        "Growth in M1 – currency in circulation and overnight deposits – had increased slightly but remained highly negative.",
        "Firms and households continued to shift funds from overnight deposits to term deposits – although this had moderated somewhat in recent months – reflecting attractive rates on the latter.",
        "This continued to explain the unprecedented rates of contraction in M1.",
        "Overall, the transmission of the policy tightening to lending rates and lending volumes was strong by historical standards, even taking into account the steep path of the ECB’s policy rates in the recent past.",
        "On the basis of the three elements of the Governing Council’s reaction function, Mr Lane proposed maintaining the three key ECB interest rates at their current levels.",
        "The incoming information had broadly confirmed the Governing Council’s previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Inflation was still expected to stay too high for too long, and domestic price pressures remained strong.",
        "At the same time, inflation had dropped markedly in September and most measures of underlying inflation had continued to ease.",
        "The Governing Council’s past interest rate increases continued to be transmitted forcefully into financing conditions.",
        "This was increasingly dampening demand and thereby helped push down inflation.",
        "Holding the key ECB interest rates at their current levels would confirm the Governing Council’s assessment in September that the rates were at levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, would make a substantial contribution to a timely return of inflation to target.",
        "This was supported by a range of model-based simulations suggesting that, while the tightening cycle had so far had a substantial downward impact on inflation and GDP growth, the further tightening in the pipeline from the current policy stance would press down further on inflation over time.",
        "By its December monetary policy meeting the Governing Council would have new data on GDP growth for the third quarter, the October and November inflation figures, fresh monetary data and a new round of projections.",
        "The Governing Council’s future decisions should ensure that the key ECB interest rates would be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.",
        "The Governing Council should continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction.",
        "In particular, its interest rate decisions should remain based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Finally, preserving the option to apply flexibility in pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) reinvestments with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic continued to be warranted.",
        "As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane that, while the latest trade data had been better than expected, the near-term outlook for trade had deteriorated compared with the September ECB staff projections.",
        "The question was raised as to what extent this was still compatible with expectations that euro area export demand would pick up and be a driver of a strengthening economy in the period ahead.",
        "However, it was also stressed that growth in both China and the United States had been better than expected, which pointed to improvements in the international environment.",
        "Turning to commodity markets, it was argued that the 1970s were not a good benchmark for assessing the impact of the latest spikes in oil prices, as energy substitution was easier now than it had been then.",
        "Moreover, wholesale gas prices, which had been the main source of recent high levels of energy inflation, had remained well below previous peaks.",
        "At the same time, concerns were expressed that the developments in the Middle East could lead to energy-related supply shocks, which, as in the 1970s, would have negative consequences for both growth and inflation worldwide.",
        "With regard to economic activity in the euro area, members generally concurred with Mr Lane that the economy remained weak and the outlook was deteriorating.",
        "Subdued foreign demand and tighter financing conditions were increasingly weighing on investment and consumer spending.",
        "Recent information suggested that manufacturing output had continued to fall and that the services sector was also weakening.",
        "Several factors were at play here: subdued industrial activity was spilling over to other sectors, the impetus from the post-pandemic reopening effects was fading and the impact of higher interest rates was broadening across sectors.",
        "The economy was likely to remain weak for the remainder of 2023.",
        "However, as inflation fell further, household real incomes recovered and the demand for euro area exports picked up, the economy should strengthen over the coming years.",
        "It was widely underlined that the outlook for the global economy and for the euro area was surrounded by elevated uncertainty.",
        "In this context, members noted that the weaker outlook for economic growth since the September monetary policy meeting implied a materialisation of the downside risks that had already been identified at the time of that meeting.",
        "Nowcasting tools indicated lower growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 than had been expected in the September ECB staff projections, and even implied that there would be a technical recession.",
        "It was suggested that continuing weakness in the fourth quarter would increase concern about whether activity would really pick up gradually in that quarter, as had previously been expected, or whether weakness could persist well into 2024.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that, while PMI indicators still pointed towards a deeper downturn, they might have lost some predictive power.",
        "Furthermore, the latest information pointed to stagnating activity rather than a deep recession.",
        "There were therefore concerns that the weaker short-term outlook, combined with a slight worsening of external demand and a further tightening of financing conditions, could also imply weaker than expected growth in 2024 and 2025.",
        "More fundamentally, the question was raised as to where the improvement in economic activity projected by staff in September would come from if growth was currently slowing in all components of demand – namely consumption, investment and exports – and while fiscal and monetary conditions were tightening.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that even a somewhat weaker growth outlook was still compatible with a “soft landing” narrative, as entailed in the September ECB staff projections, if inflation continued to decline and real incomes recovered.",
        "The observed weaker growth also partly reflected the successful transmission of tighter monetary policy.",
        "This transmission was well advanced and its impact now appeared to be close to peaking.",
        "The bleaker short-term outlook thus did not stand in the way of the gradual recovery in 2024 and 2025 expected in the staff projections.",
        "A soft landing scenario was seen to be supported by sound household balance sheets.",
        "Available data suggested that higher savings in the second quarter of this year reflected, to a large extent, repayments of loans rather than increased cash holdings.",
        "While this suggested that households were not imminently about to start consuming more, the improvement in balance sheets was positive for financial stability and made household positions safer in the longer term.",
        "Turning to employment, it was noted that the strength of the labour market had so far been supporting economic activity.",
        "Members emphasised different aspects of the latest data.",
        "On the one hand, they noted that the labour market was still tight and had once again performed better than expected, with a historically low unemployment rate.",
        "Firms holding on to their employees was an essential part of the narrative that growth would resume owing to higher spending.",
        "Moreover, even a limited increase in unemployment would still be compatible with a soft landing scenario.",
        "On the other hand, the point was made that signs of labour market weakening constituted an important change from earlier assessments.",
        "The concern was expressed that the strong performance of the labour market was in part due to labour hoarding and thus was fragile.",
        "It was argued that labour markets in Europe today were much more exposed to the vagaries of external shocks and that adjustments, when they occurred, would be stronger than before.",
        "If the weakness in foreign demand were to continue, this could be transmitted to the labour market in a more abrupt manner and therefore implied downside risks to growth.",
        "In this context, it was also noted that both productivity and average hours worked per person employed had not yet fully recovered from the pandemic, and that it was uncertain whether the economy could find itself in a new normal where these two indicators were simply lower on a structural basis.",
        "This also had implications for the inflation outlook in the medium term.",
        "With regard to fiscal policies, members reiterated that, as the energy crisis faded, governments should continue to roll back the related support measures.",
        "This was essential to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would otherwise call for even tighter monetary policy.",
        "Fiscal policies should be designed to make the economy more productive and to gradually bring down high public debt.",
        "Structural reforms and investments to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity – supported by the full implementation of the Next Generation EU programme – should help reduce price pressures in the medium term, while supporting the green and digital transitions.",
        "To that end, the reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be concluded before the end of the year and progress towards a capital markets union and the completion of the banking union should be accelerated.",
        "Members noted that countries’ draft budgetary plans remained broadly in line with the assumption of a slightly more restrictive fiscal stance in 2024 than in 2023 for the euro area as a whole, as incorporated in the September ECB staff projections.",
        "However, further analysis of the impact of the economic cycle and the current economic slowdown on the overall budget balance and the cyclically adjusted balance was seen as warranted.",
        "Another issue was the sustainability of recent and future debt developments.",
        "In particular, it was pointed out that recent reductions in debt-to-GDP ratios reflected, to a large extent, the impact of high inflation and should not be interpreted as policy-driven consolidation efforts.",
        "With inflation receding, these windfall gains could not be counted on any longer, and the impact of higher interest rates on government funding costs was also yet to have its full effect.",
        "Concerns were expressed that ongoing discussions on the fiscal rules in the context of the deliberations about the EU’s economic governance framework could imply a vacuum for 2024, as the Stability and Growth Pact had not yet been replaced by new regulations.",
        "Disciplined fiscal policies were considered paramount for achieving price stability.",
        "However, it was argued that the current fiscal stance risked pushing in the opposite direction, including via measures that altered borrowing costs and could hence be seen as directly interfering with monetary policy transmission.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that fiscal tightening without structural reforms would be of limited help and that the economy needed support from the supply side.",
        "Members assessed that the risks to economic growth remained tilted to the downside.",
        "Growth could be lower if the effects of monetary policy turned out stronger than expected.",
        "A weaker world economy would also weigh on growth.",
        "Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict sparked by the terrorist attacks in Israel were key sources of geopolitical risk.",
        "This might result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future, and could dampen growth further.",
        "Conversely, growth could be higher than expected if the still resilient labour market and rising real incomes meant people and businesses became more confident and spent more, or if the world economy grew more strongly than expected.",
        "It was noted that while downside risks identified earlier had materialised, additional risks and uncertainty had arisen since the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting.",
        "This related mainly to the impact of the conflict in the Middle East, particularly if it were to escalate further.",
        "As this had come on top of the war in Ukraine, the resulting uncertainty could make firms more apprehensive, leading to less demand for investment.",
        "Given that developments in China also remained a source of fragility, it was suggested that downside risks mainly stemmed from the external environment.",
        "These also included the possibility of spillovers from the United States, owing to euro area long-term yields moving higher in tandem with those in the United States.",
        "At the same time, recent positive surprises suggested that developments in the United States and China could also turn out better than expected.",
        "Overall, while growth continued to be weak, the Eurosystem staff projections in December would provide a more comprehensive picture.",
        "Turning to price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The incoming information had largely confirmed the previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Inflation had dropped to 4.3% in September, which was due partly to strong base effects, with the decline broad-based.",
        "In the near term, inflation was likely to come down further, as the sharp increases in energy and food prices recorded in autumn 2022 would drop out of the yearly rates.",
        "However, energy prices had risen again recently and had become less predictable in view of the new geopolitical tensions.",
        "Regarding headline inflation, members observed that the latest developments had been broadly in line with the September ECB staff projections.",
        "Furthermore, it was remarked that the indicators of underlying inflation had been moving in the right direction over recent months and that most had passed their peak and were continuing to decline.",
        "Costs, notably for industrial raw materials, had fallen and, overall, pipeline price pressures continued to decline and were being passed through to consumer prices.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that domestic price pressures remained strong, reflecting the persistence of services inflation and the impact of continuing wage pressures on underlying inflation.",
        "There had been increases in momentum across most components of headline inflation, with the exception of services inflation.",
        "Members noted that the latest information on wages also appeared to be broadly in line with the expectations entailed in the September ECB staff projections.",
        "It was highlighted that the increase in the wage drift component had been stronger than growth in negotiated wages.",
        "Wage drift being more sensitive to cyclical developments could, however, also imply a more pronounced weakening of wage growth dynamics if demand were to weaken and employment to stagnate.",
        "It was remarked that there had been limited signs of second-round effects and no evidence of wage-price spirals thus far.",
        "In cumulative terms, real wages in the euro area remained subdued compared with at the beginning of the inflationary process.",
        "Information from the ECB wage trackers on recently signed wage agreements pointed to continued strong wage growth.",
        "While this was expected to moderate over time, the decline had yet to materialise and was subject to high uncertainty.",
        "Rising energy prices might delay or dampen the expected decline in wage growth, as they might be used to justify higher wage demands.",
        "Measures of longer-term inflation expectations were mostly around 2%, but some indicators remained elevated and needed to be monitored closely.",
        "The recent decline in market-based inflation compensation was seen as a welcome development and in line with a reinforced credibility for bringing inflation back to target.",
        "However, it was also the case that markets were more forward-looking in their expectations, while the expectations of households and parts of the business sector had strong backward-looking elements.",
        "This difference needed to be borne in mind in case there were new surprises in inflation.",
        "In this context, inflation expectations were seen as fragile, as was visible in the renewed uptick in consumer expectations, possibly in response to the higher energy prices.",
        "Moreover, in the latest ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters, respondents had seen an upshift in the balance of risks for inflation expectations at the two-year horizon and a one-third probability that inflation would be above 2.5% in the longer term.",
        "Members also considered that the increased uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth translated into additional uncertainty for the outlook for inflation, particularly beyond the short term.",
        "It was noted that headline inflation would likely continue to decline in the near term, largely owing to base effects.",
        "At the turn of the year, a temporary rebound in headline inflation could be expected because of energy-related base effects.",
        "Members underlined that the outlook for wage growth continued to be highly uncertain.",
        "The picture for wage developments would only gradually crystallise during the course of next year, in view of the long lags between hard data releases.",
        "It was argued that the strong decline observed in headline inflation and the increased confidence in inflation returning to the ECB’s target should help contain upward pressure on wages in coming negotiations.",
        "The high levels of uncertainty surrounding the outlook for wages, as well as the outlook for productivity and average hours worked per person employed, implied a highly uncertain outlook for unit labour costs and, in turn, for inflation.",
        "Moreover, unit profits also played a crucial role in determining the future path of inflation.",
        "It was noted that the previous upward shift of profit margins could prove temporary if cyclical conditions weakened.",
        "At the same time, an easing in other cost factors might help mitigate any upward pressures on margins.",
        "Against this background, members assessed that there were both upside and downside risks to inflation.",
        "Upside risks could come from higher energy and food costs.",
        "The heightened geopolitical tensions could drive up energy prices in the near term and make the medium-term outlook more uncertain.",
        "Extreme weather, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could push food prices up by more than expected.",
        "Higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, or a lasting rise in inflation expectations above target, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term.",
        "By contrast, weaker demand – for example owing to a stronger transmission of monetary policy or a worsening of the economic environment in the rest of the world amid greater geopolitical risks – would ease price pressures, especially over the medium term.",
        "There were differing views on the overall balance of risks for inflation.",
        "Some members viewed the overall balance as tilted to the upside, owing to upside risks to wage growth and energy prices.",
        "Upside risks could also stem from the impact of the recent depreciation of the euro, primarily against the US dollar.",
        "Other members saw inflation risks as balanced, with inflation broadly seen evolving as projected and converging back to the 2% target over the medium term, possibly even with a risk of undershooting.",
        "Some downside risks to core inflation were seen, owing to economic activity being weaker than expected and recent data for core inflation being slightly lower than expected.",
        "Regarding the consequences of further negative supply shocks, specifically related to energy, the view was expressed that such a scenario was unlikely to play out in the same way as the large commodity price shocks of 2021-22, which had coincided, amid persistent supply bottlenecks, with the release of pent-up demand and the post-pandemic reopening.",
        "The increases in oil prices stemming from the conflict in the Middle East had so far been limited, and the market had seen the recent increase as a spike rather than a very persistent shift.",
        "The weaker aggregate demand due to tighter monetary policy should, in principle, induce firms to either resist large increases in unit labour costs or absorb them into profit margins rather than pass them on to consumers.",
        "It was argued that the large increases in profit margins in 2022 suggested that in future there would be scope to absorb higher energy costs into margins.",
        "Still, the upside risks from higher energy prices – coming after a long period of inflation substantially above target – were not seen as insignificant, even if the current macroeconomic environment was quite different.",
        "In this context, any persistence in higher energy prices could trigger further second-round effects, especially with a large number of wage agreements being negotiated at the start of the coming year.",
        "This could imply a delay or a reduction in the expected decline in wage growth.",
        "Overall, the risks posed by the geopolitical environment, including direct or indirect effects of higher commodity prices or its impact on economic sentiment among firms and households, warranted close monitoring.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The most significant development since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting was the marked rise in longer-term interest rates, reflecting large increases in other major economies, notably the United States.",
        "The decline in the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead was also noted.",
        "This had contributed to a more pronounced increase in real interest rates and was seen as a welcome sign of the credibility of the Governing Council’s recent monetary policy actions.",
        "Overall, the rise in long-term rates and the correction of risk asset prices were judged as further tightening financial conditions, while the depreciation of the euro had the opposite effect.",
        "Members discussed a range of explanations for the rise in US longer-term interest rates, which could also have different implications for expected spillovers to the euro area.",
        "These explanations included better than expected US macroeconomic developments supporting narratives of rates remaining high for longer, and a rise in the term premium.",
        "An increase in potential output in the United States or rising concerns about the financing requirements associated with persistently high US budget deficits could both have pushed up the natural interest rate.",
        "It was noted that technical factors were playing a role.",
        "It was also argued that an environment of quantitative tightening – lacking stable demand for bonds from central banks – would naturally increase the term premium, as the market clearing rate for long-term bonds was higher than before, especially in the face of spikes in volatility as seen recently.",
        "There was broad agreement that spillovers from the United States were a major driver of the increase in euro area longer-term interest rates, contributing to a rise in euro area OIS rates of just over 20 basis points since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "It was noted that the developments were not related to the underlying economic fundamentals and the inflation outlook in the euro area, and that they were driven by the term premium component rather than the expectations component of long-term interest rates.",
        "In this regard, it was also argued that euro area fiscal policy may have played a role in driving term premia higher.",
        "An additional possibility was that financial markets had started to price in a higher natural interest rate for the euro area.",
        "Members generally agreed that the rise in longer-term interest rates in the euro area had tightened financing conditions by more than anticipated.",
        "It was argued that this made it more likely that the Governing Council’s monetary policy stance was restrictive enough, although there were still uncertainties around this assessment.",
        "There were different views on the desirability of higher long-term rates for the euro area.",
        "On the one hand, they could be seen as undesirable in that they were not linked to euro area developments but contributed to additional tightening.",
        "This could unnecessarily weaken economic activity by more than intended and might cause inflation to undershoot.",
        "Moreover, higher long-term rates could render fiscal sustainability more challenging for some euro area countries.",
        "On the other hand, higher long-term rates could be welcomed after a long period in which term premia had been substantially compressed.",
        "They would strengthen monetary policy transmission to activities based on longer-term credit and signal to governments that longer-term borrowing would be more costly in the future.",
        "In addition, such tightening would enhance the credibility of inflation returning to target in a timely manner and be consistent with maintaining the policy rates at sufficiently restrictive levels for an extended period.",
        "From an economic growth perspective, the impact on the euro area depended on whether the rise in US long-term interest rates was being driven by better growth prospects for the US economy, which would imply positive spillover effects via stronger euro area external demand.",
        "Members agreed that monetary policy continued to be transmitted strongly into broader financing conditions.",
        "Funding had become more expensive for banks, and average interest rates for business loans and mortgages had risen again in August, although rates on longer-term loans to non-financial corporations had declined.",
        "The latest bank lending survey indicated a further sharp drop in credit demand in the third quarter, driven by higher borrowing rates and cuts in investment plans and house purchases.",
        "Credit standards for loans to firms and households had also tightened further.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that the resilience of the banking sector was not seen as a concern, that the latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises suggested financial constraints remained contained in a historical comparison, and that the latest Corporate Telephone Survey suggested banks were still willing to lend to firms in most sectors of the economy.",
        "Against this background, monetary and credit aggregates continued to decline rapidly.",
        "Amid weak lending and the reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet, M3 continued to contract sharply.",
        "In August it had fallen, in annual terms, at the fastest rate recorded since the introduction of the euro and in September had remained negative.",
        "Credit dynamics had weakened further, with the annual growth rate of loans to firms dropping sharply and that of loans to households remaining subdued.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that there were no indications of financial amplification, i.e.",
        "weaknesses in the banking sector reinforcing negative macroeconomic developments.",
        "Moreover, the earlier large negative flows in credit to non-financial companies were seen as driven mainly by a decline in short-term lending, typically associated with the financing of working capital needs and inventories.",
        "Moreover, loan momentum was not falling as quickly as previously, with the large negative net flows recorded in August partly reversed in September.",
        "Still, monetary transmission via the bank lending channel was generally seen to have been stronger than previously anticipated, including by banks themselves, and to have led to a significant tightening of financing conditions.",
        "It was also noted that transmission could have been even stronger if it had not been for structural labour shortages and resilient risk sentiment in the financial markets, as reflected in robust equity markets and relatively compressed risk premia.",
        "At the same time, it was mentioned that the services sector, which was accounting for most of the persistence of inflation, appeared not to be very sensitive to the tightening of financing conditions according to the Corporate Telephone Survey.",
        "Three out of four services firms had not seen an impact from tighter financing conditions on their business activity over the past 12 months and the ratio was even higher looking ahead over the next 12 months.",
        "Financial conditions still had indirect effects on the services sector through the slowdown in the growth of aggregate demand.",
        "Nevertheless, until recently, this had been compensated for by strong reopening effects.",
        "It was highlighted that for some countries the reduction in mortgage lending was a particular concern.",
        "Reference was made to a few countries that had introduced measures to support the mortgage market, which were counteracting the effect of monetary policy measures to bring down inflation.",
        "However, it was observed that this was not a general situation across the euro area and, overall, it was widely felt that monetary transmission was working well and was strong yet gradual and orderly.",
        "Looking ahead, it was argued that further transmission was still to come as fixed rate lending was rolled over, especially in countries with a higher ratio of fixed to variable rate loans.",
        "This suggested that transmission was unfolding only very gradually owing to long mortgage fixation periods.",
        "Moreover, attention was drawn to large cash buffers in parts of the corporate sector that could reduce the need for new borrowing for some time, in conjunction with the inventory cycle coming to an end.",
        "The extent of additional transmission remained uncertain but there was a possibility that it could strengthen further, in part because higher long-term interest rates could dampen growth in long-term credit.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that the latest bank lending survey suggested banks were expecting to tighten credit standards to a lesser extent in the coming quarter.",
        "Such an outcome would mean that, all else being equal, this subset of financing conditions might soon plateau.",
        "Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members highlighted that the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook had increased compared with at the time of the September Governing Council meeting, also affecting the assessment of the appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that financing conditions had tightened on account of the spillovers from the United States, which increased confidence that – barring significant deviations in inflation from the September ECB staff projections – the monetary policy stance was sufficiently restrictive and would bring inflation back to target in a timely manner.",
        "Moreover, the view was held that markets had revised their expected interest rate path to higher levels, which – if maintained for some time – would contribute to a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "It was cautioned, however, that in view of the tight labour market the current level of policy rates might not be as restrictive as generally thought.",
        "Moreover, the fact that market participants had also moved back the date at which they expected a first rate cut was seen as evidence that they did not perceive a risk of overtightening.",
        "Against this background, members assessed the data that had become available since the September monetary policy meeting in accordance with the three main elements of the “reaction function” that the Governing Council had communicated earlier in the year.",
        "These comprised the implications of the incoming economic and financial data for the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Overall, the view was held that all three elements of the reaction function were moving in the right direction, providing clear evidence that monetary policy was working as intended.",
        "Starting with the inflation outlook, members broadly concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Overall, the process of disinflation seemed to be proceeding largely as expected, reflecting not only diminishing effects from exogenous factors that had been pushing inflation up, but also the impact of monetary policy.",
        "Headline inflation had evolved as projected, although growth had turned out to be weaker than expected, partly owing to a materialisation of downside risks.",
        "It was noted that the slowdown in economic activity was also reflecting the dampening effect of past interest rate increases.",
        "At the same time, comfort was drawn from the fact that forecast errors for inflation were close to zero and, if anything, the disinflation process was proceeding somewhat faster than expected.",
        "Overall, these developments were seen as creating confidence that this process would continue, bringing inflation back to target in a timely manner.",
        "It was cautioned, however, that most of the dampening effects from past interest rate increases on inflation had yet to materialise over the coming two years, for which uncertainty – stemming mainly from future wage dynamics, fiscal policy and geopolitical risks – was still high.",
        "If upside risks to inflation from these factors materialised, it would likely take some time before their effects on inflation became evident.",
        "Moreover, it was recalled that monetary policy faced challenges in addressing the effects of adverse supply shocks on inflation.",
        "Overall, it was maintained that, given the current outlook, it could be expected that the Governing Council would be able to bring inflation back to its 2% target by 2025.",
        "Although it was generally assumed that the “last mile” in bringing inflation back to target was the most difficult, it was argued that the Governing Council should be careful that its efforts to tame inflation did not eventually lead to an undershooting of the target.",
        "Members agreed that most indicators of underlying inflation appeared to have passed their peak and continued to decline, a signal for which the Governing Council had been waiting for months.",
        "At the same time, domestic inflation was stubbornly high and longer-run inflation projections still seemed to be above the Governing Council’s target.",
        "Turning to the assessment of monetary policy transmission, members generally agreed that transmission was proceeding more strongly than had been anticipated in September.",
        "Moreover, a significant part of the interest rate pass-through was still pending and likely to restrain activity and inflation over the projection horizon.",
        "It was also pointed out that all successful disinflationary periods had required a prolonged period of rates in restrictive territory and weakening labour markets.",
        "At the same time, downside risks were highlighted that could strengthen transmission to economic activity and inflation even further.",
        "In any case, it was stressed that there was no room for complacency, as the difficult part of the disinflation process was only starting.",
        "Inflation dynamics over the remainder of the year would likely be characterised by various base effects that could be misinterpreted as a reversal in the inflation trend and lead to market volatility, although the inflation uptick would be short-lived and would not change the overall disinflationary outlook.",
        "In this context, it was cautioned against declaring victory over inflation at the current stage, when inflation was still more than twice the ECB’s target.",
        "Overall, confidence was expressed in the progress made, although it was seen as important to maintain the restrictive stance for a sufficient time.",
        "With rates in restrictive territory, patience and persistence were needed to ensure that inflation converged towards the medium-term target in a timely manner.",
        "The Governing Council would assess incoming data as they arrived and act if needed.",
        "Against this background, all members agreed with the proposal by Mr Lane to maintain the three key ECB interest rates at their current levels.",
        "All three elements of the Governing Council’s reaction function were considered to support the case for a “hold” in the hiking cycle, after ten consecutive increases in interest rates.",
        "Confidence was expressed that the current monetary policy stance was sufficiently restrictive, which gave the Governing Council the opportunity to keep rates at current levels and take time to assess the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "It was observed that markets were expecting policy rates to stay high for a longer period than predicted ahead of the Governing Council’s September meeting.",
        "Expectations were moving from a hump-shaped interest rate path – one that macroeconomic models tended to prescribe as optimal – to a flatter profile with a later first cut in the deposit facility rate.",
        "It was deemed important for the Governing Council to avoid an unwarranted loosening of financial conditions.",
        "Moreover, members argued in favour of keeping the door open for a possible further rate hike, in keeping with the Governing Council’s emphasis on data-dependence.",
        "While the decision at the September meeting had been a close call, the interest rate hike in September had reinforced progress towards the price stability objective.",
        "Another important element had been the definition of the 2% inflation target that the Governing Council had introduced following its monetary policy strategy review in 2021.",
        "It was noted that throughout this inflation episode, market and survey-based indicators of medium-term inflation expectations had remained anchored at target.",
        "Members agreed that the focus of the current meeting was communication rather than action.",
        "It was seen as necessary for the Governing Council to adapt its communication to the considerable uncertainty surrounding the evolving economic and inflation outlook during a phase in which the economy was slowing down.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that the Governing Council should strive for continuity and consistency and stick to its previous communication as closely as possible to avoid sending a message of complacency.",
        "Members agreed that the Governing Council should continue to stress its determination to set policy rates, through its future decisions, at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary to bring inflation back to target in a timely manner.",
        "In view of the high uncertainty and the risk that further supply shocks could materialise, the Governing Council’s data-dependent approach was also reaffirmed.",
        "Even if interest rates were left unchanged at the current meeting, the view was held that the Governing Council should be ready, on the basis of an ongoing assessment, for further interest rate hikes if necessary, even if this was not part of the current baseline scenario.",
        "In conclusion, it was stressed that the Governing Council had to be both persistent and vigilant.",
        "Persistence was seen as essential to bring inflation back to 2% in the medium term.",
        "This was also meant to convey perseverance and patience in the face of new shocks that could materialise.",
        "Vigilance implied that, while the Governing Council had to assert the effectiveness of its measures and to acknowledge the progress that had been made, overconfidence and complacency had to be avoided in view of possible new challenges that could lie ahead until inflation was brought back to target.",
        "Members also agreed with the Executive Board’s proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the PEPP portfolio.",
        "There was broad agreement that continuity in PEPP reinvestments would be consistent with a decision to keep interest rates unchanged at the October meeting, while a discussion of an early termination of PEPP reinvestments at the current meeting was seen as premature.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel noted that, since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 3-4 May 2023, the narrative in financial markets had shifted from global tail risks – emanating from the banking sector tensions and the US debt ceiling debate – towards concerns about a deterioration in the euro area macroeconomic outlook and more persistent core inflation pressures globally.",
        "Global market conditions had further normalised as tail risks to the economy had subsided.",
        "Volatility in financial markets had decreased notably across market segments and countries, suggesting that risks of systemic stress were currently contained.",
        "Stock market implied volatility in the United States, as measured by the VIX volatility index, had declined to its lowest level since the beginning of 2020.",
        "Market conditions had also normalised across market segments in the euro area.",
        "Banks had restarted primary market issuance activity not only for covered bonds and senior bonds, but more recently also for subordinated bonds.",
        "Moreover, banks’ asset swap spreads of subordinated and senior bonds had decreased substantially, but remained slightly above the levels seen before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).",
        "Spreads of non-financial corporate bonds had remained broadly stable and stood below the average levels recorded in 2022.",
        "Developments in sovereign bond markets had been even more benign.",
        "Sovereign spreads relative to overnight index swap (OIS) rates had decreased during the market turmoil in March and had continued to narrow since then.",
        "Both the start of partial reinvestments and the expected end of reinvestments under the asset purchase programme (APP) had been absorbed smoothly by the market.",
        "Nevertheless, sovereign spreads had remained sensitive to fundamentals, as illustrated by the response to recent shifts in rating outlooks.",
        "Negative macroeconomic data surprises had sparked investor concerns about a deterioration in the economic outlook.",
        "However, developments in equity markets argued against the hypothesis that markets were pricing in a severe economic downturn.",
        "Equity indices for euro area banks and non-financial corporations had seen only small changes.",
        "Moreover, defensive equity sectors, i.e.",
        "stocks which tend to be more stable during periods of expected economic weakness, had underperformed sectors more sensitive to the business cycle.",
        "Developments in long-term risk-free bond yields had also provided little indication that negative data surprises had left a significant mark on the economic growth outlook.",
        "A decomposition of long-term yields into real rates and the inflation component in the euro area showed that real rates were slightly up since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 3-4 May 2023, and only marginally down since the collapse of SVB.",
        "In the United States, real interest rates had continued to recover strongly from the banking sector turmoil.",
        "Markets were no longer pricing in the banking sector stress driving a significant wedge between the growth outlook in the euro area and the United States.",
        "This was also evident in the gap between ten-year real rates, which had widened again and was now as large as in early March.",
        "The divergence in risk-free rates in the euro area vis-à-vis the United States had also been reflected in the EUR/USD exchange rate.",
        "The euro had depreciated by around 3% since the previous monetary policy meeting, closely tracking movements in interest rate differentials.",
        "Regarding the evolution of interest rate expectations, the front end of the euro short-term rate (€STR) forward curve had remained broadly unchanged.",
        "The forward curve was pricing in two more 25 basis point rate hikes – one at the present meeting and another in July – and a 20% probability of an additional 25 basis point hike afterwards, implying a peak deposit facility rate slightly above the level that had been expected at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "The inversion of the forward curve had moderated.",
        "By contrast, the US federal funds futures curve had shifted upwards markedly since the previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "Uncertainty about the future path of monetary policy in the euro area had declined substantially since the collapse of SVB.",
        "Volatility in expected euro area short-term interest rates had reached its lowest level since May 2022, before the start of the ECB’s rate hiking cycle, reflecting the increasing convergence of monetary policy expectations among market participants.",
        "The reduction in uncertainty about the ECB’s medium-term policy rate path seemed somewhat at odds with market participants’ inflation expectations.",
        "Inflation-linked swap forward rates had continued to gradually increase from their mid-March lows.",
        "Remarkably, this repricing had come despite the weaker macroeconomic data as well as softer than expected inflation data releases and falling commodity prices.",
        "The increase in inflation-linked swap rates could partly be attributed to rising inflation risk premia, also reflecting the fact that many commodity prices appeared to be subject to pronounced upside risks for which investors demanded compensation.",
        "Such risks also related to food prices, which were exposed to upside risks posed by Russia’s war in Ukraine as well as to a rising probability of more frequent extreme weather events occurring this year as a result of El Niño.",
        "The second factor driving up inflation compensation was the increase in expected core inflation rates.",
        "Market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation in the euro area had trended upwards since the summer of 2022, amid some volatility.",
        "The persistent upward trend of these measures was unique among major currency areas.",
        "Option prices also pointed to rising upside risks to inflation.",
        "Such elevated and rising market-based inflation expectations over the medium and long run indicated that investors may have some doubts as to whether the currently priced-in ECB policy rate path was sufficient to rein in inflation in a timely manner.",
        "Real one-year OIS rates one year ahead were currently 45 basis points below their level before the SVB collapse and were expected to remain at around 0.25% or lower over the coming years.",
        "Ms Schnabel then turned to the market impact of some of the ECB’s recent policy decisions.",
        "As announced in February, the ceiling for the remuneration of government deposits held with the Eurosystem and for the rate on deposits of non-euro area residents held under the Eurosystem reserve management services framework had been set at a spread of 20 basis points below the euro short-term rate (€STR) from 1 May 2023.",
        "Overall, the new level of remuneration for these deposits had achieved the desired effects.",
        "Nevertheless, developments would be closely monitored to assess whether the pricing had been adequately calibrated.",
        "Turning to the implications of the upcoming large repayments due under the targeted longer-term refinancing operation (TLTRO) in June, banks were expected to predominantly draw on their excess liquidity holdings as well as on market funding.",
        "Recourse to the ECB’s regular refinancing operations – the main refinancing operations and three-month longer-term refinancing operations – would be a natural choice for banks that required other funding sources.",
        "Starting with the outlook for the global economy, Mr Lane recalled that, after a rebound in the first quarter of the year, global economic growth had decelerated, especially in advanced economies, and was heavily skewed towards the services sector.",
        "The gap between the global output Purchasing Managers’ Indices for the services and manufacturing sectors had reached a historical high.",
        "The euro had depreciated both against the US dollar and in effective terms since the last monetary policy meeting.",
        "Oil futures had remained broadly stable and natural gas futures prices were lower than at the time of the May Governing Council meeting.",
        "Non-energy commodity prices had declined, with both food and metal prices falling compared with the last meeting.",
        "The euro area economy had stagnated in recent months: contracting public and private consumption and a negative contribution from inventories had only partly been offset by expanding net trade and investment.",
        "Business investment had held up in the first quarter of 2023, thanks to the easing of supply bottlenecks, as car production in particular had resumed.",
        "At the same time, survey data pointed to only a modest recovery in the second quarter of the year.",
        "Developments had diverged sharply across sectors also in the euro area.",
        "Hard data and surveys indicated very weak activity in the manufacturing sector amid feeble demand and the running down of order backlogs.",
        "By contrast, the services sector remained resilient, still benefiting from the stimulus provided to contact-intensive services by the reopening of the economy.",
        "However, historical patterns suggested that the weakness in manufacturing could spill over to the services sector in the months ahead.",
        "One possible reason for expecting a lagged slowdown in services related to the fact that monetary policy had been shown to have a more powerful and faster effect on manufacturing than on services.",
        "The contractionary impact of monetary policy was gradually reaching the components of aggregate demand that were typically more sensitive to interest rate changes, namely housing and business investment, as well as durable goods consumption.",
        "Expectations of higher mortgage rates weighed heavily on the perceived attractiveness of housing as an investment, while short-term indicators suggested a weakening in business investment owing to tighter financing conditions and falling orders.",
        "Consumers were also less inclined to purchase big-ticket items, and survey-based evidence suggested that a rising share of households with variable rate mortgages expected to have difficulties in making their mortgage payments on time.",
        "At the same time, private consumption was still expected to pick up, driven by remaining pent-up demand for contact-intensive services following the pandemic and by rising incomes as a result of nominal wage increases and rising employment.",
        "Looking ahead, a modest increase in exports was also expected.",
        "The June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area had revised the outlook for GDP growth downwards slightly for 2023 and 2024, while leaving it unchanged for 2025.",
        "Average annual real GDP growth was expected to slow to 0.9% in 2023 (from 3.5% in 2022), before rebounding to 1.5% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025.",
        "Output was expected to increase over the projection horizon.",
        "On the supply side, favourable developments included the ongoing expansion in productive capacity after the pandemic, the easing of supply bottlenecks and the expansion in labour supply (including through immigration).",
        "Demand was expected to increase owing to rising domestic incomes, underpinned by a robust labour market; the improvement in the terms of trade and the associated decline in uncertainty; and the recovery in foreign demand.",
        "At the same time, the scale of the recovery in demand would be constrained by the ECB’s policy tightening.",
        "Together with a gradual withdrawal of fiscal support, tighter financing conditions would restrict economic activity in the medium term.",
        "Downside risks to economic growth included Russia’s war against Ukraine and an increase in broader geopolitical tensions, which could fragment global trade and thus weigh on the euro area economy.",
        "Growth could also be slower if the ECB’s monetary policy was transmitted more forcefully than expected.",
        "Renewed financial market tensions could lead to even tighter financing conditions than anticipated and could weaken confidence.",
        "Moreover, weaker growth in the world economy could further dampen economic activity in the euro area.",
        "However, growth could be higher than expected if the strong labour market and receding uncertainty meant that people and businesses became more confident and spent more.",
        "The labour market remained strong.",
        "The unemployment rate had stood at its historical low of 6.5% in April.",
        "Employment continued to benefit from a strong increase in the labour force, while demand for labour remained at high levels, including as a result of labour hoarding.",
        "At the same time, average hours worked per person employed was still somewhat below pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Wage pressures continued to strengthen, adding to underlying inflation pressures.",
        "Nevertheless, recent wage increases were broadly in line with the March staff projections and therefore had not led to a reassessment of the wage pressures for 2023 in the June projections.",
        "At the same time, in some sectors profit levels placed employers in a favourable position to absorb wage increases even as the scope for price increases declined.",
        "There had been large increases in unit profits between the first quarter of 2022 and the fourth quarter of 2022 across all sectors, ranging from around 15% in contact-intensive services to around 23% in agriculture.",
        "In the first quarter of 2023, by contrast, some divergence had started to emerge across sectors.",
        "While the energy, utility and construction sectors had seen another strong increase in unit profits, the manufacturing sector and contact-intensive services sectors had seen declining unit profits.",
        "This implied that the sizeable wage increases had not been passed on to customers in the first quarter.",
        "This early evidence of lower unit profits in both manufacturing and contact-intensive services was consistent with the baseline assumption of declining unit profits in the June projections.",
        "Headline inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had declined to 6.1% in May, from 7.0% in April.",
        "Following an uptick in April, energy inflation had resumed the downward trend seen since last autumn.",
        "Food inflation was likely to have peaked in March and stood at 12.5% in May.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food (HICPX, or core inflation) had also declined for a second consecutive month, reaching 5.3% in May.",
        "In terms of pipeline pressures for food and goods inflation, there was an ongoing improvement at earlier stages of the production process.",
        "This improvement was expected to translate into a reduction in pressures from input costs over the rest of the year.",
        "A number of indicators of underlying inflation – notably trimmed measures, exclusion-based measures and model-based indicators, such as the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI) – showed signs of softening.",
        "The “Supercore” indicator and wage-sensitive components of the HICPX were levelling off, while domestic inflation was still continuing to increase, reflecting continued strong wage growth and demand for contact-intensive services.",
        "This configuration suggested that the external drivers of underlying inflation (rising energy costs and supply bottlenecks) were easing, but rising wages and ongoing effects from the reopening of the economy were still putting upward pressure on the domestic component of underlying inflation.",
        "The different dynamics of goods inflation compared with services inflation, which were related to differences in the tradability and labour content of the different inflation components, implied that it was important to look separately at underlying measures of these two components of the HICP.",
        "For goods inflation, the Supercore and PCCI measures had both been declining, with the PCCI having been on a downward path since the end of 2022.",
        "The significant downward adjustment of the PCCI indicator largely reflected the decline in energy prices, since a large share of goods production was energy-intensive.",
        "Momentum in goods inflation was also on a downward path.",
        "By contrast, for services inflation the underlying measures and the momentum did not yet point to any visible decline.",
        "While the PCCI indicator for services had stabilised, the Supercore measure was still on an upward trend.",
        "Services inflation had declined marginally in May; however, these data were in part affected by a new, cheaper monthly ticket for public transport in Germany.",
        "Turning to inflation expectations, respondents in the Survey of Monetary Analysts had kept their expectations for 2025 and 2026 unchanged.",
        "The Consumer Expectations Survey showed that consumer inflation perceptions and expectations had both decreased significantly in April and May after the temporary increase in March.",
        "The June staff projections saw headline HICP inflation slightly above the path envisaged in previous exercises.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to decrease from 8.4% in 2022 to an average of 5.4% in 2023, 3.0% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025.",
        "The downward impact from lower energy price assumptions was more than offset by upward revisions in food inflation and core inflation.",
        "Underlying price pressures remained strong.",
        "Staff had revised up their projections for core inflation, especially for this year and next year, owing to past upward surprises and the implications of the robust labour market for the speed of disinflation.",
        "The staff projections now saw core inflation averaging 5.1% in 2023, before declining to averages of 3.0% in 2024 and 2.3% in 2025.",
        "Russia’s war against Ukraine remained a significant upside risk to the inflation outlook, as it could push energy and food costs up again.",
        "A lasting rise in inflation expectations above the ECB’s inflation target of 2%, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term.",
        "Recent wage agreements in a number of countries had added to the upside risks to inflation.",
        "By contrast, renewed financial market tensions could bring inflation down faster than projected.",
        "Weaker demand, for example owing to a stronger transmission of monetary policy, would also lead to lower price pressures, especially over the medium term.",
        "Moreover, inflation would come down faster if declining energy prices and lower food price increases were to pass through to the prices of other goods and services more quickly than was currently anticipated.",
        "Tighter monetary policy continued to be transmitted to bank funding costs.",
        "Together with increases in spreads on subordinated bank bonds and on hybrid instruments, and the increased cost of equity for banks, the impact of monetary policy tightening on the risk-free yield curve continued to drive up lending rates for firms and households.",
        "The cost of borrowing for firms had increased to 4.4% in April and mortgage rates had risen to 3.4%.",
        "Average monthly flows of lending to firms had been negative since November last year, and lending had also contracted slightly in April.",
        "Small and newer firms, which tended to be more dependent on bank credit, faced particularly steep increases in their borrowing rates and weak loan flows.",
        "Overall, the recent contraction in credit had exceeded the scale indicated by historical patterns.",
        "The short-term dynamics of monetary aggregates had weakened further since the start of the year.",
        "The three-month annualised growth rate of M3 had been negative since the start of the year, despite the cushioning effect generated by the shift from overnight to term deposits.",
        "This development was connected with the monetary policy tightening in several ways: amid weak lending, loan flows were not supporting money growth; reducing the size of the Eurosystem balance sheet mechanically drained money from the system; banks had increased their long-term funding, mainly via bond issuance, to replace maturing TLTRO funds; and, finally, the additional issuance of government bonds was not being fully absorbed by banks, with some being absorbed by other sectors, in particular households, which had further reduced M3.",
        "On the basis of an assessment of the three elements of the ECB’s reaction function – the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission – Mr Lane proposed raising the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at the present meeting.",
        "The profiles of headline inflation and core inflation had shifted upward in the June staff projections compared with the previous exercise, albeit only slightly for 2025.",
        "Indicators of underlying price pressures remained strong, although some showed tentative signs of softening.",
        "At the same time, the accumulated policy tightening was increasingly taking hold in the economy, as the tighter monetary policy stance seemed to be gradually felt in real activity.",
        "Mr Lane also proposed confirming the end of reinvestments under the APP as of July.",
        "In view of the benign developments in euro area bond markets, market participants expected that reinvestments would stop.",
        "Moreover, private investors had been able to smoothly absorb the large-scale public sector issuance since the beginning of the partial APP run-off.",
        "At the same time, preserving the option to apply flexibility to reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme as a first line of defence against fragmentation risks continued to be warranted, also in view of the proposed end of APP reinvestments in July.",
        "The current constellation of data and projections argued for continuity in communicating the Governing Council’s orientation for its next monetary policy meetings.",
        "As in May, the Governing Council needed to convey the message that future decisions would ensure that policy rates would be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to the target and would be kept at those levels for as long as necessary.",
        "Emphasis on data-dependence would allow the Governing Council to adjust the course, as appropriate, in what was still a highly uncertain environment.",
        "By the July meeting, in addition to another monthly inflation data release, the Governing Council would also be able to observe the impact of the repayment of the large TLTRO III operation coming due later in June and any market effects of the end of APP reinvestments in July.",
        "In addition, there would be other evidence on the impact of the Governing Council’s measures, including new vintages of the ECB euro area bank lending survey and the Corporate Telephone Survey.",
        "The emphasis on data-dependence and a clear reaction function provided a suitable framework for reflecting this information in future policy rate decisions.",
        "In line with its monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council needed to assess, in depth, the interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability at the present meeting.",
        "The financial stability outlook had remained challenging since the Governing Council’s last review in December 2022.",
        "Tighter financing conditions had raised the funding costs of banks and the credit risk of outstanding loans.",
        "Together with the recent tensions in the US banking system, these factors could give rise to systemic stress and depress economic growth in the short term.",
        "Another factor that weighed on the resilience of the financial sector was a downturn in the real estate markets, which could be amplified by higher borrowing costs and a rise in unemployment.",
        "At the same time, euro area banks had strong capital and liquidity positions, which mitigated these financial stability risks.",
        "Macroprudential policy remained the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities.",
        "As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane that the downward revision of expectations for foreign demand – despite the reopening of China – and for the dynamics of competitors’ import prices were two important elements in the Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Slower increases in prices in the rest of the world would help contain pricing power and eventually dampen core inflation in the euro area.",
        "The question was raised as to whether the possible effects of the weakness of the Chinese economy had been fully taken into account in the staff projections’ outlook for euro area foreign demand and whether China might become a source of global disinflation.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that economic surprise indices for both China and the United States had been on the upside, which cautioned against assuming that world growth was set to slow.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that the growth performance of the Chinese economy would likely have repercussions for global commodity prices and thus was a key risk factor for the euro area inflation outlook.",
        "Attention was also drawn to continued high geopolitical risks, which injected uncertainty and volatility into the outlook for global activity and inflation, notably with respect to energy and food.",
        "Reference was made in this context to the recent sizeable rebound in gas prices from earlier declines.",
        "With regard to economic activity in the euro area, members concurred with Mr Lane that the economy had stagnated in recent months.",
        "As in the fourth quarter of 2022, real GDP had shrunk by 0.1% in the first quarter of 2023, on the back of a drop in private and public consumption.",
        "Economic growth was likely to remain weak in the short run but to strengthen in the course of the year as inflation came down and supply disruptions continued to ease.",
        "Conditions in different sectors of the economy were uneven: manufacturing continued to weaken, partly owing to lower global demand and tighter euro area financing conditions, while services remained resilient.",
        "It was noted that the outcome for real GDP in the first quarter of 2023 implied a technical recession and was weaker than the figure embedded in the June staff projections, while not implying that the economy was facing a material contraction.",
        "In addition, the mechanical estimates presented by Mr Lane pointed to weaker than expected growth also in the current and subsequent quarters.",
        "From that perspective, the staff projections for real GDP growth of around 1% this year and 1½% in subsequent years could be on the optimistic side.",
        "The question was raised as to whether the current divergence between manufacturing and services was atypically strong, given that the performance of the services sector was still driven by a post-pandemic rebalancing of the economy.",
        "Attention was drawn to the decline in domestic demand in the first quarter of the year, which could be seen as a sign that the tightening of monetary policy was reaching the real economy.",
        "It was suggested that transmission had been working as expected but had thus far been concealed by tailwinds for growth, owing to the financial buffers and accumulated savings available to firms and consumers, as well as to the staggered recovery from supply bottlenecks.",
        "Although still present, the support from some of these tailwinds was now fading.",
        "Looking ahead, it was argued that the baseline growth scenario in the staff projections entailed a possibly too modest, “conservative” impact from monetary policy tightening.",
        "This was because the effects of credit supply constraints and the role of quantity and non-price effects in the credit channel of transmission more broadly were typically not explicitly reflected in traditional macro models.",
        "However, it was also noted that there was little evidence of quantity restrictions in credit provision as banks were well-capitalised and profitable.",
        "Members discussed different elements in the growth outlook and the staff projections.",
        "Supply-side bottlenecks were seen to have eased as expected, and it was noted that capacity utilisation in manufacturing was close to historical highs.",
        "This might indicate a need for additional investment over the projection horizon.",
        "In this context, reference was also made to the extra investment required to meet the EU’s 2030 climate objectives, especially in the household sector, which was estimated to amount to 2% of GDP annually in net terms.",
        "While it was possible that there would be a crowding out of investment owing to higher interest rates, it was more likely that climate-related investment was being driven by subsidies and hence would be relatively resilient to the interest rate cycle.",
        "This suggested upside risks to investment.",
        "An upside risk was also seen with regard to consumption, given the substantial accumulated savings that remained in place and the higher extra savings associated with the household saving ratio embedded in the June projections.",
        "Members widely agreed that the labour market remained a source of strength.",
        "Almost a million new jobs had been added in the first quarter of 2023 and the unemployment rate had stood at its historical low of 6.5% in April.",
        "The average number of hours worked had also increased, although it was still somewhat below its pre-pandemic level.",
        "In this context, it was emphasised that the labour market expansion was sustained through the extensive margin, i.e.",
        "by people joining the labour force, and argued that this implied a better adjustment process than was usually the case in Europe.",
        "“Marginally attached” workers were seeking work and there was a significant reduction in the number of underemployed people.",
        "However, it was warned that strong inflows into the labour market implied some fragility, as entrants needed time to learn new jobs and therefore obtain some employment stability, which could only be ensured if the economy was not stalled by excessive tightening.",
        "The point was made that, while demographic trends were typically slow-moving, in the current post-pandemic environment of labour scarcity and rapid structural changes, the impacts of such trends on labour market developments and on wages could become visible even within a conventional projection horizon.",
        "The role of a high level of employment in supporting aggregate demand and stronger wage pressures due to an increase in the bargaining power of workers was emphasised.",
        "As high employment was currently a manifestation of improvements on the supply side, this was consistent with expectations that there would be no material recession and that price pressures would fall over time.",
        "However, it was argued that a situation combining full employment with economic stagnation was difficult to rationalise in standard models.",
        "Accordingly, the question was raised as to whether one should not expect Okun’s law to eventually enforce some consistency between the labour market and economic activity.",
        "The same relationship could also be at work in bringing the unemployment gap into better alignment with the output gap – two measures of slack that had been misaligned in more recent times.",
        "It was argued that the potentially persistent rise in sick leave, fall in productivity and decline in average hours worked may negatively affect potential output.",
        "In this context, it was emphasised that there was a need for supply-side reforms and improvements, so that the strong labour market would be accompanied by higher productivity growth.",
        "Members concurred that, as the energy crisis receded, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and in a concerted manner.",
        "In doing so, they would avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would otherwise call for a stronger monetary policy response.",
        "Fiscal policies should be designed to make the euro area economy more productive and gradually bring down high public debt.",
        "Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, could also help reduce price pressures in the medium term.",
        "The reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be concluded soon.",
        "It was felt that risks in the fiscal domain were skewed towards a later and insufficient withdrawal of stimulus in a number of jurisdictions and for the euro area as a whole.",
        "Against this background, members concurred that the economic outlook remained highly uncertain.",
        "It was recalled that the latest GDP numbers and results from “nowcasting” models used to estimate very recent or current figures already implied a downside risk to growth relative to the June staff projections.",
        "Beyond that, downside risks to growth included Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and an increase in broader geopolitical tensions, which could fragment global trade and thus weigh on the euro area economy.",
        "Growth could also be slower if the effects of monetary policy were more forceful than projected.",
        "Renewed financial market tensions could lead to even tighter financing conditions than anticipated and weaken confidence.",
        "Additionally, weaker growth in the world economy could further dampen economic activity in the euro area.",
        "However, growth could be higher than projected if the strong labour market and receding uncertainty meant people and businesses became more confident and spent more.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that some of the risk factors mentioned could also go in the opposite direction.",
        "Monetary policy could be transmitted less strongly than projected, and the world economy could grow faster than anticipated.",
        "With regard to price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "While members considered that the second consecutive decline in core inflation was a positive signal, it was widely felt that there was as yet no sufficient or convincing evidence to confirm a turning point.",
        "It was emphasised that the momentum in price dynamics had remained strong for all components of inflation, with the exception of energy.",
        "Moreover, the outcomes for core inflation had proved stubborn and continued to be higher than projected, thus pointing to greater persistence.",
        "However, looking ahead, the degree of persistence was likely to differ across sectors – it was lower in non-energy industrial goods inflation and higher in services inflation.",
        "Clearly, the role of external shocks had already diminished and the main drivers of inflation were domestic, including a strong contribution from wages and profits.",
        "In particular, strong growth in hospitality services prices could be expected during the summer and the impact of labour costs was increasing.",
        "It was observed that, while food inflation had started to come down somewhat, it remained elevated overall, and geopolitical risks and weather and climate-related factors, including El Niño, pointed to upside risks.",
        "However, doubts were expressed about whether a particular emphasis on core inflation was justified, as it was not seen to be a leading indicator of future headline inflation.",
        "In fact, at the current juncture, the role of unwinding energy and food inflation implied that core inflation was lagging behind headline inflation.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that, beyond core inflation, all components of headline inflation needed to be analysed and the ECB monitored a wide range of measures of underlying inflation.",
        "Moreover, it was recalled that, while some measures of underlying inflation had started to decline, others had continued to grow strongly, and that a decline in underlying inflation would not be sufficient to ensure that inflation returned to the 2% target.",
        "With respect to the June staff projections, there was broad agreement that the stubbornness of inflation and higher unit labour costs were key factors in the upward revision of core inflation, especially for 2023 and 2024.",
        "At the same time, the extent of the upward revisions to inflation was also questioned, in the light of the latest, more encouraging data and with respect to changes in the assumptions underpinning the June projections compared with the March projections, in particular the assumptions of higher interest rates, lower energy prices and an appreciation of the euro.",
        "Regarding the projected speed of the decline in inflation, it was argued that there were clear disinflationary factors operating in the early stages of the disinflationary process.",
        "However, it was important to ask which factors would be operating towards the end of the projection horizon, and whether further disinflation would be harder to achieve the closer inflation came to 2%, since higher wage or inflation expectations could have become entrenched by then.",
        "On this point, it was recalled that the expected decline in inflation towards 2% was predicated on wage pressures abating; that, by 2025, real wages would have only barely made up their losses since 2019; and that profit margin and unit profit dynamics would reverse and act as a buffer against higher unit labour costs.",
        "This was seen as pointing to a very “narrow path” for getting close to the ECB’s target in 2025.",
        "It was mentioned that, in the United States, core Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation, despite reaching a turning point much earlier, was also proving to be more persistent and had repeatedly failed to come down in line with earlier Federal Open Market Committee projections.",
        "Members widely agreed with the assessment of Mr Lane in his introduction that wage pressures, while partly reflecting one-off payments, were becoming an increasingly important source of inflation.",
        "Compensation per employee had risen by 5.2% in the first quarter of 2023 and negotiated wages had risen by 4.3%.",
        "Moreover, firms in some sectors had been able to keep profits relatively high, especially where demand had outstripped supply.",
        "It was noted that the main problem companies were facing continued to be their capacity to hire skilled labour.",
        "As long as this remained the case, employment creation would come with wage pressures.",
        "Moreover, the wage drift between actual and negotiated wages was high, which was a reflection of the tight labour markets.",
        "Concern was expressed that protracted wage pressures would, in turn, contribute to greater persistence in domestic price pressures, notably as unit labour costs were increasing amid subdued growth in productivity and the continued pricing power of firms.",
        "However, it was pointed out that tightness in the labour market had emerged against the backdrop of an increasing labour force, the fast creation of short-term contracts and migration, all of which were factors that tended to reduce wage pressures.",
        "New entrants tended to take jobs paying lower wages, while job movers typically took higher-quality jobs with significant wage increases.",
        "Members assessed the outlook for wages from different angles.",
        "It was acknowledged that the baseline in the June staff projections contained substantial nominal wage growth.",
        "Recent information had pointed to strong wage growth in several countries, but it was argued that outcomes were in line with the baseline projections and did not imply an upside risk.",
        "However, it was also recalled that the projections were predicated on the assumption that pressures from wage negotiations would gradually abate.",
        "Therefore, as long as this assumption was not visible in the actual data and until there was confirmation that wage pressures had run their full course, an upside risk to wage growth remained.",
        "Moreover, given staggered wage-setting and long-term contracts in Europe, the impact of higher wages would be spread over many years to come.",
        "Likewise, there was a risk that, in some countries and sectors, union bargaining might go beyond a one-off “catch-up” of real wages with respect to pre-pandemic levels and try to make up for the trend decline in the wage share incurred during past decades.",
        "Nominal wage growth was expected to remain well above its historical average according to the June staff projections.",
        "However, it was suggested that, for the time being, this growth could still be considered moderate when viewed against the expectation that real wages would only make up their losses and return to pre-pandemic levels by 2025.",
        "While there was currently no evidence of significant second-round effects or a wage-price spiral, a note of warning was given not to underestimate the risk.",
        "After all, price levels would remain high even as inflation came down.",
        "Whether a wage-price spiral were to unfold would ultimately depend on the ability and willingness of firms to absorb higher unit labour costs in their profit margins.",
        "This, in turn, would depend on the economic environment in which firms operated, and hence on monetary policy.",
        "In this context, it was reiterated that the high levels of inflation should not lead to tit-for-tat strategies where workers and businesses sought full compensation for price and cost increases respectively.",
        "It was recalled that the euro area had been hit by a terms-of-trade shock and policymakers should communicate that, under such conditions, it would be self-defeating for social partners to aim for full compensation.",
        "In a number of smaller countries, high wage growth and high inflation had started raising concerns about a revaluation of the real exchange rate and a loss of competitiveness relative to peers.",
        "It was suspected that, in the future, this could also become an issue at the euro area level.",
        "Profits had played an important role in recent developments in output prices, and it was noted that, in the staff projections, the decline in inflation rested on the assumption that margins would shrink.",
        "This assumption was considered to be in line with past cyclical behaviour of margins in relation to labour cost developments.",
        "However, there was no evidence yet to provide reassurance that profits would revert to earlier patterns in the post-pandemic environment, and profit dynamics had already been strong for some time, notwithstanding variations in activity.",
        "It was argued that, ultimately, the behaviour of margins depended on the evolution of pricing power.",
        "The more resilient the economy remained, the bigger the risk that firms would pass the higher unit labour costs on in their prices rather than absorb them through lower profit margins.",
        "As regards inflation expectations, members took note of the assessments by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane of the latest developments in market-based measures of inflation compensation and survey-based indicators.",
        "Although most measures currently stood at around 2%, some indicators remained elevated and needed to be monitored closely.",
        "It was pointed out that market-based measures stood clearly above 2%, but were close to 2% when corrected for risk premia.",
        "However, the argument was made that the measures, while likely still broadly anchored, were standing at levels that would previously have been considered worrying and that the trend was pointing upwards.",
        "Comfort was drawn from the better news coming from the declining medium-term inflation expectations in the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey.",
        "At the same time, reference was made to the qualitative data in the European Commission’s consumer survey, which showed an unusual gap between inflation perceptions and actual inflation.",
        "This suggested that there continued to be a risk of an upward shift in inflation expectations, also in view of the long period of above-target inflation, despite the recent sharp decline in inflation.",
        "It was argued in this respect that, ultimately, inflation expectations mattered to the extent that they changed actual behaviour and then showed up in wage or price-setting in the real economy.",
        "Against this background, members considered that there were both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook.",
        "Upside risks to inflation included potential renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food, also related to Russia’s war against Ukraine.",
        "A lasting rise in inflation expectations above the ECB’s target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term.",
        "Recent wage agreements in a number of countries had added to the upside risks to inflation.",
        "By contrast, renewed financial market tensions could bring inflation down faster than projected.",
        "Weaker demand, for example due to a stronger transmission of monetary policy, would also lead to lower price pressures, especially over the medium term.",
        "Moreover, inflation would come down faster if declining energy prices and lower food price increases were to pass through to other goods and services more quickly than currently anticipated.",
        "A range of views were expressed on the risk assessment with respect to the path for inflation.",
        "Significant upside risks to headline and core inflation were seen as stemming from greater persistence and strong wage dynamics over the entire projection horizon.",
        "Specific upside risks were associated with food commodity price assumptions, possibly lasting damage to supply capacity from hysteresis effects, not sufficiently restrictive fiscal policy and weaker than projected monetary policy transmission.",
        "It was acknowledged that past forecast errors and their implications for increased inflation persistence had partly been incorporated into the baseline, but it was considered that the typical correlation of forecast errors over time still implied an upward risk in the period ahead.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that the latest evidence on strong wages and high labour costs had already been largely incorporated into the baseline projections and could therefore no longer be considered an upside risk.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members generally concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The impact of monetary policy tightening on credit and monetary dynamics was judged to be sizeable.",
        "Weak bank lending and the reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet had led to a continued decline in annual broad money growth.",
        "Credit dynamics had weakened further, owing to higher borrowing rates, tighter credit supply conditions and lower loan demand.",
        "It was maintained that the speed and extent of the contraction in lending could not be fully explained by the increase in policy rates alone or by fundamentals such as economic activity.",
        "A view was expressed that credit weakness pointed to increasing risks of an unwarranted intensification of the transmission of the monetary policy stance through the banking sector.",
        "The view was, however, also expressed that credit had remained relatively resilient in the face of sharp rate increases, and the contraction could be explained largely by weaker loan demand rather than by credit supply constraints.",
        "It was maintained, moreover, that the credit weakness had been driven mostly by a decrease in short-term loans that firms had used to finance increased working capital needs related to the earlier energy price shock.",
        "Doubts were expressed as to whether the weakness in credit exceeded the scale indicated by historical patterns, as such a comparison depended on the period considered as well as on other parameters included in the analysis.",
        "Due account needed to be taken of stocks and flows in credit, as well as the associated accumulated liquidity.",
        "The view was held that, in response to high inflation, the loan gap, i.e.",
        "the deviation of bank credit from a path that would be consistent with past cyclical patterns, tended to first decrease and only later to increase; therefore, it did not provide a reliable measure of credit supply restrictions in an inflationary environment.",
        "Furthermore, it was underlined that the euro area banking sector had weathered the turmoil in March relatively well and was profitable.",
        "It was noted that, according to ECB Banking Supervision, bank profitability had developed in a benign way since monetary policy tightening had started, which should support bank lending capacity.",
        "Moreover, according to the survey on the access to finance of enterprises, firms still had ample cash owing to the pandemic support measures, which should attenuate concerns that credit demand was not being met.",
        "Attention was drawn to the forthcoming releases of the bank lending survey and the Corporate Telephone Survey, which would shed light on these developments.",
        "At the same time, it was widely acknowledged that funding conditions had tightened for banks and credit was becoming more expensive for firms and households.",
        "Borrowing costs and non-price conditions for firms appeared to have adjusted faster than in previous tightening episodes.",
        "Regarding bank lending rates, the concern was expressed that possible bank funding tensions and increasing credit risk perceptions might translate into tighter financing conditions than those reflected in the staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "In this context it was underlined that credit conditions had been affected not only by the increase in the ECB’s policy rates, but also by the reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet, particularly against the backdrop of the coming TLTRO III repayments in June.",
        "It was noted that the rapid pace of policy rate hikes was reducing borrower creditworthiness and increasing banks’ risk perceptions, as signalled in the bank lending survey, which could be expected to dampen lending significantly.",
        "The concern was voiced that the credit tightening – in particular the consequences of the reduction in households’ net disposable income caused by higher debt servicing costs for variable rate mortgage loans – had not yet fully filtered through to the real economy.",
        "In jurisdictions with a prevalence of fixed rate mortgages, the impact of higher rates was more muted and was materialising mainly via the flow of new lending, rather than the stock of outstanding mortgages.",
        "It was argued that long rate fixation periods for mortgage debt, the slow rise in deposit rates and still high levels of excess savings were mitigating or slowing the transmission of tighter lending conditions to households.",
        "It was recalled that the share of fixed rate mortgages had increased across a number of jurisdictions during the period of low interest rates, likely dampening monetary policy transmission compared with historical precedents.",
        "The Governing Council held its biannual structured exchange on the interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability.",
        "Members concurred that the financial stability outlook had remained challenging since the last review in December 2022, as tighter financing conditions were raising the funding costs of banks and the credit risk of outstanding loans.",
        "In this context, there was seen to be a risk that excessive monetary policy tightening could hamper the smooth transmission of monetary policy and increase fragmentation risks.",
        "Another factor weighing on the resilience of the financial sector was a downturn in the real estate markets, which could be amplified by higher borrowing costs and a rise in unemployment.",
        "At the same time, confidence was expressed that euro area banks had strong capital and liquidity positions, and that macroprudential policy remained the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities.",
        "Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members overall assessed financing conditions to have tightened since the May monetary policy meeting, with past policy rate increases being transmitted forcefully to financial and financing conditions.",
        "It was noted, however, that long-term real bond yields were back to the levels that had prevailed at the beginning of the year.",
        "Market expectations regarding the policy rate path, as embedded in forward curves and revealed in surveys, had also remained relatively stable since the previous meeting, broadly pricing in two rate increases of 25 basis points for the Governing Council’s June and July meetings.",
        "Against this background, it was argued that market participants would be surprised by the upward revision of inflation, and particularly core inflation, in the June staff projections.",
        "This could trigger a repricing of the forward curve.",
        "The view was held that the level of the peak deposit facility interest rate, as well as its duration, as embodied in the forward curve and reflected in the staff projections, could be judged as insufficient to bring inflation back to the 2% medium-term target, as the projections showed inflation still lying above 2% in 2025.",
        "However, it was also underlined that the forward curve embedded in the staff projections foresaw interest rate cuts by the ECB in the first half of 2024, in line with the Survey of Monetary Analysts.",
        "As policy rates were approaching the peak of the interest rate cycle, the trade-off perceived by market participants between the level of the peak rate and its duration was seen as becoming more important.",
        "However, it was also argued that as long as the prospects for higher and more persistent policy rates were not priced into the term structure of market interest rates, that policy path would not be reflected in financing conditions.",
        "In accordance with the three main elements of its reaction function that the Governing Council had communicated earlier in the year, members evaluated developments since the previous monetary policy meeting related to the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Starting with the inflation outlook, members broadly concurred with the assessment that, with the upward revision of the inflation path in the June staff projections, inflation was still projected to remain too high for too long, calling into question whether it was returning to target in a timely manner.",
        "With upside revisions to both headline and core inflation, the return to target had again been pushed out further into the future.",
        "Moreover, upside risks to the inflation outlook were judged to still prevail, mainly owing to more persistent wage-price dynamics than those incorporated into the projections.",
        "In addition, it was recalled that, for the inflation projections to materialise, the Governing Council had still, as a minimum, to deliver two successive interest rate increases in June and July, which were embodied in the assumptions on which the projections were based.",
        "It was also argued that bringing inflation down from very high numbers to more moderate levels was easier than achieving a full return to the 2% medium-term target.",
        "In this context, it was remarked that an envisaged return of inflation to 2% towards the end of 2025 could be considered too late, because risks could materialise in the meantime that might keep inflation above the 2% target.",
        "It was seen as important for the Governing Council to stress the symmetry of its inflation objective, i.e.",
        "that upward and downward deviations from 2% were regarded as equally undesirable.",
        "Moreover, a scenario with high inflation and high interest rates was seen as possible if interest rates did not become and stay sufficiently restrictive.",
        "In contrast, it was also maintained that the staff projections, as well as the latest inflation data, showed that the initial supply-side drivers of inflation were gradually waning, although demand-side factors were gaining importance.",
        "Headline inflation had been on a declining path since October 2022 and was projected to fall further throughout the projection horizon.",
        "Moreover, the most recent incoming data had been in line with the Governing Council’s expectations, strengthening confidence that monetary policy was on the right track.",
        "At the same time, the prevailing high level of uncertainty was underlined.",
        "It was seen as important that the Governing Council’s response to the upward revision of the inflation outlook should not be perceived as a change in its reaction function, but rather as an appropriate response within the parameters of the reaction function.",
        "Emphasis was placed on the evidence that market-based measures of inflation compensation had edged up to above 2% and required close monitoring.",
        "In particular, longer-term market-based measures remained stubbornly high, which could partly be attributed to risk premia, suggesting that investors saw upside risks to the longer-term inflation outlook prevailing over downside risks.",
        "By contrast, several survey-based indicators of inflation expectations had stabilised or even decreased.",
        "Weighing up the different elements, inflation expectations were assessed to be still broadly anchored, as evidence was emerging that wage and price-setting behaviour in several euro area countries had started to moderate.",
        "In this context, the weight that was attached to the staff macroeconomic projections, as opposed to actual data, when assessing the monetary policy stance was discussed.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that the Governing Council should focus more on data than on the projections when assessing the inflation outlook.",
        "It was argued that attaching more weight to observable data would improve policy decisions, in particular when uncertainty was high.",
        "On the other hand, it was maintained that the projections were an important and useful input into the Governing Council’s decision-making.",
        "They provided discipline and a crucial benchmark for the deliberations and could be scrutinised but should not be disregarded.",
        "Members also assessed the level and persistence of underlying inflation as being a source of concern.",
        "Core inflation had again been revised up significantly in the June staff projections.",
        "It was cautioned that strong wage growth was becoming a key driver of inflation, and convincing evidence that underlying inflation had peaked was still lacking, as had been underlined by the President during her recent appearance at the European Parliament.",
        "It was highlighted, however, that according to recent data releases core inflation had stabilised and might have reached a turning point, although it was likely to be some time before underlying inflation measures embarked on a steady path of decline.",
        "In this context, it was argued that the Governing Council should not put too much emphasis on the behaviour of core inflation, as its mandate related to headline inflation.",
        "Moreover, core inflation did not represent the household consumption basket and had historically not been a good leading indicator of future headline inflation in the euro area.",
        "Finally, turning to the assessment of monetary policy transmission, members generally concurred that interest rates had reached restrictive territory, while it remained unclear at what point the stance would become sufficiently restrictive.",
        "There was evidence that the tighter policy stance was being transmitted to financing conditions, credit volumes and the real economy, while the strength of transmission and the ultimate lags in transmission to inflation remained variable and uncertain.",
        "Higher borrowing rates were seen to be contributing to a softening in demand, which was required to dampen the underlying inflation dynamics.",
        "Moreover, the point was made that the tightening impact of interest rate increases was subject to uncertainty regarding the “neutral rate”, which might be pushed up by structural changes in the labour markets and could itself be affected by monetary policy.",
        "In this context it was argued that adjustments towards a better functioning labour market needed time to unfold and would benefit from a gradual and cautious conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The transmission of monetary policy was observed to vary across euro area countries, as institutional arrangements as well as fiscal and other national policies differed.",
        "Hence, inflation was reacting to the tightening of the monetary policy stance with different lags across countries.",
        "It was also cautioned that, as the increase in policy rates had been unprecedentedly fast, the effects of past rate hikes could still be expected to materialise and exert a downward impact on growth and inflation.",
        "The argument was made, however, that if inflation expectations started to shift upwards in response to the prolonged period of high inflation, monetary policy would be transmitted less forcefully.",
        "Moreover, a higher share of services in HICP implied that changes in interest rates were slower to affect aggregate inflation.",
        "All in all, the uncertainty about the transmission of monetary policy was very high, as shown by the substantial differences in estimated effects across models.",
        "Against the background of these considerations around the Governing Council’s reaction function, members agreed that tightening the monetary policy stance by increasing interest rates further was warranted.",
        "While past rate increases were being transmitted forcefully to financing conditions and were gradually having an impact across the economy – tighter financing conditions being a key reason why inflation was projected to decline further towards the 2% medium-term target – inflation was still projected to remain too high for too long.",
        "The argument was made that in view of the worsened inflation outlook a strong signal was needed, also considering that past decisions had not been decisive enough to bring inflation back to the 2% target more quickly.",
        "Looking ahead, however, it was also maintained that continuing on a gradual tightening path would allow the Governing Council to monitor and assess the impact of past monetary policy decisions and ensure that financial conditions were adjusting in a way that was consistent with inflation moving back to the 2% medium-term target.",
        "Emphasis was put on the need to be sufficiently restrictive and persistent in the monetary policy tightening.",
        "It was seen as essential to communicate that monetary policy had still more ground to cover to bring inflation back to target in a timely manner.",
        "The view was held that the Governing Council could consider increasing interest rates beyond July, if necessary.",
        "A very broad consensus supported the 25 basis point rate increase proposed by Mr Lane, while a preference was also initially expressed for raising the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points in view of the risk of high inflation becoming more persistent.",
        "Emphasis was put on the merit of sticking to a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach in an uncertain environment, particularly as rates were moving closer to a possible peak level.",
        "A very broad consensus also prevailed in favour of confirming the end of reinvestments under the APP as of July, as proposed by Mr Lane, although a preference was also expressed for deferring the decision to a later date, after the effects of the June TLTRO III repayments on banks’ liquidity had been assessed.",
        "Overall, euro area bond markets were considered to have functioned smoothly since the beginning of the partial APP run-off.",
        "Moreover, the end of reinvestments, as signalled at the Governing Council’s previous meeting, was expected by market participants.",
        "It was noted, however, that the end of reinvestments would coincide with the June TLTRO III repayments, which would remove large amounts of excess liquidity from the system.",
        "It was noted that, in view of the discontinuation of reinvestments under the APP, the Governing Council should discuss whether further climate-related measures should be considered to ensure that the measures were fit for purpose and aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the EU’s climate neutrality objectives.",
        "Members generally agreed that the data-dependent approach to monetary policymaking, combined with the communication on the ECB’s reaction function, had served the Governing Council well and should be reconfirmed.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that, while the Governing Council might need to continue with additional interest rate steps, it would also have to be prepared to stop raising rates if required to do so by data and judgement.",
        "By July, and even more so by September, new information would become available that would allow the Governing Council to update its assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission.",
        "In this context, a data-dependent approach and meeting-by-meeting optionality were seen as essential.",
        "It was also felt that the Governing Council should stress that fiscal policy needed to be tightened in order to dampen demand and support the disinflation process.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel noted that, since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 14-15 June 2023, the narrative in global financial markets had shifted from a “higher-for-longer” scenario for inflation to growing optimism on a disinflation scenario.",
        "The increasing divergence of economic data between the euro area and the United States and the elevated sensitivity of euro area asset prices, especially to US data surprises, made the interpretation of market data challenging and could cause rapid shifts in market narratives.",
        "Following the previous monetary policy meeting, central bank communication, high UK inflation releases and strong US economic data had initially driven the euro short-term rate (€STR) forward curve higher.",
        "This upward shift had then been partly reversed in the euro area in response to the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) on 12 July as well as lower than expected Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) for the euro area.",
        "Looking through this volatility, the latest €STR forward curve still stood above the levels observed before the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "The market was pricing in one more 25 basis point rate hike at the present meeting, a 56% probability of an additional 25 basis point hike in September 2023 and a peak deposit facility rate of 3.94% by the end of the year.",
        "Market pricing was broadly in line with the results of the ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts as well as the Reuters and Bloomberg surveys, with the latter polls – conducted after the US CPI release – showing a slight majority foreseeing another rate hike in September 2023 and a peak deposit facility rate of 4%.",
        "Looking at how the recent upward shift in market expectations for the ECB’s peak rate had been related to expectations of subsequent rate cuts, no clear correlation was observed between the expected peak rate and cumulative rate cuts priced in by the end of 2024.",
        "Spillovers from the United States and the reappraisal of euro area monetary policy had been key drivers of euro area risk-free yields.",
        "With policy being more data-driven than in the period before the current global tightening cycle, the sensitivity of asset prices to macroeconomic news had generally increased strongly.",
        "Moreover, given the large common component in global inflation dynamics and the leading role of the United States in the inflation cycle, euro area risk-free yields, and asset prices more generally, appeared to show heightened sensitivity to US data surprises.",
        "A model-based decomposition of the risk-free ten-year overnight index swap (OIS) rate suggested that euro area OIS rates had initially been supported by expectations of further monetary policy tightening.",
        "Looking at developments since the US CPI release, the reversal of euro area longer-term yields had been driven by spillovers from the United States, reinforced by easing monetary policy expectations and disappointing data releases in the euro area.",
        "The shift in the market narrative had also been mirrored in EUR/USD exchange rate developments.",
        "The euro had first appreciated on the back of expectations that monetary policy would be tightened further in the euro area relative to the United States and improved risk sentiment, but it had then lost some of the gains over the past week owing to the deteriorating economic outlook for the euro area.",
        "Overall, the euro had continued to appreciate and currently stood, in nominal effective terms, around 15% above the trough recorded in September 2022, reducing inflationary pressures by means of lower import prices.",
        "A repricing of near-term inflationary pressures had been observed in financial markets following the June monetary policy meeting, which in part reflected the upward revision to the inflation projections in the June 2023 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area as well as the expected persistence of inflation and the rotation of its underlying drivers.",
        "A decomposition of one-year forward inflation compensation one year ahead in the euro area showed that upward pressure stemming from demand-side factors more than counterbalanced the fading of negative supply shocks.",
        "Market perceptions of stronger inflation persistence in the euro area were consistent with continued upside risks to the longer-term inflation outlook.",
        "Market-based measures of longer-term headline inflation compensation in the euro area had continued to trend upwards.",
        "Empirical analysis suggested that inflation-linked swap (ILS) rates remained a reliable indicator of inflation compensation for the euro area and were not significantly affected by supply-demand imbalances in the market underlying euro area break-even inflation rates (BEIRs).",
        "Higher short-term rate expectations in tandem with overall stable long-term rates had deepened the inversion of the euro area yield curve.",
        "Together with negative euro area data surprises, the inversion had reignited recession concerns among market participants on the back of the empirical evidence that such deep yield curve inversions had a strong track record of predicting recessions.",
        "However, owing to the stock effect of the central banks’ bond holdings, the term premium remained compressed, which could reduce the predictive content of the slope of the yield curve for economic growth.",
        "At the same time, euro area equity and credit markets had remained resilient.",
        "Both rising equity prices and benign developments in credit markets were consistent with expectations of a “soft landing” for the economy.",
        "They also pointed to a limited transmission of monetary policy to risk asset prices, which could again be related to the compressed term premia, which implied looser financing conditions in the medium and longer-term segment.",
        "Sovereign spreads were close to the levels observed ahead of the monetary policy tightening cycle in late 2021, as the upward pressure that could have stemmed from the sharp rise in policy rates had been largely offset by solid nominal economic growth, with the launch of the Transmission Protection Instrument an additional compensating factor.",
        "The increase in corporate bond spreads in response to tightening expectations had been notably pronounced in 2022.",
        "Yet in the year to date corporate spreads had actually narrowed, and, with the exception of high-yielding bonds, they were below the levels prevailing at the time of the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "This seemed at odds with rising default risks owing to expectations of a protracted economic downturn.",
        "The stable conditions in credit markets also needed to be seen in the context of a sharp decline in excess liquidity amid large repayments under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) and the start of the full run-off of the asset purchase programme (APP), all of which pointed to good absorption capacity in the markets.",
        "The historically large decline in excess liquidity at the end of June owing to the maturing of a TLTRO III operation had not resulted in any upward pressure on money market rates.",
        "During the period of rising excess liquidity the negative spread between the €STR and the deposit facility rate had steadily widened.",
        "Since the reintroduction of positive rates and the reduction in excess liquidity, the spread had been around 10 basis points, irrespective of the level of excess liquidity.",
        "In particular, this spread had remained unchanged after the decline in excess liquidity following the sizeable TLTRO III repayments in June 2023.",
        "This finding was consistent with still ample liquidity conditions prevailing and no evidence of local reserve scarcity, in part reflecting the fact that the repayments had been widely anticipated by banks.",
        "The recourse to the standard refinancing operations – the main refinancing operations (MROs) and the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) – had increased mildly.",
        "However, the increase had been smaller than expected, and usage had lately declined notably.",
        "Looking ahead, excess liquidity was expected to decline at a steady pace as the remaining TLTRO III operations matured and the APP portfolios were gradually unwound.",
        "Regarding the external environment, Mr Lane noted that global economic activity had been resilient in the first half of the year but had visibly lost momentum in recent weeks.",
        "The global PMI for manufacturing output had fallen into contractionary territory in June, driven by the sharp slowdown in advanced economies, with adverse consequences for global trade.",
        "The services PMI remained in expansionary territory but seemed to have reached a turning point.",
        "The euro had appreciated, both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms, since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 14-15 June, although with a slight reversal in the most recent period.",
        "As regards commodities, oil prices had increased while gas prices had declined.",
        "While metal prices had remained relatively stable, food commodity prices had increased since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, partly reflecting Russia’s unilateral withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative.",
        "Turning to the euro area, recent indicators pointed to a weak growth outlook.",
        "The composite output PMI had been declining since April 2023 and in July it had fallen below the 50 threshold.",
        "The dynamics were consistent with a weak GDP performance for the second and third quarters of the year.",
        "Manufacturing production had likely contracted again in the second quarter, and both housing investment and business investment were estimated to have declined.",
        "This was consistent with tighter financing conditions making housing less affordable and the increase in the cost of capital reducing investment.",
        "Services had remained more resilient, especially in contact-intensive sectors such as tourism, although the July PMI pointed to a marked deceleration in activity, while new order inflows suggested a broad-based deceleration in the months to come.",
        "Zooming in on the demand components of GDP, private consumption had declined in both the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023.",
        "In the first quarter of 2023, while labour and non-labour income had been supporting factors, the decline had been driven by a reversal of fiscal measures and an increase in household savings despite the progress that had been made in correcting the terms-of-trade shock.",
        "Housing investment growth had turned negative in the third quarter of 2022, and even more so in the fourth quarter, but had been positive in the first quarter of 2023, with construction supported by the mild winter and the easing of bottlenecks.",
        "After this positive “blip”, the prospects for the second and third quarters had turned negative again, as building construction declined and survey indicators were in contractionary territory.",
        "Moreover, residential building permits, a leading indicator for the housing market, had fallen considerably in recent quarters.",
        "A similar drop was observed for housing sales.",
        "Business investment had also been resilient in the first quarter of 2023, supported by the easing of bottlenecks.",
        "However, the most recent survey indicators, such as the PMIs for capital goods, outstanding business and new orders, pointed to a contraction in the following quarters.",
        "The ECB’s July Corporate Telephone Survey suggested that firms were still busy fulfilling backlogs in their order books, while new orders were declining.",
        "On trade, the export order book level for manufacturing goods was back to historical averages, so exporting firms were no longer able to rely on a large backlog of orders.",
        "Meanwhile, the PMI for new export orders was deep in contractionary territory.",
        "On the services side, the PMI for new orders had moved below the 50 threshold, while tourism new orders were still expanding but at a declining pace.",
        "On the import side, the most visible decline was in intermediate goods, which was linked to the weak investment prospects.",
        "The labour market remained robust.",
        "The unemployment rate had stayed at its historical low of 6.5% in May and recent data indicated that the expansion in employment had continued in the second quarter, especially in the services sector.",
        "Mr Lane recalled that an expanding labour force had been a key factor contributing to employment creation during the past two years, and it had also likely contributed positively to potential output.",
        "Forward-looking survey indicators suggested that job creation might slow in the coming months and turn negative for the manufacturing sector.",
        "Overall, wage negotiations appeared to be broadly in line with the path embedded in the June macroeconomic projections, although there were some risks to this projection.",
        "On the one hand, the forward-looking ECB wage tracker and the latest Corporate Telephone Survey pointed to some modest upside risks to the June wage growth projection.",
        "On the other hand, the most recent monthly data available for some countries indicated that growth in negotiated wages had decreased (excluding one-off payments).",
        "Moving to profits, in the first quarter of 2023 unit profits had contributed significantly to the increase in the GDP deflator, as had unit labour costs.",
        "Meanwhile, the latest Corporate Telephone Survey suggested a picture of declining profits at the start of the year and lower profits expected for the following quarters.",
        "Inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had come down further in June, as expected, falling to 5.5% from 6.1% in May.",
        "The drivers underlying the recent downward trend in inflation dynamics were changing.",
        "External sources of inflation were easing while domestic price pressures, including from rising wages and still robust profits, were becoming an increasingly important driver of inflation.",
        "Energy prices had fallen again, dropping by 5.6% year on year.",
        "Food price inflation had continued to slow but remained high, at 11.6%, pointing to a lagged pass-through of past input cost shocks and to weather-related factors.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food had edged up to 5.5% in June, in line with the June projections, amid some upside base effects on services inflation.",
        "Non-energy industrial goods inflation had decreased further, to 5.5% from 5.8% in May, reflecting easing supply bottlenecks, weaker demand and stronger global competition.",
        "Conversely, services inflation had risen to 5.4%, from 5.0% in May, owing to robust spending on holidays and travel and also reflecting upward base effects.",
        "Given the relevance of base effects, to assess short-term dynamics it was important to continue monitoring indicators of the momentum of HICP inflation and its components, which continued to decline, albeit to different degrees.",
        "Headline inflation on an annualised three-month over three-month basis was about 2% in June, reflecting the strong negative momentum in energy inflation.",
        "For food inflation the momentum had fallen to 6%, which was still very high, while among the core inflation items it had declined significantly for goods but not for services.",
        "Taking a longer-term perspective, while inflation momentum had decreased overall, it remained above pre-pandemic averages, driven by the dynamics in both food and services inflation.",
        "Most indicators of underlying inflation had shown some softening but had remained at elevated levels.",
        "Staff analysis suggested that the PCCI – the persistent and common component of inflation – was the best predictor for two years ahead.",
        "But there was also value in the other indicators of underlying inflation, so they should all continued to be monitored.",
        "The staff analysis also showed that the fading-out of past energy price increases and supply bottlenecks would put downward pressure on these indicators over time.",
        "An additional transitory element that continued to affect all measures was the effect of the post-pandemic reopening on services.",
        "Despite this being correlated to some extent with the bottlenecks shock, it seemed fair to assume that the inflation generated by high profits in tourism and hospitality was also a transitory factor boosting underlying inflation.",
        "Focusing on pipeline pressures, incoming data on prices in the early stage of the production chain showed significant downward movements for both food and goods.",
        "In the case of food, however, the hot summer and the risks associated with El Niño and with other climate events represented clear upside risks to food inflation, which standard tools were not able to capture.",
        "For goods inflation, pipeline pressures were unequivocally pointing to a significant deceleration in the rest of the year.",
        "The analysis of services inflation, meanwhile, did not show a significant downward adjustment overall.",
        "Zooming in on contact-intensive services, Mr Lane noted that the reset of prices for accommodation had been very pronounced during the reopening in spring 2022, while the intensity of price increases this year had been lower than a year ago.",
        "In the case of restaurants, the price increases had been much smoother than for accommodation, and inflation in that particular sector had just started to stabilise.",
        "This was a highly wage-intensive sector, and it was likely that rising wage costs in this sector would put upward pressures on services inflation overall.",
        "However, the PMI for output prices in tourism and recreation, which was a good leading indicator for contact-intensive services, was suggesting a decline in inflation in the period ahead.",
        "The annual growth rate in residential property prices had declined to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2023.",
        "At the same time, the cost of renting was going up very slowly and had reached an annual increase of 2.7% in June.",
        "Inflation in owner-occupied housing prices had continued to decline only mildly, to 8.0% in the first quarter of 2023.",
        "So, while price pressures had eased for purchasing a house, maintenance and other costs related to housing remained high.",
        "Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stood at around 2%, but some indicators remained elevated and needed to be monitored closely.",
        "Mr Lane noted that there had been no significant news on the fiscal front since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 14-15 June.",
        "The incoming information was confirming that there would be some fiscal tightening in 2024.",
        "It was expected that national budgets would reduce the support measures related to energy bills compared with 2023, and that smaller amounts would be available for spending under the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme next year.",
        "The Governing Council’s monetary policy tightening continued to be transmitted strongly to broader financing conditions.",
        "Risk-free interest rates over short to medium-term maturities had increased since the previous monetary policy meeting and funding had become more expensive for banks, in part owing to the ongoing phasing-out of TLTRO III.",
        "The large June TLTRO III repayments had proceeded smoothly, as banks had been well prepared.",
        "Average lending rates for business loans and mortgages had risen again in May, to 4.6% and 3.6% respectively.",
        "The latest bank lending survey pointed to a further tightening of credit standards and another sharp drop in loan demand in the second quarter for both firms and households, since banks were becoming more concerned about the risks faced by their customers and less willing to bear these risks.",
        "Reported demand for loans among corporations had fallen to an all-time low since the start of the survey in 2003 and, for the first time, was lower than at the height of the global financial crisis.",
        "The decline in demand was substantially greater than expected by banks in the previous quarter, reflecting mainly the impact of rising interest rates on loan demand and less willingness to undertake fixed investment.",
        "In terms of overall funding for firms, both monthly flows of bank loans and the net issuance of corporate debt securities continued to be flat.",
        "In relation to nominal business income or nominal GDP, this pointed to a significant shrinking of credit volumes.",
        "Tighter financing conditions were also making housing less affordable and less attractive as an investment.",
        "Accordingly, the demand for mortgages had dropped for the fifth quarter in a row.",
        "According to bank lending survey responses, credit standards for consumer credit and other lending had tightened more than in the previous quarter and beyond banks’ expectations.",
        "The terms and conditions for consumer credit had also tightened and loan demand had continued to fall.",
        "This meant that the consumption of durable goods would likely be affected in the near term.",
        "On the basis of the assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, Mr Lane proposed that the Governing Council raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points.",
        "The incoming data releases had largely validated the inflation outlook in the June projections.",
        "While most measures of underlying inflation were showing signs of cooling, they remained elevated, and the strong transmission of the monetary policy stance to broader financing conditions remained an important factor in bringing inflation back to target.",
        "Given the incoming information, the Governing Council should underscore continuity in its general policy orientation.",
        "By the time of the September meeting, a new round of staff projections would be available to the Governing Council.",
        "Among incoming data, inflation releases for July and August would be available, as well as further evidence of the speed and strength of monetary transmission.",
        "Taken together, the September projections, the evolution of underlying inflation and incoming information on monetary transmission would help the Governing Council update its assessment of the appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "Mr Lane therefore proposed communicating that future decisions would ensure that the key ECB interest rates would “be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary” to achieve a timely return of inflation to the Governing Council’s 2% medium-term target.",
        "This formulation made it clear that the Governing Council had an open mind on the appropriate policy action at the September meeting.",
        "The Governing Council should also continue to signal that the appropriate level and duration of restriction would be data-dependent.",
        "Preserving the option to apply flexibility to reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme as a first line of defence against fragmentation risks continued to be warranted, also in view of the end of APP reinvestments.",
        "Finally, Mr Lane proposed setting the remuneration of minimum reserves at 0%.",
        "This step would reduce the overall amount of interest that needed to be paid on reserves to implement the appropriate monetary policy stance, while ensuring the same degree of control over this stance.",
        "As such, it would preserve the effectiveness of the Governing Council’s monetary policy while improving the efficiency of policy implementation.",
        "As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane that the latest survey data pointed to a visible loss of momentum in global activity, after hard data had suggested a bottoming-out of the decline at the end of 2022 and resilience in the first half of 2023.",
        "Reference was made to the Chinese economy, where activity in the second quarter had been below market expectations.",
        "At the same time, the Chinese authorities had announced a set of policy measures, including some aimed at a more business-friendly environment supporting investment.",
        "The question was raised as to what this implied for the euro area outlook given the strong trade links with China.",
        "It was also argued that China was not the only source of weakness in global demand, with financial markets appearing to be pricing in a relatively high probability of a recession in the United States, the euro area’s largest trading partner.",
        "Members also took note of the recent appreciation of the euro compared with the technical assumptions made at the time of the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "This was the case both vis-à-vis the US dollar and in nominal effective terms, which would affect the real economy and, ultimately, prices in the euro area.",
        "With regard to economic activity in the euro area, members concurred with Mr Lane that the near-term economic outlook for the euro area had deteriorated, owing largely to weaker domestic demand.",
        "High inflation and tighter financing conditions were dampening spending.",
        "This was weighing especially on manufacturing output, which was also being held down by weak external demand.",
        "Housing and business investment were showing signs of weakness as well.",
        "Services remained more resilient, especially in contact-intensive subsectors such as tourism, but momentum was slowing in the sector overall.",
        "The economy was expected to remain weak in the short run.",
        "Over time, falling inflation, rising incomes and improving supply conditions should support the recovery.",
        "There was broad agreement on the assessment that signs of a possible downward surprise in economic activity compared with the June projections constituted important news.",
        "Reference was made to the results from “nowcasting” models that mechanically synthesised hard and soft data and were pointing to stagnation, while the projections had still seen clearly positive quarter-on-quarter growth.",
        "However, it was cautioned that the link between soft indicators and hard data had weakened and GDP data had become more prone to revisions.",
        "Hence, it was prudent to await Eurostat’s GDP release in the coming week before drawing any firm conclusions.",
        "In any case, more data and a more comprehensive update would be embedded in the September ECB staff projections.",
        "A question was raised about the extent to which the deterioration in the short-term growth outlook was related to the ECB’s monetary policy tightening, as opposed to this deterioration still reflecting the repercussions of the pandemic and energy shocks – as well as possibly more structural factors affecting the euro area economy, such as lower competitiveness in a context of higher energy and climate-related costs.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that the deterioration in the outlook showed that monetary transmission was working and that the interest rate increases were doing their intended job.",
        "On the other hand, it was recalled that typical transmission lags and ECB staff estimates suggested that the impact on GDP of most of the past tightening was still in the pipeline and would only materialise over the coming year.",
        "In this context, it was felt that it was important to look for further evidence on whether the latest deterioration in the growth outlook reflected the impact of monetary policy measures or could also be due to residual effects of the pass-through of earlier shocks or longer-lasting structural issues weighing on the supply side.",
        "It was widely regarded as unsurprising that there was less investment in housing and weaker prospects for investment more generally, in particular in capital-intensive and interest-sensitive sectors.",
        "Comfort was drawn in this context from the observation that the bank lending survey suggested that green investment might be less affected by the general pull-back of lending, as public and private green investment was vital for mitigating the occurrence and impact of climate shocks.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that the bad news concerning the growth outlook was concentrated on housing investment and now also on the prospects for business investment, which were more dependent on financing than demand in other sectors.",
        "This raised the question of whether the elasticities embedded in the staff projections to capture the impact of monetary policy measures had been too low.",
        "Members extensively discussed the contrasting signals coming from the industrial and services sectors.",
        "While the latest survey data for industry pointed to a downturn in activity, those for services were still in line with positive growth.",
        "Moreover, consumer sentiment had continued to improve, despite the ECB’s monetary tightening and still high inflation.",
        "The point was made that the relative resilience of services was, to a large extent, due to seasonal activity in the recreational travel and accommodation businesses and could thus change during the remainder of the year.",
        "In this context, it was suggested that demand for tourism-related services partly came from outside Europe, and that pent-up demand from within the euro area likely relied on previously accumulated savings, which could be expected to diminish over time.",
        "In addition, it was argued that the deceleration of industrial production growth had started to extend to services, and the expectation was expressed that this reconnection between the two sectors could accelerate after the summer.",
        "However, it was also argued that a spillover of the weakness in manufacturing to the services sector was not inevitable given the considerable heterogeneity within services.",
        "It was recalled that the dichotomy between manufacturing and services was in line with historical patterns whereby monetary policy affected services with a longer lag.",
        "In aggregate activity, this lagged response and longer recovery time had become more pervasive as the euro area economy had become more services-based than in earlier decades.",
        "However, this dichotomy was still seen as raising the question of whether the slowdown in economic activity was predominantly due to demand and the impact of monetary policy because, if that was the case, stronger effects would also have been observed for services.",
        "In a similar vein, it was seen as puzzling that the interest rate elasticity of the manufacturing sector appeared to be much higher for the euro area than the United States.",
        "The fact that sentiment in the US manufacturing sector was holding up well compared with the euro area was seen as casting doubt on whether the slowdown in the euro area could be attributed to monetary policy.",
        "To explain the asymmetry between the two economies, structural factors weighing specifically on manufacturing in the euro area could also be mentioned as having played a role.",
        "One notable example was the car industry, which was not merely a victim of lower demand but was also facing competitiveness issues.",
        "Another example was the energy price shock, which had led to large structural changes in industrial competitiveness.",
        "Members widely agreed that the labour market remained robust.",
        "The unemployment rate had stayed at its historical low of 6.5% in May and many new jobs were being created, especially in the services sector.",
        "At the same time, forward-looking indicators suggested that this trend might slow down in the coming months and could turn negative for manufacturing.",
        "It was noted that labour market developments remained puzzling, given that their response was unusually muted compared with previous episodes of weakening growth.",
        "The labour market remained a strong element in the overall economic outlook and suggested that a soft landing was still possible for the economy.",
        "This strength was seen as reflecting the increased flexibility of many European labour markets, especially in the case of services.",
        "At the same time, the greater flexibility also implied that employment in the services sector was more fragile, as it would also affect employment more negatively once firms stopped hiring workers or started firing them.",
        "Unemployment could then also jump more abruptly later on.",
        "This risk was exacerbated by the services sector employing a large share of temporary and part-time workers.",
        "It was observed that there were already the first glimpses of a softening in labour market conditions, namely in manufacturing, and it was suspected that more such signs could follow across sectors.",
        "With regard to fiscal policies, members concurred that, as the energy crisis faded, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and in a concerted manner.",
        "This was essential to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would otherwise call for a stronger monetary policy response.",
        "The recent Eurogroup statement on the euro area fiscal stance was consistent with this assessment.",
        "Fiscal policies should be designed to make the euro area economy more productive and to gradually bring down high public debt.",
        "Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity could help reduce price pressures in the medium term while supporting the green transition, which was also being furthered by the NGEU programme.",
        "It was reiterated that the reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be concluded before the end of this year.",
        "With respect to the fiscal tightening implied by national budget plans for 2024, it was acknowledged that significant tightening could be expected in the future.",
        "This would also support the disinflation process.",
        "The European Commission had started to ask for additional adjustment of the budgets and there were signs that governments were becoming more serious about fiscal tightening.",
        "However, caution was advised given that the greater control of public expenditure and improvement in deficits announced in the past had often failed to materialise.",
        "In this context, it remained to be seen whether, for instance, energy subsidies would be phased out speedily and deficits would be reduced in tandem.",
        "The point was made that the reduction in government debt-to-GDP ratios observed thus far largely reflected the impact of inflation rather than structural reform efforts.",
        "Moreover, while changes in the primary balance indicated some tightening, it was argued that fiscal policy in many European countries had remained procyclical and was therefore still adding to inflationary pressures.",
        "The pressure for higher primary balances in view of higher interest rates was emerging only very gradually, as long as budgets were still supported by higher than expected tax revenues as a result of high inflation.",
        "Against this background, members concurred that the outlook for economic growth remained highly uncertain.",
        "Downside risks to growth included Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and an increase in broader geopolitical tensions, which could fragment global trade and thus weigh on the euro area economy.",
        "Growth could also be slower if the effects of monetary policy were more forceful than expected, or if the world economy weakened and thereby dampened demand for euro area exports.",
        "Conversely, growth could be higher than projected if the strong labour market, rising real incomes and receding uncertainty meant that people and businesses became more confident and spent more.",
        "It was argued that, while for the time being the central scenario remained that of the June projections, the latest information implied clearer downside risks to growth.",
        "However, in view of the elevated uncertainty in nowcasts, the imminent release of GDP data for the second quarter would provide further information.",
        "With regard to price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The drivers of inflation were changing.",
        "External sources of inflation were easing, but domestic price pressures, including from rising wages and still robust profit margins, were becoming an increasingly important driver of inflation.",
        "While some measures were moving lower, underlying inflation remained high overall, including owing to the persistent impact of past energy price increases on economy-wide prices.",
        "Members underlined that there had been no material surprise in the latest inflation outcomes compared with the June projections.",
        "This was seen as good news given the earlier streak of upward surprises.",
        "The observed decline in headline inflation was mainly due to energy and food prices, which was seen as confirmation that the shocks that had initially caused inflation to rise steeply were now also unwinding quickly.",
        "This was visible in the major role of base effects in the decline in inflation.",
        "The point was made that this could lead to a boom-bust pattern in inflation in countries where energy and food accounted for a larger share of the household consumption basket.",
        "More generally, it pointed to the relevance of the “last mile” problem as inflation pressures rotated from external sources to domestic price pressures.",
        "It was suggested that core inflation might also have passed its peak, but it was cautioned that it would remain elevated over the summer months.",
        "However, a slight decline could be seen when looking through the upward base effect associated with the temporary transport price subsidy in the euro area’s largest economy in the summer of 2022.",
        "This base effect would only drop out of the data in October, at which point the data would hopefully confirm that a peak had been reached in core inflation, which for the time being remained stubbornly high.",
        "In this context, some comfort was drawn from survey data for firms, which pointed to a substantial decline in the frequency and share of price increases compared with price reductions in some euro area economies.",
        "Similarly, short-term inflation expectations of households and selling price expectations of firms had consistently declined in recent months in the euro area.",
        "References were made to the ECB staff analysis of underlying inflation measures referred to by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "It was observed that these measures had, on balance, remained rather stable in recent months, although at high levels.",
        "It was also noted that the three measures identified by staff as performing best as indicators of medium-term inflation were currently pointing in different directions, with the PCCI declining swiftly, while HICP inflation excluding energy, food, travel-related items, clothing and footwear and the measure of domestic price pressures still pointed to the upside.",
        "Adjusting the different measures for the impact of the energy and bottleneck shocks pointed to lower levels, but they all still remained well above 2%.",
        "Hence, it seemed that the fading of shocks alone could not be expected to bring inflation back to target, which would point to more entrenched inflationary pressures.",
        "Food price developments were identified as a major source of uncertainty as they were influenced by factors and potential shocks that were hard to predict.",
        "In this context, the consequences of Russia’s unilateral withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative were a big question mark.",
        "Another significant risk factor for food prices was the impact of climate change and weather shocks such as those related to El Niño, which were likely to be non-linear.",
        "It needed to be established whether these shocks were related to demand or supply and whether they implied mainly short-term volatility or might affect the medium-term outlook.",
        "While short-term volatility did not necessarily warrant a monetary policy response, in the context of high inflation it could affect wage negotiations and then have a more material impact.",
        "Members noted that wage growth in the first quarter of 2023 had been somewhat higher than expected, but that the overall information appeared in line with a turnaround and lower wage growth in 2024, as anticipated in the June projections.",
        "From that perspective there was no material surprise regarding wage growth, which was still expected to peak in the summer of 2023 and decelerate thereafter.",
        "However, some concerns were expressed that this outlook was surrounded by upside risks.",
        "Reference was made to wage agreements with longer durations, which implied wage pressures being lower in the near term but lingering for longer in the pipeline and materialising only later once the current agreements expired.",
        "Moreover, anecdotal information for some euro area economies suggested that workers’ claims in wage negotiations were becoming more oriented towards recent actual inflation, rather than being forward-looking and anchored by the prospect of inflation coming back to the 2% target.",
        "In addition, the point was made that higher wage growth was likely to outpace the lower productivity growth implied by the latest economic activity and labour market developments, which would then lead to less of a softening of unit labour cost pressures than foreseen in the June projections.",
        "This pointed to upside risks to inflation, with recent trends in nominal wage increases incompatible with the ECB’s 2% medium-term target when adjusting for subdued productivity developments.",
        "Moreover, with respect to the pass-through of higher wages, it was recalled that one of the central assumptions in the June projections had been that rising labour costs would be buffered by a compression of unit profits.",
        "Some doubts were raised as to whether this would be the case following the strong profit growth seen in 2022 and into 2023.",
        "However, it was also argued that the chances of this buffering occurring in the future were seen to have become more realistic in view of the disappointing growth performance and negative demand developments, as the probability of firms lowering their mark-ups would increase.",
        "It was also recalled that labour hoarding was not cost-free and that the costs would sooner or later show up not only in lower productivity, but also in lower profits for firms and lower wages.",
        "All in all, it was concluded that the evolution of wage and profit growth remained an important factor of uncertainty.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, members took note of the assessments by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane of the latest developments in market-based measures of inflation compensation and survey-based indicators.",
        "Although most measures currently stood at around 2%, some indicators remained elevated and needed to be monitored closely.",
        "The broad stability of survey-based long-run inflation expectations was considered important, as it meant that large wage increases would be less likely in the future.",
        "It was emphasised that the continued increases in market-based inflation compensation measures, including the measure for five years forward five years ahead standing at above 2.5%, were mainly due to risk premia.",
        "While this did not call into question that inflation expectations remained anchored, it suggested that market participants were seeing rising upside risks to longer-term inflation.",
        "In addition, this evidence continued to raise the question of why the receding inflation uncertainty was not showing up in a reduction of risk premia.",
        "Against this background, members considered that the outlook for inflation remained highly uncertain and was subject to both upside and downside risks.",
        "The upside risks included potential renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food, also related to Russia’s unilateral withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative.",
        "Adverse weather conditions, in light of the unfolding climate crisis, could push up food prices by more than projected.",
        "And a lasting rise in inflation expectations above the ECB’s target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term.",
        "By contrast, weaker demand – for example owing to a stronger transmission of monetary policy – would lead to lower price pressures, especially over the medium term.",
        "Moreover, inflation would come down faster if declining energy prices and lower food price increases were to pass through to the prices of other goods and services more quickly than currently anticipated.",
        "Members referred to different risks to inflation.",
        "One set of risks pertained to the possibility of higher wage growth or profit margins remaining elevated for longer.",
        "It was suggested that the process of disinflation would become more challenging once the direct effects of the previous external supply-side shocks on inflation had reversed and the more persistent domestic price pressures and second-round effects started to dominate.",
        "At the same time, looking at how wages, profit margins and inflation expectations were evolving, there were currently no discernible indications of strengthening second-round effects.",
        "It was also recalled that the inflation projections were predicated on the assumption that no new shocks would occur.",
        "By contrast, the example of the climate and food crises, likely exacerbated by El Niño effects this year and next, suggested that new shocks could occur well within the projection horizon, with associated upside risks to inflation over that timescale.",
        "Already today, the consequences of climate change could be seen in more frequent extreme weather events, droughts, wildfires and floods, threatening harvests and tourism.",
        "In view of this, risks to food prices were seen as strongly tilted to the upside.",
        "In addition, some of these shocks and adverse structural developments might reduce the euro area’s supply capacity and increase upside risks to inflation over the medium and longer term.",
        "The view was expressed that the combination of no surprises in inflation and lower than expected growth prospects implied that the risks to inflation had become more balanced, if they had not already started to move to the downside.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that, in the presence of adverse supply shocks, the outcome could also be one of “stagflation”.",
        "Here, even a recession would not necessarily be accompanied by a clear reduction in inflation for some time to come, unlike in the more standard case where demand shocks were the driving force.",
        "It was argued that, compared with the assessment made on the basis of the June projections, a downshift in the risks to the inflation outlook was warranted merely when taking into account the mechanical impact that the updated technical assumptions for financing conditions and the exchange rate had on the inflation numbers when applying conventional elasticities.",
        "Yet it was also suggested that a picture of inflation being in line with expectations and growth being lower could also be interpreted in a way that pointed to greater inflation persistence than expected for a given growth rate, or less pass-through of policy tightening to the final objective.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members generally concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Average lending rates for business loans and mortgages were rising and credit standards were tightening.",
        "According to the bank lending survey, credit demand from firms and households was falling, leading to muted loan growth rates, and monthly loan flows to firms had been hovering around zero since November 2022.",
        "It was also underlined that evidence from the bank lending survey showed that credit demand from firms for business investment had declined and could be expected to decline further.",
        "However, the point was also made that – following the large swings observed during the pandemic period and when confronting the energy shock in 2022 – from a medium-term perspective outstanding credit might now be returning to its longer-term trend.",
        "Attention was drawn to developments in money and credit aggregates, with growth rates declining at a fast pace and in negative territory in real terms.",
        "In particular, it was recalled that developments in narrow money had typically been a good leading indicator of turning points in economic activity.",
        "While weak development of credit aggregates could reflect both supply and demand effects, it was argued that the bank lending survey was not showing evidence of credit supply restrictions and that incoming data were not signalling financial amplification effects stemming from the banking sector.",
        "However, the existence of a credit supply channel was seen as relevant not only in the event of crisis-like developments in the financial sector.",
        "It could also reinforce the tightening impact of monetary policy impulses via credit demand more broadly.",
        "This channel had to be taken into account when calibrating the monetary policy stance.",
        "In this context, it was maintained that banks’ liquidity conditions had to be monitored carefully, as financial stability risks were particularly high when the balance sheets of financial intermediaries contracted amid weaker macroeconomic conditions.",
        "With respect to the transmission of tighter financing conditions to loans for housing, a remark was made that, in some parts of the euro area, the housing market was recovering despite the ongoing tightening of monetary policy.",
        "A possible reason for this was seen in the muted response of longer-term interest rates that were still compressed by the large stock of assets on the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, with long-term rates broadly stable in 2023 after the sizeable initial increases observed in 2022.",
        "Reference was made to indications that tighter financing conditions were starting to affect economic decisions elsewhere, notably with regard to investment choices.",
        "Overall, the risk-free forward rate curve remained somewhat above the levels observed prior to the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "The downward shift observed in the last few weeks could be explained by market participants expecting lower growth rates to feed into lower inflation rates, requiring less-pronounced interest rate increases.",
        "However, it was remarked that this narrative appeared at odds with the continued upward drift in market-based measures of inflation compensation, although when correcting the inflation compensation measures extracted from forward ILS rates for inflation risk premia, the five-year forward ILS rate five years ahead was at virtually the same level as at the time of the 14-15 June meeting.",
        "The fact that risk premia were still increasing or remained elevated was seen as pointing to upside risks to inflation.",
        "A concern was voiced that the inversion of the yield curve could be interpreted as an indicator of an upcoming slowdown in economic activity.",
        "The fact that the yield curve was even more inverted for the United States, the euro area’s main trading partner, was seen as adding to the recession risks for the euro area.",
        "In this context, it was argued that euro area monetary policy was facing a challenge, as market participants expected directionally a similar interest rate path for both currency areas whereas, in light of the past negative data surprises, economic activity in the euro area had decoupled from the more positive developments in the United States.",
        "Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members assessed financing conditions as having tightened overall since the Governing Council’s 14-15 June meeting, with past policy rate increases continuing to be transmitted strongly to financing conditions across sectors.",
        "Risk-free interest rates over short to medium-term maturities had increased over this period.",
        "It was pointed out that the appreciation of the euro had contributed to a tightening of financial conditions, while risk assets, including equity, had been resilient overall to monetary tightening and a deteriorating outlook, as had corporate and sovereign bond spreads.",
        "The observation was made that borrowing costs for banks, firms and households had risen substantially and would continue increasing for some time, even without further rate hikes, in view of transmission lags.",
        "Moreover, other monetary policy measures, such as the maturing TLTRO III operations and the rundown of the APP portfolio, were seen as reinforcing the monetary policy tightening resulting from the increase in the key ECB interest rates.",
        "It was noted, however, that, having repriced quickly at the start of the tightening cycle, longer-term interest rates had been moving sideways for some time, although real interest rates had risen significantly over the past year and would continue to rise even without further interest rate hikes, as inflation could be expected to continue to fall.",
        "It was underlined that the current restrictiveness of monetary policy and the degree of monetary policy restriction that might ultimately be required remained uncertain.",
        "In accordance with the three main elements of its “reaction function” that the Governing Council had communicated earlier in the year, members evaluated developments since the Governing Council’s 14-15 June meeting related to the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Starting with the inflation outlook, members generally concurred that developments had been broadly in line with the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "By contrast, indicators for the real economy were signalling weaker GDP growth than projected.",
        "It was noted that headline inflation had come down quickly, albeit from high levels.",
        "Inflation expectations remained broadly anchored, partly owing to the strong monetary policy response and to the observed decline in inflation.",
        "Moreover, the risk of second-round effects leading to wage-price spirals seemed to be contained, raising confidence that monetary policy was starting to take effect.",
        "Nevertheless, caution was expressed that further inflation data for the coming months were required for the Governing Council to be able to confirm the downward trend in HICP inflation.",
        "It was highlighted that inflation had been above 2% for quite some time and could not be expected to return to target quickly without further action.",
        "A more comprehensive picture would emerge with the new ECB staff projections in September.",
        "At the same time, it was maintained that the weakening of economic activity could be expected to help generate the conditions necessary to restore price stability.",
        "Although upside risks to the inflation outlook were still seen as prevailing, related mainly to an underestimation of wage pressures and to renewed supply shocks, it was argued that a weakening of the economy would contribute to dampening inflation pressures.",
        "This would bring the inflation outlook more into line with the Governing Council’s 2% medium-term target.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that overtightening would not help bring inflation sustainably to the 2% target if it later led to inflation undershooting.",
        "It was recalled that the effects of past rate hikes had not yet been fully transmitted to the real economy.",
        "Moreover, the Governing Council needed to take into account the “secondary objectives” assigned to it in the Treaty on European Union and contain unnecessary side effects on output and employment when pursuing its price stability mandate over the medium term.",
        "A concern was voiced that, with the current slowdown in economic activity, the ongoing transmission of past monetary policy actions could lead to a more pronounced deceleration in economic activity than was necessary to achieve price stability.",
        "However, in view of the still elevated inflation outlook, together with the weaker growth outlook, the concern was also raised that the economy might be entering a phase of stagflation, in contrast to a more benign scenario of a soft landing.",
        "It was underlined that the Governing Council’s mandate was price stability and that institutional independence had been granted to allow central banks to focus squarely on price stability.",
        "In view of the prevailing uncertainties and the large costs of bringing inflation down once it had become entrenched, it was argued that it was preferable to tighten monetary policy further than to not tighten it enough.",
        "Before deciding to stop the tightening cycle, the Governing Council needed clearer signs of whether inflation would converge to target once the effects of recent shocks had faded.",
        "Finally, inflation risks from fiscal developments were seen as persisting.",
        "Members also assessed the level and persistence of underlying inflation as being a source of concern, although it was acknowledged that indicators of underlying inflation had been broadly stable in recent months.",
        "This stability suggested that the momentum was reversing and that inflation might have passed its peak.",
        "The view was taken that little comfort could be drawn from ECB staff analysis suggesting that the fading of supply-side shocks alone would be insufficient to bring core inflation back to values around 2%.",
        "Overall, despite the recent improvements, underlying inflation could be expected to remain high for an extended period, even if growth was slowing, unless further action was taken.",
        "By contrast, it was argued that tighter monetary policy still working its way through the pipeline, together with moderate wage increases and a buffer from profit margins, should help bring core inflation down.",
        "Finally, turning to the assessment of monetary policy transmission, members concurred that there was ample evidence that policy tightening was being transmitted strongly to broader financing conditions, including bank lending rates and money and credit flows.",
        "Moreover, the transmission of monetary policy was increasingly dampening demand, which was judged an important factor in bringing inflation back to target.",
        "It was felt, however, that, on the one hand, the decline in economic activity was less significant than could have been expected in reaction to the substantial monetary policy tightening over the past few months.",
        "On the other hand, risks of stronger transmission than expected were elevated, particularly in view of the sharp increase in bank lending rates and weak credit growth.",
        "It was noted that the monetary policy tightening seemed to be strongly affecting sectors that depended heavily on financing, such as housing, construction, the automotive industry and capital goods.",
        "In this context, it was discussed whether the disconnect between manufacturing and services could be attributed to monetary policy having a different impact on the two sectors, as manufacturing could be expected to react more strongly and quickly than services to monetary policy tightening.",
        "It could therefore be expected that part of the response from the services sector would still materialise with a delay.",
        "However, it was deemed difficult to determine to what extent the slowdown in growth was due to the monetary policy tightening or to the residual effects of past supply shocks.",
        "This was because current economic developments were judged to be still influenced by the aftermath of the pandemic and the energy price shock.",
        "Moreover, it was noted that, if part of the economic weakness was still being driven by supply shocks and not by demand, the impact of the slowdown in growth on inflation would be less pronounced.",
        "While there was little doubt that the “first leg” of monetary policy transmission to financial conditions was working well, a better understanding of the “second leg” of the transmission process from financial conditions to the real economy was seen as crucial.",
        "Having discussed the Governing Council’s reaction function, members agreed that tightening the monetary policy stance by further increasing interest rates was warranted.",
        "In light of the inflation outlook, which was basically unchanged since the June monetary policy meeting, an additional interest rate step into restrictive territory was seen as necessary to bring inflation back to target in a timely manner.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that the Governing Council had been communicating since September 2022 that it sought to achieve its inflation target in a timely manner and, in view of the severity of the supply shocks, the time by which the Governing Council expected to see inflation returning to target had shifted from the last quarter of 2024 to 2025.",
        "While bringing this timing forward could require depressing economic activity to an unnecessary extent, it was seen as important not to extend the time horizon by which the target was to be met beyond 2025.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that further shocks to inflation could occur – resulting for instance from weather-related effects on food prices – driving inflation further away from target.",
        "Against this background, all members supported the 25 basis point rate increase proposed by Mr Lane, while a preference was also initially expressed for not raising the key ECB interest rates in view of risks of stronger than anticipated transmission.",
        "Emphasis was put on the merit of sticking to a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach in an uncertain environment, as market participants would pay special attention to the Governing Council’s guidance for the future interest rate path.",
        "In particular, broad agreement prevailed that, ahead of its September meeting, the Governing Council should neither hint at further rate increases nor signal that it would pause in hiking rates or that it had reached the peak rate.",
        "It was emphasised that any further tightening had to be assessed meeting by meeting, on the basis of the incoming data and a “risk management approach” that carefully weighed up the relevant risks.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that interest rates had to cover more ground to bring inflation back to target, in particular if inflation did not decline as quickly as expected.",
        "A further rate hike in September would be necessary if there was no convincing evidence that the effect of the cumulative tightening was strong enough to bring underlying inflation down in a manner consistent with a timely return of headline inflation to the 2% target.",
        "In this context, it was maintained that bringing inflation fully back to target from moderate but persistently elevated levels could turn out to be difficult.",
        "Specifically, it was argued that the process of disinflation would become more challenging once the direct effects of previous external supply shocks on inflation had reversed and the more persistent domestic price pressures started to dominate.",
        "This was argued to point to the need for further action to show that the Governing Council would be at least as stubborn and persistent as inflation pressures turned out to be.",
        "On the other hand, it was argued that it was quite probable that the September ECB staff projections would revise the inflation path sufficiently downwards towards 2%, without the need for another interest rate hike in September.",
        "However, caution was also expressed about assigning too much importance to the September meeting and the projections, with a strong case for adopting a risk management approach for the coming meetings in light of prevailing uncertainties.",
        "Broad agreement was expressed with Mr Lane’s proposal to set the remuneration of minimum reserves at 0%, while leaving the minimum reserve ratio at 1%.",
        "Members widely agreed that this decision would improve the efficiency of monetary policy by reducing the overall amount of interest that needed to be paid on reserves in order to implement the appropriate stance.",
        "It would also maintain the current degree of control over the monetary policy stance and ensure the full pass-through of the interest rate decisions to money markets.",
        "Setting the remuneration of minimum reserves to zero was deemed a proportional response to some of the side effects that were arising from the rapid monetary policy tightening in an environment of high excess liquidity.",
        "It was recalled that, when interest rates were at the lower bound, the Governing Council had introduced a two-tier system for reserve remuneration to counter negative side effects on banks’ transmission capacity.",
        "A reduction in the remuneration of minimum reserves could thus be seen as a reversal of the tiering system.",
        "It was argued that such a reduction was also necessary because, after a period of asset purchases, monetary policy tightening proceeded by first raising interest rates and then reducing the balance sheet only gradually over time.",
        "This also took into account financial market risks that could arise with too fast a disposal of assets.",
        "It was also recalled that, in October 2022, the Governing Council had decided to reduce the remuneration of minimum reserves from the rate on the MROs to the deposit facility rate.",
        "That change had aligned minimum reserve remuneration more closely with short-term money market rates.",
        "Since then, however, the efficiency aspect had gained in relevance, in line with the higher level of the key ECB interest rates.",
        "It was also clarified that this decision did not prejudge the outcome of the ongoing review of the ECB’s operational framework.",
        "At the same time, some members expressed reservations against a change in the remuneration of minimum reserves.",
        "It was argued that remunerating minimum reserves at 0%, below relevant market rates, might add to the tightening effect of the monetary policy measures.",
        "It was also cautioned that changes in the remuneration of minimum reserves could raise questions about the objectives in the Eurosystem’s reaction function related to central bank profits and losses, together with concerns over financial independence.",
        "Other members, by contrast, saw the minimum reserve requirement as a monetary policy tool that could be used to support or complement the intended restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "These members preferred to increase the minimum reserve ratio to 2%, also noting that, before 2011, a minimum reserve ratio of 2% had been the rule.",
        "It was argued that the Governing Council had a good case for taking another step in the normalisation of its policy instruments.",
        "This it could do by reversing the previous reduction to 1%, decided in December 2011 as part of a package of non-standard measures to support the bank lending channel and free up liquidity and collateral when monetary transmission had clearly been under stress.",
        "It was also recalled that banks had benefited from extraordinarily favourable refinancing terms and conditions, not least under the TLTROs, for an extended period of time.",
        "However, it was also recalled that, before 2011, minimum reserves were remunerated at the MRO rate.",
        "Moreover, it was mentioned that the very rationale for minimum reserve requirements was now less clear, in view of the prudential liquidity regulations for banks that had been introduced in response to the global financial crisis.",
        "Overall, caution was expressed against using the minimum reserve ratio as an active instrument for adjusting the monetary policy stance.",
        "With all these considerations in mind, members expressed a willingness to join a broad consensus supporting the measure as proposed by Mr Lane.",
        "With respect to communication, it was felt that the ECB’s reaction function seemed to have been well understood by market participants.",
        "In line with the Governing Council’s data-dependent approach, communication had to avoid signalling complacency to financial market participants and the public on the back of declining headline inflation and slowing growth, as this would ease financial and financing conditions and thereby counteract the Governing Council’s intention to bring inflation back to target in a timely manner.",
        "There was broad agreement that the Governing Council would ensure that the key ECB interest rates would “be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary” to achieve a timely return of inflation to its 2% medium-term target.",
        "It was felt that the word “set” was consistent with preserving optionality, which, however, did not include the possibility of a rate cut at the September meeting.",
        "Finally, the Governing Council reiterated its call for fiscal policy to be designed in such a way as to make the economy more productive and to gradually bring down high public debt.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press releases.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel noted that since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, the market narrative had shifted back from financial stability concerns to inflation concerns and to potential effects on the economy from the turbulence in the banking sector.",
        "Markets seemed so far to have digested the bank failures well, especially in the euro area.",
        "Measures of systemic stress, volatility and market liquidity had returned to close to their levels before the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).",
        "Risk assets in the euro area had not only largely recovered the losses experienced following the SVB failure, but in some cases had even rallied to new multi-year highs.",
        "Sovereign bond spreads had also shown remarkable resilience.",
        "Yet investors had significantly scaled back expectations of ECB monetary policy tightening.",
        "While the sharp downward shift in expectations for monetary policy rates at the height of the banking tensions had been partially reversed, the peak rate expected for the deposit facility remained around 50 basis points below levels priced in before the failure of SVB.",
        "Three potential factors could explain this repricing: receding inflation risks, heightened recession fears in the face of tighter financial conditions, or financial stability concerns.",
        "However, none of these explanations was fully borne out by financial market data.",
        "On the basis of market pricing, current risks of systemic stress seemed contained.",
        "Implied volatility in US bond markets had retreated to its 2022 average from very high levels in mid-March, while stock market implied volatility in the United States had recently fallen to its lowest level since November 2021.",
        "Similarly, liquidity conditions in euro area sovereign bond markets had normalised.",
        "The turbulence had left a lasting mark on bank stock indices, which remained below the levels observed before SVB’s failure.",
        "However, euro area bank stocks currently stood above their level at the start of 2023, and spillovers from the financial sector to the non-financial corporate sector had been limited.",
        "Prices for risk assets had generally been less adversely affected in the euro area than in the United States.",
        "The general resilience of financial markets also extended to sovereign bonds.",
        "Sovereign spreads had widened only slightly after the SVB failure, had normalised quickly after the banking tensions had subsided and had since remained close to their pre-SVB levels.",
        "This resilience had not been challenged by evolving market expectations for the reduction of the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio.",
        "Both the start of quantitative tightening and expectations of a full roll-off had been absorbed smoothly by the market.",
        "Despite fading concerns about market turbulence, investors had, in response to the banking tensions, significantly scaled back expectations for future ECB interest rate hikes.",
        "A first possible explanation for the pronounced repricing of expectations for ECB interest rates could be receding concerns about inflation risks in the euro area.",
        "The decline in inflation-linked swap (ILS) forward rates, which had started at the beginning of March, had continued with the onset of the banking turbulence, in line with an initially disinflationary effect from the turbulence.",
        "At the same time, market participants did not seem to see the risks to the longer-term inflation outlook as having been alleviated by the banking tensions.",
        "The five-year forward ILS rate five years ahead had remained stubbornly above 2.4% since the Governing Council’s March monetary policy meeting.",
        "Investors continued to consider a scenario where inflation remained above target over the longer term significantly more probable than a scenario where it dropped below 2%.",
        "An alternative explanation for the repricing of monetary policy expectations was the perception that tighter financial conditions made a recession more likely, implying less need for further rate hikes.",
        "However, most common financial conditions indices for the euro area had remained broadly unchanged since the collapse of SVB, even though bank lending rates had been increasing.",
        "There was also little indication in financial markets that the banking sector stress had affected economic growth.",
        "Investors were currently pricing in only marginally higher tail risks to the economic outlook for the euro area compared with the pre-SVB period.",
        "The evolution of the exchange rate provided further insights into the expected impact of the banking sector turbulence on the economy.",
        "Since the start of the banking tensions the euro had appreciated discernibly against the US dollar, in line with the narrowing of the two-year interest rate differential between the euro area and the United States.",
        "Monetary policy convergence between the ECB and the Federal Reserve System seemed to have been a key driver of the euro’s appreciation.",
        "The scaling back of rate hike expectations had been greater in the United States than in the euro area.",
        "Positive economic data surprises in the euro area had also supported the euro, whereas rising downside risks to the US growth outlook had put pressure on the dollar.",
        "All in all, euro-dollar exchange rate developments were consistent with a more muted impact of the banking tensions on the economic outlook in the euro area than in the United States.",
        "A third possible explanation for the repricing of interest rate expectations was related to financial stability concerns.",
        "With net outflows of deposits from euro area banks, market-based funding was becoming more important.",
        "However, short-term funding conditions in the interbank market had returned to pre-SVB conditions.",
        "The increase in credit and liquidity risk premia in money markets in mid-March had proved to be only temporary.",
        "Similarly, the effect on longer-term market funding conditions had been limited, and asset swap spreads of bank bonds had also almost returned to pre-SVB levels.",
        "At the same time, banks’ increasing use of longer-term bond market funding as an alternative to deposit funding tended to increase their average funding costs.",
        "Finally, the vulnerability of banks to rising interest rates depended not only on funding considerations but also on the assets side of their balance sheets.",
        "Overall, short-run risks to euro area banks from higher interest rates appeared to be contained.",
        "Mr Lane went through the latest economic, monetary and financial developments in the global economy and the euro area since the Governing Council’s last monetary policy meeting.",
        "Global economic activity had been stronger than expected in early 2023.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had risen further in March and reached 51.8 in the first quarter, up from 48.4 in the last quarter of 2022.",
        "At the same time, PMI data signalled a divergence between services, which continued to expand, and manufacturing, which had weakened further into contractionary territory.",
        "Since the services sector was less trade-intensive, world trade had remained weak.",
        "The euro had appreciated both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms.",
        "Compared with the March ECB staff macroeconomic projections, non-energy commodity prices had remained broadly unchanged, while the current oil futures curve was lower and slightly more steeply downward-sloping.",
        "The gas futures curve was also lower, although slightly more upward-sloping at the end of the year than embedded in the ECB projections.",
        "Euro area GDP growth in the first quarter of the year – at 0.1% according to Eurostat’s preliminary flash estimate – had been broadly in line with the March staff projections.",
        "Excluding the strong negative growth rate for Ireland, it was slightly higher, at 0.2%.",
        "The available country data pointed to a positive contribution from net trade owing to buoyant exports, which was offset by a negative contribution from domestic demand.",
        "At the same time, developments differed significantly across countries, depending on the relative importance of services versus manufacturing.",
        "Lower energy prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and fiscal policy support for firms and households had continued to shore up the economy.",
        "Manufacturing activity was still benefiting from a backlog of orders but its prospects were worsening, as was visible in the manufacturing output PMI for April.",
        "The services sector was growing more strongly, owing to the reopening of the economy.",
        "Private domestic demand, especially consumption, was likely to have remained weak.",
        "Households were less inclined to purchase “big ticket” items, as the impulse from the additional savings accumulated over the pandemic had progressively waned and financing conditions were tightening.",
        "For instance, in the first two months of the year, retail sales and car registrations had declined from their levels at the end of 2022 by 0.4% and 3.7% respectively.",
        "The asset allocation of savings flows showed that households had accumulated money in bank accounts during 2020.",
        "However, the deposits were subsequently used by and large not to consume more but to invest in other financial assets or in capital formation, chiefly housing.",
        "Since 2022 they had also been used to repay debt, contributing to an increase in the saving ratio at the end of 2022.",
        "Turning to investment, housing investment had been contracting since mid-2022.",
        "At the beginning of 2023, building construction had rebounded, thanks to good weather and the buffer from accumulated order backlogs, suggesting a temporary recovery in housing investment.",
        "However, the PMI for construction remained in negative territory, pointing to a subdued outlook.",
        "Affordability and profitability indicators had both declined sharply at the end of 2022.",
        "By contrast, non-housing investment and net exports were expected to have contributed positively to GDP growth in the first quarter of 2023.",
        "A recovery in capital goods had been helped by easing supply bottlenecks.",
        "However, the new orders PMI for capital goods remained in negative territory.",
        "As regards prospects for exports, the PMI for manufacturing orders had remained below the 50 threshold in April, while the PMI for services had returned to expansionary territory.",
        "Looking ahead, model estimates and survey data pointed to a further moderate expansion of GDP in the second and third quarters of 2023, broadly in line with the March projection exercise.",
        "The labour market had remained strong in the first few months of 2023.",
        "The unemployment rate had been relatively stable since April of the previous year and fallen to a new historical low of 6.5% in March 2023.",
        "Employment had grown steadily through higher labour force participation and higher immigration, with older and highly skilled workers behind the expansion.",
        "By contrast, average hours worked had been more sluggish.",
        "The employment outlook remained positive, according to the April PMI indicators, but with sectoral differences.",
        "The employment PMI for services had increased strongly, while the index for manufacturing had declined marginally, although it remained in expansionary territory.",
        "In the construction sector, the employment PMI had been in contractionary territory for a year.",
        "Negotiated wage growth had increased strongly, to slightly above 5% in both January and February, from around 3% in December.",
        "But wage growth was more moderate if one-off payments were excluded, with rates of 3.1% in December, 3.7% in January and 3.8% in February.",
        "The latest settlements monitored in the ECB wage tracker implied comparable signals for wage growth over the coming 12 months, albeit with significant variation across countries.",
        "At the same time, the Indeed high-frequency job postings indicator of wage pressures had moderated since last October.",
        "The ECB’s Corporate Telephone Survey showed that large companies expected margins to deteriorate in 2023 from elevated 2021-22 levels.",
        "The same firms indicated that they continued to expect wages to rise by 5% in 2023.",
        "The fall in energy prices and easing supply bottlenecks, together with strong labour markets and rising wages, were expected to continue to support the economy in the coming months.",
        "Later in the year, however, less scope for catch-up dynamics and progressively tighter financing conditions were likely to act as a drag on economic growth.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, the annual inflation rate had been 7.0% in April, having dropped from 8.5% in February to 6.9% in March.",
        "The uptick in April was due to a positive base effect for energy inflation.",
        "Services inflation had also increased slightly.",
        "The inflation rates for all other components of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had declined.",
        "Inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation) had been 5.6% in April, back to its February level after edging slightly higher in March.",
        "Food price inflation had remained elevated at 13.6% in April, after 15.5% in March and 15.0% in February.",
        "Overall, price pressures remained strong.",
        "The inflation momentum, measured as the annualised three-month over three-month price change, had showed a headline inflation rate of around 4% in April, with energy inflation deeply negative.",
        "Momentum had not yet declined for either food or services price inflation.",
        "It had decelerated slightly for goods inflation, but was still very high.",
        "Indicators of underlying inflation were elevated and, for now, sent mixed signals.",
        "While exclusion-based and model-based measures were already declining, other indicators were only levelling off or still creeping up.",
        "Among those measures, the model-based Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI) was declining more strongly than others since it was more quickly affected by the impact of declining energy prices.",
        "At the same time, domestic inflation was still increasing and was more indicative of pressures coming from wages.",
        "When information was taken from both indicators, the message was therefore mixed.",
        "So it was important to acknowledge that measures of underlying inflation would not be sending the same signal for a while, as there was a large relative price adjustment going on.",
        "On the one hand, there was a big decline in energy prices and, on the other hand, a big increase in the price of labour.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation that still included past energy shocks and the pressures from wages remained high.",
        "These measures were not a good predictor of where inflation would be one or two years from now, however, given the reversal of the energy shock, the easing of bottlenecks and the expectation that the catch-up in low real wage growth would fade over time.",
        "Longer-term inflation expectations reported in the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters, the Consensus Economics survey and the ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts had remained in the range of 2.0-2.1%.",
        "Financial market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased, but excluding higher inflation risk premia they had remained broadly unchanged and close to 2%.",
        "The upward movement in inflation expectations reflected in the ECB Consumer Expectations Survey also warranted ongoing monitoring.",
        "Short-term euro area forward rates had increased since the beginning of April, partly reversing their earlier declines in the acute phase of the banking tensions.",
        "At present, the forward curve peaked at a rate of around 3.75%, to be reached in the third quarter of this year.",
        "Further out, the pricing indicated that increasing probability was attached to cuts in the key ECB interest rates starting in the second quarter of 2024.",
        "Reflecting the rise in the risk-free yield curve, interest rates on bank loans had increased further, while overall credit flows remained low.",
        "Widening spreads between bank bonds and risk-free rates in the wake of the banking tensions were likely to affect bank lending behaviour.",
        "The latest bank lending survey showed a further strong net tightening in the standards applied by banks to corporate and housing loans, and banks cited higher risk perceptions and lower risk tolerance as the main drivers of their loan decisions.",
        "The share of rejected applicants had also increased for all loan categories.",
        "In parallel, banks reported declining demand for bank credit, owing to the general level of interest rates, weaker fixed investments for firms and worsening housing market prospects for households.",
        "Overall, this constituted a tightening impulse that was likely to add to the factors that were expected to weigh on economic growth and dampen inflation over the next two years.",
        "Following its March monetary policy meeting, the Governing Council had announced that policy rate decisions would be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Overall, the incoming information broadly supported the assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook formed at the March meeting.",
        "Headline inflation had declined significantly over recent months, but underlying price pressures remained strong.",
        "At the same time, the past rate hikes were being transmitted forcefully to euro area financing and monetary conditions, while the lags and strength of transmission to the real economy remained uncertain.",
        "The incoming information was sending a range of signals.",
        "Some developments were expected to dampen medium-term inflation dynamics: lower energy prices, the further easing of bottlenecks, the appreciation of the euro, the decline in global prospects for manufacturing and further global monetary tightening.",
        "In the other direction, the current strength of core and food price inflation, together with the level of recent wage agreements, posed upside risks to the March projections, especially in terms of the duration of the inflation adjustment process.",
        "Regarding underlying inflation, the signals were mixed: while exclusion-based and model-based measures had started to decline, the domestic and wage-intensive components of inflation were still rising.",
        "In addition, the momentum in some of these indicators continued to be substantial.",
        "In relation to monetary policy transmission, financing conditions continued to tighten.",
        "The latest bank lending survey indicated that the extent of credit tightening was stronger than previously expected by the banks, while the recent tensions in the global banking system might also add to risk aversion, curbing credit supply.",
        "With these considerations in mind, the Governing Council needed to strike the right balance between advancing further towards interest rate levels that were sufficiently restrictive to ensure inflation returned to the 2% target in a timely manner and taking into account the elevated uncertainty regarding the speed and strength of the transmission of the cumulative tightening in the policy stance, including through the credit channel.",
        "This argued in favour of raising rates by an increment of 25 basis points at the present meeting.",
        "The Governing Council’s emphasis on data-dependence and on articulating the main criteria informing the rate decisions had been very effective in steadying policy expectations.",
        "The APP portfolio was set to decline by €15 billion per month until the end of June 2023.",
        "The realised and expected balance sheet normalisation had so far complemented the tightening of policy interest rates in a smooth manner.",
        "Looking ahead, the latest Survey of Monetary Analysts had indicated that, beyond June, investors expected to see an acceleration in the pace of reduction of the APP portfolio to a rate that was consistent with a full run-off.",
        "To the extent this expectation was priced in by the market, the yield impact of discontinuing APP reinvestments as of July was expected to be small.",
        "Against this background, and in line with the Governing Council principle of data-dependence as well as its commitment to reduce the APP portfolio at a measured and predictable pace, Mr Lane proposed that the Governing Council communicate the expectation that reinvestments would be discontinued as of July.",
        "Expressing the decision as an expectation would preserve some flexibility in case adverse tail risks were to materialise, in particular with regard to financial market conditions.",
        "As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane that global growth excluding the euro area had been higher than expected since the start of the year.",
        "The upside surprises had been broad-based, in both advanced and emerging economies.",
        "In contrast to economic activity, global trade had been relatively weak over the last few months, as demand had rotated towards domestic services.",
        "The euro exchange rate had appreciated since the Governing Council’s last monetary policy meeting, which, looking ahead, would contribute to lower inflationary pressures for the euro area.",
        "Non-energy commodity prices were broadly unchanged.",
        "Oil prices had increased while gas prices had declined, extending their previous large decreases.",
        "High inventories had contributed to the improved gas price outlook.",
        "In the United States, economic activity was moderating, reflecting weakening domestic demand.",
        "In China, real GDP growth had rebounded strongly in the first quarter from its pandemic-induced slump.",
        "The reopening of the Chinese economy, with higher than expected growth in China, was mentioned as an external factor that could contribute to lower core inflation in the euro area, as cheap Chinese imports had dampened inflation in Europe and the United States in the past.",
        "At the same time, higher demand from China could put upward pressure on global commodity prices, including energy.",
        "With regard to economic activity in the euro area, members concurred with Mr Lane’s assessment that lower energy prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and fiscal policy support for firms and households had contributed to the resilience of the economy.",
        "At the same time, private domestic demand, especially consumption, was likely to have remained weak.",
        "Business and consumer confidence had recovered steadily in recent months but remained weaker than before Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people.",
        "There was also a divergence across sectors of the economy.",
        "The manufacturing sector was working through a backlog of orders, but its prospects were worsening.",
        "The services sector, on the other hand, was growing more strongly, especially owing to the reopening of the economy.",
        "Household incomes were benefiting from the strength of the labour market.",
        "Members highlighted the resilience of economic activity so far.",
        "The preliminary flash estimate for GDP growth in the first quarter of 2023 had been better than anticipated earlier, especially when taking into account that the aggregate number was most likely to have been pushed down by volatile transactions in Irish intellectual property products, while broadly in line with the March ECB staff projections.",
        "Moreover, incoming data suggested that growth could pick up further in the second and third quarters, in line with the March projections.",
        "This implied that the euro area economy would manage to escape a recession and that the exit from accommodative monetary policy had so far been smooth.",
        "While the resilience of economic activity was seen as good news, it was nevertheless argued that strengthening activity would contribute to more persistent upward inflation pressures, making a timely return of inflation to target more difficult.",
        "However, it was also pointed out that the better than expected GDP growth had mainly been driven by a reversal in the terms-of-trade shock associated with lower energy prices, together with the easing of bottlenecks and an increase in labour supply, which was one factor supporting potential output.",
        "These favourable supply forces could allow an increase in GDP while at the same time also favouring disinflation.",
        "The impact of tighter monetary policy was starting to become more visible in financing conditions in the early stages of transmission.",
        "At the same time, this raised the question of how much of the impact of tighter monetary policy was already in the pipeline and had yet to materialise, given the remaining uncertainty about long and variable lags in the transmission of monetary policy to output and inflation.",
        "In this context, it was mentioned that the impact of tighter monetary policy was becoming visible in non-financial companies’ perceptions of a weaker demand outlook, as flagged in the ECB’s latest Corporate Telephone Survey, as monetary policy was working through slowing aggregate demand.",
        "With respect to demand components, as financing conditions were tightening, investment was expected to weaken, partly as a result of the fair amount of uncertainty still clouding the outlook.",
        "As to private consumption, consumer services and tourism were still strengthening now that the pandemic had been overcome.",
        "Moreover, stronger tourism would also contribute to higher exports as non-euro area tourists returned to the euro area, a development that was not related to labour income growth due to domestic demand.",
        "Members concurred that, as the energy crisis faded, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and in a concerted manner to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a stronger monetary policy response.",
        "In this context, it was argued that the current fiscal stance was out of line with the cyclical position of the economy.",
        "Moreover, if there were any fiscal tightening in the future it would likely be “too little too late” to be helpful in bringing inflation back to target.",
        "Especially as interest rates were rising, the question was whether governments would manage to tighten their fiscal stance at a time when higher inflation would increasingly weigh on public deficits, owing among other things to higher public wages and pension outlays.",
        "At the same time, it was mentioned that the size of the energy-related fiscal measures in 2023 and, as a consequence, the impact on inflation of their removal in 2024, would likely be revised down, in line with lower than expected energy prices.",
        "Fiscal policies should be oriented towards making the economy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt.",
        "Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, could also help reduce price pressures in the medium term.",
        "The reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be concluded soon.",
        "Against this background, the view was expressed that it was no longer evident that the balance of risks to economic activity was skewed to the downside, as had been judged at the preceding monetary policy meeting.",
        "Members nonetheless assessed that – even though recent market tensions related to stress in the banking system had largely subsided – renewed financial market tensions, if persistent, would pose a downside risk to the outlook for growth as they could tighten broader credit conditions more strongly than expected and dampen confidence.",
        "Russia’s war against Ukraine also continued to be a significant downside risk to the economy.",
        "However, the recent reversal of past adverse supply shocks, if sustained, could spur confidence and support higher growth than currently expected.",
        "The continued resilience of the labour market, by bolstering household confidence and spending, could also lead to higher growth than anticipated.",
        "With regard to price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Inflation was still being pushed up by the gradual pass-through of past energy cost increases and supply bottlenecks.",
        "In services, especially, it was still being pushed higher also by pent-up demand from the reopening of the economy and by rising wages.",
        "The information available up to March suggested that underlying inflation remained high.",
        "Wage pressures had strengthened further as employees, in a context of a robust labour market, recouped some of the purchasing power they had lost as a result of high inflation.",
        "Moreover, in some sectors firms had been able to increase their profit margins on the back of mismatches between supply and demand and the uncertainty created by high and volatile inflation.",
        "Although most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stood at around 2%, some indicators had edged up and warranted continued monitoring.",
        "Members underlined that, while headline inflation had declined substantially from its earlier peak, the inflation outlook was still too high for too long.",
        "Inflation data had continued to surprise on the upside, for both headline and core inflation.",
        "All inflation components other than energy prices were significantly higher than had been expected in the March ECB staff projections.",
        "According to the mechanical update, headline and core inflation for 2023 would be higher than projected in March.",
        "Underlying inflation was proving more persistent, which was argued to point to clear upside risks to the latest projections.",
        "While it was felt that the outlook for headline inflation in the medium term remained similar to that in the March projections, developments in underlying inflation had become more worrisome and pointed to increased persistence.",
        "Momentum in all components except for energy remained very high or had even increased, especially for services.",
        "Against this background, the inflation outlook in the March projections was judged to be too optimistic, as there was still no robust evidence of a turning point in underlying inflation, with a rising risk of inflation becoming more entrenched owing to higher wage growth and of inflation expectations becoming unanchored.",
        "However, it was also argued that the Governing Council should not focus too much on monthly inflation data being 0.1 percentage point higher or lower.",
        "What mattered was whether a downward trend in inflation could be expected over the medium term, in line with the projections.",
        "Moreover, with respect to changes in the projection assumptions since the March cut-off date, the latest developments in oil prices, food commodity prices and the exchange rate would together mechanically imply a downward impact on inflation, looking ahead.",
        "While there were forces, such as wages, that would push inflation up, there were also several factors going in the other direction, including rising interest rates, a stronger exchange rate, lower energy prices, easing supply bottlenecks, an increasing labour supply and lower fiscal subsidies, all of which would be disinflationary.",
        "Food price inflation was widely seen as another important factor behind the still elevated level of headline inflation.",
        "Pipeline pressures suggested that the pass-through of past cost shocks to consumer food prices remained incomplete, posing significant upside risks to food inflation in 2023.",
        "This also represented an upside risk to prices in related areas such as restaurants and hotel services, and thus to underlying inflation.",
        "While commodity prices were falling steeply, consumer prices remained very sticky, suggesting that expanding profit margins were preventing inflation from falling.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that a large part of the currently elevated food price inflation could still be explained by higher energy prices.",
        "Moreover, there was a big transportation component in food prices, which was labour and energy-intensive.",
        "As regards developments in core inflation, the latest developments were broadly seen as worrisome.",
        "The level and momentum of inflation excluding energy and food continued to be very high, so that small improvements in core inflation or other measures of underlying inflation should not be interpreted as an indication of a turning point.",
        "Reference was made to the United States, where the policy-relevant measures of core inflation had already started to decline some time ago, albeit at a slow pace.",
        "It was argued that underlying inflation in the euro area appeared to be more stubborn and was likely to be stickier than in the United States, since wage and price-setting were typically less flexible in Europe.",
        "The observed strength and persistence of core inflation were seen to call into question the earlier hypothesis that euro area inflation was to a larger extent supply-driven and due to external shocks than a result of domestic demand.",
        "It was also pointed out that the momentum of services inflation was clearly on the rise, indicating that wages – a key component of services inflation – would become increasingly important in explaining underlying inflation, especially given the resilience in the labour market.",
        "Moreover, the demand for hospitality services was expected to strengthen further over the coming months, which should give an additional boost to services and core inflation.",
        "In this context reference was made to the recent developments in wage negotiations in the public sector of the largest euro area country, and to evidence of non-linearities and greater persistence in the reaction to pipeline pressures, all of which were worrying for the outlook for underlying inflation.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that, given the earlier large increases in energy prices, it was natural that core inflation would only start to decline with a considerable lag, as also suggested by historical regularities.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that there was no stable predictive relationship between core or other indicators of underlying inflation and headline inflation one to two years ahead.",
        "If anything, the causality between core and headline inflation went in the opposite direction.",
        "Against this background, the view was expressed that too much attention was paid to core inflation, first because core inflation was not representative of the household consumption basket, and second because core inflation had no clear leading indicator properties for future headline inflation.",
        "It would therefore be beneficial to explain that the analysis of underlying inflation pressures took a wide range of indicators into account and went well beyond core inflation.",
        "Members recalled that the trend in wages was key to understanding medium-term inflation pressures.",
        "Even if it were the case that wage developments had so far remained broadly in line with the March ECB staff projections, this did not necessarily provide reassurance that the trend in wage increases would prove consistent with the ECB’s inflation target.",
        "Moreover, some of the latest wage increases, notably in the public sector, were widely seen as worrisome and had not been included in the March projections.",
        "There were clear signs that unions had regained bargaining power, which was unlikely to recede.",
        "Reference was also made to empirical evidence that the public sector played a leading role in private sector wage-setting in a number of euro area countries.",
        "More generally, as high inflation became more protracted, this exacerbated the underlying social conflict between workers and employers.",
        "Moreover, while wage claims had for a long time been in line with domestic inflation and productivity growth, recent wage claims were clearly higher than levels that would be consistent with this regularity in future if inflation declined as anticipated.",
        "Wage growth was increasing, with further risks to the upside.",
        "In the euro area such developments typically started late and slowly, but they might be hard to stop.",
        "Negotiated wages (including one-off payments) had grown by more than 5% year on year in January and February 2023.",
        "There had been a significant increase in the growth rate of compensation per employee, which, together with the weakening of labour productivity growth, had implied a sharp increase in unit labour costs.",
        "At the same time, there was already substantial evidence that the longer inflation remained high, the stronger demands for higher wages would become, with second-round effects on other prices.",
        "The social dialogue was seen as coming under increasing strain in a number of countries, suggesting that the argument about wages versus profit was becoming more intense.",
        "It was therefore contended that signs of a wage-profit-price spiral were emerging.",
        "In addition, a remark was made that higher mortgage rates might also induce workers to demand higher wages, giving rise to another channel through which inflation could perpetuate itself.",
        "However, it was also recalled that there were considerable differences in wage developments, so all 20 euro area countries had to be taken together to see what the implications for monetary policy for the whole of the euro area would be.",
        "In this context, it was mentioned that there was no uniform message from recent wage indicators.",
        "Developments in negotiated wages and the ECB’s wage tracker pointed to a continued acceleration, but the signal from the latter indicator was affected by compositional and methodological issues.",
        "By contrast, information from the Indeed online job-matching platform, which covered new hiring, was showing a deceleration in wage dynamics.",
        "In addition, it was pointed out that the observed reduction in the unemployment rate reflected both an increase in new hires and a remarkable reduction in unemployment duration, suggesting that European labour markets had become much more fluid than they used to be.",
        "This should be positive for productivity and could indeed justify some wage increases if they were related to more robust productivity growth.",
        "However, it was also observed that no increase in productivity had been seen in the available macro data so far.",
        "Finally, it was pointed out that the cumulative increase in prices between 2021 and 2024 would be around 20%.",
        "This meant that nominal wage increases observed over the past year would need to be put into the context of a “catching-up” process, by which employees were trying to compensate for the lower real wages received for much of the period.",
        "The March ECB staff projections had therefore expected significant wage increases, recognising that real wages were likely to recover over the projection horizon.",
        "Nonetheless, it was noted that the March projections did foresee inflation eventually coming back to target even with very substantial nominal wage increases.",
        "However, it was also argued that the cost of an adverse terms-of-trade shock could not be compensated but had to be shared between workers and employers.",
        "Moreover, the benign inflation outcome depicted in the baseline scenario of the staff projections was subject to large upside risks, as higher wages were likely to have a protracted impact and would increase inflation persistence, especially if not absorbed by lower profit margins.",
        "Together with increasing wage pressures, recent elevated profits were seen as warranting closer monitoring.",
        "In some countries and sectors profit margins had grown very strongly at the end of last year.",
        "Unit profits in the euro area had contributed more than half of the domestic price pressures in the last quarter of 2022.",
        "As wage inflation had been much lower than price inflation, profits were plainly on the rise, with prices often clearly outpacing increases in input costs and wages.",
        "If wages were chasing prices and profits were chasing wages, this could be an explanation for the increased persistence of high inflation.",
        "To fully understand the implications for inflation, it was therefore important to see how profits would develop in the future.",
        "In this context, the Corporate Telephone Survey was sending a clear message, suggesting that companies had indeed been able to attain ample mark-ups in 2022, but they did not think that this would persist during the current year.",
        "As companies were passing on the higher input costs, it was likely that a reversal of this process would be seen in 2023, with wages contributing more and profits less, in line with past regularities.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, members recalled that inflation expectations mattered a lot in wage negotiations.",
        "In particular, higher inflation expectations today could give rise to higher inflation over a prolonged period because of the long duration of wage agreements.",
        "Inflation expectations also mattered a lot in firms’ price-setting.",
        "Repeated upside surprises and target overshoots over a long period of time could erode trust in the ECB’s ability and willingness to bring inflation back to the 2% target.",
        "Maintaining the credibility of the ECB’s commitment to price stability was especially challenging in light of substantial lags in policy transmission.",
        "Attention was drawn to the increase in consumer inflation expectations in March.",
        "The question was raised as to whether this could be related to persistently high food inflation, with energy prices having declined significantly.",
        "Against this background, a large number of members assessed the risks to price stability as being clearly tilted to the upside over the policy-relevant horizon, while other members judged that the risks were more symmetric, especially beyond the near term.",
        "Overall, the Governing Council assessed that there were still significant upside risks to the inflation outlook.",
        "These included existing pipeline pressures that could send retail prices higher than expected in the near term.",
        "Moreover, Russia’s war against Ukraine could again push up the costs of energy and food.",
        "A lasting rise in inflation expectations above target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term.",
        "Recently negotiated wage agreements had added to the upside risks to inflation, especially if profit margins remained high.",
        "The downside risks included renewed financial market tensions, which could bring inflation down faster than projected.",
        "Weaker demand, due, for example, to a more marked slowing of bank lending or a stronger transmission of monetary policy, would also lead to lower price pressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Policy rate increases were being transmitted strongly to risk-free interest rates and to financing conditions for firms, households and banks.",
        "Growth in loans to firms and households had weakened owing to higher borrowing rates, tighter credit supply conditions and lower demand.",
        "The tightening of overall credit standards reported in the latest round of the bank lending survey was stronger than banks had expected in the previous survey round, which suggested that lending might weaken further.",
        "The observed weakness in lending meant that money growth had also continued to decline.",
        "It was argued that some of the stronger tightening of credit standards reported in the survey, beyond the level that had been expected by banks in the previous survey round, was likely to be attributable to the recent tensions in the global banking system.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that there was no indication of a credit crunch and bank lending seemed to reflect mainly weaker loan demand rather than any quantitative constraints.",
        "The view was also expressed that it was surprising that the recent stress and uncertainty in the banking sector had had such a limited impact on the results of the bank lending survey, which had reported unchanged net tightening for loans to firms compared with the previous quarter and an expected deceleration in the pace of tightening in the period ahead.",
        "Moreover, it was recalled that the tightening of credit standards had come after a long period of very favourable credit developments, so, to some extent, it reflected a normalisation.",
        "In addition, it was felt that the observed tightening of bank lending standards and declining loan demand were welcome evidence that monetary policy transmission was working.",
        "Furthermore, access to financing was not seen as a major problem for firms, as was reflected in responses to the European Commission’s business survey regarding obstacles to production.",
        "However, credit developments were weakening.",
        "When measured in real terms, the contraction in loans to firms as a proportion of GDP was particularly pronounced and similar to the contractions observed in 2008 and in 2011.",
        "Overall, members assessed financing conditions to have tightened since the March monetary policy meeting, while the picture of market-based financial conditions was mixed across markets.",
        "The acute strains that arose in financial markets in early March had diminished, as reflected in measures of systemic stress and volatility which had returned to levels seen prior to the emergence of the financial market tensions.",
        "Nevertheless, bank stock prices remained notably lower than before the tensions, although they were still higher than at the beginning of the year, while bank bond spreads over risk-free rates had widened somewhat.",
        "Banks’ funding costs had risen from low levels, as banks had to compensate for outflows from overnight deposits with more expensive time deposits and market-based debt.",
        "This would increase the supply pressure in the market for bank bonds, which was already elevated as banks took steps to pre-fund the large reimbursement due on the targeted longer-term refinancing operation (TLTRO) expiring in June.",
        "Yet short-term funding conditions in the interbank market had returned to levels seen prior to the onset of the banking sector tensions.",
        "In this context, it was argued that the financial market tensions had led to both a faster increase in funding costs for banks and a faster transmission of monetary policy to financing conditions than previously expected.",
        "Members expressed confidence in the resilience of European banks.",
        "Banks were increasingly reporting profits linked to rising net interest income.",
        "In this context, it was underlined that financial stress or instability was far from a level that might jeopardise the transmission of monetary policy.",
        "Nevertheless, financial fragilities might still surface, with the unprecedented policy rate tightening cycle exposing financial imbalances that had built up during the period of low interest rates.",
        "Against this background, the remark was made that it was, in any case, important to uphold the separation principle, which called for the monetary policy stance to be assessed independently of risks related to financial stability, with these being addressed, if needed, by dedicated means.",
        "Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members evaluated the data obtained since the previous monetary policy meeting against the three criteria specified at the March meeting as being important in driving the Governing Council’s reaction to the unfolding circumstances.",
        "These criteria comprised (i) the implications of the incoming economic and financial data for the inflation outlook, (ii) the dynamics of underlying inflation, and (iii) the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Starting with the inflation outlook, members broadly concurred with the assessment that, with inflation outturns having again surprised on the upside, the outlook continued to be for too high inflation for too long.",
        "The risk of a severe economic downturn and the risk of an impact on financial stability had both eased, and hence some of the factors exerting downward pressure on inflation had receded.",
        "These considerations tended to support the inference that inflation risks had moved further to the upside since the March monetary policy meeting.",
        "At the same time, commodity prices had fallen, financing conditions had tightened and the effective exchange rate of the euro had appreciated.",
        "On balance, weighing up the different factors, it could be concluded that the medium-term inflation outlook was still broadly consistent with the March staff projections.",
        "Members assessed the evidence regarding measures of underlying inflation as being a source of concern.",
        "While core inflation had edged down slightly, indicators of underlying inflation ranged overall between 4% and 7%, giving a mixed picture.",
        "The momentum of services inflation was clearly on the rise, with wages expected to become increasingly important in explaining underlying inflation.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food was still very high and its momentum was rising, while strong wage growth was expected to prevail, with the risk of more persistent inflation as well as the possibility of second-round effects.",
        "Turning to the assessment of monetary policy transmission, members noted that there was now more solid evidence that monetary policy was being transmitted to financing and credit conditions.",
        "This was generally seen as a positive development, suggesting that the first stages of transmission were working.",
        "The still strong dynamics of underlying inflation could be a reflection of a slower than expected transmission of monetary policy to inflation.",
        "On the other hand, it was also argued that, with a very strong labour market and longer interest rate fixation periods for bank loans, transmission could be weaker than usual.",
        "However, it was noted that a further tightening of bank credit conditions was still in the pipeline, as the full extent of policy rate increases had not yet been reflected in bank lending rates and credit growth.",
        "Furthermore, uncertainty about the transmission channels was currently higher than usual.",
        "This was because the extra tightening impulse that, according to the bank lending survey, would result from banks’ more cautious lending decisions following the recent banking sector tensions, was hard to quantify precisely and warranted continuous monitoring.",
        "Overall, it was felt that the conditions were not in place to “declare victory” or to be complacent about the inflation outlook.",
        "Instead, members concurred that further tightening was needed to bring inflation back to target over the medium term.",
        "High inflation was seen to be hurting the most vulnerable parts of society and weakening the euro area’s economic performance.",
        "Emphasis was placed on the evidence that various measures of longer-term inflation expectations had edged up above 2%, indicating risks of an unanchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "In particular, market-based measures of longer-term expectations remained stubbornly high, which could partly be attributed to the level of risk premia, suggesting that investors saw upside risks to longer-term inflation prevailing over downside risks.",
        "Over shorter horizons, market-based measures of inflation expectations stood below staff inflation projections.",
        "Monitoring the inflation expectations of households and firms was also seen as important because they mattered in wage negotiations and firms’ price-setting.",
        "Against this background, members agreed that a tightening of the monetary policy stance by increasing interest rates further was warranted.",
        "A number of members initially expressed a preference for increasing the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points in view of the risks to the inflation outlook posed by continued upside inflation surprises and inflation projected to be above target over at least four years, as well as by the elevated risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "Such a step would more clearly demonstrate the Governing Council’s determination to achieve price stability in the face of elevated and more persistent inflation.",
        "More decisive action was warranted to move rates into sufficiently restrictive territory to ensure a timely return of inflation to target.",
        "These members saw the risk of tightening rates too much as being less than the risk of tightening them too little.",
        "Moreover, the view was expressed that the financial market turbulence had been short-lived and had not exerted a meaningful additional tightening impulse.",
        "Furthermore, the resilience of the euro area economy and receding recession risks, together with broadening price and wage pressures, suggested that underlying inflation was unlikely to decelerate sufficiently soon, which gave rise to increased risks of an unanchoring of expectations.",
        "At the same time, most of these members indicated that they could accept the proposed rate increase of 25 basis points.",
        "The ECB’s communication should, however, convey a clear “directional bias” to underline that, on the basis of the present outlook, further interest rate increases would be warranted in order to return inflation to target and to avoid a smaller rate increase being misinterpreted as signalling the prospect of a pause in the current hiking cycle.",
        "Against this background, almost all members supported the 25 basis point rate rise as proposed by Mr Lane, in combination with clear communication that, on the basis of the current data, monetary policy still had more ground to cover.",
        "This decision was seen as striking the right balance between meeting the need for further rate increases and accounting for elevated uncertainty about the speed and strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Since interest rates were already in restrictive territory, raising rates by 25 basis points was seen as preferable, including from a risk management perspective.",
        "This magnitude was viewed as prudent, with the possible costs of larger increments outweighing the benefits, given the still elevated uncertainty and the perception that the transmission of much of the impact of previous rate increases was still pending.",
        "In addition, the point was made that a smaller increment than those decided since July 2022 would allow the Governing Council to keep raising rates for longer, if underlying inflation pressures persisted or even strengthened through the summer, until there was sufficiently strong evidence that a turning point had been reached and inflation was retreating at an adequate pace.",
        "Emphasis was put on the merit of keeping to a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach in an uncertain environment and with rates moving closer to a possible “landing zone”.",
        "A return to a more standard size of rate increment was also justified in view of the fact that the various monetary policy instruments were reinforcing each other in the transmission of the monetary policy stance.",
        "On this basis it was concluded that reducing the size of the increment from 50 to 25 basis points could be justified for two main reasons.",
        "First, substantial ground had been covered thus far, with the Governing Council having raised rates by 350 basis points over nine months, which implied that rates were getting closer to their destination, though they were not there yet.",
        "Second, the smaller rate increase also reflected uncertainty about the impact of past decisions, with a great deal of this impact still being in the pipeline.",
        "Slowing the pace of rate hikes was also seen as helping the right conclusions to be drawn about the destination.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that reducing the size of the rate increment should not be interpreted as signalling that the Governing Council had opened the door to a pause in its monetary policy tightening cycle.",
        "Members generally agreed that the data-dependent approach, combined with the communication about the ECB’s reaction function issued following the March meeting, had served the Governing Council well.",
        "Financial markets were assessing progress in terms of the inflation outlook, underlying inflation and the transmission of monetary policy, and were pricing in interest rates accordingly.",
        "It was argued that communication should emphasise the importance of being persistent and tenacious, and should make it clear that once the peak rate was reached rates would stay at that level for some time and the increases would not be reversed immediately.",
        "As regards communication of the Governing Council’s directional bias, members agreed that it was appropriate to affirm that the Governing Council’s future decisions would ensure that the policy rates would be brought to levels that were sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% medium-term target, and would be kept at those levels for as long as necessary.",
        "At the same time, there was a strong preference against returning to outright forward guidance on policy rates, which was not regarded as a suitable instrument when rates were well above their lower bound and was seen as inconsistent with the meeting-by-meeting approach to decision-making that remained warranted in a volatile environment.",
        "Turning to the policies affecting the size and composition of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, members widely agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to announce the Governing Council’s expectation of discontinuing, as of July 2023, the reinvestment of maturing securities in the APP portfolio.",
        "Members recalled the reasons why the balance sheet needed to be normalised.",
        "First, ending reinvestments in July was seen as being consistent with the current monetary policy stance and with the need to support the reduction in excess liquidity, complementing the expiry of the large TLTRO operation in June.",
        "In addition, progress with balance sheet normalisation was needed to regain policy space for possible future situations in which policy rates again came close to the lower bound and in order to adhere to the principle of proportionality.",
        "In this regard, while the APP had been introduced to provide additional monetary accommodation and to compress term premia when rates were at the lower bound, in the current conditions of ample excess liquidity and upside price pressures, the proportionality of continuing the partial reinvestment policy was questionable.",
        "Moreover, the current level of excess liquidity was not necessary to implement the desired monetary policy stance.",
        "Furthermore, normalisation was needed to reduce the side effects of a large balance sheet, including the risk of fiscal dominance, the exposure to credit and duration risk, and the impact on financial stability risks and on market functioning.",
        "Finally, from a longer-term perspective, a steeper yield curve would support banks’ intermediation capacity via maturity transformation.",
        "By contrast, keeping down term premia via the APP securities holdings for longer than necessary could negatively affect bank balance sheets and therefore the provision of credit to the private sector.",
        "Members widely viewed financial markets as being able to digest a full portfolio run-off, having calmed after the turbulent weeks in mid-March.",
        "Market absorption had been very smooth even in times of market turbulence and despite relatively front-loaded government bond issuance this year.",
        "Overall, financial markets were seen as having largely priced in a full run-off by the summer, implying that the impact on long-term yields was likely to be limited.",
        "It was recalled, however, that the reduction in the stock of securities held in the APP portfolio would be accompanied by a considerable decline in excess liquidity linked to the upcoming sizeable TLTRO repayments, with the largest coming due in June.",
        "Moreover, the fact that the June repayments were fully expected and priced in by markets did not preclude any impact if liquidity was withdrawn, because a fast contraction of the Eurosystem balance sheet could have wider implications for the financial sector.",
        "Over time there was likely to be some pressure on yields, a rise in interest rates on bank deposits, a rotation in household savings from investment funds back into term deposits as the rates on them increased, and a rise in demand for bonds from investment funds.",
        "Reference was made to the need to monitor the composition of the APP portfolio in order to assess whether the composition across and within asset classes remained compatible both with the intended monetary policy stance and with the ECB’s Treaty requirement to support the general economic policies in the EU, as also reflected in the ECB’s monetary policy strategy.",
        "In particular, a request was made to assess whether the overall composition of the portfolio remained aligned with climate goals of the Paris Agreement.",
        "Caution was also expressed against too fast a contraction in the Eurosystem balance sheet.",
        "Owing to the TLTRO repayments, the expected pace of the reduction in the balance sheet was already quite fast, while the impact of the APP run-off on the lowering of inflation was seen as small.",
        "Moreover, the remark was made that the optimal size of the balance sheet in the long run was uncertain.",
        "Some members saw benefits in leaving an announcement about adjustments to APP reinvestments until June or in providing only a directional communication following the present meeting, while deciding on the exact calibration of reinvestments after the second quarter of 2023, at the June monetary policy meeting.",
        "This would allow a more complete assessment of the impact of TLTRO reimbursements in June amid lower liquidity during the summer months and was seen as beneficial in view of the high uncertainty and market volatility.",
        "Overall, the process of reducing reinvestments under the APP, including the Governing Council’s communication of this process, was seen as a success.",
        "The expected and realised balance sheet normalisation had already delivered a tightening of longer-term yields, thus supporting the policy stance, while at the same time not measurably increasing volatility.",
        "Against this background, members were ready to join the consensus in support of Mr Lane’s proposal, subject to reiterating the principles of gradualism and predictability when announcing the expectation that reinvestment under the APP would be discontinued as of July.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel distinguished two periods when reporting on financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 1-2 February 2023.",
        "In the first period, stretching until the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in the United States, mounting signs of more persistent pressures on core inflation in the euro area – i.e.",
        "inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) excluding the food and energy components – had led investors to reassess their views on the likely future path of inflation and interest rates, and they were pricing in a higher-for-longer inflation and rate environment.",
        "Expectations regarding the level of the “terminal rate” (the peak rate) in the ECB’s ongoing rate hiking cycle had reached a level of 4.2% in the week prior to the Governing Council’s meeting on 15-16 March, while the expected date of the first rate cut had been pushed out to the third quarter of 2024.",
        "Yet, despite this sharp upward revision to the expected policy rate path, market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations had continued to point to elevated concerns that inflation would remain above the ECB’s target of 2%.",
        "The second period had started when these market developments had been abruptly halted by the collapse of SVB.",
        "Interest rate expectations had been revised downwards sharply, but they had partially reversed this decline on 14 March 2023 before dropping again on the morning of 15 March.",
        "Financial market indicators at the close of the markets on 14 March 2023 had not shown signs that the US banking sector turbulence would cause a systemic crisis in the United States or the euro area.",
        "However, the moves in these indicators had reversed again on the morning of 15 March, in turbulent market conditions.",
        "It would not be possible to get a clearer picture of the most recent change in market perceptions until the dust from the market turbulence had settled.",
        "Amid this market volatility, three observations stood out.",
        "First, broad stock indices had remained much more resilient than bank stocks, as the share prices of non-financial corporations had been affected only moderately.",
        "Second, spillovers from the United States to the euro area had been contained.",
        "Third, bank share prices in the euro area remained well in positive territory relative to their lows in mid-2022, owing to the strong and sustained rally since then on the back of improving earnings expectations.",
        "While stock prices of major global banks had fallen sharply across Europe and the United States, spreads on credit default swaps had increased only moderately for euro area banks.",
        "Liquidity conditions also remained solid.",
        "The FRA-OIS spread – i.e.",
        "the difference between the rate charged on interbank unsecured deposits and the overnight index swap (OIS) rate – had increased significantly in the euro area but had remained near its long-term average level.",
        "Moreover, the cost of offshore US dollar funding had increased substantially, although this increase had been partially reversed subsequently.",
        "As regards volatility, fixed income markets had reacted much more strongly to the SVB event than equity markets.",
        "Overall, these developments suggested that, if there was no intensification of the stress in the banking sector, the inflation outlook would soon come to the fore again in the minds of market participants.",
        "Before the banking sector turbulence had started in the United States, global macroeconomic upside surprises had dominated financial market developments across major economies.",
        "Positive data on economic activity had been accompanied by upward surprises for headline inflation and, especially, core inflation in the euro area.",
        "This growth and inflation mix had led to a repricing by markets of the inflation outlook for the euro area over the medium term, as market participants perceived the factors driving inflation pressures to have shifted from external supply to internal demand or, put differently, from headline to core inflation.",
        "Investors were now pricing in a substantially more sluggish return of inflation to 2%, despite lower natural gas prices.",
        "Expectations of more persistent core inflation had led to a significant reappraisal of policy rate expectations in the euro area.",
        "The United States had seen a similarly strong repricing of the forward curve, underlining the perceived close synchronicity in the global economic activity and inflation cycle.",
        "These developments had been reversed after the unfolding of the events related to SVB.",
        "But developments in market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area were a vivid reminder that investors saw elevated risks of inflation remaining above target in the medium term.",
        "Evidence from option prices also pointed to elevated upside risks to inflation.",
        "Three factors had fuelled market concerns about inflation becoming more persistent in the euro area.",
        "The first related to the prevailing uncertainty about the ECB’s “reaction function”.",
        "The second factor was related to uncertainty about the extent of policy tightening needed to bring real interest rates into sufficiently restrictive territory to curb inflation.",
        "The third factor related to broader financial conditions, which might be insufficiently restrictive, as they had remained broadly unchanged since the Governing Council’s October monetary policy meeting despite a notable tightening of monetary policy in this period.",
        "Regarding developments in bond markets, sovereign bond spreads had remained broadly unchanged until the collapse of SVB, when they had started to increase somewhat.",
        "Yet this increase in spreads had been moderate and entirely driven by the sharper decline in German Bund yields.",
        "Developments in corporate bond markets had also been benign until the onset of the banking sector stress.",
        "Since then, there had been a sharp increase in corporate bond spreads of investment-grade financial corporations compared with those of non-financial corporations.",
        "Spreads of high-yield non-financial corporate bonds had also increased, but they remained at relatively compressed levels from a historical perspective.",
        "Regarding market functioning, collateral availability concerns had been fading.",
        "Since the announcement of the new ceiling for remuneration of non-monetary policy deposits, the spread between short-term government bills and the respective risk-free rates (OIS) had been narrowing.",
        "Looking ahead, further progress on the roll-off of the ECB’s monetary policy bond portfolios would support the availability of collateral.",
        "Mr Lane noted that the ongoing exceptional tensions in the financial markets were a source of significant uncertainty for the economic outlook.",
        "These could lead to an undue tightening of credit conditions or significantly dampen confidence, and therefore implied additional uncertainty for the baseline assessments of growth and inflation.",
        "The Governing Council needed to closely monitor current market tensions and stand ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area.",
        "The euro area banking sector was resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions.",
        "This reflected effective supervision and a rigorous implementation of the global regulatory reform agenda.",
        "In any case, the ECB’s policy toolkit was fully equipped to provide liquidity support to the euro area financial system if needed and to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy.",
        "Turning to economic developments in the euro area, a series of favourable supply shocks and increasing evidence of the ECB’s monetary policy tightening working its way through the economy had been the dominant developments since the start of the year.",
        "The fall in energy prices and the clearing of supply chain bottlenecks were lowering price pressures, while at the same time boosting confidence and supporting real incomes and business activity, especially in the short run.",
        "Indeed, most survey indicators pointed to improving business and consumer sentiment, although still at low levels, with the brighter prospects for economic activity reflecting a broad-based improvement in supply conditions.",
        "Delivery times for inputs for factories were shortening to a degree not seen since the recovery from the global financial crisis in 2009.",
        "However, international markets were becoming a drag on the euro area economy, as evidenced by the substantial fall in order book volumes in February.",
        "Overall, the world economy showed signs of a stabilisation in the first few months of the year and the reopening in China was expected to provide support later on.",
        "Nevertheless, the outlook for global activity remained subdued in the near term, reflecting weak domestic demand in key trading partners of the euro area.",
        "In addition, the rapid tightening of the ECB’s monetary policy stance was increasing the cost of credit for the euro area economy and slowing the provision of bank loans.",
        "This sharp tightening of financing conditions was starting to affect the real economy measurably.",
        "Euro area economic activity had stagnated in the last quarter of 2022.",
        "Industrial production was virtually flat in the final quarter of 2002 and had recovered only marginally in January 2023. Notable contractions in the production of energy, intermediate goods and durable consumer goods had been offset by still expanding production of non-durable and capital goods, especially motor vehicles, as production in these sectors was recovering with the easing of supply disruptions.",
        "At the same time, market services had contracted in the fourth quarter of 2022, mainly because of sharp declines in retail trade, transport, and accommodation and food services in December.",
        "While the previously expected economic contraction had been avoided, all private domestic demand components had contracted.",
        "Whereas private consumption had been very strong in the second and third quarters of 2022 as a result of the reopening of the euro area economy, the significant drop in the fourth quarter of 2022 reflected low confidence and the earlier terms-of-trade shock adversely affecting spending decisions.",
        "Looking ahead, households had started to be more optimistic in their expectations for their own financial situation, thanks to the decline in inflation.",
        "However, this had not yet translated into stronger optimism in their spending plans.",
        "In relation to demand for housing, where monetary policy was expected to have a stronger impact, the results of the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey showed that households’ perceptions of housing as a good investment continued to deteriorate.",
        "Turning to investment, investment in residential construction had started to fall in the second quarter of 2022 and this decline had accelerated in the third and fourth quarters of 2022.",
        "Survey indicators, such as the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for output and business expectations in the construction sector, had recovered slightly in recent months but still clearly pointed to contracting activity both currently and in the near future.",
        "Business investment had seen a small contraction in the last quarter of 2022 if Irish intellectual property products were excluded.",
        "Survey indicators showed some improvement in the capital goods sector in recent months, as the output PMI for the sector had moved into slightly positive territory, in line with the expected better outlook for GDP in the short term.",
        "But steeply rising financing costs were expected to weigh on business investment in the quarters ahead.",
        "For trade, recent data confirmed a significant drop in imports of goods, while exports had recovered somewhat.",
        "Thanks to falling energy prices, the terms of trade had started to improve at the end of last year and this had led to an improvement in the goods trade balance.",
        "On the services side, forward-looking indicators for tourism pointed to the expectation of a strong rebound in the first half of 2023, to which the reopening of China might also contribute.",
        "Regarding the labour market, all indicators pointed to resilience.",
        "The unemployment rate had stood at 6.6% in January, broadly stable since April 2022.",
        "The vacancy rate had also remained stable.",
        "Employment growth was expected to remain positive in early 2023, according to the PMI.",
        "The labour force had recovered from the impact of the pandemic and remained well above its longer-term trend.",
        "This dynamism reflected increased participation rates – in particular for older workers – and an increase in migrant workers.",
        "This was an important element to take into account in relation to future wage growth dynamics.",
        "These macroeconomic developments were reflected in the March 2023 ECB staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "Provided that the current financial market tensions did not feed into an undue tightening of credit conditions or significantly dampen confidence, the economy looked set to recover over the coming quarters as the adverse supply shocks that had occurred over the past few years had been partly reversed.",
        "Industrial production was expected to pick up as supply conditions improved further, confidence continued to recover, and firms worked off large order backlogs.",
        "Rising wages and falling energy prices would partly offset the loss of purchasing power that many households were experiencing as a result of high inflation.",
        "This, in turn, was projected to support consumer spending.",
        "Accordingly, projected growth for 2023 had been revised up by 0.5 percentage points, to 1.0%, in the March staff projections.",
        "At the same time, the expected further pick-up in growth to 1.6% in both 2024 and 2025 was weaker than projected in December, as the headwinds from tighter financing conditions and the appreciation of the euro were seen to outweigh the positive effects on real income and confidence of somewhat lower inflation.",
        "This combination of factors, together with the gradual withdrawal of fiscal support and lingering concerns about energy supply risks for the winter of 2023-24, was expected to weigh on economic growth in the medium term.",
        "Risks to the outlook for economic growth were tilted to the downside.",
        "Persistently elevated financial market tensions could tighten broader credit conditions more strongly than expected and dampen confidence.",
        "Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people continued to be a significant downside risk to the economy and could again push up the costs of energy and food.",
        "There could also be an additional drag on euro area growth if the world economy weakened more sharply than expected.",
        "However, companies could adapt more quickly to the challenging international environment and, together with the fading-out of the energy shock, this could support higher growth than currently expected.",
        "Inflation had edged down from 8.6% in January to 8.5% in February, while underlying price pressures remained strong.",
        "The decline in the overall inflation index had resulted from a renewed sharp drop in energy prices.",
        "Conversely, food price inflation had increased further, to 15.0% in February, with the past surge in the cost of energy and of other inputs for food production still feeding through to consumer prices.",
        "Inflation excluding energy and food had increased markedly to 5.6% in February, from 5.3% in January, driven by the delayed pass-through of the past surge in energy prices, as well as continued, albeit declining, pipeline pressures and strengthening wage growth pressures.",
        "At the sectoral level, inflation in the non-energy industrial goods sector had risen to 6.8% in February, mainly reflecting the delayed effects of past supply bottlenecks and high energy prices.",
        "Services inflation – which had risen to 4.8% in February – was also still being driven by the gradual pass-through of past energy cost increases, residual pent-up demand from the reopening of the economy and rising wages.",
        "Other indicators of underlying inflation had also stayed high.",
        "As these indicators aimed to capture the most persistent part of inflation, it was interesting to compare them with the surveys of expectations about the persistence of inflation.",
        "Survey data on expectations of headline inflation in the near term were aligned with the information coming from the indicators of underlying inflation.",
        "In other words, the surveys predicted that inflation would fall but remain high, at above 4%, over the next few months.",
        "However, for 2024-25 there was a disconnect, as both survey data and market-based inflation compensation measures indicated that inflation would be well below 4% from the beginning of 2024.",
        "This showed that it was not straightforward to extrapolate a signal for medium-term headline inflation from indicators of underlying inflation.",
        "Indeed, it was likely that these indicators reflected, to varying degrees, cumulated distortions as a result of extraordinary developments following the pandemic – namely the war in Ukraine and the energy shock.",
        "Focusing on core inflation, there had been a large gap between the inflation developments in energy-sensitive sectors and those in non-energy-sensitive sectors.",
        "Those sectors with a high energy dependency had seen a disproportionate increase in the inflation rate compared with non-energy-sensitive sectors.",
        "This implied that, as the effect of the energy shock faded, the contribution of this component of core inflation would start to decline.",
        "Mr Lane also noted that, while downward pressures could be expected from inflation developments in energy-sensitive sectors, inflation in wage-intensive sectors had started to increase their contribution to core inflation.",
        "Changes in HICP weights in January were expected to have a significant impact on the profile of inflation in 2023.",
        "For headline inflation the change implied a negative impact throughout 2023, while for core inflation (and especially services) the impact was estimated to be negative in the first quarter of 2023 and positive in the third quarter of the year, mostly owing to a higher weight of recreational services in 2023.",
        "Mr Lane remarked that it was important to look also at the inflation momentum in order to capture turning points.",
        "One indicator for momentum was the three-month-on-three-month annualised inflation rate based on seasonally adjusted data.",
        "For headline inflation this measure had fallen from close to 11% in November 2022 to close to 3% in February 2023.",
        "This sharp fall in momentum was entirely due to a sharp decline in energy inflation.",
        "For other components of the HICP, changes in inflation momentum were much more limited.",
        "Although pipeline pressures were weakening, they remained substantial.",
        "Wage pressures had strengthened, supported by robust labour markets and employees aiming to recoup some of the purchasing power lost owing to high inflation.",
        "Moreover, many firms had been able to raise their profit margins in sectors faced with constrained supply and resurgent demand.",
        "The evolution of profits compared with that of wages suggested that wages had had only a limited influence on inflation over the past two years and that the increase in profits had been significantly more dynamic than that in wages.",
        "An important question for the forecasting of inflation was whether firms would continue with the same pricing strategy or would accept lower profit margins in the period ahead.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased substantially across maturities since the Governing Council’s 1-2 February meeting, although they had eased again more recently.",
        "More reassuringly, expectations captured in the ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts and the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters showed that an increasing share of respondents expected inflation to be at target over the long run.",
        "Household expectations for inflation three years ahead, as expressed in the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey, had declined by 0.5 percentage points in January 2023 compared with the previous month’s survey.",
        "In the March ECB staff projections, the path for inflation had been revised down throughout the projection horizon, owing mainly to a smaller contribution from energy prices than previously expected.",
        "This, in turn, implied a smaller role for compensatory fiscal measures and a somewhat stronger impact of monetary policy tightening.",
        "Inflation was now projected to average 5.3% in 2023, 2.9% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025, implying downward revisions of 1.0, 0.5 and 0.2 percentage points respectively.",
        "In contrast, inflation excluding energy and food had been revised up by 0.4 percentage points to 4.6% for 2023, largely on account of recent data surprises and the lagged pass-through of indirect effects from past energy price increases.",
        "Overall, these indirect effects would still contribute to inflation until the end of the projection horizon despite the sharp downward corrections in energy prices.",
        "Similarly, the past depreciation of the euro had continued to put upward pressure on core inflation, although to a lesser extent than previously assumed owing to the recent appreciation of the euro.",
        "So, while most of the projected core inflation was essentially coming from profits and labour costs, the contribution of indirect effects from the past energy shock and depreciation of the euro was still sizeable.",
        "However, the fall in energy prices, combined with the recent appreciation of the euro and continued tightening of credit conditions, was expected to gradually dampen core inflation compared with the December projections.",
        "This was reflected in the downward revisions to core inflation of 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points for 2024 and 2025 respectively.",
        "Over those later years of the projection horizon, core inflation was projected to ease slowly towards 2% by 2025.",
        "Upside risks to inflation included existing pipeline pressures that could still send retail prices even higher in the near term.",
        "Domestic factors, such as a persistent rise in inflation expectations above the Governing Council’s target or higher than anticipated increases in wages and profit margins, could drive inflation higher, including over the medium term.",
        "Moreover, a stronger than expected economic rebound in China could give a fresh boost to commodity prices and foreign demand.",
        "On the downside, persistently elevated financial market tensions could accelerate disinflation.",
        "In addition, falling energy prices could translate into reduced pressure from underlying inflation and wages.",
        "A weakening of demand, including owing to a stronger than expected transmission of monetary policy, would also contribute to lower price pressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term.",
        "Financing conditions reflected a strong transmission of tighter monetary policy but had recently been subject to significant volatility.",
        "Market interest rates had risen considerably in the weeks following the Governing Council’s February monetary policy meeting.",
        "But this increase had reversed sharply in the days before the March meeting in the context of severe financial market tensions.",
        "Turning to real rates, Mr Lane commented on two measures of the real rate.",
        "The first was the short-term version, computed as the policy rate minus the expected inflation rate one quarter ahead.",
        "This short-term real rate remained negative, but it was increasing strongly – into positive territory – as expected inflation was declining and the policy rate implied by the yield curve was increasing.",
        "The second version was a medium-term cost of finance concept, computed as the expected average policy rate over the next year minus the expected inflation rate over the same period.",
        "This second version was solidly positive throughout the horizon.",
        "Mr Lane emphasised that bank credit to firms had become more expensive and, in January, banks’ cost of borrowing had risen to levels last seen in late 2011.",
        "The biggest increase was in bank bond yields, but deposit rates were also starting to rise noticeably.",
        "There was also a composition effect because more people were moving away from overnight deposits to better remunerated types of deposits.",
        "Moreover, the move away from targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) to market funding was also pushing up the cost of finance for banks.",
        "Following a sharp slowdown since mid-2022, credit flows to non-financial firms had lately declined to close to zero as a result of lower demand and considerably tighter credit supply conditions.",
        "The cost of borrowing for households had increased as well, especially owing to higher mortgage rates, which were currently at their highest level since early 2013.",
        "This rise in borrowing costs and the resultant decline in demand, along with tighter credit standards, had led to a further slowdown in the growth of loans to households.",
        "Amid these weaker loan dynamics, money growth had again slowed sharply, driven by its most liquid components.",
        "The decline in the annual growth rate of narrow money (M1) had been accelerated by a pronounced reshuffling between instruments within broad money (M3), with shifts from overnight deposits into other less liquid but better remunerated instruments, such as time deposits.",
        "Since inflation was set to remain above the target for too long, Mr Lane proposed raising the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points, in line with the intention communicated after the February Governing Council meeting.",
        "The Governing Council should also state that future policy rate decisions would be determined by its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Following up on the announcement in February that the Governing Council would evaluate the subsequent path of its monetary policy at the March meeting, this clear statement of the ECB’s policy reaction function would help orient market expectations towards the key factors underlying its decisions.",
        "In particular, this would clarify that a careful analysis of underlying price pressures and the state of monetary policy transmission at each point in time would act as a cross-check of the staff projections in times of heightened uncertainty and potential structural change.",
        "It also reflected the fact that monetary policy considered financial developments to the extent that these affected price stability, in line with the ECB’s monetary policy strategy statement.",
        "As regards the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), the signalling power of the PEPP’s reinvestment flexibility framework still contributed to supporting the transmission mechanism.",
        "It was therefore proposed that, in the spirit of prudence, the Governing Council should continue to allow flexibility in PEPP reinvestments as an effective first line of defence against remaining fragmentation risks, but that it would only exercise this flexibility in the event market conditions deteriorated.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment of the economic situation and outlook of the euro area provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The March ECB staff projections had a cut-off date in mid-February for the technical assumptions and had been finalised in early March.",
        "This was before the release of the flash estimate of euro area inflation for February and the emergence of financial market tensions.",
        "There was broad agreement that these tensions implied additional uncertainty around the baseline assessments of economic growth and inflation.",
        "The view was expressed that, given the emergence of the tensions and heightened uncertainty, observers might see the economy as being in a different place compared with that pictured in the projections.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that despite the uncertainty implied by the tensions, and unless the situation deteriorated drastically in the new situation, inflation would still not simply disappear on its own and underlying inflation, in particular, remained far too high.",
        "As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane that the upward impact on trade from the unwinding of supply bottlenecks had been fading in the second half of 2022.",
        "In the March ECB staff projections, both world real GDP growth and trade growth had been revised upwards for 2023, reflecting higher growth projections for China and the United States.",
        "In the exchange of views, it was reiterated that the reopening of the Chinese economy would increase China’s appetite for commodities.",
        "While currently this applied mostly to China’s demand for coal, it was suggested that the prospect of the country restocking gas supplies should be closely monitored, as increased demand for gas might not yet be fully reflected in current gas futures prices and could still have an impact on euro area energy prices.",
        "It was pointed out that even slower than expected growth in China would still imply an enormous increase in its energy demand.",
        "Turning to economic activity in the euro area, members took note of Mr Lane’s assessment that the dominant developments since the start of the year represented a partial reversal of earlier adverse supply shocks and there was increasing evidence that monetary policy tightening was starting to work its way through the economy.",
        "The euro area economy had stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2022, thus avoiding the previously expected contraction.",
        "However, private domestic demand had fallen sharply as high inflation, prevailing uncertainties and tighter financing conditions had dented private consumption and investment.",
        "These had fallen by 0.9% and 3.6% respectively.",
        "According to the March ECB staff projections, the economy looked set to recover over the coming quarters.",
        "Industrial production should pick up as supply conditions improved further, confidence continued to recover and firms worked off large order backlogs.",
        "Rising wages and falling energy prices would attenuate the loss of purchasing power that many households were experiencing as a result of high inflation.",
        "This, in turn, would support consumer spending.",
        "Looking ahead, the ECB staff’s baseline projections for economic growth in 2023 had been revised up to an average of 1.0%.",
        "This was the result of both the decline in energy prices and the economy’s greater resilience to the challenging international environment.",
        "The projections then expected growth to pick up further, to 1.6%, in both 2024 and 2025, underpinned by a robust labour market, improving confidence and a recovery in real incomes.",
        "At the same time, the pick-up in growth in 2024 and 2025 was seen to be weaker than projected in December, owing to the tightening of monetary policy.",
        "Some comfort was drawn from the fact that there had been no contraction at the end of last year, which had previously been expected, but it was cautioned that the observed stagnation still implied a fragile growth outlook for this year.",
        "It was noted that the upward revision to economic growth in 2023 reflected a better than expected outcome for the fourth quarter of 2022 and lower energy prices.",
        "At the same time, financing conditions were now substantially tighter compared with the corresponding assumptions underpinning the December 2022 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "It was well understood that the impact of interest rate increases on growth usually came with a lag, but there was still a question as to whether forecasting models sufficiently captured the cumulative impact on growth and inflation of the sequence of rate increases seen so far.",
        "It was also argued that the decline in the credit-to-GDP ratio foreseen over the projection horizon could not be driven only by a fall in demand for credit but had to reflect also significant supply-side effects.",
        "These were likely to have a strong impact on consumption and investment, which appeared at odds with the only limited credit supply effects on GDP incorporated into the staff projections.",
        "At the same time, it was questioned whether, in the absence of hard evidence, quantity restrictions on lending should have come into play at all, at least before the recent turbulence, since the economy had improved and macro risks had receded, while bank profitability had been growing and capital and liquidity positions were solid.",
        "Members widely underlined the continued resilience of the labour market, which had remained strong despite the weakening of economic activity.",
        "Employment had grown by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the unemployment rate had stayed at its historical low of 6.6% in January 2023.",
        "It was noted that the increase in the unemployment rate that had been expected for the last six months had not materialised and that the projections implied continued labour market tightness over the projection horizon.",
        "Strong growth in employment was seen as reflecting the elastic response of the labour force to job opportunities, which differed from the situation in the United Kingdom and the United States, where labour force participation rates had not fully recovered since the pandemic.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that the upward revisions to real GDP growth and highly resilient labour markets likely reflected the impact of some tailwinds, including accumulated savings and liquidity buffers held by households and firms, as well as generous government support measures, all of which could not be expected to last indefinitely.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that labour markets were usually a lagging indicator that sooner or later might reflect the uncertainties in the real economy.",
        "However, it was also argued that the tight labour market might reflect potentially persistent matching problems between vacancies and the unemployed, which would also have implications for wages.",
        "The point was made that the resilience of the labour market and labour scarcity likely meant that, on the basis of historical regularities, the monetary policy transmission to the economy could well be weaker than was expected.",
        "As regards fiscal policies, members reiterated that government support measures to shield the economy from the impact of high energy prices should be temporary, targeted and tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy.",
        "As energy prices were falling and risks around the energy supply were receding, it was important to start rolling back these measures promptly and in a concerted manner.",
        "Measures falling short of these principles were likely to drive up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a stronger monetary policy response.",
        "Moreover, in line with the EU’s economic governance framework and as stated in the European Commission’s guidance of 8 March 2023, fiscal policies should be oriented towards making the euro area economy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt.",
        "Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, could help reduce price pressures in the medium term.",
        "To that end, governments should swiftly implement their investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme.",
        "The reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be concluded rapidly.",
        "Risks on the fiscal side were seen as stemming from governments’ energy-related support measures remaining in place for longer than currently expected or budgetary space being redirected towards other expenditures, with uncertainty prevailing about the reform of the EU’s fiscal governance framework and the outlook for medium-term national consolidation paths.",
        "Against this background, members overall assessed risks to the economic growth outlook as tilted to the downside.",
        "Persistently elevated financial market tensions could tighten broader credit conditions more strongly than expected and dampen confidence.",
        "It was pointed out in this regard that the recent financial market tensions could put the current expectation of a soft landing of the economy at risk.",
        "Russia’s war against Ukraine continued to be a significant downside risk to the economy and could again push up the costs of energy and food.",
        "There could be an additional drag on euro area growth if the world economy weakened more sharply than expected.",
        "However, companies could adapt more quickly to the challenging international environment and, together with the fading-out of the energy shock, this could support higher growth than currently expected.",
        "For the medium term, the question was raised as to whether the assessment that the balance of risks was tilted to the downside was justified, given that the baseline projections had already seen a substantial downward adjustment.",
        "With regard to price developments, looking ahead, members noted that the path for headline inflation had been revised down in the March ECB staff projections, mainly owing to a smaller contribution from energy prices than previously expected and a somewhat stronger downward impact from monetary policy tightening.",
        "At the same time, underlying price pressures remained strong and ECB staff expected HICP inflation excluding energy and food to average 4.6% in 2023, which was higher than foreseen in the December projections.",
        "In the discussion of the inflation outlook and the projections, the point was made that HICP data for February had surprised on the upside compared with the starting point for the projections.",
        "Mechanically incorporating the latest information would imply higher headline and core inflation in 2023.",
        "Moreover, even disregarding this upside surprise, the projected outcome of 4.6% for core inflation in 2023 suggested that the projections incorporated an overly optimistic belief in the unwinding of underlying inflation.",
        "While core inflation might be close to a turning point, this had not yet been seen in hard data.",
        "Reference was made to the calculations of the momentum of core inflation in the short term, based on annualising the rate of price increases over the last three months, which had rebounded for the euro area according to the February inflation data release.",
        "Some comfort was drawn, however, from the observation that the March projection had embodied the first downward revision to the inflation outlook after eight consecutive rounds of upward revisions.",
        "It was acknowledged that this was mainly due to lower current and future energy commodity prices and implied that the supply shock that had caused inflation to surge initially was now partly unwinding.",
        "Questions were raised as to how strongly and quickly the new situation of energy prices would be reflected in underlying inflation.",
        "While it was welcomed that the projections incorporated some staggered effects in the pass-through of past increases in energy prices to core inflation, this begged the question of whether the pass-through would play out symmetrically with respect to the recent declines in energy prices.",
        "As evidence for an asymmetric pass-through, it was observed that PMI survey data pointed to a much slower decline in output prices than in input prices, which was in line with recent academic research.",
        "It was remarked that the decomposition of HICP inflation excluding energy and food into energy-sensitive and wage-sensitive items suggested that, while the energy factor was becoming less important, wages were becoming more important.",
        "According to this decomposition, wage growth was becoming the main driver of underlying inflation and lately its contribution had been roughly twice as large as in 2019-20.",
        "The apparent stickiness of core inflation thus reflected a rotation of the main drivers.",
        "It was also argued that the extent to which the adjustment of core inflation to energy price developments was symmetric over the disinflationary phase would depend on the behaviour of profit margins.",
        "It was recalled that profit margins had remained rather resilient and had even expanded during 2022, in the face of the large adverse energy and cost-push shocks.",
        "This behaviour might potentially differ when energy prices fell, but it remained to be seen if the widening of profit margins would reverse in 2023.",
        "As regards wage and price-setting, members agreed that wage pressures had strengthened on the back of robust labour markets and employees aiming to recoup some of the purchasing power lost owing to high inflation.",
        "Moreover, many firms had been able to raise their profit margins in sectors faced with constrained supply and resurgent demand.",
        "Reference was made to the strong growth in compensation per employee and unit labour costs in the fourth quarter of 2022, which was well above levels considered consistent with the 2% inflation target in the medium term.",
        "Given the tight labour markets and the ongoing high inflationary pressures, in particular for everyday purchases such as food, wage growth was not expected to ease soon.",
        "It was observed that the average for wage agreements in the euro area concealed considerable variation across countries.",
        "There were doubts about whether the projected lower wage growth towards the end of the horizon in the March projections was justified.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that it was consistent to revise down nominal wage growth if inflation decelerated at a faster pace than previously expected over the medium term.",
        "Nominal wage growth was a little lower because of the fall in the cost of living.",
        "In real terms, however, the projections implied an upward revision of wages, and it was noted that this now implied that the terms-of-trade shock would not result in any decline in real wages by the end of the projection horizon compared with early 2022.",
        "Members widely reiterated that developments in profits and mark-ups warranted constant monitoring and further analysis on an equal footing with developments in wages.",
        "Frequent references to wages in public communication did not imply that there was no consideration of profit margin developments.",
        "It was stressed that the terms-of-trade shock had been operating like a tax and that its absorption in the domestic economy should proceed with some burden-sharing between labour and capital.",
        "From a monetary policy perspective, what mattered was that burden-sharing would contribute to preventing second-round effects and wage-price spirals.",
        "The question was also raised as to whether the strong profit margin developments implied that the sizeable cost pressures had not immediately affected the competitiveness of European exporters.",
        "It was observed that corporate balance sheets and profitability had been very strong, which suggested that pricing power had been significant until the economy had started to soften.",
        "In a period of increasing cost pressures, this pricing power and an increased frequency of price changes had kept upward pressure on underlying inflation.",
        "However, the point was also made that competitiveness concerns would ultimately kick in and help reduce inflation.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, members took note that most measures currently stood at around 2%, although they warranted continued monitoring, especially in light of recent volatility in market-based inflation expectations.",
        "It was underlined that market-derived inflation expectations had increased substantially across maturities in the period between the Governing Council’s last two monetary policy meetings, although they had eased again more recently.",
        "While these measures seemed to include significant inflation risk premia, a rise in these premia could be interpreted as reflecting market uncertainty about the ECB’s ability to achieve its inflation target on a lasting basis.",
        "The fact that the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had moved up to almost 2.6% was seen as an indication that a fast reduction in underlying inflation was unlikely.",
        "Furthermore, market-based inflation expectations had hardly moved down in response to the latest financial market tensions, suggesting that the events were not seen as having a large disinflationary impact.",
        "However, it was also recalled that swap rates did not reflect genuine inflation expectations, as they included significant inflation risk premia.",
        "Reference was also made to the recent increase in option price-implied probabilities of longer-term inflation being above 3%.",
        "With respect to surveys, it was recalled that medium-term inflation expectations in the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey had, reassuringly, been coming down.",
        "Against this background, members assessed that there were both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook and that, in view of the considerable uncertainty associated with the recent financial market tensions, there was no need for the Governing Council to express its own collective balance of risks to price stability from the range of risk factors.",
        "The upside risks to inflation included existing pipeline pressures that could still send retail prices even higher than expected in the near term.",
        "Domestic factors, such as inflation expectations persistently above target or higher than anticipated increases in wages and profit margins, could drive inflation higher, including over the medium term.",
        "Moreover, a stronger than expected economic rebound in China could give a fresh boost to commodity prices and foreign demand.",
        "The downside risks to inflation included persistently elevated financial market tensions that could accelerate disinflation.",
        "In addition, falling energy prices could translate into reduced pressure from underlying inflation and wages.",
        "A weakening of demand, including owing to a sharper deceleration of bank credit or a stronger than projected transmission of monetary policy, would also contribute to lower price pressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term.",
        "Listing these risk factors did not imply that the risks were balanced but instead highlighted the significant uncertainty that prevailed in the current environment, which called for a data-dependent approach to monetary policymaking.",
        "In their discussion, members expressed a range of views on the risks with respect to the baseline of the staff inflation projections, with a number of members seeing risks as tilted to the upside over the entire horizon.",
        "Some members argued that there was only a small probability that inflation would fall back to low levels as quickly as suggested in the March ECB staff projections, which gave the impression of an “immaculate disinflation” (i.e.",
        "a return of inflation to target with very low cost in terms of lost output).",
        "It was also underlined that the baseline and the balance of risks were not independent of one another: if the downward revision to the baseline reflected greater optimism, this should lead to an upward tilting of the risk balance.",
        "It was remarked that such an interpretation appeared to be corroborated by the latest inflation data, which had been higher than expected and challenged the downward revision of the baseline.",
        "In addition, it was suggested that the latest strengthening of wage growth was consistent with second-round effects having already started.",
        "It was also suggested that the output gap was now narrower than before and that, in any case, it gave different indications compared with the unemployment gap, as had been discussed on previous occasions.",
        "The point was made that there was a potential for different risk factors to reinforce rather than neutralise each other, and this would then imply greater persistence, especially of core inflation, than was embedded in the projections.",
        "More expansionary fiscal policy was considered to be a further important upside risk factor, although it was surrounded by uncertainty, related not least to adherence to fiscal rules.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that the downward impacts incorporated in the baseline from monetary policy tightening and credit constraints were too small, which implied a downside risk.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members widely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "It was noted that bank credit to euro area firms had become more expensive, among other things because collateral values were declining.",
        "This was also contributing to a sharp contraction in demand for loans.",
        "At the same time, credit supply was also playing a role, with the recent tensions in financial markets likely to reinforce the tightening of credit conditions and banks becoming more sensitive to the risk of deposit outflows and therefore less willing to lend.",
        "However, against the background of an economy projected to pick up over the coming quarters and profitable lending opportunities for banks, the existence of credit supply restrictions was called into question.",
        "Moreover, the argument was made that credit developments, and specifically bank lending to firms, responded to monetary policy with a time lag.",
        "Hence the recent weakening in loan growth could reflect lower credit demand owing to the energy price shock and high investment uncertainty rather than quantitative restrictions on the supply of credit.",
        "Reference was also made to the downward trend in lending to non-financial corporations reversing some of the exceptionally strong loan growth seen during the pandemic period.",
        "It was cautioned, however, that such a benign assessment might have to be revised if risk premia increased and the tensions in financial markets proved to be longer-lasting.",
        "It was noted that household borrowing had also become more expensive, owing to higher mortgage rates.",
        "These had resulted in a decline in loan demand and, along with tighter credit standards, had led to a further slowdown in the growth of loans to households.",
        "Concerns were voiced that the sharp slowdown in money growth, which was driven by its most liquid components, could foreshadow further risks to the economic outlook.",
        "At the same time, members expressed confidence that the euro area banking sector was resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions.",
        "The Governing Council’s expression of confidence in the euro area banking sector, together with the measures that were being discussed at the international level to ease conditions for banks’ foreign currency funding, were expected to alleviate the current market tensions.",
        "The view was held that, should it be faced with spillovers to euro area banks, the Governing Council was equipped with a policy toolkit that allowed it to provide sufficient liquidity support to the euro area financial system if needed and to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy.",
        "With these instruments, the Governing Council was seen as being able to calm markets if and when necessary.",
        "The point was made that, in the context of tighter monetary policy, pockets of financial vulnerability had to be expected.",
        "It was also to be expected that market participants would scrutinise the soundness of banks, so elevated market volatility was likely to persist.",
        "It was argued that, in assessing financial stability risks, it had to be considered that the transmission of monetary policy impulses was likely to be stronger at times of market stress than in calmer times.",
        "Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members widely agreed that bank credit had become more expensive since the previous monetary policy meeting, reflecting an ongoing transmission of tighter monetary policy.",
        "However, bond markets and broader financial conditions had more recently been subject to significant volatility, with increasing risk premia but lower risk-free yields, as market participants had considerably lowered their expectations for the policy rate peak in the current hiking cycle.",
        "This was exerting countervailing effects and was likely to mean that more time was needed to fully assess the overall effect of the monetary policy stance on financial conditions.",
        "Against this background, reference was made to the separation principle, which called for the monetary policy stance to be assessed independently of risks related to financial stability.",
        "It was recalled that the Governing Council had liquidity instruments at hand to address potential liquidity strains in the banking sector and spillovers from international developments, which allowed it to look through the recent volatility in financial market variables to set interest rates in accordance with its price stability objective.",
        "Further analysis on the strength of monetary policy transmission was seen as warranted, so as to better understand the effect of tighter financial conditions on the economic outlook and on trends in underlying inflation.",
        "On the one hand, the view was held that in the past the effect of monetary policy had been continually overestimated, which might happen again.",
        "On the other hand, it was pointed out that, because of long transmission lags, the effects of the interest rate increases since July 2022 had not yet fully materialised, leading to a risk that the impact of monetary policy tightening was being underestimated.",
        "Turning to the policy proposal for the present meeting, members emphasised that inflation remained far too high and was projected to remain too high for too long.",
        "While inflation expectations appeared to remain broadly anchored, developments in market-based measures of inflation compensation had been moving in the wrong direction for much of the period since the February monetary policy meeting, and there was a risk that high inflation could become more persistent, with core inflation still increasing.",
        "In this context, monetary policy still had some way to go to bring inflation down, including in the case that the baseline of the March ECB staff projections materialised.",
        "The point was made that, in light of the risk of persistent inflation dynamics, the ECB’s monetary policy had to be persistent as well.",
        "At the same time, the ongoing exceptional financial market tensions were seen as a source of significant uncertainty for the economic and inflation outlook, as the magnitude, persistence and scope of the shock were not known.",
        "Sustained financial stress had the potential to move the economy from the baseline scenario to a different regime, with such a regime shift being difficult to ascertain in real time.",
        "All in all, it was felt that the two objectives of price stability and financial stability were complementary and there was no fundamental trade-off, as safeguarding financial stability supported an orderly transmission of monetary policy and the achievement of price stability over the medium term.",
        "Moreover, it was judged that, unless the situation deteriorated significantly, the financial market tensions were unlikely to fundamentally change the Governing Council’s assessment of the inflation outlook.",
        "Against this background, a very large majority agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to raise the ECB’s key interest rates by 50 basis points, in line with the intention the Governing Council had communicated at its last monetary policy meeting.",
        "It was acknowledged that in the current situation of heightened uncertainty a decision had to be taken with imperfect information.",
        "In this situation, risks were seen on both sides.",
        "However, following the announced intended interest rate path was seen as important to instil confidence and avoid creating further uncertainty in financial markets.",
        "In any case, it was highlighted that inflation was far above the Governing Council’s target and inflation dynamics were still too strong, which justified a 50 basis point increase in the ECB’s key interest rates.",
        "Overall, delivering a 50 basis point increase was considered to be proportionate, taking into account possible side effects.",
        "Some members would have preferred not to increase the key rates until the financial market tensions had subsided and to conduct a comprehensive re-evaluation of the stance at the Governing Council’s next monetary policy meeting, in May.",
        "It was stressed that markets were volatile and the positive opening of the financial markets on the second day of the current meeting could not be taken as evidence that financial stability risks had receded.",
        "Moreover, a risk-management approach was seen as calling for the interest rate hike to be put on hold, as the risks from not raising rates, if the tensions turned out to be short-lived, were assessed to be much less severe than the risks associated with raising rates into a persistent crisis.",
        "Moreover, a 50 basis point increase would exert a much stronger tightening effect if the economy was already suffering from the fallout of financial stress.",
        "Past episodes were recalled in which the Governing Council had increased interest rates and then had to reverse the hike shortly afterwards.",
        "It was felt that the Governing Council’s data-dependent approach would in the current situation suggest postponing the interest rate hike and waiting until uncertainty had declined.",
        "Looking ahead, members concurred with Mr Lane that the elevated level of uncertainty reinforced the importance of a data-dependent approach to the Governing Council’s future policy rate decisions.",
        "It was argued that this approach would acknowledge the Governing Council’s limited information as to how the ongoing market turbulence was likely to develop.",
        "At the same time, it was maintained that the Governing Council’s communication would confirm its determination to deliver on its primary objective, underpinned with a sizeable interest rate increase at the present meeting.",
        "Against this background, it was underlined that if the inflation outlook embedded in the March ECB staff projections were confirmed, the Governing Council would have further ground to cover in adjusting the monetary policy stance to ensure a timely return of inflation to target.",
        "At the same time, it was also seen as important for the Governing Council to clarify its reaction function for future monetary policy decisions.",
        "In this context, spelling out the main “reaction variables” was critical.",
        "In particular, these comprised the implications of the incoming economic and financial data for the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.",
        "By listing the main variables that would be given particular weight in upcoming policy decisions, the Governing Council would provide an anchor that the public could use to form expectations in conditions of heightened uncertainty.",
        "A clearer statement of the policy reaction function would allow the public to form their own assessment of the strength of monetary policy transmission, on the basis of newly available information such as from the bank lending survey.",
        "In any case, the Governing Council would have time in the period until its monetary policy meeting in May to reassess the effect of the tightening in financing conditions on inflation dynamics.",
        "At the same time, it would stand ready to provide liquidity support if needed to ensure a smooth monetary policy transmission.",
        "With these considerations in mind, members generally agreed that the Governing Council should refrain from communicating unconditional expectations for the future interest rate path.",
        "However, the concern was voiced that the absence of any such guidance could be interpreted as indicating that the hiking cycle was coming to an end.",
        "For this reason, it was suggested to convey the message that, had the recent market turmoil not occurred, the Governing Council would have expressed the expectation that it would increase rates further, given the baseline scenario.",
        "All in all, members widely concurred on the resilience of the euro area banking system and on the importance of reassuring market participants that banks’ capital and liquidity positions were strong.",
        "The view was held that, while it should be indicated that the Governing Council would monitor financial stability risks, it had to be reiterated that price stability was the primary objective and that the Governing Council remained committed to bringing inflation back to its medium-term target in a timely manner.",
        "Finally, it was seen as important to reiterate that the Governing Council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returned to its medium-term target and – in view of the elevated uncertainty – to also highlight the smooth functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.",
        "Members also agreed with the proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the PEPP portfolio.",
        "Maintaining the existing flexibility in PEPP reinvestments was considered an efficient, pre-emptive approach to responding to a potential re-emergence of risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel noted that the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 14-15 December 2022 had left a visible footprint in euro area financial markets, with a welcome increase in real interest rates to levels that were more consistent with a timely return of inflation to the 2% target.",
        "However, while the “terminal rate” priced in the euro area real overnight index swap (OIS) forward curve had edged up initially, a sharp decline in expected inflation, on the back of lower gas prices and inflation surprises to the downside, had later contributed to market participants revising down their rate expectations.",
        "Expectations of rapid disinflation had also induced markets to price in material rate cuts as of 2024, suggesting that they judged the period of restrictive monetary policy needed to rein in high inflation to be relatively short.",
        "These developments, alongside further signs of a more resilient euro area economy and the reopening of China’s economy, had boosted risk sentiment.",
        "Risk premia had declined measurably across market segments, compressing bond spreads and boosting equity prices, while the euro had appreciated further across the board as sentiment towards the euro area improved.",
        "However, the compression in risk premia was predicated on the markets’ firm conviction that inflation dynamics were on a steep and sustained downward trajectory towards 2%.",
        "A stronger persistence of underlying price pressures could lead to a reappraisal of the monetary policy outlook and a correction in asset prices, as suggested by the strong market reaction, during the week, to some higher than expected inflation prints.",
        "Documenting the substantial changes in real interest rates that had occurred since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, it was noted that the euro area real OIS forward curve had shifted upwards, with the real two-year OIS rate having turned positive for the first time since the 2008-09 global financial crisis.",
        "The upward shift reflected the impact of the ECB’s December communication, as well as a decline in expected inflation that had been most pronounced over the near term.",
        "While the rise in real rates did not necessarily imply that rates were now restrictive, especially considering the uncertainty about the level of the neutral rate, it could, if persistent, mark the end of a long era of negative real interest rates.",
        "Model-based analysis suggested that the decline in the market-based inflation outlook had two broad origins.",
        "First, after a long phase of upside surprises to inflation, some misses to the downside relative to expectations for euro area headline inflation had been observed since November.",
        "Second, there had been a substantial decline in gas prices, which had, at present, a much larger impact on inflation swap rates than in the past, at both the short and the long end of the inflation swap curve.",
        "This increased sensitivity to changes in gas prices may have contributed to an increasing disconnect between the market-implied inflation path and that of professional forecasters.",
        "Two factors raised doubt about the markets’ benign view of inflation.",
        "First, the growing signs that a technical recession in the euro area had become less likely.",
        "And second, the reopening of China’s economy.",
        "As markets were seemingly discounting these risks to the inflation outlook, they also questioned whether the ECB would keep rates in restrictive territory for a sustained period.",
        "While the market-implied path for future short-term interest rates foresaw a further tightening over the short run, in line with the ECB’s December communication, it also envisaged a reversal as of 2024.",
        "The expected terminal rate in the euro area had initially shifted notably upwards in response to the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "However, it had gradually fallen back as investors reappraised the inflation outlook.",
        "Furthermore, markets currently expected a significant number of rate cuts over the course of 2024.",
        "In other words, given that investors expected a fast and sustained return of inflation to 2%, they expected policy rates to remain at a restrictive level for only a short period of time.",
        "Investors had also become more certain about the revised expected interest rate path.",
        "Implied volatility over a horizon of up to one year was now at its lowest since spring 2022, although it remained high from a historical perspective.",
        "The decline in interest rate volatility, however, masked important differences in the drivers of uncertainty, with model-based analysis suggesting that uncertainty about the ECB’s “reaction function” had increased, while inflation uncertainty had declined.",
        "These developments were not confined to the euro area.",
        "Investors, globally, expected major central banks to cut their key policy rates this year or next, as headline inflation was expected to ease rapidly from high spot levels.",
        "In response to some first signs of a turning point in headline inflation, investors were signalling that they believed rate cuts would soon be needed.",
        "This was despite warnings from central bank officials around the world that interest rates would probably stay higher for longer than markets expected, since core inflation – as measured by excluding energy and food from the overall index – remained elevated.",
        "Overall, therefore, markets had taken a view that the global economy, including the euro area, was at an inflection point, with stronger growth and lower inflation than previously expected.",
        "Such positioning was putting market pricing at a considerable risk of correction should inflation prove more persistent.",
        "This was also visible when looking at the significant impact of the global reappraisal of the inflation and interest rate outlook on broader financial markets.",
        "In fixed income markets, there had been a broad-based compression of risk premia.",
        "In euro area sovereign bond markets, spreads had fallen across jurisdictions, despite the ECB’s December announcement that the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio would start to decline as of March 2023 and expectations of a faster run-off as of the third quarter.",
        "In euro area corporate bond markets, spreads for non-financial corporate bonds were around 25% lower than late-October levels.",
        "The rally in financial markets, spurred by the prevailing disinflation narrative, had been especially pronounced in stock markets, with euro area equities, in particular, having made significant gains.",
        "Fading risks of recession, amid lower gas prices, had also been a key driver behind the euro’s continued appreciation since the 14-15 December meeting.",
        "This appreciation had been broad-based against most major currencies, with the Japanese yen being a notable exception.",
        "In this environment of a more positive risk sentiment, market functioning had also improved notably, as reflected in lower volatility and improved liquidity in euro area sovereign bond markets.",
        "This made a further positive contribution to investors’ risk absorption capacity.",
        "At the same time, the increase in public sector issuance had contributed to reducing collateral scarcity.",
        "German repo rates for non-general collateral had moved closer to the euro short-term rate (€STR) again, reducing the collateral premium.",
        "Mr Lane observed that the world economy had further decelerated in the fourth quarter of 2022, with the global Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for both manufacturing and services output falling below the threshold of 50 at the end of 2022.",
        "Consistent with low activity, international trade had also slowed in the final quarter of 2022.",
        "Despite the deceleration, global growth projections had improved for 2023, owing partly to the relaxation of pandemic restrictions in China.",
        "The euro had continued to appreciate since the 14-15 December Governing Council meeting.",
        "In trade-weighted terms, the exchange rate had returned to the level observed at the beginning of 2022.",
        "The slowdown in global demand, together with the unusually warm winter and effective gas saving measures, had led to a sharp decline in energy prices.",
        "European gas prices had fallen by around 50% since the December monetary policy meeting.",
        "According to the futures curve, they were expected to remain around present levels, easing concerns about storage levels for next winter.",
        "Oil prices had ticked up since the December meeting but remained significantly below mid-2022 levels.",
        "The sharply lower energy prices and easing of supply bottlenecks could be interpreted as a partial reversal of the large negative supply shock that had been observed since 2021.",
        "The euro area economy had slowed further in the fourth quarter of 2022 but had proved more resilient than expected in December.",
        "The PMI composite output indicator had risen above the threshold of 50 in January 2023, after falling well into contractionary territory last autumn.",
        "However, unlike services, manufacturing output was still below the threshold.",
        "Manufacturing was once again the principal drag on overall output, despite the continued easing in supply bottlenecks that had particularly benefited car production and sales.",
        "Strong demand for leisure activities, tourism and hospitality were cushioning the slowdown in services activity.",
        "The latest round of the Commission’s household survey suggested that euro area households had revised their expectations on consumer prices 12-months ahead sharply downwards and their expectations on the economic situation upwards.",
        "The less pessimistic view on the economic situation also supported the improvement in their expectations on the financial situation and would help private consumption in the period ahead.",
        "These survey results supported the interpretation of a reversal of the negative supply shock.",
        "Housing and business investment were clearly weakening, owing partly to tighter financing conditions.",
        "The Commission’s business survey had shown that supply constraints, rather than demand constraints, had so far been the strongest factor limiting production.",
        "In particular, shortages of material and equipment were constraining production in the capital goods sector.",
        "While output in this sector had been supported by the easing of supply bottlenecks and firms working through backlogs of orders, especially in the car industry, new orders remained weak.",
        "For the construction sector, the PMI for both output and new orders had been on a downward trend since early 2022.",
        "Nonetheless, Mr Lane continued to expect that the economy would recover over the course of the year, on the back of a robust labour market, rising wages and fiscal support measures, as well as current headwinds fading away.",
        "If the favourable supply-side developments persisted, these would provide further support to the recovery in activity.",
        "The decline in energy inflation had meant an improvement in the terms of trade.",
        "A significant drop in import price inflation had been followed by a less pronounced decline in export price inflation.",
        "This asymmetry in the price adjustment had led to a significant improvement in the euro area current account at the end of 2022.",
        "The labour market continued to be resilient.",
        "The unemployment rate had stabilised at 6.6% in December, far below the pre-COVID level.",
        "The PMI for employment, which had declined from its very high mid-2021 level, was still firmly positive.",
        "This suggested that firms were continuing to increase their labour force.",
        "In terms of vacancies, the latest Indeed data (from online job matching portals in the five largest euro area countries and Ireland) indicated that there had been a slight decline, but the level remained very high.",
        "Compared with December expectations, risks to the growth outlook had become more balanced.",
        "Russia’s war against Ukraine continued to be a significant downside risk to the economy and could again push up energy and food costs.",
        "There could also be an additional drag on euro area growth if the world economy were to weaken more sharply than expected at present.",
        "Moreover, the recovery would face obstacles if the pandemic were to re-intensify and cause renewed supply disruptions.",
        "However, the adverse energy shock could fade away faster than anticipated and, while the security of European gas supplies remained vulnerable to global supply risks, higher than usual gas inventories had reduced supply risks for next winter.",
        "Moreover, euro area companies could adapt more quickly to the challenging international environment.",
        "This would support higher growth than currently expected.",
        "HICP inflation had declined sharply from 10.6% in October to 9.2% in December, and further to 8.5% in January, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate.",
        "The lower figures largely reflected the sizeable drop in energy price inflation.",
        "By contrast, food price inflation had increased to 14.1% (from 13.8% in December).",
        "As in December, HICP inflation excluding energy and food stood at 5.2% in January.",
        "However, there was some variation across the sub-categories, with the inflation rate for non-energy industrial goods rising to 6.9% (from 6.4%) and services inflation declining to 4.2% (from 4.4%).",
        "When measured in terms of “momentum”, defined as the annualised three-month-on-three-month percentage change in prices, the deceleration of inflation dynamics between December and January was notably stronger than suggested by the annual rates in these components.",
        "The uncertainty surrounding Eurostat’s January flash HICP estimate was greater than usual, as it contained an estimate of the figure for Germany.",
        "In January there had also been the usual change in the HICP weights, reflecting changes in expenditures over the previous year.",
        "Across items, one of the most important changes was the increased weight of services, as households had returned to a more normal consumption profile.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation continued to stand at high levels.",
        "However, those indicators that included an energy component saw a turnaround.",
        "In addition, the recent dynamics of core inflation showed that there had been a levelling-off of momentum.",
        "Looking at the determinants of goods inflation, energy-sensitive items had continued to provide a strong contribution until December 2022.",
        "Looking ahead, the contribution of energy-sensitive items could be expected to decline.",
        "However, it was uncertain whether the pace of the reduction was likely to be symmetric to that of the increase.",
        "But the contribution of non-energy-sensitive items was increasing.",
        "To reconcile the still increasing contribution of energy-sensitive items with the fall in energy costs, it was useful to look at pipeline pressures.",
        "Those pressures had declined for food inflation, in particular for international food commodity prices and for European farm gate prices.",
        "But the producer price index for processed food was still increasing, owing to long transmission lags.",
        "Similarly, for goods inflation, there had already been a significant decline in pipeline pressures for intermediate goods, but the producer price index for non-food consumer goods was still increasing.",
        "Still, the fast decline observed in pressures upstream in the production chain were expected to lead to lower retail prices, as had been the case in the United States.",
        "Mr Lane reported that, in the latest round of the ECB’s Corporate Telephone Survey, firms had stated that input cost pressures had been easing, reflecting declines in energy costs as well as other input costs, and they were expecting input costs to continue to decline.",
        "Moving to the inflationary pressures stemming from the housing sector, rent inflation had been picking up very gradually in the euro area during 2022.",
        "Housing-related expenses had increased strongly during 2022 but the pace had started to decelerate at the end of the year.",
        "Moreover, inflation in owner-occupied housing costs had started to ease in the third quarter of 2022, reflecting the acquisition component.",
        "Residential property price inflation in the euro area had eased substantially in the third quarter of 2022, falling to 6.8%, from 9.2% in the second quarter.",
        "Measured wage growth was strengthening, as compensation for past high inflation was becoming the main theme in wage negotiations, but wage developments so far were broadly in line with the December 2022 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area.",
        "The ECB wage tracker, which had improved its representativeness with the inclusion of data for France, indicated that new contracts signed during 2022 and coming into effect in 2023 implied ongoing wage increases of around 5%.",
        "Similarly, according to the January wage expectations from the Corporate Telephone Survey, firms expected average wage growth of around 5% for 2023, which was similar to the rate expected in the October survey round.",
        "The Indeed wage tracker had shown some signs of a turnaround in the last two months of 2022.",
        "Longer-term inflation expectations stood at around 2%.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation compensation had edged down, with a more marked correction for 2023 and 2024.",
        "In the other direction, the 2023 and 2024 inflation projections from the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters had increased.",
        "However, longer-term expectations had been revised marginally down to 2.1%, whereas those from the ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts were unchanged at 2%.",
        "Finally, the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey for December 2022 indicated a levelling-off of median inflation perceptions and one-year ahead inflation expectations, but continued to point to three-year ahead inflation remaining at around 3%.",
        "Overall, the favourable supply-side developments, if these persisted, should help dampen inflation, including through the impact of lower energy prices on the cost structures of energy-intensive sectors in the goods and services categories and on the real wage gap.",
        "At the same time, the improvement in the terms of trade constituted a positive income and wealth shock that would also support demand.",
        "The inflation outlook remained highly uncertain, although compared with the Governing Council’s expectations in December, the risks to the inflation outlook had become more balanced, especially in the near term.",
        "On the upside, existing pipeline pressures could still send retail prices higher in the near term.",
        "Moreover, a stronger than expected economic rebound in China could give a fresh boost to commodity prices and foreign demand.",
        "Domestic factors, such as inflation expectations persistently above the ECB’s target or higher than anticipated wage rises, could drive inflation higher, also over the medium term.",
        "On the downside, the recent fall in energy prices, if it persisted, might slow inflation more rapidly than expected.",
        "This downward pressure in the energy component could then also translate into weaker dynamics for underlying inflation.",
        "A further weakening of demand would also contribute to lower price pressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term.",
        "The net impact of the reopening of China’s economy on euro area inflation dynamics over the coming months was uncertain.",
        "While a strong rebound in Chinese production could further ease supply bottlenecks and increase competition in the global goods market, thus constituting a disinflationary impulse for the world economy, a recovery in Chinese demand could also add to inflationary pressures, especially through higher demand for commodities.",
        "Turning to financial and monetary developments, bank funding costs continued to reflect the transmission of monetary policy.",
        "Euro area bank bond yields had increased somewhat further since the December Governing Council meeting, reflecting the movements in the key ECB interest rates and in market rates.",
        "Deposit rates had also increased further, rising more strongly for firms than for households since May 2022.",
        "The spread between M3 savings deposits and overnight deposits had continued to widen, broadly in line with past rate hiking periods.",
        "Over time, this would likely lead to a considerable downward adjustment to the currently still high share of overnight deposit holdings, as currently there was an incentive to minimise deposit holdings in current accounts.",
        "Moreover, as the ECB’s targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) were being repaid, banks needed some longer-term deposits to meet various regulatory ratios.",
        "Thus, there was an expectation that this portfolio switch would continue.",
        "The increase in policy rates continued to be passed through to firms.",
        "The cost of debt financing had risen substantially since September 2022 and the strong increase in bank lending rates had led to a considerably narrower spread between the cost of market-based debt financing and the cost of bank borrowing at the end of 2022, compared with its September level.",
        "The current pace of monetary policy tightening was faster than in previous rate hiking cycles, reflecting the greater frequency and size of policy rate hikes.",
        "However, as this represented a reversal of previous loosening and was a necessary normalisation to address high inflation, it was not viewed as a severe squeeze by the banks or their customers.",
        "The transmission of monetary policy was also reflected in developments in bank lending conditions, as reported by banks in the latest bank lending survey.",
        "Banks continued to report a substantial net tightening of their credit standards on loans to firms and on loans to households for house purchase in the fourth quarter of 2022.",
        "Mr Lane noted that, since the survey was meant to assess the change in credit standards and not their level, it was legitimate to ask whether banks were tightening or just reversing a very accommodative set of credit standards.",
        "Still, as the tightening continued, at some point the trend would move beyond normalisation.",
        "Demand for bank loans to non-financial corporations had also declined in the final quarter of 2022.",
        "This was driven mainly by rising interest rates, in line with the increase in bank lending rates for firms.",
        "The bank lending survey revealed that the decline in demand for loans stemmed, in particular, from the commercial real estate, residential real estate and construction sectors, the most interest rate-sensitive sectors.",
        "In addition, loan demand was being dampened by lower financing needs for fixed investment and a moderation in firms’ financing needs for working capital.",
        "The bank lending survey reported a steep drop in demand for housing loans, which was unprecedented in the history of the survey.",
        "The main drivers of this fall were rising interest rates, deteriorating prospects for housing markets and low consumer confidence.",
        "Debt financing flows for firms had declined in November and December, owing to net redemptions in bank borrowing.",
        "There was therefore evidence of some deleveraging by firms at the end of 2022.",
        "Household borrowing dynamics had also weakened, driven mainly by developments in housing loans.",
        "The moderating trend in mortgage borrowing reflected tighter credit standards, rising lending rates and decreasing loan demand.",
        "Finally, on monetary developments, Mr Lane reported that the deceleration in loan creation was reflected in a decline in money growth.",
        "The moderation in broad money (M3) growth was driven mainly by outflows from narrow money (M1), the growth of which had fallen markedly.",
        "Persistently low remuneration of overnight deposits meant that the opportunity costs of holding M1 instruments had risen significantly.",
        "Deposit flows continued to reflect the shifts towards time deposits and to M3 instruments offering a remuneration closely linked to market rates.",
        "Against this background, Mr Lane proposed raising the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and communicating that the Governing Council expected to raise them further.",
        "The Governing Council should stay the course in raising interest rates significantly at a steady pace and in keeping them at levels that were sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target.",
        "Accordingly, in view of the underlying inflation pressures, Mr Lane proposed communicating the intention to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points at the next monetary policy meeting in March and to then evaluate the subsequent path of monetary policy.",
        "Signalling a 50 basis point step for the March meeting acknowledged that, in a very wide range of scenarios, the Governing Council saw that a further step of this size remained necessary to bring the key ECB interest rates to levels that would ensure a return of inflation to target in a timely manner.",
        "That said, looking beyond the immediate term, the monetary policy meeting in March would provide a waypoint at which to evaluate the subsequent path of monetary policy, including on the basis of a new set of staff macroeconomic projections that would then be available.",
        "The Governing Council would in this way ensure that its future policy rate decisions continued to be data-dependent and followed a meeting-by-meeting approach.",
        "Regarding the parameters that would govern the measured and predictable reduction of the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio that had been decided in December, it was important that the process remained transparent, simple to understand and as neutral as possible vis-à-vis the pricing of the classes of securities held in the portfolio.",
        "To this end, Mr Lane proposed that the partial reinvestments be conducted broadly in line with current practice.",
        "Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the Governing Council should also support the gradual decarbonisation of the Eurosystem’s corporate bond holdings, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.",
        "As regards the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), the signalling power of the framework for PEPP reinvestment flexibility was still supporting the monetary policy transmission mechanism.",
        "It was therefore proposed, in the spirit of prudence, to continue to allow flexibility in PEPP reinvestments as an effective first line of defence against remaining fragmentation risks.",
        "Ms Schnabel then detailed the proposal for the modalities to be followed in reducing the APP holdings, following the Governing Council’s decision at its December monetary policy meeting to reduce the APP portfolio by €15 billion per month on average from the beginning of March until the end of the second quarter of 2023.",
        "During the partial reinvestment phase, reinvestment amounts were expected to be relatively small.",
        "Any changes to the modalities would therefore have a very limited impact on the composition of the APP portfolio.",
        "This argued for keeping the modalities for the period of partial reinvestments simple, reflecting as much as possible the practice applied for full reinvestment.",
        "This approach would also preserve consistency with the overall monetary policy stance and market functioning, and should facilitate the Eurosystem’s public communication.",
        "As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane that subdued global economic activity and high levels of geopolitical uncertainty, especially owing to Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people, continued to act as headwinds to euro area growth.",
        "Subdued global activity would weigh on global trade and euro area foreign demand, despite improvements in global supply chains.",
        "In their discussion, members argued that, on the one hand, the reopening of the Chinese economy should lead to fewer bottlenecks in global supply chains and thus support global activity.",
        "This would also imply stronger foreign demand for the euro area.",
        "On the other hand, the reopening of its economy would increase China’s appetite for commodities, including natural gas, and would make China a strong competitor of Europe for supplies of liquified natural gas.",
        "This would put upward pressure on European gas prices and act as a headwind to Europe’s recovery.",
        "Pressure on prices of other raw materials, such as metals, owing to increased demand from China, was already visible.",
        "Which of the various forces at play would eventually prevail was not clear, creating considerable uncertainty for the euro area outlook.",
        "Members highlighted that energy commodity prices had come down significantly, in some cases returning to levels prevailing before the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine.",
        "This implied that the euro area’s import bill for fossil fuels would be reduced considerably.",
        "At the same time, it was mentioned that there was still considerable scepticism in energy markets about whether the current lower energy prices would persist.",
        "Part of the decline in prices seemed to be driven by the current mild winter weather, which would not necessarily be repeated next winter.",
        "It was widely stressed that the euro area continued to be confronted by an exceptionally high degree of global uncertainty, owing to both economic and geopolitical factors.",
        "With regard to economic activity, despite the challenging external environment, members concurred with Mr Lane that the euro area was likely to avoid a recession.",
        "Together with high inflation and tighter financing conditions, global headwinds were dampening spending and production, especially in the manufacturing sector.",
        "However, in addition to easing supply bottlenecks and more secure gas supplies, firms were still working through large order backlogs and confidence was improving.",
        "Moreover, output in the services sector had been holding up, supported by the continuing effects of the reopening of the economy and stronger demand for leisure activities.",
        "Rising wages and the recent decline in energy price inflation were also set to ease the loss of purchasing power that many people had experienced owing to high inflation.",
        "This, in turn, would support consumption.",
        "Overall, the economy had proved more resilient than expected and should recover over the coming quarters.",
        "The unemployment rate had remained at a historical low of 6.6% in December 2022.",
        "However, the rate at which jobs were being created was seen as potentially slowing, with unemployment rising over the coming quarters.",
        "Members commented on the surprising resilience of economic activity to date.",
        "The release of Eurostat’s preliminary flash estimate for GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 had surprised on the upside, which was regarded as good news, even if the figure had most likely been pushed up by volatile transactions in Irish intellectual property products.",
        "In combination with recent levels of inflation, which had been lower than expected, this stronger activity was seen as indicative of a partial reversal of the negative supply shocks that had shaped developments in the euro area economy over the past year.",
        "As a result, the euro area economy was now in a better situation than expected in December, and it was argued that recent developments were in line with a “soft landing” (with the economy slowing but avoiding a recession).",
        "In such circumstances, the Governing Council might be able to bring down inflation without overly large sacrifices in terms of economic activity.",
        "However, it was also maintained that, despite the better than expected economic news, the underlying economic situation had not fundamentally changed since the December meeting.",
        "Members concurred that government support measures to shield the economy from the impact of high energy prices should be temporary, targeted and tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy.",
        "In particular, as the energy crisis became less acute, it was important to start rolling these measures back promptly in line with the fall in energy prices and in a concerted manner.",
        "Any such measures falling short of these principles were likely to drive up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a stronger monetary policy response.",
        "Moreover, in line with the EU’s economic governance framework, fiscal policies should be oriented towards making the economy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt.",
        "Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, could help reduce price pressures in the medium term.",
        "To that end, governments should swiftly implement their investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme.",
        "The reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be concluded rapidly.",
        "Against this background, members assessed risks to the economic growth outlook as having become more balanced.",
        "Russia’s war in Ukraine continued to be a significant downside risk to the economy and could again push up the costs of energy and food.",
        "There could also be an additional drag on euro area growth if the world economy weakened more sharply than expected.",
        "Moreover, the recovery would face obstacles if the pandemic were to re-intensify and cause renewed supply disruptions.",
        "However, the energy shock could fade away faster than anticipated and euro area companies could adapt more quickly to the challenging international environment.",
        "This would support higher growth than currently expected.",
        "With regard to price developments, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Price pressures remained strong, partly because high energy costs were spreading throughout the economy.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food, as a measure of core inflation, remained at 5.2% in January.",
        "Other indicators of underlying inflation were also still high.",
        "Although supply bottlenecks were gradually easing, their delayed effects were still pushing up goods price inflation.",
        "The same was true for the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions: while weakening, the effect of pent-up demand was still driving up prices, especially in the services sector.",
        "Government measures to compensate households for high energy prices were, by contrast, dampening inflation in 2023.",
        "However, the scale of some of these measures depended on the evolution of energy prices and therefore their overall contribution to inflation was particularly uncertain, since they were expected to raise inflation once they expired.",
        "Market-based indicators suggested that energy prices were seen as being significantly lower over the current and coming years than had been expected at the time of the Governing Council’s December meeting.",
        "At the same time, wages were growing faster, supported by robust labour markets.",
        "However, recent data on wage dynamics had been in line with the December Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations stood at around 2% but warranted continued monitoring.",
        "Members concurred with the view that, although the rate of headline inflation had slowed since October, inflation was still far too high.",
        "While the good news ought to be welcome, it was argued that the December assessment of the inflation outlook had not fundamentally changed.",
        "Core inflation was still at levels foreseen in December.",
        "Therefore, it was much too early to declare victory.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that the inflation figures for the euro area’s largest economy had not been available in time to be included in Eurostat’s flash release for January.",
        "It was suggested that, in all likelihood, the final release would turn out to be somewhat higher for the euro area.",
        "In this context, it was underlined that core inflation had surprised slightly on the upside and remained unchanged from December, which was seen as the reason for the very muted market reaction to the lower than expected headline inflation figure for January.",
        "Since core inflation was often regarded as the “attractor” to which headline inflation would revert over the medium term, the latest inflation figures were not necessarily a welcome development overall.",
        "However, caution was expressed against focusing too much on measures of core inflation.",
        "Indeed, some elements of core inflation could move quite quickly, as seen from the experience in the United States and in line with the latest developments in euro area pipeline pressures.",
        "However, that would not necessarily imply that the more persistent elements of inflation, such as those related to wages, would turn around.",
        "It was recalled that the ECB monitored a wide array of measures of underlying inflation and undertook a detailed analysis of all components of headline inflation, rather than looking exclusively at particular measures of core inflation excluding several volatile items.",
        "Finally, it was mentioned that January inflation developments in Croatia, which had just joined the euro area, had been quite stable overall, compared with December.",
        "This suggested that the upward impact on prices from the cash changeover had been rather limited so far, contrary to the expectations of some people.",
        "As regards developments in core inflation, it was stressed that the pass-through of lower energy prices to this measure was a key factor in the assessment of the lag with which the rate of core inflation would show convincing signs of a deceleration.",
        "In this context, members debated the extent to which lower energy prices would lead to a moderation in underlying price pressures.",
        "This would depend on whether the pass-through from declining energy prices to other components of inflation was symmetric to that observed when energy prices increased.",
        "On the one hand, there were a number of reasons to believe that offsetting factors might lead to a slower pass-through of the disinflationary impulse than had been observed over the recent inflationary phase.",
        "In particular, the pass-through of earlier higher wholesale energy prices to retail prices took time and was still ongoing.",
        "Demand pressures had increased and wage pressures were rising on the back of wage negotiations that were being increasingly influenced by the high rates of current or past inflation and continued labour scarcity.",
        "In addition, the longer duration of wage contracts, rising minimum wages and staggered wage-setting could lead to a longer persistence of wage growth.",
        "In this respect, it was underlined that inflation pressures had been broadening for some time, so the driving force behind the inflation process was no longer a pure supply-side inflation shock.",
        "While the rise in inflation had started with a supply shock, it had turned into more of a demand-side type of inflation, making inflation more persistent.",
        "Moreover, there was evidence that the effect of an increase in energy prices on both GDP and inflation was very different from the effect of a decrease in energy prices, partly owing to downward price and wage rigidities.",
        "Recent evidence for the euro area showed that there was significant asymmetry, so the strong and fast pass-through observed as energy prices rose could not be expected to simply reverse swiftly as prices declined.",
        "On the other hand, it was argued that the decline in energy prices could well be transmitted more quickly to items of core inflation, in line with how the inflationary shocks had filtered through to this measure in recent quarters as prices rose.",
        "This suggested that core inflation might over time decline faster than envisaged in the December projections.",
        "In any case, it was noted that it was too early to observe such a rapid pass-through, as non-energy industrial goods inflation was still increasing, suggesting that the upside pressures from past higher energy prices were still present.",
        "Staggered price adjustment implied that households and firms might face higher energy prices only after some time had elapsed, so while energy commodity prices were falling, households and firms would still see some of the pass-through from the previous increase in energy prices.",
        "At the same time, it had to be acknowledged that the rate of industrial producer price inflation, excluding energy, had significantly decelerated, which was an important indication that lower energy prices would at some point translate into lower core inflation.",
        "In this context, it was also argued that in the three-month-on-three-month changes in the HICP excluding energy and food – the core “momentum” – there were already initial signs that underlying inflation would start to decline in annual growth rates, despite the fact that core inflation naturally responded with a lag to changes in energy prices.",
        "Members considered the implications of the reopening of China’s economy for inflation developments in the euro area.",
        "In this context, the remark was made that the reopening of a major global net-exporting economy, such as China, should on balance be expected to have a dampening impact on global price pressures, even if Chinese aggregate demand increased.",
        "Moreover, Chinese exporters could also be expected to lower their prices so as to regain some of the market share they had lost during the periods of lockdown, thus spurring price competition worldwide.",
        "However, upward pressures on inflation could be expected from an increase in Chinese demand, especially for commodities.",
        "There was still considerable uncertainty about the dampening impact of tighter monetary policy on inflation.",
        "The current inflation dynamics most likely did not yet reflect recent monetary policy tightening.",
        "In fact, it was argued on the basis of recent survey evidence that current financing conditions were hardly restrictive enough to dampen demand sufficiently to bring inflation back to the ECB’s target in a timely manner.",
        "This suggested that the contribution of monetary policy to disinflation had been limited so far, except indirectly through the appreciation of the euro and through the housing market channel in a number of euro area economies.",
        "With regard to exchange rates, it was noted that the recent appreciation of the euro implied lower inflationary pressures for the euro area in the period ahead.",
        "Members recalled that wage pressures were key in understanding the risks of second-round effects on inflation and in determining more persistent developments in underlying price pressures.",
        "Until a few months ago wage growth had remained moderate, but now there was a clear acceleration, which had to be taken into account in the outlook for core inflation.",
        "It was also highlighted that, despite the slowdown in economic activity, the labour market remained exceptionally tight.",
        "This meant that price pressures acting on labour-intensive services were unlikely to abate soon.",
        "The wage trackers were showing very strong wage increases under newly concluded contracts, which, in a context of the long durations of wage contracts and centralised wage bargaining, might lead to more persistent wage growth.",
        "However, it was also noted that wage growth for the pool of job movers should naturally be expected to be much higher than wage growth for job stayers, as the former were expected to account for the bulk of productivity growth.",
        "Following the pandemic, the economy was going through a period of intensified job churning, so it was natural that labour productivity and wage growth were accelerating.",
        "But this would not necessarily imply an increase in price pressures.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that the observed strong increase in minimum wages would add to existing wage pressures.",
        "There was evidence that, over time, increases in minimum wages could feed into wage increases further up the wage scale.",
        "Therefore, while there was wide agreement that there were no signs of a wage-price spiral, it was argued that current wage growth was clearly not consistent with a 2% inflation target, even when taking into account trend improvements in productivity.",
        "In this context, it was reiterated that wages were a lagging indicator, so only the most recent phase of wage growth should be seen as fully reflecting past price increases.",
        "In some sectors and some countries, wages were expected to rise by more than 10%.",
        "However, it was also observed that there was a lot of heterogeneity across sectors and countries.",
        "Moreover, while wage negotiations were still ongoing, wage claims were hardly reliable early indicators for the final wage agreements, which more often than not tended to be more moderate.",
        "It was observed that some catch-up effect from the loss of purchasing power accumulated over the past few years would unavoidably exert upward pressure on wage growth, in line with the December staff projections.",
        "At the same time, as energy prices had started to decline again, the loss in real income was now lower than previously expected.",
        "This could imply that the push to recover purchasing power via higher wages would also diminish, while leading to stronger than expected aggregate demand.",
        "It was underlined that, so far, the association of fast-rising prices with lagging wages had implied a large shift in income from labour to capital.",
        "Developments in unit profit growth remained very strong, which suggested that the pass-through of higher costs to higher selling prices remained robust.",
        "It was therefore widely stressed that developments in profits and mark-up warranted constant monitoring and further analysis on an equal footing with developments in wages.",
        "Members agreed that fiscal policies continued to play a crucial role in determining the degree of persistence of medium-term inflation.",
        "Several members were of the view that fiscal policy was working against monetary policy efforts to restore price stability.",
        "At the same time, some upward effects on inflation could be expected from the positive demand impact of fiscal policy – especially through the component of fiscal policy aimed at protecting consumers from a loss of purchasing power.",
        "Moreover, governments could be expected to refrain from providing additional support if there was a diminished need for it, because this was costly in budgetary terms.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, members took note of the assessments by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane of the latest developments in market-based measures of inflation compensation and in survey-based indicators, concurring that they were broadly in line with longer-term inflation expectations being well anchored.",
        "Financial markets continued to see the Governing Council as credible in bringing inflation back to target.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that some indicators suggested longer-term inflation expectations remained at risk of becoming unanchored.",
        "Market-based expectations for near-term inflation had come down substantially, whereas medium and long-term inflation expectations remained broadly unchanged.",
        "Moreover, some survey-based measures had even increased.",
        "Median three-year ahead inflation expectations in the Consumer Expectations Survey for December had reversed their previous decline and again stood at 3%.",
        "The Survey of Professional Forecasters had reported upward revisions for 2023 and 2024, for both headline and core inflation, while long-term inflation expectations had declined slightly.",
        "Against this background, members assessed that the risks to the inflation outlook had become more balanced, especially in the near term.",
        "On the upside, existing pipeline pressures could push retail prices higher in the near term.",
        "Moreover, a stronger than expected economic rebound in China could give a fresh boost to commodity prices and foreign demand.",
        "Domestic factors, such as a persistent rise in inflation expectations above the ECB’s target or higher than anticipated wage rises, could drive inflation higher, including over the medium term.",
        "On the downside, the recent fall in energy prices, if it persisted, might slow inflation more rapidly than expected.",
        "This downward pressure in the energy component could then translate into weaker dynamics in underlying inflation.",
        "A further weakening of demand would also contribute to lower price pressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "As monetary policy was tightened, bank lending rates for firms and households were rising.",
        "The growth of bank lending to firms had decelerated sharply over recent months.",
        "This partly stemmed from lower financing needs for inventories.",
        "But it also reflected weakening demand for loans to finance business investment, in the context of a steep upward move in bank lending rates and a considerable tightening in credit standards, as reported in the most recent euro area bank lending survey.",
        "Household borrowing had continued to weaken as well, reflecting rising lending rates, tighter credit standards and a sharp fall in the demand for mortgages.",
        "As the pace of loan creation was decelerating, money growth was also slowing rapidly, with a marked decline in the growth of its most liquid components, including overnight deposits, which was only partially compensated for by a shift to term deposits.",
        "It was highlighted that the weakening in credit dynamics, with the growth of loans to firms in the euro area coming to a virtual standstill in November and December, was in large part a natural and desired consequence of the ongoing normalisation of the monetary policy stance.",
        "However, the size and speed of the recent decline had to be monitored, since it might act as a drag on the recovery.",
        "A question was raised as to the extent to which the weakening in lending dynamics was due to lower demand, which could be traced back to monetary policy tightening, or to supply factors.",
        "Reference was made in this respect to the results of the latest round of the bank lending survey.",
        "This pointed to reduced loan demand being driven mainly by a higher general level of interest rates and lower demand for fixed investment, while the tightening of lending standards was driven mainly by banks’ risk perception and risk tolerance, and less by the cost of funds.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that euro area banks’ capital positions remained solid amid improving asset quality, despite challenging and quickly evolving macroeconomic and financial circumstances.",
        "Moreover, at the current stage of policy normalisation, banks saw their profitability boosted by increasing interest rate margins.",
        "Rising bank lending rates and lower lending volumes did not therefore necessarily reflect a reduction in banks’ intermediation capacity.",
        "Looking beyond bank-based financing costs, members noted that broader financial conditions had tightened overall after the December meeting, reflecting the Governing Council’s policy decisions and communication.",
        "Market expectations for the terminal rate had risen to levels that were regarded as more comfortable and more consistent with a timely return of inflation to target.",
        "Notwithstanding the uncertainty about the precise level of the terminal rate, these expectations had been remarkably stable since December.",
        "Moreover, members welcomed the fact that real forward rates were now positive along the entire yield curve.",
        "It was underlined that debt financing conditions had tightened amid a benign situation in the bond market, in conjunction with receding uncertainty.",
        "In particular, bond spreads remained generally contained and risk assets, including equities, were performing strongly.",
        "In addition, the ECB’s announcement in December regarding the plans to reduce the APP portfolio from March 2023 had not resulted in a substantial increase in term premia or government bond spreads.",
        "Overall, despite some volatility, it was felt that the market response to the Governing Council’s communication following its December meeting could thus be deemed a success.",
        "In view of recent monetary and financial developments, members noted that the transmission of monetary policy to financing conditions seemed to be working as intended and, so far, was broadly in line with previous hiking cycles.",
        "Given that transmission lags were long and variable – typically estimated to be around two years – it was argued that only a limited impact could be expected to be visible in demand and inflation at this point, at least if policy normalisation was assumed to have started in July 2022.",
        "However, it was suggested that December 2021, when the winding-down of asset purchases had been announced, could be a better starting point.",
        "This was when financing conditions had begun to tighten and mortgage rates had started to rise, well ahead of the time when policy rates were first raised.",
        "Accordingly, there had already been evidence for some time of a transmission of monetary policy to the housing market – which was welcome in view of the long-standing signs of overheating.",
        "Consumer loans and loans to non-financial corporations, by contrast, had seen little impact before the sharp deceleration in lending to firms observed in more recent months.",
        "As regards the extent to which financing conditions were constraining demand, reference was made to the ECB’s Corporate Telephone Survey.",
        "This suggested that larger firms continued to see financing conditions as favourable, with very few considering them a reason for reducing investment.",
        "Similarly, in the recent European Commission survey, financial constraints were not seen by firms as a significant factor limiting production.",
        "This was somewhat at odds with the results of the ECB’s bank lending survey, in which banks pointed to a significant negative contribution of interest rates to demand for loans.",
        "Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members stressed that inflation remained far too high.",
        "However, the latest data implied that risks had become more balanced, with both downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation having diminished relative to the Governing Council’s December assessment.",
        "Energy prices had declined rapidly, suggesting a partial reversal of the earlier adverse supply shock.",
        "If this development persisted, it should lead to a more rapid fall in headline inflation.",
        "It was also reiterated that, given the typically long transmission lags, the decline in headline inflation observed to date was unlikely to be the result of monetary policy tightening.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that core inflation and other measures of underlying inflation were likely to be stickier, with only limited evidence of a stabilisation so far.",
        "Overall, it was widely argued that the latest data and the change in the balance of risks did not fundamentally alter the assessment made by the Governing Council in December, and there was a need to stay the course in raising interest rates significantly at a steady pace and in keeping them at levels that were sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% medium-term target.",
        "While members agreed that there were no signs of a wage-price spiral taking hold, wage pressures were broadening, in line with the December 2022 projections.",
        "On the whole, although there were already signs of a stabilisation and turning point in headline inflation, the pass-through to persistent components of inflation was highly uncertain.",
        "Underlying price pressures remained strong, inflation in non-energy components of the price index was rising and a tight labour market would continue to exert pressure on core inflation.",
        "Moreover, a better than expected growth outlook would contribute to continued inflationary pressures, which were unlikely to abate by themselves without further significant policy tightening.",
        "In any case, it was argued on the basis of standard model elasticities that expected inflation for 2025 would now be closer to 2% than envisaged in the December 2022 projections, when taking into account the most recent data as well as changes in the external assumptions.",
        "These included higher market rates, a stronger euro in nominal effective terms and markedly lower energy prices.",
        "Beyond the impact of new data, members underlined the role of the change in market interest rate expectations, which had moved higher since the cut-off date for the December projections.",
        "At the same time, it was acknowledged that this was a partial analysis, and the strength and persistence of the various factors driving inflation required a full new round of projections to assess the implications for both the baseline outlook and the balance of risks.",
        "Uncertainty remained very high in any case, and it was unclear whether low energy prices would persist.",
        "Uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook stemmed particularly from the impact of China’s reopening, fiscal measures and the exchange rate on inflation.",
        "The next ECB staff projections would help shed more light on these questions and provide a more complete picture.",
        "It was remarked that basing the new staff projections on a yield curve that was more in line with members’ views should offer a better benchmark than the one provided by the projections available at the Governing Council’s December monetary policy meeting.",
        "Attention was drawn to the gap between the inflation trajectory embedded in the December projections and that implied by financial markets.",
        "Market participants appeared to be more optimistic and had substantially reassessed their inflation outlook, with inflation-linked swap rates having come down significantly at short horizons.",
        "This raised the question of whether markets were giving too much weight to the decline in energy prices.",
        "In this context, it was seen as somewhat surprising that markets had hardly reacted to the flash estimate for euro area January headline inflation being lower than projected.",
        "At the same time, they had reacted strongly to the upside surprise in January headline inflation in the euro area’s fourth largest economy, which had also seen an acceleration in core inflation.",
        "This could indicate that markets were now paying more attention to core inflation than to headline inflation to gauge underlying inflationary pressures.",
        "It was underlined that both survey and market-based indicators of inflation expectations at longer-term horizons remained broadly anchored, suggesting that the ECB was expected to be successful in bringing inflation down to 2% over the medium term.",
        "However, it was also pointed out that some survey-based measures of inflation expectations had been revised upwards, and that the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored had not disappeared.",
        "Against this background, broad support was expressed for Mr Lane’s proposal to raise the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and to communicate that the Governing Council expected to raise them further, indicating specifically that it intended to raise rates by another 50 basis points at the next monetary policy meeting in March and would then evaluate the subsequent policy path.",
        "Indeed, further increases were required for the Governing Council’s policy rates to enter restrictive territory, and it was necessary to keep them at levels that were sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target.",
        "Any assessment of what level of rates could be seen as excessively restrictive was complex and uncertain, although it was generally felt that concerns of “overtightening” were premature at the present high levels of inflation and in view of the likely persistence of underlying price pressures.",
        "It was emphasised that policy rates were, at present, barely consistent with the range of estimates for the neutral rate and that the large bond portfolio held by the Eurosystem was also still providing substantial policy accommodation.",
        "Moreover, even the benign inflation scenario expected by financial markets was conditional on the significant further rate increases priced into the forward curve.",
        "Overall, it was seen as imperative to stay the course and to show determination in the intention to tighten further.",
        "This would reduce unwarranted policy uncertainty and would be fully consistent with the decisions and communication adopted by the Governing Council in December.",
        "The view was expressed that, given the still substantial distance to the prospective terminal rate, there continued to be value – from a risk management perspective – in frontloading rate hikes at the present stage.",
        "In particular, showing determination now to raise rates significantly further could help to avoid being forced into further rate hikes later on.",
        "In this context, it was remarked that the risk-free forward curve suggested markets were expecting rate cuts not long after the terminal rate had been reached.",
        "This was seen to be somewhat at odds with the Governing Council’s communication in December that interest rates would need to stay at restrictive levels for inflation to return to the medium-term target.",
        "At the same time, this could be interpreted as markets having confidence that the ECB would be successful in stabilising inflation.",
        "In other words, once inflation had returned to target, interest rates could come down to a level consistent with the long-run “steady state”.",
        "While there was broad agreement that tightening needed to continue, reservations were expressed on the proposed communication of an intention for the March meeting.",
        "The point was made that policy rates were coming closer to a level where caution was needed to ensure that monetary policy was not tightened excessively.",
        "In view of the high uncertainty, the inflation outlook could change rapidly in either direction.",
        "This required a careful assessment of new data and of the effect of previous rate hikes on price dynamics.",
        "Not least in view of the ECB’s symmetric inflation target, the risk of doing too much deserved as much consideration as the risk of doing too little.",
        "It was noted that the short-term momentum in core inflation had also started to decline somewhat and, allowing for transmission lags, core inflation should come down further over time.",
        "Moreover, at the start of policy normalisation, large buffers of savings accumulated by households and firms, together with substantial pent-up demand, had ensured that monetary policy could be tightened without causing much harm to the real economy.",
        "Although these buffers remained at high levels, they had diminished.",
        "This implied that more caution was required as regards further tightening steps.",
        "The point was made that the proposed communication did not prevent adapting the intended change in the policy stance in March should it be required on the basis of substantial new information: expressing an “intention” was different from giving a “commitment”.",
        "It merely reflected the fact that, on the basis of the information available, the probability of a change occurring was seen as insignificant.",
        "It conveyed the view that, in the absence of abrupt changes in circumstances, a further 50 basis point interest rate hike at the March meeting was consistent with a very wide range of possible scenarios for the way inflation would develop.",
        "An advance indication of such a move would therefore provide clarity about the near-term direction of monetary policy.",
        "This reconciled communicating the intention to raise rates in March with a data-dependent approach.",
        "All in all, it was seen as important to provide a firm signal of policy intentions for the March meeting, while stating that the path of monetary policy following that meeting would be evaluated with an open mind, in line with the data-dependent approach.",
        "Turning to the policies affecting the size and composition of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, members widely agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal on the key parameters for the reduction of the APP portfolio and with the detailed operational modalities as described by Ms Schnabel and as set out in a dedicated ECB press release.",
        "In particular, given the relatively small reinvestment amounts expected, broad support was expressed among the members for a simple and neutral approach.",
        "This meant that the partial reinvestments over the period between March and the end of June would be conducted broadly in line with current practice.",
        "The remaining reinvestment amounts would be allocated proportionally to the share of redemptions across each constituent programme of the APP and, under the public sector purchase programme, proportionally to the share of redemptions of each jurisdiction and across national and supranational issuers.",
        "Just as the APP had supported the monetary policy stance when it was introduced, the reduction of the APP portfolio had to be carried out in a way that would support smooth policy normalisation and transmission, keeping the decline in the portfolio measured and predictable.",
        "It was highlighted that tilting reinvestments in the corporate sector purchase programme portfolio more strongly towards issuers with a better climate performance would signal the ECB’s continued commitment – without prejudice to the objective of price stability – to supporting the EU’s policies for achieving the climate goals of the Paris Agreement via a gradual decarbonisation of the Eurosystem’s corporate bond holdings.",
        "Members also agreed with the proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the PEPP portfolio.",
        "Maintaining this existing flexibility was seen as an efficient, pre-emptive approach to countering a potential re-emergence of risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the relevant press releases.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting."

    "2015": [
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed recent financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 21-22 January 2015, the announcement of the ECB’s expanded asset purchase programme (APP) had had a significant impact on euro area financial markets, contributing to lower government bond yields and money market rates, particularly at longer maturities, while the euro had depreciated further against the US dollar especially in the days leading up to the meeting.",
        "With the decision to expand the APP, augmenting the existing private sector asset purchase programmes with a public sector purchase programme (PSPP), euro area government bond yields had continued to trend lower, declining to all-time lows in most jurisdictions, with more bond yields turning negative since the 21-22 January meeting.",
        "At the same time, sovereign yield curves had flattened further.",
        "Intra-euro area sovereign yield spreads had narrowed after the initial widening recorded in the weeks following the January monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council.",
        "Market-based inflation expectations, for example as measured by the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, had initially risen following the announcement of the expanded APP but had subsequently declined, reversing most of the increase, to stand marginally above 1.60% at the beginning of March.",
        "Euro area equity markets had continued to perform strongly after the expanded APP announcement.",
        "As regards the implementation of the programme, market participants had highlighted the potential scarcity of bonds to be purchased under the PSPP, citing two main factors.",
        "First, net issuance from euro area jurisdictions over the life of the programme was expected to be modest, as already reflected in the pricing of term repos at significantly negative levels in some markets, pointing to expected scarcity of certain types of collateral.",
        "Second, in the view of market participants, the euro area government bond investor base could be reluctant to sell its holdings due to regulatory constraints, a lack of attractive investment alternatives and institutional investors managing “buy-and-hold” portfolios.",
        "Greek markets had experienced some episodes of high volatility in response to unfolding events, but contagion to other euro area government bond markets had remained limited.",
        "Purchases under the third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3) and the ABS purchase programme (ABSPP) had amounted to €51.2 billion and €3.5 billion respectively, as at Friday, 27 February 2015.",
        "In line with seasonal patterns, public issuance of covered bonds had rebounded in January and had remained sustained.",
        "The issuance had been more broad-based in terms of issuers and jurisdictions and also of a longer average maturity than previously observed.",
        "Secondary market spreads had continued to narrow for covered bonds across most euro area jurisdictions, particularly for Spain and Italy.",
        "Purchases under the ABSPP had remained low which, according to market participants, could be attributed to several factors.",
        "Supply had remained subdued, as many banks reportedly had more attractive funding alternatives than ABSs and saw limited scope for capital relief via ABS issuance given the absence of progress in the regulatory framework.",
        "A pick-up in new issuance was foreseen, while activity in the secondary ABS market was structurally thin and the market characterised by buy-and-hold behaviour.",
        "As regards Eurosystem credit operations, the maturity of the two three-year longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) on 29 January and 26 February 2015 had not had much of an impact on the level of excess liquidity, as the maturing operations had been, to a large extent, rolled over into shorter Eurosystem liquidity-providing operations.",
        "Furthermore, developments in autonomous factors had also affected the level of excess liquidity favourably.",
        "Combined with the monetary policy decisions taken at the 21-22 January meeting, the level of excess liquidity had put further downward pressure on money market rates.",
        "Since then, the three-month EURIBOR and the one-year EURIBOR had continued to decline and had reached new lows of 3.8 basis points and 2.3 basis points respectively, in part reflecting expectations of ample excess liquidity going forward.",
        "The EONIA had stood at levels between -4 and -6 basis points for most of the period, not far from the historical low of -8.5 basis points.",
        "In the repo markets, short-term rates for general collateral had stood between -10 basis points and -15 basis points.",
        "Regarding market measures of monetary policy expectations, the EONIA swap curve had declined by 6 basis points for maturities of longer than two years on expectations that the expanded APP would maintain significant excess liquidity over a longer horizon.",
        "As regards currency market developments, the euro’s exchange rate against the US dollar had been relatively stable for most of the period since the previous monetary policy meeting, before depreciating in the days immediately before the Governing Council meeting in Nicosia.",
        "Looking forward, market participants expected a further depreciation of the euro due to the divergence of the monetary policy stances in the United States and in the euro area, after recent improvements in the US labour market had brought forward market expectations about the first increase in the federal funds rate.",
        "In addition, according to market participants, the widening of the USD/EUR cross-currency basis spread, in particular for maturities of over two years, had been mostly driven by the expected increase in excess liquidity in the euro area following the implementation of the expanded APP and the notable increase in euro-denominated issuance by non-European institutions benefiting from favourable issuing conditions, even after swapping the proceeds into US dollars.",
        "In Switzerland, since the Swiss National Bank’s decision on 15 January 2015 to discontinue the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro, the Swiss franc had depreciated from CHF 1.00 to CHF 1.07 against the euro, thus pointing to a correction after the Swiss currency’s initial, very sharp appreciation following the decision.",
        "At the end of February, the exchange rate of the Danish krone against the euro had again moved closer to its central rate within ERM II, as inflows into the krone had slowed in response to the policy measures taken by the Danish authorities to defend the central rate.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "The recovery in the global economy was expected to continue but to remain uneven across regions.",
        "After weakening slightly in the fourth quarter of 2014, the momentum of global growth had shown signs of stabilising in early 2015, supported by previous declines in oil prices.",
        "Similarly, the global Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for new export orders pointed to sustained growth at the start of 2015, after some moderation in the fourth quarter of 2014.",
        "Annual OECD CPI inflation had fallen to 0.5% in January 2015, driven by a negative contribution from energy prices, although excluding food and energy it had decreased only slightly to 1.7%.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 21-22 January 2015, Brent crude oil prices had risen by 26% to stand at around USD 61 per barrel on 3 March 2015, still roughly 50% below their mid-2014 peak.",
        "Non-energy commodity prices had declined by 3%, mainly owing to developments in metal prices.",
        "The euro had depreciated by 4% in bilateral terms against the US dollar and by 2.2% in nominal effective terms.",
        "For the euro area, real GDP had risen by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2014.",
        "While no breakdown was as yet available, short-term indicators and available country data suggested that both domestic demand and exports had continued to provide impetus to growth.",
        "The modest growth dynamics in the euro area over recent quarters had mainly been driven by low investment activity in the context of continued weak corporate profits, ample spare capacity and uncertainty about the growth outlook.",
        "Although output had been growing in recent quarters and the unemployment rate had been declining from its peak in 2013, there was still considerable slack in the economy.",
        "Available indicators pointed to an ongoing economic recovery at the beginning of 2015.",
        "The composite output PMI and the European Commission’s economic sentiment indicator had improved in both January and February and stood, on average, above their respective levels in the fourth quarter of 2014.",
        "Private consumption dynamics appeared to have held up, as both the volume of retail sales and new car registrations had risen sharply in January.",
        "In addition, consumer confidence had risen markedly in January and February, reaching pre-crisis levels.",
        "As regards labour markets, employment had risen by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2014 and labour productivity per person employed had increased by 0.2% on an annual basis.",
        "The unemployment rate had decreased further, by 0.1 percentage point to 11.2% in January 2015, following similar declines in the previous two months.",
        "Survey data pointed to continued moderate employment growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 and in the first quarter of 2015.",
        "The March 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresaw annual real GDP increasing by 1.5% in 2015, 1.9% in 2016 and 2.1% in 2017.",
        "Compared with the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections published in December 2014, the projections for real GDP growth in 2015 and 2016 had been revised upwards, reflecting the favourable impact of lower oil prices, the weaker effective exchange rate of the euro and the impact of the ECB’s non-standard monetary policy measures taken since June 2014.",
        "To capture and assess the full impact of these measures on the macroeconomic outlook, a more comprehensive approach had been adopted to include also those channels of transmission that are usually not fully captured by the standard modelling framework used in the projection exercise, such as a portfolio rebalancing channel, certain expectational channels and real-financial feedback loops.",
        "Turning to prices, inflation in the euro area had remained very low and the short-term outlook was subdued.",
        "According to Eurostat, euro area annual HICP inflation had fallen to -0.2% in December 2014 and to -0.6% in January 2015.",
        "In February, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, it had rebounded to -0.3%, mainly reflecting a higher annual rate of change of the energy and food components.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food had stood at 0.6% in February, unchanged from January and 0.1 percentage point lower than in December 2014.",
        "PMI survey data on input and output prices in the manufacturing and services sectors had shown a slight rebound in February, after a substantial drop in January.",
        "The February data had been closer to the levels observed in December but continued to point to subdued price pressures in the months ahead.",
        "Similarly, European Commission survey data on selling prices across all the main sectors of the euro area economy had pointed to a pick-up, particularly in the retail sector.",
        "Producer price developments had remained very subdued.",
        "The annual rate of change in industrial producer prices excluding energy and construction had declined further to -0.7% in January, after -0.4% in December and -0.1% in November.",
        "Producer price inflation for non-food consumer goods, which tended to lead non-energy industrial goods price inflation, had declined in January compared with December and November.",
        "At the same time, the annual rate of change in import prices for intermediate goods had been positive for the third consecutive month and the annual rate of change in import prices for non-food consumer goods had increased following the depreciation of the euro.",
        "The annual rate of change in producer prices for consumer food had continued to decline since mid-2014.",
        "Looking ahead, the latest available information suggested that annual HICP inflation rates were likely to remain very low or negative for some time.",
        "This reflected mainly previous declines in US dollar-denominated oil prices, which were only partly offset by the recent depreciation of the euro.",
        "Looking further ahead, the upward slope of the oil price futures curve implied that the downward impact of the decline in oil prices would fade later this year.",
        "This, together with the expected recovery in demand, the impact of the non-standard monetary policy measures taken since June 2014 and the depreciation of the euro, would continue to support a gradual increase in inflation rates.",
        "The March 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresaw annual HICP inflation at 0.0% in 2015, 1.5% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017.",
        "In comparison with the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections published in December 2014, the inflation projection for 2015 had been revised downwards, mainly reflecting the past fall in oil prices.",
        "In contrast, the inflation projection for 2016 had been revised slightly upwards, also reflecting the expected impact of recent monetary policy measures.",
        "As regards measures of longer-term inflation expectations, the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the first quarter of 2015 indicated that the expected five-year-ahead inflation rate was 1.77%.",
        "Medium and long- term market-based measures, such as forward inflation-linked swap rates, had broadly stabilised since the previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "Regarding monetary and financial conditions, the EONIA forward curve had remained at values close to zero for the past few months at very short maturities, while it had declined further at longer maturities.",
        "Long-term sovereign bond yields in the euro area had also declined further following the announcement of the expanded APP.",
        "Euro area stock prices had increased strongly over the period.",
        "Bank lending rates had declined sharply since summer 2014, with the nominal cost of bank borrowing for non-financial corporations (NFCs) declining for two consecutive quarters and continuing to fall in January 2015.",
        "Money and loan growth had recovered further, albeit at low levels.",
        "The annual growth rate of M3 had increased to 4.1% in January 2015 from 3.8% in December.",
        "This was mainly driven by M1, in particular overnight deposits, while other short-term deposits continued to exert a drag on monetary dynamics.",
        "These substitution effects could be partly explained by the very low interest rates.",
        "The annual growth rate of M1 reached a robust 9.0% in January, which was consistent with a recovery in the euro area in the coming quarters.",
        "The recovery in loan dynamics had also continued.",
        "The annual rate of change in loans to NFCs originated by monetary financial institutions (MFIs), adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, had continued to improve in January 2015, rising to -0.9% from -1.1% in December 2014, after -1.4% in November and -1.6% in October.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households originated by MFIs, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, had increased slightly in January to 0.9%, from 0.8% in December.",
        "On an annual basis, MFIs had continued to increase their securities portfolios.",
        "The 12-month cumulated net purchases of securities by euro area MFIs had remained positive in January on account of larger holdings of domestic sovereign bonds and reduced net redemptions of private securities.",
        "Turning to other M3 counterparts, the annual flows of MFIs’ net external assets had moderated further in January 2015 from their historical peak in mid-2014.",
        "The ongoing reduction in longer-term MFI liabilities (excluding capital and reserves), which stood at an annual rate of change of -5.7% in January, after -5.5% in December, had contributed significantly to the increase in annual M3 growth.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, the average euro area fiscal stance was expected to remain broadly neutral.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet noted that economic activity had gained momentum recently and that the latest staff projections pointed to an improved outlook for euro area economic growth, although surrounded by downward risks.",
        "In addition, euro area HICP inflation was expected to return gradually towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the policy-relevant horizon, supported by the pronounced easing of the monetary policy stance resulting from the non-standard monetary policy measures adopted by the Governing Council since last June.",
        "Cross-checking the results of the economic analysis with the evidence from the monetary analysis, money and credit dynamics had strengthened further and were also consistent with the outlook of a slowly improving environment for euro area growth and inflation.",
        "All in all, the Governing Council’s decisions of 22 January 2015 had made a strong contribution in confronting the risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation and had given grounds for confidence.",
        "At the same time, the Governing Council had to remain cautious given the very early stages of the economic recovery and the high degree of uncertainty, particularly regarding the outer years of the projection horizon, which now extended up to 2017.",
        "Assessing policy options for the present meeting, Mr Praet noted that the current state of the economy and expected developments, as well as the baseline outlook for price stability, appeared to be consistent with calibrations underlying the latest monetary policy decisions.",
        "Accordingly, he saw no need at the meeting for the Governing Council to reconsider any of the parameters underlying the expanded APP.",
        "Nor was it warranted to consider any new policy initiative.",
        "Rather, the focus should now be on the decisive implementation of the measures decided previously.",
        "At the same time, it was important to recognise that a cyclical economic recovery in the euro area along the lines of the March 2015 ECB staff projections was no grounds for complacency, as important structural challenges remained to be addressed, relating in particular to low potential growth and high structural unemployment.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, the members of the Governing Council generally shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The latest economic data and, particularly, survey evidence available up to February 2015 were seen as pointing to a further improvement in economic activity at the beginning of the year.",
        "The various monetary policy measures taken by the Governing Council – including previous measures and the recently expanded APP – seemed to have contributed to this general improvement, notably supporting confidence as an important channel in the transmission of monetary policy.",
        "There also seemed to be clearer evidence that the past decline in oil prices had had a positive impact on aggregate demand in the short term, while the stimulative growth effect of the euro’s depreciation was likely to unfold with some delay.",
        "Overall, the evidence was seen as suggesting a gradual broadening and strengthening of the euro area economy going forward.",
        "This assessment was also broadly reflected in the March 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, as reported by Mr Praet.",
        "Predicated, as they were, on the full implementation of all the measures that had been decided since June 2014, the projections were seen to underpin the Governing Council’s commitment and confidence in the effectiveness of the measures, which had since been corroborated by a broad range of financial market variables.",
        "Members took note of the inclusion in the current projection baseline, unlike in previous projection exercises, of the full impact of the non-standard monetary policy measures, which also took into account financial transmission channels not normally captured by the standard projection framework, in addition to effects through the technical assumptions about interest rates, exchange rates and stock prices.",
        "The impact of the announcement of the expanded APP on the projections via the technical assumptions had accounted for a significant part of the upward revisions.",
        "In this respect, the importance of the methodological step capturing additional financial transmission channels should not be overstated, given the rather limited quantitative impact.",
        "In complementing their considerations of the baseline projections, members exchanged a number of views on the growth outlook.",
        "In line with Mr Praet’s presentation, the cyclical nature of the projected acceleration in growth was emphasised, with potential growth remaining rather modest, underscoring the need for structural reforms to bring about an improvement in potential growth.",
        "In addition, it was remarked that the growth outlook for 2017 depended on a number of factors that might become less growth-supportive towards the end of the projection horizon.",
        "Specifically, it was not clear to what extent monetary policy would still be as supportive in 2017, taking into account that the monthly purchases of euro area securities under the expanded APP were intended to last until the end of September 2016 and, in any case, until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with the aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2%.",
        "Moreover, the pick-up in growth over the projection horizon depended on the assumptions of continued low oil prices and a further strengthening in foreign trade.",
        "In this regard, the argument was put forward that oil price developments might turn out to be stronger than currently assumed if global demand were to improve considerably.",
        "In addition, growth might also be constrained by structural bottlenecks in some countries.",
        "As to the various demand components, a number of factors were cited that might suggest a relatively strong effect of the oil price-induced strengthening of real disposable income on consumption, as embedded in the staff projections.",
        "Reference was made to favourable short-term consumption indicators, such as retail trade and car registrations in some euro area countries.",
        "A relatively strong consumption effect might also be rationalised by recent monetary policy measures, which might have increased the propensity to consume the oil price-related income gain, by reducing uncertainty, including about possible second-round effects from the oil price decline.",
        "Regarding the euro area’s export profile, the view was expressed that a somewhat stronger impact of the euro’s depreciation on export growth than currently foreseen could not be excluded, especially for some open economies, where the current exchange rate implied a very notable improvement in price competitiveness.",
        "Business investment was expected to contribute to the recovery by gaining momentum over the projection horizon.",
        "In the discussion, several considerations were offered to highlight a number of challenges to a swift recovery in business investment.",
        "The point was made that the projected trajectory of profits and margins could be seen as optimistic, given firms’ continued lack of pricing power.",
        "Moreover, even if profits were to develop as foreseen in the projections, it was not clear that retained earnings would necessarily be used to fund investment in the euro area rather than in the rest of the world.",
        "Moreover, there was, as yet, little evidence from hard data to support the projected recovery in investment, which seemed to rely on the assumed impact from the low interest rate environment and a recovery in profits, as well as possibly being driven by high equity valuations, implying a low replacement cost of capital according to Tobin’s q.",
        "The remark was also made that some favourable factors were less relevant for investment spending by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that had no access to capital markets and might also be more affected by bank lending constraints.",
        "Members exchanged various views on the interaction between structural reforms and the output gap.",
        "On the one hand, the point was made that structural reforms, in particular those pertaining to labour markets, might be expected to widen the output gap initially, as they would raise potential output without a corresponding pick-up in real GDP.",
        "On the other hand, it was argued that some structural reform measures in labour and product markets had the potential to generate positive short-run effects on actual growth, notably in the case of the liberalisation of certain markets.",
        "Similarly, reforms that made investment more attractive would initially have a strong demand effect before capital formation over time led to an actual increase in potential output.",
        "As a result, structural reforms might be seen as increasing inflationary pressures through their positive impact on the output gap in the short run, rather than reducing them.",
        "It was, however, acknowledged that it might not be straightforward to identify reform measures that would indeed bring about this effect.",
        "In some cases, positive effects on potential output might be very slow to materialise, as in the case of education reform.",
        "This would argue in favour of heightened urgency in their implementation.",
        "In any case, it was difficult to disentangle potential and cyclical output developments in real time.",
        "Reference was made to experience in the United States, which had shown that what had appeared to be structural unemployment had eventually turned out to be cyclical, as soon as aggregate demand started to strengthen.",
        "A diagnosis that unemployment was mainly structural in nature should thus not necessarily lead to the policy conclusion that demand-side policies were not needed.",
        "Additionally, in view of the fact that the projection horizon had been extended to 2017, it was stressed that the degree of forecast uncertainty tended to increase with the length of the projection horizon.",
        "Uncertainty related not only to the underlying technical assumptions, such as those about oil prices and the exchange rate, and to potential growth and monetary policy in other jurisdictions, but also to the effectiveness of the adopted monetary policy measures.",
        "The point was also made that the technical complexities associated with fully incorporating the expanded APP into the projections in all likelihood implied that uncertainties were larger than in previous projection exercises, especially for the outer years of the projection horizon.",
        "Overall, members saw the risks surrounding the euro area economic outlook as remaining on the downside, although they had diminished following recent monetary policy decisions and the fall in oil prices.",
        "The downside risks to growth were seen as stemming from geopolitical and political risks inside and outside the euro area.",
        "The possibility of weaker than expected investment growth was also considered to be a downside risk.",
        "In addition, it was remarked that the materialisation of the baseline scenario depended on a number of assumptions – including the closure of the output gap, a recovery in investment growth, the strengthening of corporate pricing power and a significant pass-through of the fall in oil prices to spending – each of which might be seen as being associated with some downside risks.",
        "The question was posed as to whether the strong rebound in the economy, in part also as a result of monetary policy measures, was fully consistent with the underlying financial market assumptions, since expectations of a pronounced recovery in growth appeared not to square easily with interest rates and monetary conditions remaining very accommodative far into the future.",
        "At the same time, it could also be argued that, while a constant level of the exchange rate was embedded in the technical assumptions, a further weakening would affect other variables such as export growth and investment activity.",
        "The risk of insufficient progress on structural reforms was also highlighted as a major downside risk.",
        "In that context, the argument was advanced that the projected pick-up in growth could weaken incentives for governments to pursue the necessary structural reforms and thereby adversely affect potential growth.",
        "The remark was made that a cyclical recovery along the lines of the March 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections was no cause for complacency, given the low level of potential growth and high structural unemployment, as had been highlighted by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The point was also made that the importance of structural reforms for growth in the short term should not be overestimated.",
        "It was argued that the sharp contraction in output in 2008-09 had mainly been due to a large negative demand shock, which had been exacerbated by the ensuing weakness in demand owing to deleveraging.",
        "Nevertheless, structural reforms were absolutely essential, even if politically difficult to implement, for medium-term growth prospects, not least in view of adverse demographic developments, which called for compensatory efforts to increase total factor productivity.",
        "The issue was raised that the possibility of short-term demand effects emanating from a more contractionary fiscal stance had to be seen in perspective, in the light of the recent decisions by the European Commission in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact.",
        "In that respect, it was also remarked that, while the direct impact on growth over the short term of a flexible interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact was likely to be limited, the negative effect over the medium and long term on the overall credibility of the institutional framework of EMU could potentially be significant.",
        "It was remarked that weakening the credibility of the fiscal framework also entailed a risk of a negative impact on the effectiveness of the expanded APP through heightened uncertainty adversely affecting expectations and risk premia.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that, from a macroeconomic point of view, one should be cautious in calling for too restrictive a fiscal policy stance at the current juncture.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Reference was made to the fact that the inflation outturn for February was above the projected levels for the first time following a long series of lower than expected outcomes, but at the same time there was also a lack of clear improvement on the nominal side.",
        "On the basis of the current information and prevailing futures prices for oil, annual HICP inflation could be expected to remain very low or negative in the months ahead.",
        "Later in 2015 inflation rates could be expected to start increasing again, supported inter alia by the favourable impact of recent monetary policy measures on aggregate demand.",
        "This assessment was also broadly reflected in the March 2015 ECB staff projections as presented by Mr Praet earlier in the meeting.",
        "In their discussion of the inflation outlook, the members put forward a number of considerations and challenges.",
        "Regarding the relatively pronounced rebound in inflation rates over the projection horizon, it was pointed out that this was largely a reflection of base effects related to the past sharp decline in oil prices, which was assumed not to continue.",
        "The crucial role of external factors, notably oil prices and the exchange rate, in driving inflation developments over the projection horizon was highlighted, and their effect was expected to be temporary.",
        "The expected contribution of lagged exchange rate effects in bringing inflation rates close to 2% in 2017 was singled out in particular.",
        "Some caution was expressed concerning the degree to which the pick-up in inflation rates could be expected to be maintained in 2017 and beyond the projection horizon.",
        "It was remarked that recent wage agreements in a large euro area country confirmed that second-round effects stemming from the past decline in oil prices were likely to be contained in that Member State and any overall effect on prices was therefore likely to be limited.",
        "Accordingly, the past sharp fall in oil prices had thus far had no visible impact on wage negotiations in a country where nominal rigidities did not limit the scope for downward adjustment in wage settlements.",
        "In several other countries, such downward adjustments might be limited by nominal rigidities, implying that wage developments would not fully reflect the past decline in oil prices.",
        "Some comments were also made about the key role in the March 2015 projections of developments in profit margins in bringing inflation back into line with the Governing Council’s aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2%.",
        "The members exchanged views regarding the risks surrounding the inflation projections.",
        "It was observed that, while the projected reversal in the inflation trend might indeed be the most likely scenario, a number of factors warranted close monitoring.",
        "These included the trend in global inflation and the possibility that the past decline in oil prices might be more persistent than currently envisaged.",
        "In any case, the Governing Council would continue to monitor closely all relevant factors, including the pass-through of its monetary policy measures, geopolitical developments, exchange rate developments and energy price developments.",
        "All in all, the members agreed that, even though the March 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections suggested that inflation rates would move closer to 2% over the projection horizon, there was no room for complacency.",
        "It was underlined that for the baseline scenario to materialise the expanded APP had to be fully implemented and supported by appropriate communication.",
        "Moreover, it was essential that structural reforms were ambitiously implemented, in part with a view to supporting private sector decisions conducive to innovation.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, the members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction that recent data had confirmed a gradual increase in underlying growth in broad money and the continued gradual recovery of loans to NFCs.",
        "Despite a gradual improvement, the dynamics of loans to NFCs remained subdued.",
        "Annual growth in loans to households increased to 0.9% in January 2015.",
        "Recent monetary policy measures were expected to support a further improvement in credit flows.",
        "The view was advanced that the evolution of the monetary data had consistently provided moderately positive news for a number of months.",
        "This suggested that the impact of the credit easing package that had been adopted during the course of 2014 was starting to be felt and that comfort could be drawn with respect to the effectiveness of those measures.",
        "The question was also raised as to whether the renewed expansion of assets on the MFI balance sheet without a concomitant increase in bank lending, notably associated with an increase in the MFI net external asset position, could be interpreted as a symptom of speculative positions in the banking system, possibly in part as a side effect of the monetary policy programmes in place.",
        "It was, however, also noted that a more benign explanation of such developments could be offered, with higher MFI net external assets reflecting capital inflows and external demand for euro area assets.",
        "A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis broadly confirmed the appropriateness of the further monetary policy accommodation provided with the decisions taken on 22 January 2015.",
        "All the monetary policy measures adopted, taken together, should support further improvements in credit flows, provide support to the euro area recovery and bring inflation rates closer to levels below, but close to, 2% over time.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, the members generally shared the assessment that significant positive effects from the monetary policy decisions taken on 22 January 2015, in conjunction with the package of measures decided in June-September 2014, could already be seen, namely an easing in financial market conditions and in the cost of external finance for the private economy.",
        "Moreover, recent data on economic activity had been somewhat positive and there were signs of a turnaround in inflation dynamics, including a stabilisation in market-based measures of inflation expectations.",
        "This provided grounds for “prudent optimism” regarding the scenario of a gradual recovery and a return of inflation rates to levels closer to 2%.",
        "It was recalled that the March 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections were predicated on the full implementation of all monetary policy measures taken by the Governing Council, including the expanded APP comprising monthly purchases of €60 billion, which were intended to be carried out until the end of September 2016 and, in any case, until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with the aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2%.",
        "The March 2015 projections should therefore not be interpreted as suggesting that the latest monetary policy measures were less necessary.",
        "On the contrary, they confirmed that full implementation of these measures was required to deliver on the Governing Council’s mandate.",
        "At the same time, the Governing Council would continuously assess the effectiveness of the measures and would regularly review progress towards the attainment of the objectives as evidence accumulated over time.",
        "The favourable financial market impact of the latest measures was highlighted again, particularly with respect to the yield curve and, to a lesser degree thus far, with respect to inflation expectations.",
        "This confirmed that the measures were working as intended in anticipation of the start of purchases under the expanded APP, laying the groundwork for a positive scenario.",
        "It also underlined the need to fully implement the measures, as otherwise part of the favourable market impact might be reversed.",
        "Hence, it was essential for the Governing Council to remain firm, implementing the measures adopted without hesitation until the objectives were reached, in line with its commitment to keep this policy in place for as long as needed.",
        "At the same time, there were various reasons for caution with respect to the materialisation of the March ECB staff projection baseline and to the expected time frame for the non-standard measures, particularly towards the end of the horizon.",
        "The high degree of uncertainty surrounding the transmission of non-standard policies and the lack of historical precedent were emphasised, also in view of limited and mixed evidence, thus far, on the impact of earlier non-standard measures.",
        "Moreover, other policy areas needed to play their part in supporting a sustained recovery.",
        "The view was widely shared that, on the basis of current information, the package of monetary policy measures taken since June 2014, including the expanded APP, was warranted and fully adequate to gradually reach the intended objectives over time.",
        "There was therefore no need to consider any new policy initiatives at this stage or to reconsider any of the parameters of the PSPP decided on 22 January 2015.",
        "The focus was now on the determined implementation of all the monetary policy measures that had been adopted over recent months.",
        "A number of reflections were offered on the scope and effectiveness of the purchase programmes as a basis for monitoring their implementation going forward.",
        "Caution was expressed in view of some market perceptions that the deposit rate could fall below -20 basis points, which, it was affirmed, should be regarded by the Governing Council as the effective lower bound.",
        "With respect to the parameters of the PSPP, the possibility of adjusting the issue limit – initially set at 25% – on some future occasion was recalled, in view of possible scope for differentiation according to applicable law on blocking minority clauses in collective action clauses in different jurisdictions.",
        "Regarding the envisaged maturity profile of purchases, it was underlined that conducting purchases in the same proportions across the yield curve appeared appropriate to safeguard market neutrality.",
        "However, the behaviour of bond holders in different segments of the yield curve could differ significantly and needed to be taken into account.",
        "This called for close monitoring of the impact of purchases on interest rates and on different investor “habitats” along the yield curve.",
        "With regard to purchases from non-resident holders, the remark was made that in this case the transmission channel of the additional liquidity provided would not operate in the same way as typically assumed for domestic holding sectors, but would depend on the use made of the extra liquidity injected, while in any case a stimulus was to be expected, either via a rebalancing of portfolios into other euro area assets or via an impact through the exchange rate channel.",
        "More broadly, attention was drawn to the need to carefully monitor changes in the operation of financial markets over the coming years in the context of evolving financial structures in reaction to non-standard policies, unusual constellations of yields and changes in risk appetite, in conjunction with regulatory reforms.",
        "Understanding such changes would be important from the perspective of financial stability, but it was also seen as essential for assessing the transmission mechanisms for monetary policy geared to price stability.",
        "Overall, the sentiment was widely shared that with the January 2015 monetary policy decisions the Governing Council had added a sizeable further stimulus and had now deployed almost the full range of the instruments at the disposal of monetary policy in support of the economic recovery to deliver on its price stability mandate.",
        "To complement the measures taken by the ECB, determined policy action was needed in other policy areas.",
        "A strong message to governments was warranted to seize the opportunity for a renewed impetus for structural reforms to boost potential growth.",
        "In this context, it was also felt that greater efforts were needed at the European level to explain clearly that structural supply-side measures were aimed at increasing productivity, competitiveness and employment, and hence welfare in the longer term, even if possible adverse short-term impacts on demand could not be ruled out.",
        "With regard to fiscal policies, members underlined that full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact was key for confidence in Europe’s fiscal framework.",
        "While it was judged that the Governing Council should not interfere with the application of the fiscal rules on a case-by-case basis, which was the prerogative of the European Commission, concerns were expressed about a tendency in recent decisions to exercise greater discretion in the implementation of the legal provisions and to use flexibility to the maximum extent.",
        "Doubts about the enforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact were seen to increase uncertainty and to risk weakening further the credibility of the fiscal framework over time.",
        "It was widely felt that lasting damage to confidence from a weakening of the rules-based approach would far outweigh any rather limited short-term gains that could conceivably arise by supporting activity via a loosening of the aggregate fiscal stance, as opposed to a full and consistent implementation of the rules at present and in future.",
        "However, a view was also put forward that, from a macroeconomic perspective, the recent decisions by the European Commission were defendable and appeared to be in line with the broadly neutral fiscal stance as entailed in the projections.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement that the Governing Council should send a firm message on the need for full and consistent implementation of the fiscal rules.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.20% respectively.",
        "With regard to the PSPP, the Governing Council adopted the ECB Decision on a secondary markets public sector asset purchase programme, establishing the PSPP and its eligibility criteria (ECB/2015/10).",
        "Regarding implementation issues related to the PSPP, the Governing Council also decided on the initial list of eligible agencies located in the euro area, which would apply from 5 March 2015.",
        "This initial list of eligible entities may be amended following the Governing Council meeting on 15 April 2015, based on monetary policy considerations and duly reflecting risk management aspects.",
        "The Governing Council furthermore decided on the list of eligible international organisations and multilateral development banks located in the euro area.",
        "Both lists would be included in the communication provided by the ECB on its website on “Implementation aspects of the public sector purchase programme”.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed recent financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 2-3 September 2015, the main event for market participants had been a postponement of the expected first rate hike in the United States, following the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on 16-17 September.",
        "This had reverberated in different ways through international bond and foreign exchange markets and to the euro area, where, over the same period, market expectations of additional monetary stimulus measures had increased.",
        "Regarding developments in international markets, market expectations of an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate by the FOMC in 2015 had been receding owing to increasing uncertainty, linked partly to macroeconomic developments and partly to the reference to global economic and financial developments in the FOMC’s statement.",
        "According to the federal funds futures-implied curve, in mid-October the market was assigning a probability of around only 30% to a rate hike by December 2015, while the first rate increase was fully priced in only by around mid-2016.",
        "Moreover, ten-year US Treasury yields had temporarily reached their lowest levels since April 2015, at slightly below 2%, while the US dollar had depreciated against all major currencies, as well as emerging market currencies.",
        "The change in market expectations regarding US monetary policy had supported risk sentiment globally.",
        "Equity market indices had bounced back from their September lows, emerging market currencies had stabilised and implied volatilities had started to decrease across market segments.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had temporarily rebounded to above USD 50 per barrel.",
        "Moreover, beyond their direct impact on euro area government bond yields, developments in the United States had had an indirect impact on the euro area through the expectations channel.",
        "In that context, market participants were increasingly discussing three possibilities with regard to a further easing of the ECB’s monetary policy stance: first, an increase in the monthly volume of purchases of euro area government bonds; second, an extension of the asset purchase programme (APP) beyond September 2016; and, third, a further lowering of the deposit facility rate.",
        "Euro area government bond yields had been on a downward path since early June, with the increase in expectations of further monetary easing in the euro area and the continuation of purchases under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) further contributing to this trend, together with the impact of developments in global bond yields.",
        "The implementation of the PSPP had remained smooth, despite somewhat less supportive market liquidity conditions during the summer.",
        "No sizeable demand for borrowing securities under the securities lending facility had been observed, as conditions had remained normal in the repo market.",
        "Looking at countries under financial assistance programmes, both Greece and Cyprus had recorded a sharp downward adjustment of sovereign bond yields, due in Greece to a perception of increased political stability and the start of discussions on the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding, and in Cyprus to the successful conclusion of the last two review missions and the inclusion in the PSPP of that country’s sovereign bonds.",
        "After seven months of the three purchase programmes running in parallel, primary market data for covered bonds and corporate bonds suggested better financing conditions for banks and corporations, which were reflected in their ability to raise funding in higher volumes and with longer maturities.",
        "Activity in the euro area interbank money market had remained moderate as a result of ample excess liquidity, which had reached approximately €500 billion on 20 October and was expected to further increase at a steady pace owing to the ongoing APP.",
        "Cash rates had remained relatively stable, with overnight maturities trading near -20 basis points and the EONIA rate hovering around -14 basis points.",
        "By contrast, EONIA forward rates, as well as derivatives markets, had shifted downwards as a result of changing expectations regarding monetary policy in the euro area.",
        "EONIA forward contracts starting from June 2016 were currently trading close to, and on some days even below, the level of the deposit facility rate of ‑0.20%.",
        "Regarding the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), the fifth operation, carried out on 24 September 2015, had resulted in an allotment of €16 billion, bringing the total recourse to TLTROs to €400 billion, which currently represented 75% of the Eurosystem’s outstanding credit operations.",
        "Market analysts attributed the low take-up to improving funding conditions, especially in those countries where short-term funding markets had reopened at sizeable volumes, and to the comfortable liquidity position of banks.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Available data pointed to continued moderate and uneven global real GDP growth in the third quarter of 2015.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had declined slightly from 53.9 in August to 52.8 in September, which was below its long-term average but still above 50 and thus within expansionary territory.",
        "Global trade had remained at low levels.",
        "Although the latest data for July pointed to some stabilisation in the third quarter of 2015, survey-based indicators – including the global PMI for new export orders, which had further declined in September – suggested continued weakness in the months ahead.",
        "Global inflation had remained moderate.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area had remained unchanged in August, in terms of both headline inflation (0.6%) and inflation excluding food and energy (1.7%).",
        "Compared with early September, both commodity prices and the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro against 38 trading partners had been broadly stable.",
        "Turning to the euro area, domestic demand had thus far proved resilient compared with the somewhat weaker external environment.",
        "Real GDP had risen by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2015, following a rise of 0.5% in the previous quarter.",
        "Both quarterly growth rates had been revised up by 0.1 percentage point with Eurostat’s second release of euro area national accounts on 8 September.",
        "Available survey data were consistent with continued economic expansion in the third quarter of 2015.",
        "Monthly trade data up to July showed that euro area exports had continued to grow overall, while exports to emerging market economies had declined further.",
        "Industrial production (excluding construction) had stood, on average in July and August, 0.3% above the level recorded in the second quarter.",
        "In addition, both the Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) and the PMI stood in the third quarter above their respective long-term averages.",
        "In September the PMI had declined, while the ESI had improved.",
        "Recent data on retail trade and new passenger car registrations were in line with a continued increase in private consumption in the third quarter.",
        "In addition, the near-term outlook for growth in real disposable income remained favourable, supported by the impact of energy price developments.",
        "Labour markets were also expected to continue to improve gradually.",
        "Employment had increased further by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2015.",
        "The unemployment rate, which had been on the decline for over two years, stood at 11% in August, the lowest rate since the beginning of 2012.",
        "Non-construction investment had continued to recover from its trough in early 2013.",
        "Following several years of low profitability, sectoral data available up to the second quarter of 2015 suggested that the profits of non-financial corporations were recovering.",
        "The ratio of both net operating surplus and retained earnings to value added had increased in the second quarter of 2015.",
        "The bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2015, conducted in October, also showed that the demand for loans for investment purposes, while volatile since the end of 2014, had remained at a relatively high level.",
        "Forecasts for real GDP growth from the private sector and international institutions released since early September remained broadly in line with the September 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "The IMF’s forecast for real GDP growth was marginally lower in 2016 and 2017, while the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the fourth quarter of 2015, which would be released on 23 October, was in line with the ECB staff projections.",
        "Risks to the growth outlook were seen to be on the downside, reflecting in particular heightened uncertainty regarding developments in emerging market economies.",
        "The refugee crisis could generate some upward impact on growth via increased government spending and construction.",
        "Turning to price developments in the euro area, the decline in annual HICP inflation to -0.1% in September from 0.1% in August mainly reflected a further drop in energy price inflation, only partially compensated for by a higher annual rate of change in the unprocessed food component.",
        "Underlying inflation, as measured by the HICP excluding food and energy, had stood unchanged at 0.9%.",
        "Evidence of a sustained rise in underlying inflation had yet to be seen.",
        "The stalling of the pick-up in underlying inflation over the previous few months could be attributed to the recent strengthening of the euro exchange rate and the indirect effects from recent renewed declines in oil prices.",
        "Overall, import prices had remained the main source of upward pipeline pressures, while domestic producer prices continued to be weak and nominal wages subdued.",
        "Compared with inflation forecasts from other international organisations, the September 2015 ECB staff projections for 2016 were slightly higher than those of the IMF and the SPF and in line with Consensus Economics and the Euro Zone Barometer.",
        "For 2017, the September 2015 ECB staff projections were higher than the forecasts of both the IMF and the SPF.",
        "Longer-term inflation expectations, as measured by survey and market-based data, were broadly unchanged since the early-September Governing Council meeting.",
        "Forward inflation swap rates had changed little, with the five-year forward rate five years ahead standing at 1.7% on 20 October 2015.",
        "In addition, in the latest SPF, the expected five-year-ahead inflation rate was unchanged at 1.9%.",
        "Moreover, the price of protection against deflation had declined.",
        "Turning to financial and monetary conditions, financial market volatility had subsided somewhat but remained elevated, amid continued uncertainty about the global environment.",
        "The EONIA curve had flattened and financing conditions for euro area non-financial corporations (NFCs) remained favourable.",
        "The cost of external financing for NFCs had edged up somewhat but remained close to its historical low, with the continued pass-through of the monetary policy accommodation in place to lower bank lending rates, while the cost of equity and market-based debt was somewhat higher than in the spring.",
        "Net issuance of debt securities and quoted shares by NFCs had moderated since the summer, following some frontloading of corporate debt issuance in the first quarter of 2015.",
        "As regards money and credit developments, annual M3 growth had been 4.8% in August, down from 5.3% in July.",
        "It continued to be driven by strong M1 growth.",
        "MFI lending to the non-financial private sector had continued its gradual recovery.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for sales and securitisation) had increased to 1.0% (from 0.9% in July), while the annual growth rate of loans to NFCs (adjusted for sales and securitisation) had increased to 0.4% (from 0.3% in July).",
        "These developments were being supported by improvements in both credit supply and demand factors.",
        "As regards fiscal policies, the government deficit and debt ratios were expected to decline over the projection horizon, on account of the cyclical improvement in the euro area economy and declining interest expenditure.",
        "At the same time, the average euro area fiscal stance, measured as the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was expected to remain broadly neutral.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet recalled that, at its meeting on 2-3 September 2015, the Governing Council had concluded that the economic recovery was expected to continue, albeit at a somewhat slower pace, and that it was likely to take longer to reach its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, compared with expectations earlier in the year.",
        "The Governing Council had also concluded that downside risks had increased but that it was premature to draw firm conclusions, in particular on whether developments in emerging market economies would have a lasting impact on the outlook for price stability in the euro area.",
        "Incoming data since September had confirmed the ongoing euro area recovery, with weaker foreign demand being, by and large, compensated for by resilient domestic demand.",
        "Available information had also indicated continuing weak upward price pressures, and in particular weaker signals regarding a possible pick-up in underlying inflation.",
        "At the same time, credit conditions had continued to improve while financial conditions were broadly unchanged since 2-3 September 2015, although they were somewhat tighter than in the technical assumptions underlying the September 2015 ECB staff projections, notably when taking into account the stronger euro exchange rate.",
        "Looking ahead, a mechanical update by ECB staff of their September projections with market data available up to the meeting of the Governing Council in Malta suggested that there were downside risks to the September baseline scenario, notably as regards the inflation outlook.",
        "As a result, the anticipated timing of inflation normalising towards 2% was likely to be pushed back again, as had already been the case in previous staff projections.",
        "While weak price pressures were largely the result of lower oil prices, indirect effects on core inflation were significant in the present environment.",
        "Cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis indicated the need to firmly implement the Governing Council’s monetary policy decisions and to monitor closely all relevant incoming information as concerned their impact on the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "In the light of the above, it was important that the Governing Council reiterated that the euro area economic recovery remained moderate, with downside risks persisting, and that the strength and persistence of the factors currently slowing the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term required thorough analysis.",
        "Accordingly, the Governing Council needed to re-examine the degree of monetary policy accommodation at its December 2015 monetary policy meeting, when the new Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections would be available, and task ECB staff, in consultation with the relevant Eurosystem committees, with conducting a technical analysis of the monetary stimulus achieved, reviewing the options available and analysing their efficacy.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Incoming information, such as the most recent PMI and ESI, confirmed a continued moderate economic recovery in the euro area, broadly in line with the September 2015 ECB staff projections.",
        "While external demand appeared to be somewhat weaker than expected, in an environment of muted global trade growth, domestic demand continued to show resilience, driven mainly by private consumption.",
        "The balance of risks continued to be tilted to the downside, with heightened uncertainties stemming in particular from the economic outlook in emerging market economies.",
        "Several remarks were made on the diverging contributions of individual demand components to euro area economic activity.",
        "It was noted that economic growth had recently been supported mainly by private consumption, which had remained robust in the face of adverse global shocks.",
        "Investment growth remained relatively subdued, although the recovery in corporate profits and the strength of retained earnings could provide some support looking ahead.",
        "The weak investment dynamics were seen as a challenge for euro area growth prospects, and the view was expressed that the European Commission’s investment plan may fall short of providing a decisive contribution to reinvigorating investment.",
        "External demand dynamics had disappointed, as global economic activity and global trade growth had lost momentum.",
        "It was recalled that, even if the short-term outlook for economic growth had not changed much compared with the previous meeting, the recovery in the current business cycle was particularly sluggish.",
        "However, it was also underlined that the protracted nature of the euro area adjustment process was no longer a surprise element and could be explained by the combination of the financial crisis and the prevailing imbalances across the Monetary Union.",
        "A cross-country comparison of economic growth was seen to confirm this view, as the strength of the economic recovery in individual euro area economies was largely correlated with the extent of pre-crisis imbalances.",
        "It was therefore deemed useful to deepen the analysis of the nature of the crisis and to disentangle the structural and cyclical drivers of current economic developments.",
        "The economic outlook continued to be surrounded by significant uncertainty, as risks of further balance sheet adjustments and deleveraging remained relevant and the international economic environment appeared fragile, in particular with regard to the outlook for emerging market economies.",
        "Uncertainty about China was still seen to be particularly high.",
        "While there were indications that the slowdown in China would remain gradual and moderate, views were also expressed that a more protracted rebalancing and deeper slowdown were possible.",
        "While the effects of China’s slowdown on the euro area, including through confidence channels, had so far remained contained, it was seen as important to monitor developments closely and to further analyse the potential transmission channels to the euro area economy.",
        "A further source of uncertainty for the euro area economic outlook stemmed from the ongoing refugee crisis and the related migration flows.",
        "Although it was generally considered to be too early to conduct a reliable evaluation of the economic impact, given the high uncertainty regarding the size of migration flows, it was highlighted that the impact on economic activity could potentially be positive, in particular through the expansionary effect of additional fiscal expenditure, provided that such expenditure was not offset by other fiscal measures.",
        "With a lag, construction activity could also be fostered.",
        "Members recalled that the economic outlook also depended on actions in other policy areas and reiterated the key contribution of decisive structural and fiscal policy measures needed for a sustainable recovery.",
        "It was emphasised that structural reforms should be accelerated, in particular in a number of countries where reform efforts had stalled.",
        "While the positive economic impact of structural reforms would generally take some time to unfold, a number of measures could enhance household and investor confidence and strengthen domestic demand in the short run.",
        "Fiscal policy should also support the economic recovery by ensuring a growth-friendly composition of revenues and expenditure and by implementing, where fiscal space allowed, additional public investment expenditure and growth-friendly tax reductions.",
        "Some calls were made to consider the role of wages, as stronger wage growth, where justified by fundamentals, could make a positive contribution to growth in real disposable income and domestic demand.",
        "With regard to price developments, members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook and risks presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Annual euro area HICP inflation had stood at -0.1% in September 2015, mainly on account of declining energy prices and the recent appreciation of the euro.",
        "Looking ahead, inflation rates were expected to pick up during 2016 and 2017, but the overall outlook had deteriorated somewhat according to a mechanical update of the September 2015 ECB staff projections.",
        "Downside risks to the outlook for inflation were generally considered to have remained high, with concerns expressed that the prolonged period of low inflation could last longer than previously anticipated.",
        "As regards the medium-term outlook for prices, members broadly concurred that euro area inflation continued to be expected to increase towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, albeit at a slower pace than previously anticipated.",
        "In particular, lower energy prices and recent exchange rate developments, if not reversed, suggested a further downward revision to the inflation outlook.",
        "Such a downward revision to the inflation outlook was seen as potentially worrisome, especially when coupled with less robust evidence of a sustained turning point in underlying inflation, as it would imply a further extension of the protracted period of low inflation and a further postponement of the return of inflation to levels in line with the ECB’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "Attention was drawn in that context to the expected short-term profile of inflation, which, after a pick-up around the turn of the year owing to oil price-related base effects, could fall back to relatively low levels in early 2016.",
        "Members therefore emphasised the need to continue analysing the strength and persistence of the factors behind the current period of low inflation and to understand the medium to long-term implications of such low inflation.",
        "First, it was considered important to monitor the implications of headline inflation developments for measures of underlying inflation, such as the HICP excluding food and energy prices.",
        "Concern was expressed that the pass-through of low commodity prices to core inflation had recently appeared to be relatively fast and pronounced.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that robust evidence of second-round effects from energy prices on headline inflation had so far been largely absent.",
        "Second, it was argued that the persistence of low inflation in the euro area was part of a wider phenomenon of low global inflation and that a sustained rise in euro area prices would be difficult to achieve in the absence of a global pick-up in inflation.",
        "The importance of global factors was also visible in measures of inflation expectations, as short-term movements in those measures for the euro area, the United States and the United Kingdom were seen to be highly correlated.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that domestic factors, notably related to demand and economic slack, also played a crucial role in explaining the prolonged period of low inflation.",
        "Third, attention was drawn to structural determinants of low inflation.",
        "In particular, structural changes in technology, consumer behaviour and competition could partly explain low inflation.",
        "However, it was widely remarked that the low inflation environment in the euro area nonetheless largely reflected demand-side factors in the context of protracted weak growth and high unemployment.",
        "Fourth, the outlook for price stability could still usefully be assessed on the basis of the future path of economic activity and the output gap, as well as the relationship between activity and prices, as measured by the Phillips curve.",
        "As on previous occasions, members underlined that measures of the output gap were surrounded by significant uncertainty.",
        "Concern was expressed that labour market slack could be higher than estimated, especially if involuntary part-time work, and discouraged workers more generally, were taken into account.",
        "Reference was also made to academic research suggesting that the slope of the Phillips curve may have steepened in recent years, implying that a significant degree of slack in the economy would correspond, ceteris paribus, to lower levels of inflation.",
        "Fifth, it was seen as important to continue monitoring closely the impact of the protracted period of low inflation on inflation expectations.",
        "It was noted that survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained unchanged at 1.9%, according to the latest SPF, and that market-based measures of inflation expectations had broadly stabilised since late August.",
        "Some comfort was drawn from these recent developments, as they suggested that the recent weakness in headline and core inflation had not had a negative impact on expectations.",
        "However, concern was also expressed that market-based measures of inflation expectations remained low, had not shown an upward trend over recent weeks and indicated that inflation was expected to reach 1.9% as late as 2025.",
        "In assessing the risks to the outlook for inflation, members noted that downside risks remained prevalent and had possibly increased.",
        "These risks stemmed mainly from uncertainties regarding the economic outlook and the persistence of the output gap in the euro area, as well as from global oil and commodity price developments.",
        "As regards the latter, it was highlighted that recent oil and commodity price declines also reflected demand-driven factors and could not be expected to be reversed quickly.",
        "In addition, concerns were voiced that the current prolonged period of low inflation was in itself a source of downside risk, as it could contribute to an unanchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "Reference was also made to a potential deflationary scenario, which could not be fully excluded as a tail risk.",
        "Nevertheless, it was highlighted that the likelihood of deflation had decreased since the start of the year, according to market-based measures.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction that recent data had confirmed solid growth in M3, notwithstanding a decline in the annual growth rate in August.",
        "Loan dynamics had continued to improve, pursuing the gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014.",
        "The bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2015 had confirmed an increase in demand for bank loans and a further easing of credit standards on loans to enterprises, while those on loans to households for house purchase had tightened somewhat.",
        "These developments in money and credit growth, albeit with bank lending remaining at relatively low levels, were widely seen as positive signs for a continuation of the recovery path, reflecting significant monetary accommodation and the gradual pass-through of the ECB’s broad set of measures, with financial fragmentation in the distribution of credit and credit conditions receding.",
        "As confirmed by the bank lending survey, favourable funding conditions and increased competition between banks were supporting an easing of lending conditions and credit standards.",
        "Together with the reported improvement in credit demand, this should underpin credit expansion in the euro area in the period ahead, also considering that there was still significant monetary accommodation to feed through to the economy from the ECB’s asset purchases as well as the three TLTROs yet to come.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that heterogeneity remained an issue, with money and credit growth still well into negative territory in countries that had been most affected by the financial crisis, in contrast to relatively robust growth elsewhere.",
        "Some caution was also expressed about the risk of possible pressure for further deleveraging by euro area banks.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The information that had become available since the Governing Council’s meeting in early September broadly confirmed the ongoing recovery.",
        "It also pointed to continued weak price pressures and suggested that the expected timing of a sustained normalisation of inflation could be pushed back further, which called for a thorough analysis of the factors that were currently slowing the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "It was recalled that, at its previous monetary policy meeting, the Governing Council had felt that it was premature to conclude whether adverse external developments and increased downside risks would have a transitory or lasting impact on the euro area price outlook and on a sustainable adjustment towards a path in line with the ECB’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "On the basis of the economic and monetary analyses of incoming data, a range of arguments were offered as to whether it could already be concluded that there was a material change in the outlook that warranted a policy response or if further evidence and analysis were needed, particularly in the context of the December Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Against this background, members voiced concern about the prospect of a further deterioration in the price outlook, including at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, with risks clearly on the downside.",
        "Attention was drawn, in particular, to the loss of momentum in the turnaround of various indicators of underlying inflation, with inflation excluding food and energy appearing to be stuck at below or around 1%.",
        "There had also been a repeated undershooting of inflation relative to projections by ECB/Eurosystem staff and by other public and private forecasters.",
        "It was emphasised that, while the ECB’s asset purchase programmes and lending operations were working as intended in expanding liquidity, supporting favourable financing conditions and ultimately reaching output and prices, there had been a number of countervailing developments in external conditions.",
        "These included persistently low oil prices, weaknesses in emerging economies and the postponement of the expected adjustment in policy rates in the United States.",
        "Taken together, the impact of external factors and heightened uncertainty raised the possibility that the ECB’s measures, despite their magnitude, might not be gaining sufficient traction in the present environment to achieve their ultimate objective in terms of inflation rates, also in view of low price pressures globally.",
        "Attention was drawn in this context to the very slow recovery of euro area output in the wake of the financial and sovereign debt crisis.",
        "It was argued that, in such an environment, the risk of deflation remained relevant.",
        "Against this background, the view was put forward that a case could be made for considering reinforcing the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy stance already at the current meeting and, in any case, to act sooner rather than later.",
        "At the same time, members expressed caution about adopting an unduly gloomy interpretation of recent data and reaching premature conclusions with respect to policy implications.",
        "Recent data had been mixed overall, with some positive signs, and comfort could be drawn from the resilience of the domestic economy notwithstanding a weaker external environment.",
        "This suggested that the environment had not changed materially since the previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "It was therefore seen as preferable to wait until December to reassess whether there had been a sufficient change in the factors underlying the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "The renewed deterioration in inflation data had been largely due to commodity prices and external factors, as well as possibly to structural changes, outside the domain of monetary policy, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored.",
        "Moreover, there appeared to be no indications of a risk of deflation, in the sense of a self-reinforcing, expectations-driven, broad-based decrease in the price level.",
        "With regard to monetary and financial conditions, members generally concurred with Mr Praet that these had remained broadly unchanged from the Governing Council’s early September meeting, while they had tightened relative to the technical assumptions embedded in the September 2015 staff projections.",
        "This tightening mainly reflected an appreciation of the euro, which had reversed about half of the earlier depreciation, seen until the spring of 2015, associated with the announcement of the expanded APP.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that looking at a broader range of indicators gave a more benign picture.",
        "In particular, interest rate indicators continued to signal an accommodative monetary policy stance, and developments in bank lending were consistent with a continued recovery in loans to the non-financial private sector.",
        "At the same time, crisis-related fragmentation, spreads and risk premia had been receding.",
        "It was therefore maintained that one could not unambiguously conclude that the monetary policy stance had tightened.",
        "With respect to the effectiveness of the measures taken by the Governing Council in 2014 and 2015, members generally concurred that they had had a favourable impact on financial conditions and were gradually working their way through to the real economy, with effects at the early stages of the transmission mechanism clearly visible, for example, in measures of liquidity, short-term interest rates, bank lending rates and easing credit conditions, as well as with respect to reducing fragmentation in credit distribution and conditions.",
        "Moreover, it was highlighted that much of the accommodation from the ECB’s measures was still in the pipeline.",
        "The presence of long and variable lags in monetary transmission was seen to argue in favour of patience before considering changes to the APP, which was still only eight months into its expected 19-month lifespan.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that, while monetary policy had been effective in achieving intermediate targets, such as improving financial conditions, turning around the credit cycle and reducing financial fragmentation, it had so far not been able to deliver a noticeable impact on its final target, i.e.",
        "moving inflation decisively to a higher path.",
        "This posed a challenge to the Governing Council in formulating the most appropriate stance for the euro area’s monetary policy.",
        "One possible implication was that it might be necessary to acknowledge the longer time horizon over which monetary policy could be expected to deliver on its ultimate objective in the current environment, which did not necessarily speak in favour of additional measures at the current juncture.",
        "Another reflection pointed to the need for more forceful action or for considering a broader set of tools to ensure adequate transmission to the real economy and to underpin a firm anchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "This suggested that the full menu of available monetary policy instruments should be examined in depth.",
        "At the same time, it was urgently felt that the crucial role played by other policy areas needed to be underlined, so as to avoid overburdening monetary policy and to ensure that other policy areas contributed to a more satisfactory economic outcome in the euro area.",
        "The low interest rate environment was seen as providing an opportunity for governments to proceed decisively with necessary structural reforms.",
        "However, disappointment was expressed about the insufficient speed of structural reforms that had been observed and the lack of supportive action in the fiscal domain, including a lack of momentum behind the Juncker plan.",
        "A number of preliminary remarks were made on possible options for providing further monetary accommodation, should this become necessary.",
        "With regard to adjusting the size, composition or duration of the APP, it was underlined that the present communication already catered for the possibility of extending the programme beyond September 2016, depending on progress in achieving a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation towards the medium-term objective.",
        "Adjusting the overall size and range of eligible assets was seen as requiring further analysis by ECB staff and the relevant committees.",
        "Other options might also be examined.",
        "Preliminary views were also expressed on the option of further lowering policy rates, in particular the rate on the deposit facility.",
        "Reference was made to the experience in other jurisdictions, where negative rates had not appeared to result in major difficulties or widespread substitution into cash.",
        "However, it was also argued that a rate cut would venture further into uncharted territory and have repercussions on the functioning of markets and the behaviour of banks and customers.",
        "For this reason, further technical staff and committee work was seen as necessary to assess the benefits and costs, particularly regarding the impact on money markets and on banks’ margins and lending capacity.",
        "Against this background, it was therefore seen as necessary to step up communication and underscore the Governing Council’s determination and readiness to act as soon as warranted by new information and a new assessment, with the December Eurosystem staff projections allowing for an in-depth reflection on the monetary policy stance.",
        "This would confirm the ECB’s reaction function in the light of evolving data and would also serve to counter possible misconceptions that the ECB might tolerate a persistent undershooting of its objective or not have sufficient tools to be employed effectively.",
        "At the same time, a need was seen to communicate a full reassessment of the situation and a comprehensive review of policy options in December, while not creating undue expectations or being perceived as pre-committing to a certain course of action.",
        "Taking into account the views expressed by the Governing Council, the President concluded that the degree of monetary policy accommodation would need to be re-examined at the December monetary policy meeting.",
        "Accordingly, ECB staff and the relevant Eurosystem committees would be mandated to conduct a technical analysis of the monetary policy stimulus achieved, review the options available should the Governing Council judge that further monetary accommodation was necessary, and analyse them in terms of efficacy.",
        "It was underlined that the Governing Council was willing and able to act, if warranted, by using all available tools within its mandate, including by adjusting the size, composition and duration of the APP.",
        "It was recalled that the monthly asset purchases of €60 billion would be fully implemented until the end of September 2016, or beyond, if necessary, and, in any case, until a sustained adjustment was visible in the path of inflation that was consistent with the Governing Council’s aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "On a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.20% respectively.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed recent financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 14-15 April 2015, the implementation of the ECB’s expanded asset purchase programme (APP) had continued smoothly in a market environment characterised by rising euro area government bond yields and bouts of volatility, with the higher levels of excess liquidity putting downward pressure on euro money market rates.",
        "The increased volatility and pick-up in bond yields had had some spillover effects on other global bond markets.",
        "Regarding developments in the euro area bond markets, the period since the April monetary policy meeting had been characterised by a rise in yields, led by German government bonds.",
        "Since December 2013, when the German ten-year government bond yielded 2%, yields had been on a virtually uninterrupted downward trend.",
        "On 17 April 2015 they had reached 0.05%, their lowest ever intraday level.",
        "At the end of April and in the first half of May, the German ten-year government bond yield had, however, risen substantially, touching intraday highs close to 0.78% on 7 and 14 May.",
        "Yield changes had been most pronounced in long-term maturities, leading to a significant steepening of the German yield curve.",
        "Since those moves, the German ten-year bond yield had declined somewhat and on 1 June had closed at 0.54%.",
        "The yields on other euro area government bonds had also been under upward pressure.",
        "During the first two weeks of the bond sell-off, yields had generally increased by less than those on German government bonds, but yield spreads had widened during the second half of May.",
        "Among the different explanations put forward by market analysts for the bond market moves since the monetary policy meeting on 14-15 April, three seemed to have played a key role.",
        "First, several indicators of euro area economic activity and sentiment released in the second half of April had increased, thereby supporting expectations that the economy was gradually picking up.",
        "Second, the recovery in euro area inflation expectations and inflation data had also started to attract analysts’ attention, including the HICP release on 2 June, which was associated with sizeable market moves.",
        "That said, a change in fundamentals could not explain such an abrupt correction in yields.",
        "Accordingly, third, technical factors in the markets were also likely to have contributed.",
        "Gross bond issuance by euro area governments in May had been high, with hardly any redemptions.",
        "Furthermore, many investors’ positioning had reportedly been one-directional, owing to the conviction that yields would remain at the prevailing levels or would even decline further.",
        "Once the markets had started to turn around, the unwinding of investors’ positions had been very quick and pronounced.",
        "In this environment, volatility had increased substantially over the period between the end of April and the end of May.",
        "Inter alia, market analysts had pointed to relatively poor market liquidity conditions as significantly exacerbating the rise in bond yields, which had been linked to the general positioning of the market and to the absence of some traditionally active investors.",
        "Turning to the implementation of the APP, Eurosystem securities holdings had increased by €60.3 billion in April and by €63.1 billion in May.",
        "The recent significant increase in yields had had a positive impact on the implementation of the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) and on market liquidity for covered bonds.",
        "Covered bond purchases under the CBPP3 had amounted to €34 billion over a three-month period to the end of May, taking the cumulative book value of CBPP3 holdings to €85.1 billion, with the share of primary market purchases standing at 18%.",
        "The recent sell-off in the euro area fixed income market had temporarily facilitated the implementation of the CBPP3, with some investors selling more covered bonds under the CBPP3 when they became less attractive than sovereign bonds on a relative value basis.",
        "Moving to the ABS purchase programme, purchases of asset-backed securities had amounted to €1.2 billion in April and €1.4 billion in May.",
        "In May, ABS primary market issuance had been somewhat stronger.",
        "Cumulative purchases under the programme had increased to €7.2 billion by the end of May, having been largely concentrated in the secondary market.",
        "Looking ahead, expanding the size of the Eurosystem balance sheet toward levels observed at the beginning of 2012, which had been the stated objective of the purchase programmes and the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), appeared to be within reach.",
        "With respect to liquidity developments in the banking system, excess liquidity had doubled since the start of the PSPP purchases.",
        "The higher excess liquidity had continued to exert downward pressure on short-term euro money market rates, as evidenced by several new all-time lows in various market segments, illustrating a stronger pass-through of the accommodative monetary policy stance into money market rates.",
        "Having begun in the wholesale markets, negative rates were now spreading to the retail markets through the EURIBOR, which did not seem to be creating major disruptions in contracts.",
        "However, the further narrowing of the spread between the overnight money market rate and the rate on the deposit facility was becoming a disincentive for banks to lend into the market as opposed to them depositing excess cash at the central bank with potentially an adverse impact on market functioning.",
        "Money market forward rates had increased, as the bond market sell-off had also put pressure on money market rates in longer maturities at the beginning of May.",
        "Since then, this upward trend had come to a halt and, over the last two weeks of May, forward rates had partly reversed their earlier sharp increases.",
        "Finally, with regard to developments in international markets, the elevated volatility and the significant increase in euro area government bond yields had had some spillover effects on other global bond markets.",
        "US Treasury yields and, to a lesser extent, Japanese government bond yields had risen sharply since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting, while US and Japanese yield curves had steepened.",
        "In the context of stronger economic and inflation data in the euro area, the euro had appreciated against other major currencies over the period.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Global growth momentum had softened in the first quarter of 2015, with the recovery remaining uneven across regions.",
        "Global trade had also lost momentum in the first quarter.",
        "Annual OECD CPI inflation had declined to 0.4% in April 2015, from 0.6% in March.",
        "Excluding food and energy, it had decreased slightly to 1.6%.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 14-15 April 2015, Brent crude oil prices had risen by 12% to stand at USD 63 per barrel on 1 June (8% higher in euro terms) and thus almost 40% higher than in mid-January 2015 (almost 50% higher in euro terms).",
        "Non-oil commodity prices had also slightly increased since mid-April.",
        "Over the same period, the euro had appreciated by 3.6% against the US dollar and by 2.8% in nominal effective terms.",
        "For the euro area, real GDP had risen by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2015.",
        "Although no breakdown was available as yet, data suggested that both the industrial and services sectors had made positive contributions to real GDP growth.",
        "In addition, short-term indicators and country-specific information pointed to strong private consumption and, to a lesser extent, a pick-up in investment growth.",
        "Looking ahead, survey data for the second quarter pointed to continued moderate real GDP growth.",
        "Both the composite output PMI and the European Commission’s economic sentiment indicator had improved between the first quarter of 2015 and the first two months of the second quarter.",
        "In addition, both indicators had stood, on average in April and May, above their respective long-term averages.",
        "Consumption was expected to remain the main driver of the recovery in the euro area, with the past fall in oil prices supporting households’ purchasing power.",
        "A recovery in investment could also be expected in view of improving financing conditions and lower energy prices easing firms’ costs in the short term.",
        "However, profits – as measured by the net operating surplus as a share of value added – had still been on the decline and there was a risk that they would remain weak, notwithstanding a cyclical pick-up in domestic and external demand.",
        "The improvement in euro area labour markets had continued, albeit proceeding relatively slowly.",
        "Employment had risen further by 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the last quarter of 2014, while the unemployment rate had declined by 0.2 percentage point, to 11.3%, in the first quarter of 2015 and stood at 11.1% in April.",
        "Survey data pointed to continued moderate, possibly accelerating, employment growth in the first and second quarters of 2015.",
        "While output had grown in recent quarters and the unemployment rate had declined from its peak in 2013, there was still considerable slack in the euro area economy.",
        "According to available estimates, the negative output gap was currently nearly as large as in 2009.",
        "Although the output gap was expected to close and potential growth to pick up in the coming years, the loss in actual and potential output owing to the crisis and to structural impediments to growth was likely to remain substantial in the medium term.",
        "Against this background, the June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area saw real GDP increasing by 1.5% in 2015, 1.9% in 2016 and 2.0% in 2017.",
        "This was virtually unchanged from the March 2015 ECB staff projections.",
        "Turning to price developments in the euro area, headline inflation had continued on an upward path and underlying inflation had moved off a historical low.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation had increased to 0.3% in May 2015 from 0.0% in April, turning positive for the first time since November 2014.",
        "HICP inflation excluding food and energy had also increased, from 0.6% in April to 0.9% in May.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to continue to hover around low levels until later in 2015, when it was seen as increasing on account of base effects due to earlier developments in oil prices.",
        "In 2016 and 2017 inflation was expected to rise further, owing to a gradual decline in economic slack and positive external price pressures, reflecting the lagged effect of the exchange rate and the upward sloping oil price futures curve.",
        "Broadly consistent with this picture, PMI survey data on output and input prices had generally pointed to increases in May 2015, while further upward price pressures along the pricing chain, such as producer prices, were likely to be imminent.",
        "Also in the retail sector, selling price expectations had been recovering and were now higher in most large euro area economies.",
        "The June Eurosystem staff projections saw annual HICP inflation at 0.3% in 2015, 1.5% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017.",
        "Compared with the March ECB staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised upwards for 2015 and remained unchanged for 2016 and 2017.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, market-based measures had broadly stabilised at higher levels, albeit displaying some volatility.",
        "For instance, the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead stood at 1.8% in early June 2015.",
        "Shorter-term market-based measures, such as forward inflation-linked swap rates with maturities of up to five years, remained broadly unchanged overall since the April monetary policy meeting.",
        "Moving on to monetary and financial conditions, the EONIA forward curve had steepened since mid-April, notably at medium to longer horizons.",
        "Sovereign bond yield spreads had increased somewhat between April and May, while corporate spreads had broadly stabilised.",
        "Against the background of sharp increases in longer-term nominal yields in the euro area, real rates had likewise increased amid broadly stable inflation expectations.",
        "Nonetheless, financing conditions for corporates and households had, overall, improved somewhat further.",
        "Regarding money and credit, the recovery in broad money growth and loan dynamics had continued, although only gradually in the case of the latter.",
        "The annual growth rate of M3 had increased to 5.3% in April from 4.6% in March.",
        "This increase had been mostly driven by the narrow monetary aggregate M1, up to 10.5% in April from 10.0% in March, reflecting the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid components of money.",
        "The annual growth rate of MFI loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) had remained unchanged at 0.8% in April 2015.",
        "The annual rate of change in MFI loans to non-financial corporations had stood at -0.1%, slightly improved from March and notably up from the trough (-3.2%) recorded in February 2014.",
        "The annual growth rate of MFI loans to households had been 1.3% in April 2015, up from 1.1% in March.",
        "Banks’ funding costs had continued to fall significantly in the first quarter, partly related to the expanded APP.",
        "In addition, the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism was contributing to a defragmentation of financial markets.",
        "At the same time, non-performing loans remained a factor constraining credit expansion in some countries.",
        "The latest half-yearly “Survey on the access to finance of enterprises in the euro area” (SAFE), which had been conducted between 16 March and 25 April 2015 and reported mainly on changes with respect to the period from October 2014 to March 2015, highlighted that, for the first time since 2009, SMEs signalled an overall improvement in the availability of external sources of finance and in the willingness of banks to lend.",
        "This was also reflected in the more favourable terms and conditions applied by banks when granting new loans.",
        "Amid some signs of improvements in the financial situation of SMEs, the general economic outlook had also had a smaller negative impact on their financing conditions in comparison with the previous survey round.",
        "As regards fiscal policies, the June Eurosystem staff projections had seen the fiscal stance for the euro area, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, to be broadly neutral over the projection horizon.",
        "The aggregate euro area government deficit-to-GDP ratio was projected to improve from 2.4% in 2014 to 1.5% in 2017, mainly on account of the cyclical recovery and low interest payments.",
        "The aggregate euro area government debt-to-GDP ratio had peaked at 92% in 2014 and was projected to decline gradually to 88.4% by 2017.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet noted that the latest data confirmed that the euro area economy was growing at a moderate pace and that, looking ahead, the economic recovery was expected to broaden in line with what had already been expected in the March 2015 ECB staff projections.",
        "On the nominal side, euro area HICP inflation had continued on its upward path and inflation expectations remained broadly unchanged.",
        "Cross-checking the results of the economic analysis with evidence from the monetary analysis, money and credit dynamics had strengthened further in a context of favourable financial conditions and remained consistent with the outlook of a slowly improving environment for euro area economic growth and inflation.",
        "At present it was judged that recent strong fluctuations in financial market prices had not materially altered this picture, while close monitoring and continuous assessment were warranted from a monetary policy perspective.",
        "Furthermore, while a case could be made for prudent optimism, the outlook for euro area growth and inflation remained conditional on the full implementation of all the monetary policy measures in place.",
        "Moreover, the economic recovery still faced headwinds related to the necessary balance sheet adjustments in various sectors of the economy and insufficient structural reforms to improve the business environment and investment activity.",
        "Risks to the economic recovery therefore remained on the downside – although more balanced on account of the January monetary policy decisions and oil price and exchange rate developments.",
        "Against this background, the Governing Council needed to continue to monitor closely the outlook for price developments over the medium term and also ensure that the degree of monetary accommodation throughout the euro area remained appropriate.",
        "With regard to key monetary policy issues for the present meeting, Mr Praet deemed that the information available since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 14-15 April did not give grounds to reconsider the monetary policy stance or any of the APP parameters.",
        "Accordingly, it was warranted to maintain a steady monetary policy course and to signal the Governing Council’s commitment to the firm implementation of the previously announced measures.",
        "To this end, the Governing Council needed to reconfirm the monthly APP purchase volume of €60 billion and that purchases were intended to be carried out until the end of September 2016 – and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that was consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "In addition, Mr Praet raised the need for the Governing Council to assess recent strong fluctuations in financial market prices from a monetary policy perspective.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, the members of the Governing Council generally shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The latest economic data, including survey evidence available up to May 2015, were seen to be consistent with a continuation of the moderate growth trend in the second quarter of the year.",
        "Overall, the euro area recovery appeared to be proceeding in line with earlier expectations.",
        "Looking ahead, the economic recovery was expected to broaden, supported by the improvement in financial conditions, the past decline in oil prices and depreciation of the euro.",
        "At the same time, there were still a number of factors dampening growth, including the necessary balance sheet adjustments in some sectors and the sluggish pace of structural reforms.",
        "This assessment was broadly reflected in the June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, which had not seen any major revisions, and could be viewed as confirmation of the outlook for growth that had been embedded in the March 2015 ECB staff projections.",
        "As in the previous exercise, the June 2015 macroeconomic projections were predicated on the full implementation of the monetary policy measures in place.",
        "A number of remarks were made regarding both the outlook and the risks for the international environment.",
        "While global growth was expected to increase gradually, growth in global trade had experienced a slowdown at the start of the year and there had been some weakening in the global recovery.",
        "Geopolitical uncertainties continued to prevail.",
        "There was therefore a downside risk to trade, which in the case of the euro area had, to some extent, been compensated for by past movements in the exchange rate.",
        "At the same time, it was suggested that the external environment might be weak for some time, while the positive effects of the lower exchange rate on euro area growth would gradually dissipate.",
        "Members were in general agreement that the recovery was broadly on track to unfold as expected.",
        "Available evidence pointed to ongoing growth of around 0.4% quarter on quarter, which was consistent with the June staff projections.",
        "Although a number of surveys had recently provided indications of a stabilisation or of a plateau being reached, it was recalled that survey results needed to be interpreted with caution.",
        "Some observations were made regarding the latest country-specific developments.",
        "The overall conclusion was that recent developments in the largest euro area countries seemed to support the assessment of continued moderate growth.",
        "There was broad agreement about the important role of investment and a resumption of risk-taking in the real economy for a sustained recovery, as well as about the connection between a pick-up in investment and an improvement in profit margins.",
        "While it was recognised that cyclical developments pointed to an upturn in profits, it was possible that downward pressures on profits might continue, notably owing to the impact of globalisation.",
        "On a future occasion, it would be worthwhile for the members of the Governing Council to discuss in more detail what was driving profit developments, including evidence on the pricing power of euro area firms in domestic and foreign markets.",
        "Looking at country-specific developments, the composition of growth in the first quarter of the year highlighted some positive indications for investment growth across countries.",
        "Despite these positive signs, there was still a high degree of uncertainty about the investment outlook across the euro area.",
        "Members also referred to developments in potential growth and the degree of slack in the economy.",
        "In this context, it was underlined that, even if the output gap was closing over the projection horizon, output growth in the euro area was developing below its pre-crisis long-term trend, owing in part to past low investment.",
        "The euro area was thus experiencing a cyclical, rather than a structural, recovery.",
        "At the same time, the well-known uncertainty surrounding estimates of the output gap was recalled, which supported a cautious interpretation of the output gap.",
        "This caution was also seen to be applicable to estimates of the structural level of unemployment.",
        "The outlook for economic activity was seen as being dependent on the implementation of structural reforms and sound public finances.",
        "For the full benefits of the monetary policy measures to be reaped, other policy areas needed to contribute decisively.",
        "There was no room for complacency.",
        "Important challenges, including low potential growth and high structural unemployment in certain parts of the euro area, remained to be addressed.",
        "It was equally important to monitor productivity developments closely, as they were a key determinant of potential growth and therefore also of the size of the output gap.",
        "A number of remarks were made about fiscal developments.",
        "On the one hand, it was noted that one of the key features of the current projections, and one of the factors supporting growth, was the broadly neutral fiscal stance from 2014 onwards, after the more restrictive fiscal stance in previous years.",
        "The point was made that, even if the fiscal stance for the euro area was neutral overall, from a macroeconomic perspective different policy advice was warranted for different countries.",
        "While some countries still needed further fiscal consolidation, one should caution against making a uniform plea for more fiscal tightening.",
        "At the same time, the comment was made that the Stability and Growth Pact seemed to be, once more, incorrectly perceived to be about reaching the 3% government deficit ratio, rather than about aiming for a structural government budget balance close to zero in the medium term.",
        "In this context, it was important to learn from the mistakes of the past.",
        "Overall, members noted that the recovery in the euro area economy was proceeding in line with the Governing Council’s earlier expectations.",
        "While they remained on the downside, the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area had become more balanced on account of earlier monetary policy decisions and oil price and exchange rate developments.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Reference was made to Eurostat’s flash estimate, according to which euro area annual HICP inflation had risen to 0.3% in May 2015, the first positive rate since late 2014, reflecting higher annual growth rates for all main components of the HICP.",
        "While the outcome in May was slightly above market expectations, it was in line with the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "However, the annual rate of HICP inflation excluding food and energy, which increased to 0.9% in May from 0.6% in April, was slightly higher than expected.",
        "While it was important to remain cautious, as these data related to only one month, it was nevertheless considered to be a positive development.",
        "Inflation seemed to have bottomed out at the beginning of the year.",
        "While expected to remain low over the months ahead, inflation rates were seen to rise visibly towards the end of the year and to pick up further in 2016 and 2017.",
        "This assessment was also broadly reflected in the June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "The pick-up in inflation was expected to be supported by the gradual closing of the output gap, the impact of the lower exchange rate of the euro and the assumed path of oil prices according to oil futures markets.",
        "Accordingly, the inflation profile for 2015-16 also reflected base effects on account of the sharp fall in oil prices in late 2014.",
        "A number of other positive indications were also highlighted, including the recovery of inflation expectations from their troughs in early 2015 and the absence of significant deflation risks.",
        "Members took note of these developments, in particular of the confirmation of the inflation outlook provided by the projections.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that the role of external factors in this turnaround appeared to be significant.",
        "It would therefore be very important to monitor carefully domestic inflation indicators in order to assess whether a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation had been achieved.",
        "It was underlined that the degree of forecast uncertainty tended to increase with the length of the projection horizon, and it remained to be seen whether inflation would increase as strongly as projected by staff.",
        "In particular, the size of the output gap and the speed at which it closed would have important implications for the inflation rate in 2017.",
        "Two issues were noted in this context.",
        "First, while it had to be recognised that there was substantial measurement uncertainty, the output gap in the June Eurosystem staff projections was assessed to close somewhat faster than the estimates of some international institutions.",
        "Second, since 2010, core inflation in the euro area had been around 1¼%, with movements in headline inflation being driven primarily by developments in the non-core components of the HICP.",
        "The Governing Council should therefore not draw conclusions prematurely, in particular as regards the price outlook for 2017, but rather continue its close monitoring and assessment of underlying price trends.",
        "The inflation outlook embedded in the staff projections was also seen to be based on a fairly strong pass-through of the past depreciation of the exchange rate and to depend on a future upward path of oil prices.",
        "As regards the former, different views were expressed by members.",
        "It was pointed out that, over the past 10-15 years, the pass-through of the exchange rate had been slower following large movements.",
        "The pass-through had also been slow so far for the euro area.",
        "A pricing-to-market strategy on the part of euro area exporters, which implied higher euro prices following the depreciation of the euro, represented a low pass-through to importing countries.",
        "At the same time, it could be argued that this was not that surprising, as exporting firms needed to see where the exchange rate would stabilise.",
        "It would take some time for foreign prices to adjust.",
        "In the meantime, margins were improving and the potential for having more competitive products on markets abroad was a positive indicator for the future.",
        "Many euro area countries would, over time, benefit through their exports of goods and services.",
        "All in all, the euro area economy was seen to be moving in the right direction and inflation was also improving.",
        "In their assessment of the risks surrounding the inflation outlook, members referred to the pass-through of the monetary policy measures, as well as geopolitical, exchange rate and energy price developments.",
        "While there was broad agreement on the need to monitor closely the risks to the outlook, the Governing Council saw recent developments as overall confirming its previous assessment and the staff projections.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment that money and credit dynamics had strengthened further, although credit growth had improved only gradually and remained overall subdued.",
        "Recent data had confirmed that growth in broad money (M3) had continued to accelerate, driven by a further pick-up in the narrow monetary aggregate M1.",
        "The robust recovery in the most liquid components of money was seen to reflect a more pronounced preference for liquidity given the low opportunity cost of holding monetary instruments.",
        "As a result, there had been a substitution within MFI liabilities towards short-term instruments included in M3 owing to the low incentives for the money-holding sector to invest in alternative assets, as their returns were not high enough to compensate for the loss of transaction services that money offered.",
        "In addition, the most recent acceleration in broad money growth was starting to reflect the effects of the Eurosystem’s asset purchases from the euro area money-holding sector, in particular via increased holdings of monetary deposits by non-monetary financial intermediaries, especially investment funds.",
        "All in all, caution was still seen to be warranted as regards possible monetary policy interpretations of recent favourable dynamics in money growth.",
        "Loan dynamics, while remaining subdued, had gradually improved further.",
        "Though the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector had remained at 0.8% in April, a positive signal was visible from developments over the previous six months, whereby loans to the private sector on a six-month annualised basis recorded a growth rate of 2%.",
        "These developments had been supported by significant decreases in composite bank lending rates, which had declined by around 60 basis points for euro area non-financial corporations since May 2014, as well as by signs of an improvement in both the supply of, and demand for, bank loans.",
        "In particular, banks showed a greater willingness to lend, as extending credit had become relatively more attractive in the context of a negative rate on the deposit facility, whereby individual banks were seeking ways to avoid the higher cost of keeping deposits with the Eurosystem, although this was not possible for the banking system to achieve in the aggregate.",
        "Overall, also taking into account the pipeline effects from the interest rate cuts in 2013 and 2014, the credit-easing package from the summer of 2014 and the comprehensive assessment of banks’ balance sheets, recent developments confirmed that the ECB’s monetary policy measures were helping to restore the proper functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and were continuing to support a further recovery in credit flows to firms and households.",
        "Complementing earlier positive evidence from the bank lending survey on the general improvements in credit market conditions, the recent survey on enterprises’ access to finance (SAFE) had provided indications that the more favourable credit environment not only applied to large firms but was also trickling down to SMEs.",
        "Despite these improvements, the dynamics of loans to non-financial corporations remained subdued.",
        "This could, in part, be attributed to the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, which was still incomplete, as evidenced by the high level of non-performing loans in some countries where a clear turnaround could not yet be discerned.",
        "At the same time, it was felt that increased recourse to various forms of non-bank sources of financing needed to be taken into account in the assessment alongside the bank lending channel.",
        "In this context, it was noted that an environment of weak credit growth, coupled with attractive financing conditions, also required caution on the part of the relevant authorities with regard to possible financial stability implications, arising in particular from a shift of intermediation activity into the shadow banking sector.",
        "Members generally shared the assessment that the economic recovery was proceeding at a moderate pace in line with earlier expectations, with inflation continuing its upward trajectory and money and credit dynamics strengthening further, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "Members also recalled that the outlook for growth and inflation, as portrayed in the June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, which were virtually unchanged from the March ECB staff projections, was predicated on the full implementation of all the monetary policy measures taken by the Governing Council.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement that cross-checking the assessment of economic and monetary developments did not give reason to reconsider the current monetary policy stance or any of the APP parameters.",
        "This called for maintaining a steady monetary policy course, firmly implementing the Governing Council’s monetary policy measures.",
        "Regarding the need to assess the recent sharp fluctuations in financial market prices from a monetary policy perspective, as suggested by Mr Praet in his introduction, there was broad agreement that the recent partial reversal of previous strong increases in financial market prices was of a multifaceted nature and was likely to be related to the three factors mentioned by Mr Cœuré, namely a reappraisal of the economic outlook by market participants, the observed recovery in inflation expectations since early 2015 and a number of technical market factors.",
        "Recent financial market developments had been dominated by sharp movements in government bonds, accompanied by a fall in equities and a stronger euro, which, however, on balance, were not assessed to have materially altered the economic outlook for the euro area.",
        "On this basis, it was widely felt that it was advisable for the Governing Council to look through recent financial market volatility.",
        "As stated on previous occasions, if there were factors that led to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy, or if the outlook for growth and inflation were to materially change, the features of the monetary policy programmes in place would have to be reviewed.",
        "There was, however, no reason to do so now.",
        "As regards the factors behind volatility in financial market prices, to the extent that the rise in longer-term real interest rates and the re-appreciation of the euro were related to expectations of an improved macroeconomic outlook, this was to be seen as a confirmation of the current monetary policy stance.",
        "To the extent that the recent reversal was a correction driven mainly by technical factors, volatility could subside again as markets adjusted to the new market environment, characterised by the injection of cash associated with the Eurosystem’s asset purchases and the implications for the pricing of sovereign bonds.",
        "However, there were also reasons to expect that increased volatility would persist in an environment of low interest rates in which asset prices tended to be more volatile, as also borne out by the experience in other jurisdictions.",
        "Prevailing geopolitical risks and continued uncertainty about the outcome of negotiations between one euro area government and its official creditors were also seen as likely sources of market uncertainty and volatility.",
        "Notwithstanding the recent volatility in the financial markets, the ECB’s monetary policy measures were seen to be working in the right direction.",
        "Asset purchases were proceeding well and positive effects were visible.",
        "Taking a somewhat longer-term perspective, the monetary policy measures introduced since the summer of 2014 had contributed to a broad-based easing in financial conditions, which remained very accommodative in spite of the recent reversal in financial market prices.",
        "In particular, short-term money market rates remained at historically low levels and in line with the Governing Council’s forward guidance on the key policy interest rates and the ongoing expansion of the Eurosystem balance sheet.",
        "Moreover, financing conditions for banks, firms and households had improved considerably, the euro exchange rate had weakened and inflation expectations had recovered.",
        "There was, hence, broad agreement among members that the monetary accommodation provided by all the ECB’s monetary policy measures was bearing fruit, with the effects of these policy measures gradually working their way through to the economy, thereby contributing to the recovery, the pick up in inflation and improvements in money and credit growth.",
        "The view was widely shared that it was, nonetheless, too early to declare them a success.",
        "The purchases under the ECB’s expanded APP were only into their third month.",
        "Moreover, the economic recovery remained moderate and it still faced headwinds and remained subject to risks and vulnerabilities.",
        "Against this background, members widely agreed that it was essential to maintain a steady course of monetary policy, looking through short-term economic and financial market developments to the extent that they were temporary and would not have a materially adverse impact on the transmission of monetary policy and, ultimately, on the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "This included leaving the key ECB interest rates unchanged in line with the Governing Council’s forward guidance and firmly implementing the non-standard monetary policy measures adopted.",
        "Overall, taking into account the views expressed, the President concluded that the Governing Council was unanimous in its assessment that it should look through recent volatility in financial markets and maintain a steady monetary policy course.",
        "The Governing Council also reaffirmed its intention to carry out asset purchases of €60 billion per month until the end of September 2016 and, in any case, until a sustained adjustment was visible in the path of inflation, consistent with the Governing Council’s aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "When carrying out its assessment, the Governing Council would follow its monetary policy strategy and concentrate on trends in inflation.",
        "As stated on previous occasions, the design of the APP provided sufficient flexibility for it to be adapted if circumstances were to change and should the need arise.",
        "With regard to interest rates, taking into account the foregoing and on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.20% respectively.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed recent financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s meeting in early December 2014, there had been a number of developments that had contributed to elevated market volatility.",
        "A sharp decline in crude oil prices had reinforced market expectations of lower inflation and a more accommodative monetary policy in the euro area.",
        "Overall, sovereign bond yields had continued to decline in most euro area countries and the euro had depreciated against most currencies.",
        "Regarding the global situation, major developments had been observed in the oil market, with the price of Brent crude oil having declined by more than 50% since June 2014.",
        "Market expectations and crude oil option-implied probabilities indicated that oil prices were expected to stay at low levels over the policy-relevant horizon.",
        "In the view of market participants, the factors underlying this decline were very different from those prevailing in 2009, when the market was characterised by shrinking demand, and analysts expected the current conditions of excess supply to be sustained in the near future.",
        "The continued fall in oil prices had had an impact on market-based inflation expectations, which had continued to decline in both the United States and the euro area.",
        "In equity markets, energy companies’ share prices had been decreasing worldwide, but, in general, declines in European markets were less pronounced than those in the United States.",
        "Turning to the euro area, market expectations of a broad-based purchase programme including public sector bonds had continued to intensify since the Governing Council’s meeting in early December 2014.",
        "Based on the lower inflation outlook and recent communication by Governing Council members, market participants expected an announcement to be imminent.",
        "Over the previous week market commentary had increasingly focused on the potential modalities of such a programme.",
        "Reflecting market expectations of further monetary policy accommodation, sovereign bond yields had continued to trend lower, declining to all-time lows in most euro area countries, and sovereign yield curves had continued to flatten across most euro area jurisdictions.",
        "As a result, the yield curves of a number of euro area countries had moved further into negative territory.",
        "Political developments had led to a period of volatility in the Greek sovereign bond market.",
        "Greek government bond yields had increased, particularly at shorter maturities, which had led to an inversion of the Greek sovereign yield curve.",
        "The impact on other euro area sovereign bond markets had been limited.",
        "Against the background of expectations of further monetary policy accommodation in the euro area, the euro had weakened against major currencies, with the exception of the Japanese yen.",
        "Since the early December 2014 meeting, the euro had depreciated by around 6% against the US dollar and had declined to an 11-year low of below USD 1.16, which in part reflected strong growth expectations in the United States.",
        "Many analysts’ forecasts for the USD/EUR exchange rate had been adjusted downwards markedly.",
        "Option market-based indicators also pointed to an asymmetric distribution of market expectations, with a higher probability being assigned to further depreciation of the euro.",
        "The Swiss National Bank’s decision of 15 January 2015 to discontinue the exchange rate floor of CHF 1.20 against the euro and to lower its policy rate target range to between -1.25% and -0.25%, from -0.75% to 0.25%, had led to a strong appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro.",
        "The yields on Swiss government bonds with maturities of up to 13 years had declined into negative territory.",
        "After a two-week pause over the Christmas period the Eurosystem’s covered bond and asset-backed securities (ABS) purchase programmes had resumed on 5 January 2015.",
        "Purchases under the third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3) and the ABS purchase programme (ABSPP) amounted to €33.1 billion and €2.1 billion respectively as at Friday, 16 January 2015.",
        "After a subdued start, activity in the covered bond market had picked up substantially in the third week of January.",
        "In addition to Eurosystem purchases, counterparties had also reported strong participation by private investors in the primary market for covered bonds.",
        "Covered bond swap spreads had been relatively stable recently after tightening markedly following the initial announcement of the CBPP3 and during the first few weeks of purchases under the programme.",
        "In the ABS market, activity at the start of the year had remained more subdued, with market participants continuing to cite the availability of more attractive funding alternatives and the limited scope for capital relief as the main impediments to increased ABS issuance, both for new issues and for bringing retained deals to the market.",
        "Downward pressure on money market rates had intensified recently, as higher levels of excess liquidity had enhanced the impact of the September 2014 rate cut.",
        "The EONIA rate, which had shown some resilience in the last quarter of 2014, had decreased on the back of higher excess liquidity.",
        "In the short-term repo market, overnight general collateral repo rates were trading close to the level of the deposit facility rate.",
        "The three-month EURIBOR had reached a new historical low of 5.5 basis points.",
        "At the same time, market expectations of a more accommodative policy stance had supported a downward move in forward money market rates, with the exception of the expected EONIA rate for the first maintenance period of 2015 which remained relatively high at about -4 basis points and reflected uncertainty about near-term liquidity conditions.",
        "This uncertainty was related primarily to the maturing of the two three-year longer-term refinancing operations on 29 January 2015 and on 26 February 2015, which could lead to a temporary decline in excess liquidity.",
        "However, the ongoing asset purchases and the fixed rate full allotment procedures in place, which allow banks to satisfy their demand for central bank liquidity, were expected to ease this uncertainty.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "The global economy was expected to continue its gradual recovery, although developments were expected to be uneven across regions.",
        "While the latest surveys suggested some softening in the growth momentum in the last quarter of 2014, global activity had been supported by the recent drop in oil prices.",
        "Global trade had improved in the third quarter of 2014, while the global Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for new export orders pointed to some moderation in the last quarter of the year.",
        "Global inflation had remained modest in November 2014, with annual OECD CPI inflation easing to 1.5% and, excluding energy and food, to 1.7%.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had declined to USD 49 per barrel on 20 January 2015 and had more than halved compared with their level in January 2014.",
        "Non-energy commodity prices had declined slightly since early December 2014, mainly owing to metal prices.",
        "Since the early December 2014 meeting of the Governing Council the euro had depreciated by 6% against the US dollar and by 4% in nominal effective terms against 19 trading partners (EER-19).",
        "Half of the euro’s effective depreciation had occurred on 15 January 2015, when the Swiss National Bank abandoned its official exchange rate floor of CHF 1.20 per euro.",
        "Euro area real GDP growth had been confirmed at 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2014, in line with the December 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "Domestic demand had made a positive contribution, particularly on the back of consumption developments supported by an acceleration in households’ gross disposable income growth, while net trade had made a neutral contribution.",
        "The weak growth dynamics in the euro area over recent quarters had mainly reflected weak investment, mirroring continued weak corporate profits, for example as reflected in a further decline in the ratio of net operating surplus to value added, as well as ample spare capacity and concerns about the growth outlook in a context of weakening reform momentum in a number of euro area countries.",
        "Available indicators pointed to modest growth in the fourth quarter of 2014.",
        "In October and November industrial production excluding construction had stood, on average, 0.3% above its level in the third quarter, when production contracted by 0.4% on a quarterly basis.",
        "Similarly, in the same period construction production had stood 0.5% above its outcome in the third quarter, when it too recorded a decline.",
        "Recent developments in retail trade and car registrations were in line with continued positive private consumption growth in the fourth quarter, while production of capital goods pointed to a modest expansion of euro area investment.",
        "Although the euro area composite output PMI and the European Commission’s economic sentiment indicator had declined, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter, their levels were in line with continued moderate growth at the turn of the year.",
        "While output had been growing in recent quarters, and the unemployment rate had declined from its peak in 2013, there was still considerable slack in the economy.",
        "According to available estimates, the output gap was currently estimated to be as large as it was in 2009 and was expected to close only gradually.",
        "As regards labour markets, employment had risen by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2014 and labour productivity per person employed had increased by 0.2% on an annual basis.",
        "However, the euro area unemployment rate had remained broadly unchanged at around 11.5% between June and November 2014.",
        "The PMI for employment expectations pointed to a modest further improvement in labour market conditions in the period ahead.",
        "The December 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections had foreseen annual real GDP increasing by 0.8% in 2014, 1.0% in 2015 and 1.5% in 2016.",
        "Available forecasts from private sector and international institutions were broadly in line with these staff projections.",
        "Turning to prices, inflation in the euro area had remained very low and the outlook was subdued.",
        "According to Eurostat, euro area annual HICP inflation was negative at ‑0.2% in December 2014, after 0.3% in November, mainly reflecting a drop in the annual rate of change of the energy component but also a decline in the food component.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food stood at 0.7% in December, unchanged since October 2014, on account of broadly unchanged annual rates of change in the non-energy industrial goods component and in the services component.",
        "Annual average HICP inflation for 2014 was 0.4%.",
        "Compared with the December 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the December outcome for inflation was lower than expected largely due to developments in the energy component following the recent sharp falls in crude oil prices.",
        "Across HICP components, the share of items recording negative and low rates of inflation had remained elevated.",
        "PMI survey data had confirmed the outlook for subdued price pressures in the months ahead.",
        "European Commission survey data also confirmed continued subdued pressure on selling prices across all the main sectors of the euro area economy.",
        "Selling price expectations had stabilised for the retail and services sectors, while they had continued to decline for the industrial sector.",
        "Producer price developments had been very subdued.",
        "The annual rate of change in industrial producer prices excluding energy and construction had remained unchanged at ‑0.2% in November 2014.",
        "Producer price inflation for non-food consumer goods had declined slightly to 0.2% in November from 0.3% in October, and the annual rate of change in producer prices for consumer food, which had been positive up to June 2014, had dropped slightly to ‑1.2% in November from ‑1.1% in October.",
        "Labour costs had also confirmed continued moderate domestic price pressures.",
        "Annual wage growth, as measured by compensation per employee, had declined to 1.3% in the third quarter of 2014 (according to the new ESA 2010 methodology) from 1.4% in the second quarter, mainly on account of a smaller contribution from the industrial and construction sectors.",
        "However, despite declining growth in compensation per employee, growth in unit labour costs had increased slightly in the third quarter, owing to a slowdown in annual productivity growth.",
        "The December 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections foresaw annual euro area HICP inflation reaching 0.7% in 2015 and 1.3% in 2016.",
        "Since the cut-off date for these projections, several forecasters had revised their inflation outlook for 2015 substantially down, mainly reflecting the recent decline in oil prices.",
        "Looking ahead, the latest available information suggested that annual HICP inflation rates were likely to remain in negative territory for some time.",
        "This reflected mainly the recent decline in oil prices, which was partly offset by the recent depreciation of the euro.",
        "For 2016, the slope of the oil futures curve implied that the downward impact of the decline in oil prices would fade; this together with the impact of the depreciation of the euro would continue to support a gradual increase in inflation rates.",
        "Measures of longer-term inflation expectations based on the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the first quarter of 2015 indicated that the expected five-year-ahead inflation rate was 1.77%, compared with 1.80% in the previous survey.",
        "Market-based measures, such as the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, had declined somewhat further since the early December 2014 meeting of the Governing Council, with shorter-term forward inflation rates being revised downwards more substantially.",
        "As regards monetary and financial conditions, the EONIA forward curve had remained at values close to zero for the past few months at very short maturities, while it had declined further at longer maturities.",
        "The cost of bank borrowing had declined sharply since the summer.",
        "Money and loan growth had recovered recently, while remaining at low levels.",
        "Annual M3 growth had increased further to 3.1% in November 2014, after 2.5% in October.",
        "The pick-up in annual broad money growth from the low of 0.8% in April 2014 was broad based across countries and sectors.",
        "In annualised three-month terms, M3 growth had stood at around 5% since July 2014.",
        "This development reflected strong inflows into overnight deposits from households and non-financial corporations (NFCs) in a low interest rate environment.",
        "Annual M1 growth remained robust and had picked up further in November 2014 to stand at 6.9%, up from 6.2% in October.",
        "Developments in November also reflected stronger investor preference for acquiring euro area assets, as signalled by investor surveys in November.",
        "While loan dynamics remained weak, there was further evidence that a turning point had occurred in the second quarter of 2014.",
        "The annual rate of change in loans originated by monetary financial institutions (MFIs) to NFCs, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, had continued to recover in November 2014, standing at ‑1.3%, up from -1.6% in October and from the trough of -3.2% in February 2014.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans originated by MFIs to households, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, had also continued to increase slightly in November 2014, standing at 0.7%, after 0.6% in October.",
        "Sales of government debt securities by euro area MFIs were observed in November, unlike in October.",
        "According to the January 2015 bank lending survey for the euro area, credit standards for all loan categories had continued to ease in net terms in the fourth quarter of 2014.",
        "This development was mainly driven by an improvement in the cost of funds and in balance sheet conditions, as well as stronger competitive pressures.",
        "Credit standards, however, remained relatively tight in historical terms.",
        "The demand for loans had increased across loan categories, with a rise in firms’ loan demand being largely driven by financing needs for fixed investment.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, the December 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections had foreseen the average euro area fiscal stance, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, to be broadly neutral over the projection horizon.",
        "Summing up, and cross-checking the results of the economic analysis with those of the monetary analysis, the euro area macroeconomic outlook appeared to be starting to stabilise, following a weakening of momentum in the second half of 2014, with a potential for stronger momentum ahead.",
        "At the same time, a moderate increase in M3 growth had been recorded, alongside less negative credit growth.",
        "Notwithstanding, euro area inflation dynamics had weakened further on account of the continued sharp fall in oil prices, implying that the macroeconomic risks from too prolonged a period of low inflation had intensified further and risks of second-round effects had increased.",
        "Against this background Mr Praet recalled the key elements of the December 2014 introductory statement.",
        "Accordingly, the time had now come to reassess the outlook for inflation and to examine whether the monetary stimulus already in the pipeline remained adequate to achieve inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, or whether an expanded asset purchase programme had become necessary to fulfil the ECB’s price stability mandate.",
        "Starting with an assessment of the monetary stimulus achieved, the “price” or “spread” dimension had exceeded initial expectations.",
        "Covered bond and ABS spreads had narrowed substantially since the start of the CBPP3 and the ABSPP.",
        "The targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) had contributed to a further decline in bank lending rates across the euro area, thereby easing borrowing conditions for firms and households.",
        "However, the “quantitative” element of the Governing Council’s measures had clearly fallen short of initial expectations.",
        "The total estimated take-up over all eight TLTRO operations was significantly lower than envisaged in September 2014.",
        "In addition, regarding the evolution of the ABSPP, cumulative purchase volumes had been modest to date, in contrast to sizeable purchases of covered bonds.",
        "Coinciding with this shortfall in quantitative stimulus, a continuous deterioration in the outlook for price stability over the medium term had been observed.",
        "The sharp decline in oil prices was, in itself, a positive factor for the economic outlook, but only if inflation expectations remained well anchored.",
        "In the current environment of very weak price developments, further falls in commodity prices had accelerated a downward trend that had been evident since the start of the sovereign debt crisis and had increased the risk that inflation might stay “too low for too long”.",
        "First , a range of available inflation indicators currently stood at, or close to, their historical lows.",
        "Second, exclusion-based measures of inflation currently also displayed significantly lower resilience to negative headline inflation shocks.",
        "Third, the sharp drop in oil prices had contributed to the further fall in medium to longer-term market-based inflation expectations, thereby signalling increased risks of an unanchoring of those expectations.",
        "Against this background, the risk of second-round effects had increased further and, with it, the risk of too prolonged a period of too low inflation.",
        "This, in turn, raised the possibility of deflationary forces setting in, which would not permit an attitude of “benign neglect”.",
        "Taking everything into account and based on the Governing Council’s regular economic and monetary analyses, Mr Praet suggested that two policy options could be considered.",
        "On the one hand, it could be argued that the evidence available clearly suggested that there was a need to take action at the present meeting to provide further monetary accommodation.",
        "On the other hand, a “wait and see” approach could be preferred, so as to monitor developments further and to wait for more information to become available, for example in the context of the March 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "Due account would also need to be taken of the risks stemming from not acting at the present meeting, which might be higher than the risks stemming from acting.",
        "First, a large part of the very substantial financial price adjustment observed over recent weeks would most likely rapidly unwind if no monetary policy action were taken at the current meeting.",
        "This would effectively amount to an unwarranted tightening in the monetary policy stance.",
        "Second, the policy option of acting at the present meeting would contribute to strengthening the economic recovery, which was currently too weak to support a return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Third, a decision to act forcefully at the current meeting should help to counteract the fall in medium to long-term inflation expectations and encourage a gradual rise of inflation back to levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "If the Governing Council decided to act at the present meeting on providing further monetary policy accommodation, two variants could be considered regarding the focus of an expanded asset purchase programme including sovereign bonds.",
        "One option would be to limit purchases to a subset of the sovereign bond universe, namely bonds from highly rated issuers (those rated at least AA).",
        "A second option would be to allow purchases from a broader universe of government securities, namely securities of investment-grade issuers (rated AAA to BBB) in proportions that would reflect the share of the respective national central bank (NCB) in the ECB’s capital key.",
        "However, on the basis of ECB staff analysis and the work carried out by Eurosystem committees, the first option was considered to be less effective in the current environment.",
        "All in all, the following elements were seen to deliver the monetary impulse necessary to provide material support to economic activity and help to return inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "First, the Governing Council could decide on a pace of combined monthly asset purchases, including ABSPP, CBPP3 and public sector securities purchases, in the order of €50 billion.",
        "Second, it could determine an intended period for asset purchases, which could start in March 2015 with an end-date of, for example, the end of 2016.",
        "Third, these decisions could be combined with the strong message that such purchases would in any case be conducted until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "With regard to the sharing of hypothetical losses under an expanded asset purchase programme, the Governing Council could choose from a continuum of loss-sharing options.",
        "One polar option was full loss sharing and another was no loss sharing for the part of the portfolio held on the balance sheets of NCBs.",
        "Both options involved trade-offs.",
        "Intermediate solutions could, however, also be designed so as to strike an appropriate balance.",
        "In all cases, the singleness of monetary policy was preserved, as reflected in the full control the Governing Council would always maintain over all its monetary policy instruments, including the design features of the expanded asset purchase programme, and with the ECB always coordinating the purchases.",
        "At the same time, taking into account the unique institutional structure of the euro area with a single currency co-existing with 19 national fiscal and economic policies, the Governing Council could decide that, while a given share of ECB purchases would be subject to a regime of risk sharing, the remaining part would not be subject to loss sharing.",
        "Mr Cœuré then introduced the operational details of a possible purchase programme for public sector securities.",
        "As regards the eligibility criteria for such asset purchases, in line with what the Governing Council had decided for the ABSPP and the CBPP3, the securities to be purchased would have to fulfil the collateral eligibility criteria and be denominated in euro.",
        "They would need to be issued by an entity established in the euro area which was either a central government, one of certain agencies, or one of certain supranational institutions.",
        "In terms of rating, the securities would be required to have a first-best rating of at least credit quality step 3 (CQS3), i.e.",
        "If they were guaranteed, the guarantee would have to be eligible in accordance with the ECB’s Guideline ECB/2011/14, as amended.",
        "Securities that did not achieve the CQS3 rating would be eligible as long as the Eurosystem’s minimum credit quality threshold was not applied for the purpose of their collateral eligibility, meaning that the same waiver as for the ECB’s collateral policy and for the ABS and covered bond purchases would be applied if countries were under a financial assistance programme.",
        "Moreover, unlike in the case of ABS and covered bonds, eligibility would be subject to a positive programme review and, in any event, purchases would only be possible outside of programme review periods.",
        "With regard to the operational design, it was considered appropriate not to impose a minimum issue size.",
        "The maturity range for purchases could be limited to a minimum remaining maturity of two years and a maximum remaining maturity of thirty years at the time of purchase.",
        "A “blackout period”, i.e.",
        "a period during which securities could not be bought, was considered to be a safeguard to preserve the distinction between the primary and the secondary markets.",
        "It would also be applied for the neighbouring securities along the yield curve.",
        "Such a provision would be in line with earlier practice to ensure compliance with the monetary financing prohibition laid down in the Treaty.",
        "Furthermore, an issue share limit, to be set uniformly at 25%, was considered.",
        "The purpose of this limit, which would cap the proportion of a given issue that the Eurosystem could buy, would be to preclude the possibility of the Eurosystem obtaining a blocking minority in a debt restructuring involving collective action clauses (CAC).",
        "Monitoring and additional analysis was needed to refine the application of the issue limit, given the CAC specifications and the different structures of the bonds.",
        "This was a matter for further review by the Governing Council.",
        "Turning to the case of countries not complying with the CQS3 rating requirement but benefiting from a waiver, an additional adjustment factor could be applied to the general issue limit of 25% with a view to achieving broad risk equivalence, in line with the rules set in previous programmes.",
        "In terms of creditor treatment, the Eurosystem would accept the same treatment as private creditors, which was a “pari passu” treatment.",
        "This was a means to ensure that the Eurosystem did not disrupt the normal functioning of the market by obtaining seniority vis-à-vis private investors.",
        "In addition, a second limit could be imposed in the form of an aggregate limit on Eurosystem holdings of the securities of any given issuer.",
        "This limit could be set at 33% of an issuer’s outstanding securities within the remaining maturities considered for purchase.",
        "This was also a way to safeguard the normal price formation mechanism in the market, as the Eurosystem did not want to crowd out private investors.",
        "The purchases could be guided by a benchmark that would be revised on a quarterly basis and could be adjusted in the future.",
        "It had to be recognised that some flexibility was needed both over time and across jurisdictions, to take account of market conditions.",
        "In such cases it might be necessary to depart at the margin from the benchmark allocation owing to operational considerations.",
        "For central government and agency bonds, a benchmark could be defined on the basis of the ECB’s capital key, and the purchases could be implemented in a decentralised manner by all NCBs.",
        "Inflation-linked securities would be purchased by the domestic NCB only, in proportion to their nominal share in the universe of purchasable securities.",
        "If the Eurosystem did not buy inflation-linked securities, it could severely distort break-even inflation rates.",
        "The eligible counterparties could be those eligible for the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations, together with any other counterparty used by the Eurosystem for the investment of its euro-denominated portfolios.",
        "In terms of securities lending, such transactions would be carried out as soon as possible, which would also serve the purpose of supporting market functioning.",
        "Completing the policy options, possible modifications to the terms and conditions of the remaining six TLTROs could be considered.",
        "Given the evolution of the term premium at the front end of the yield curve, the 10 basis point spread over the rate on the main refinancing operations could be eliminated for the six remaining TLTRO auctions.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, there was broad agreement among the members of the Governing Council with the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area presented by Mr Praet.",
        "The incoming information had been broadly in line with the short-term outlook for real GDP growth, as contained in the December 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, and remained consistent with both moderate growth around the turn of the year and a gradual economic recovery in the period ahead, which was still uncertain and subject to downside risks.",
        "The main news since the Governing Council’s meeting on 4 December 2014 had been the further substantial decline in oil prices.",
        "Moreover, interest rates were lower and there had been a further depreciation of the exchange rate of the euro.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that recent supportive financial market developments largely reflected market expectations about the monetary policy decisions to be taken at the current meeting.",
        "Accordingly, a reversal of recent financial market developments could be expected if no further monetary policy measures were announced.",
        "If this were to occur, the associated positive impact on the growth and price outlook could be unwound and a higher degree of volatility or instability in the financial markets could create additional risks.",
        "The remark was also made, however, that the depreciation of the euro against the US dollar could fundamentally be attributed to the different growth paths in the United States and the euro area, rather than only to monetary policy expectations regarding an announcement of a large-scale asset purchase programme by the ECB following the meeting.",
        "The assessment was widely shared that developments in the euro area economy continued to be characterised by protracted weak demand and a lack of confidence as reflected, in particular, in persistently weak investment.",
        "This also confirmed the continued need to address underlying structural weaknesses and to improve the business environment in order to unlock the euro area’s growth potential.",
        "Against this background, lower oil prices should be a positive factor, supporting the outlook for growth in the euro area, and might go some way towards mitigating downside risks to growth.",
        "The remark was made that there were even upside risks to the outlook for growth because of the oil price shock.",
        "However, this positive impact was conditional on the extent to which the fall in oil prices was driven by supply factors, as opposed to demand factors.",
        "In this context, the decline in oil prices over most of 2014 was widely considered to have been the result of a combination of both supply and demand factors, while there seemed to be a consensus that in the most recent period it was mainly related to supply factors, which should be positive for growth.",
        "Lower oil prices should eventually feed through to investment trends, and consumption should also be supported by higher real disposable income.",
        "While global growth remained modest, there were signs of a gradual, uneven recovery, which should also be supported by the lower oil prices.",
        "With this in mind, the remark was made that a more optimistic assessment of economic developments was possible, as several signs seemed to be positive.",
        "However, there were several sources of uncertainty about the magnitude of the positive impact on growth from lower oil prices.",
        "For example, lower oil prices could also imply higher saving ratios, rather than higher domestic spending by firms and households.",
        "While this would be positive for growth over a longer-term horizon and would support the ongoing deleveraging process and the strengthening of balance sheets, it would not contribute to supporting demand over the shorter term.",
        "On balance, it was argued that lower oil prices should, in any case, allow the Governing Council to have more confidence in the economic recovery, while it was less clear whether the oil price decline would mainly affect the balance of risks to the outlook for growth or whether it would translate into an effective upward revision to euro area growth.",
        "At this juncture, members broadly shared the view that they would maintain their assessment that, on balance, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook were on the downside, while downside risks had diminished as a result of the fall in oil prices.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Euro area HICP inflation had fallen to -0.2% in December 2014, largely reflecting the drop in oil prices.",
        "Inflation had thus turned negative for the first time since 2009.",
        "The impact of changes in oil prices (in euro terms) since the finalisation of the December 2014 Eurosystem staff projection exercise would substantially lower the euro area headline HICP inflation rate in 2015, which was likely to remain in negative territory for most of the year.",
        "Therefore, there was now a higher risk of inflation being too low for too long a period of time.",
        "In the current fragile environment with persistent low price pressures, it was underlined that the Governing Council was not in a comfortable position to “look through” price shocks, even when they originated on the supply side.",
        "However, the argument was also advanced that the current very low rates of inflation should be seen primarily in the light of falling oil prices and, when looking at exclusion measures of the HICP (such as the HICP excluding food and energy), inflation remained stable at around 0.7%.",
        "In that context it was, however, also observed that a significant part of the decline in inflation since late 2011 had been due to developments in services and non-energy industrial goods prices, suggesting weak domestic demand and indicating that there were some adverse spillovers from developments in energy and food prices to other HICP components.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that the euro area was not currently experiencing deflation, according to the usual definition, and no forecasts available (from either the ECB or international institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission) pointed to a deflationary situation.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the fact that while a substantial downward revision to the inflation path for 2015 could be expected, the potential revisions for 2016 – closer to the relevant medium-term horizon – were less clear, as the impact of lower oil prices had to be assessed in conjunction with the impact of the recent exchange rate depreciation, and the lagged impact on prices from improved growth prospects also needed to be taken into account.",
        "Nonetheless, it was widely acknowledged that the risk of second-round effects needed to be considered very seriously.",
        "On the one hand, it could be argued that the risk of such effects was relatively small owing to the asymmetric effects of wage indexation (with indexation clauses often not applicable when inflation was in negative territory) and the prevalence of nominal rigidities, notwithstanding structural changes in wage-setting in a number of countries since the onset of the crisis.",
        "On the other hand, however, there was broad agreement that the potential for second-round effects, even if uncertain, constituted a major downside risk to the inflation outlook and needed to be monitored closely.",
        "This was particularly important given the downward movements in market-based inflation expectations and the already long period of very low inflation in the euro area, together with the likelihood of several more quarters of low or even negative rates of inflation.",
        "With regard to inflation expectations, a number of remarks were made on how recent developments in survey and financial market-based indicators should be interpreted.",
        "There was some evidence of an increased sensitivity of inflation expectations to negative inflation shocks, and market-based measures of inflation expectations at different horizons had been declining.",
        "It could therefore be considered that there was a higher risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "At the same time, developments in market-based inflation expectations required further analysis.",
        "The impact of oil prices on inflation expectations should, in principle, be transitory and of limited relevance over medium-term and longer-term horizons.",
        "One explanation for why this was currently not reflected in market-based expectations was that liquidity distortions might be playing a role or that the decline could be related to a further reduction in inflation risk premia.",
        "In line with such interpretations, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were still broadly unchanged at around 1.8%.",
        "Declines in market-based inflation expectations also appeared to be an international phenomenon, with similar developments occurring in the United States (despite large quantitative easing programmes).",
        "In this respect, more analysis was needed, including of the role of factors such as globalisation or technological change.",
        "However, the point was made that, even if such factors were at work and pronounced changes in relative prices were to take place, it was still the task of monetary policy to anchor price stability in aggregate terms.",
        "Taking all arguments into account, the risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations was generally perceived as a matter of concern for the euro area and it was crucial to avoid any potential impact of the currently very low inflation rates on medium-term wage and price-setting behaviour.",
        "The potential adverse impact of lower inflation expectations and low or negative inflation on real GDP growth also continued to be a matter of concern.",
        "It was remarked that the large oil price shock had had an immediate downward impact on inflation and, to some extent, on inflation expectations, while the positive effects on income would take longer to materialise.",
        "Moreover, in assessing the economic impact of falling inflation, the environment of fragile inflation expectations and elevated debt levels needed to be taken into account.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, the members generally shared the assessment that recent data indicated a recovery in the underlying growth of broad money, albeit at low levels.",
        "Loan growth remained in negative territory, while continuing its gradual recovery from the trough observed in February 2014.",
        "It was recalled that weak monetary growth could be explained by the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets and weak economic activity.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that there were also some positive signs in the recent data, as evidenced by recent loan dynamics and falling borrowing costs.",
        "Evidence from the January 2015 bank lending survey had also provided further positive signals for a continued recovery of credit markets, indicating a further net easing of credit standards for all loan categories in the fourth quarter of 2014.",
        "Banks expected that these dynamics would continue in early 2015.",
        "Overall, however, from a historical perspective, the level of credit standards remained relatively tight.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, the members broadly shared the assessment that inflation dynamics had continued to be weaker than expected, economic slack had remained sizeable and money and credit developments had continued to be subdued, notwithstanding recent more positive monetary developments.",
        "The Governing Council was thus faced with heightened risks of too prolonged a period of too low inflation.",
        "On the basis of its reassessment of the outlook for price stability and the monetary policy stimulus achieved, the Governing Council discussed (i) whether or not there was a need for policy action at the current meeting; (ii) which instruments to use if additional monetary policy measures were seen as warranted; and (iii) how to frame the regime of risk sharing and the precise implementation modalities to be applied to an expanded asset purchase programme.",
        "As a general starting point, all members considered asset purchases, including sovereign bond purchases, to be part of the set of monetary policy instruments which, as foreseen in the ECB’s legal framework, were at the Governing Council’s disposal if and when required for it to deliver on its price stability mandate, although some members argued that this instrument should only be used in contingency situations.",
        "A number of considerations were put forward in support of monetary policy action being taken at the current meeting.",
        "While the existing monetary policy measures adopted in June and September 2014 were showing encouraging results with regard to a further improvement in overall financing conditions, it had become increasingly evident that they would fall short in quantitative terms.",
        "This implied that the expected stimulus via funding cost relief and the boost to lending provided by the TLTROs and the existing private sector asset purchase programmes was more limited than had initially been envisaged.",
        "The view was widely shared that inflation developments continued to be weaker than expected.",
        "Inflation outturns had been on a continuous downward trend, which had led to successive downward revisions of the inflation outlook for the euro area to levels well below the Governing Council’s aim of inflation rates over the medium term of below, but close to, 2%.",
        "In addition, shorter-term inflation dynamics had started to influence inflation expectations at longer-term horizons.",
        "In this context, the potential for second-round effects on wage and price-setting had increased, significantly increasing the risk of inflation remaining too low for too prolonged a period of time.",
        "Taking into account both the weakened medium-term outlook for price stability and the smaller than envisaged monetary stimulus introduced by the policy measures adopted in June and September 2014, the prevailing degree of monetary policy accommodation was seen to fall short of sufficiently countering the heightened risks to the ECB’s medium-term price stability objective.",
        "Against this background, there was a broadly shared view that the conditions were fully in place for taking additional monetary policy action at the current meeting.",
        "Moreover, an unwelcome tightening in the monetary policy stance – as reflected, for example, in higher real interest rates in an environment of declining prices with policy rates at the lower bound – needed to be countered.",
        "Monetary policy needed to act to anchor inflation expectations in line with price stability over the medium term.",
        "Such anchoring required forceful policy action in addressing too low a level of inflation, just as had been the case in the past when countering inflation rates above the ECB’s price stability objective.",
        "In addition, the current meeting was the right time to take monetary policy action as it would allow the measures to provide decisive support to the momentum of the recovery in the period ahead.",
        "A number of considerations in favour of maintaining a wait-and-see stance at the current meeting were also advanced by some members, as the cost-benefit assessment of the proposed measures was not positive in their view.",
        "In short, a slightly different assessment of the economic situation, the inflation outlook and money and loan dynamics could be made, the effectiveness of the proposed measures could be questioned and the potential negative side effects of these measures should not be underestimated.",
        "In greater detail, although inflation had fallen uncomfortably low, the recent sharp decline in oil prices had been the dominant factor behind the decline.",
        "Given the uncertainty about the impact of the oil price shock on the medium-term price outlook, notably in view of its positive impulse for growth prospects, and the possibility that the oil price shock might be a one-off event or might reverse, the extent to which the relevant medium-term inflation outlook had changed significantly remained unclear.",
        "Accordingly, risks of second-round effects seemed rather contained.",
        "Moreover, recent declines in inflation expectations might also be mainly driven by negative inflation risk premia, low liquidity and high uncertainty, which, while worrying developments, could not be taken as evidence of an unanchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "Reference was again made to the market-based measures of long-term inflation expectations in the United States, which were currently moving in tandem with those in the euro area despite the implementation of large-scale asset purchases in the United States.",
        "On the basis of these considerations, in the view of some members there appeared to be no urgent need for monetary policy action at the current meeting.",
        "In particular, broad financial and monetary conditions, including interest rate and exchange rate developments, had provided additional stimulus over recent weeks.",
        "Moreover, while the decline in inflation expectations had led to a tightening in the monetary policy stance in terms of real short-term interest rates, real lending rates for loans to NFCs had improved more recently, for example when compared with their level in May 2014.",
        "In this context, it was also highlighted that there was still monetary accommodation in the pipeline owing to the ongoing implementation of the existing monetary policy measures, and the full effect of these measures on the economy was still to be seen.",
        "It was also cautioned that the case for action could not be separated from the issue of the choice of instrument.",
        "Purchases of sovereign bonds were associated with a number of challenges and side effects, particularly related to the nature of sovereign bond purchases within the specific institutional framework of Economic and Monetary Union.",
        "Therefore, purchases of sovereign bonds should remain a contingency instrument of monetary policy, to be used only as a last resort in the event of an extremely adverse scenario, such as a downward deflationary spiral.",
        "However, thus far there was no evidence of a serious risk of deflation, which clearly argued against mobilising the instrument of sovereign bond purchases at the current meeting.",
        "As regards the most appropriate instruments for achieving additional monetary stimulus, the point was made that purchases of corporate bonds, possibly complemented by purchases of supranational bonds, could be seen as the most natural extension of the Governing Council’s credit easing package, representing a more targeted measure directed towards a further improvement in the financing conditions of firms.",
        "However, it was widely judged that, given the current level of corporate bond yields and the size of the corporate bond market, the credit easing potential of corporate bond purchases appeared rather small, and therefore offered only limited scope for providing the degree of accommodation needed at this stage.",
        "At the same time, the remark was made that this asset class should not be excluded from future consideration, if needed.",
        "Consequently, it was broadly agreed that any further monetary policy measure would need to involve purchases of government securities.",
        "One of the variants mentioned, namely to limit the purchases to a portfolio comprising only sovereign bonds of the euro area countries with the highest credit ratings, was generally regarded as being insufficiently effective.",
        "Against this backdrop, a large number of members were in favour of expanding the existing private sector asset purchase programmes to include purchases of a broad portfolio of securities of euro area governments and agencies and of supranational institutions.",
        "Purchases of sovereign debt appeared to be the only remaining instrument of sufficient scope to provide the necessary monetary stimulus to deliver on the ECB’s price stability objective.",
        "Through the compression of euro area sovereign yields, portfolio rebalancing effects could be set in motion, including spillovers to the prices of a multitude of other assets.",
        "As a result, forces would materialise which would lead to an easing of conditions across broad sources of financing, including those relevant for the borrowing conditions of euro area NFCs and households.",
        "Some degree of caution was still expressed with regard to the potential effectiveness of sovereign bond purchases.",
        "Sovereign bond yields in the euro area had already approached rather low levels, limiting the scope for further yield compression and, consequently, the potential funding cost relief to be passed on to final borrowers’ financing conditions.",
        "In addition, portfolio rebalancing effects could turn out to be more muted than envisaged given the ongoing need for balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors.",
        "Moreover, in the United States the capital market-based transmission channels were at work, most notably via direct effects on mortgage and housing markets and the greater role of corporate bond markets, and these factors might be weaker in the case of the euro area.",
        "It was noted that monetary policy action, particularly in the area of sovereign bond purchases, could not be seen in isolation from the actions of other policy actors.",
        "Possible moral hazard implications for euro area governments could weaken their incentives for structural reforms and fiscal consolidation.",
        "Hence, there was broad agreement that the effectiveness of sovereign bond purchases would also depend on the appropriate action on the part of other policy-makers in the euro area.",
        "Growth-friendly fiscal policies, while fully respecting existing commitments, were seen as an effective instrument to support economic growth in the euro area at the current juncture.",
        "Moreover, the determined implementation of structural reforms, together with actions to improve the business environment, would increase investment activity, boost job creation and increase productivity growth.",
        "This would not only raise the euro area’s long-term growth prospects, but would also reinforce the positive effects of any monetary policy measures on economic growth and inflation developments.",
        "These were strong messages to be conveyed to euro area governments and the European Commission.",
        "It was also noted that the Governing Council had to be wary of possible financial stability ramifications which could arise from intervening in already generously priced markets.",
        "Spillovers from sovereign bond purchases not only into corporate bond prices, but also into equity prices, could trigger the mispricing of risk and feed financial market exuberance with potential destabilising effects on financial markets.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that this should be addressed by macro-prudential policy.",
        "Members discussed the appropriate modalities of risk sharing related to the purchases of securities issued by euro area governments and agencies and European institutions.",
        "On the one hand, arguments were made in favour of full risk sharing so as to counter perceptions of a lack of unity.",
        "Full risk sharing would also underline the singleness of monetary policy.",
        "On the other hand, in view of concerns about moral hazard it was argued that a regime of partial loss sharing would be more commensurate with the current architecture of Economic and Monetary Union and the Treaties under which the ECB operates.",
        "Weighing all the arguments, a consensus could be reached on the following approach.",
        "The purchases of European institutions’ securities conducted by the NCBs, amounting to 12% of the additional asset purchases, would be subject to full risk sharing.",
        "It was also proposed that the ECB would conduct 8% of the additional purchases, which was in accordance with past practice and the standard way of implementing monetary policy by the Eurosystem.",
        "The rest of the NCBs’ additional asset purchases would not be subject to loss sharing.",
        "This implied that 20% of the additional asset purchases would be subject to a regime of risk sharing.",
        "As regards the volume of the programme, a pace of combined monthly asset purchases in the order of €50 billion lasting from March 2015 to end-2016, which had been mentioned by Mr Praet, was widely regarded as a sizeable complement to the existing purchase programmes.",
        "This was seen as needed to compensate for the weakened inflation outlook coupled with the weaker than expected monetary stimulus provided by the monetary policy measures taken in June and September 2014.",
        "In order to accelerate the impact, there was broad support in favour of some frontloading by increasing the monthly purchase volume to €60 billion, starting in March 2015 and intended to last until the end of September 2016, while not materially altering the overall volume of intended purchases.",
        "This would comprise the purchase of public sector securities, as well as the private sector programmes that were already in operation.",
        "At the same time, members agreed to make the termination of purchases contingent on the evolving path of inflation being consistent with the Governing Council’s price stability objective.",
        "This provided an important element of forward guidance.",
        "As a further complement to the expanded asset purchase programme, the proposal to adapt the terms and conditions applied to the remaining six TLTROs by eliminating the spread of 10 basis points over the prevailing rate on the main refinancing operations was widely supported The Governing Council discussed the technical design features of a sovereign bond purchase programme, as presented earlier.",
        "With regard to the universe of purchasable assets, it was agreed that the programme would include purchases of securities of central government, certain agencies established in the euro area and certain international or supranational institutions located in the euro area.",
        "It was viewed as important to restrict purchases to investment-grade securities, namely those with a first-best rating of at least CQS3, in line with the collateral eligibility criteria applied in the Eurosystem’s credit operations.",
        "This, however, did not imply the a priori exclusion of particular euro area countries from the additional sovereign bond purchases.",
        "A rating derogation was to be granted, in line with the earlier practice with regard to the ABSPP and CBPP3 and as long as the Eurosystem’s minimum credit quality threshold was not applied in the Eurosystem’s credit operations, for countries under EU/IMF adjustment programmes.",
        "Moreover, in line with past practice, the rating derogation would be subject to some additional eligibility criteria and limit adjustments aimed at achieving risk equivalence.",
        "There was broad agreement on conducting the additional purchases of securities according to Eurosystem NCBs’ shares in the ECB’s capital key.",
        "Regarding the residual maturity of the sovereign bonds to be purchased, there was broad agreement that a residual maturity of two to thirty years would strike a good balance between ensuring an appropriate universe of purchasable sovereign bonds and limiting the risks of market distortions and the crowding-out of investors in the longer-maturity segment.",
        "As regards the issue limit, broad agreement prevailed that an issue share limit would ensure proper market functioning, counter monetary financing concerns and safeguard “pari passu” treatment.",
        "An issue share limit of 25% needed to be applied in order to avoid obtaining a blocking minority in a debt restructuring involving collective action clauses.",
        "Therefore, this issue limit also comprised the existing Eurosystem holdings of sovereign bonds in the context of the Securities Markets Programme and any other portfolios owned by Eurosystem central banks.",
        "Likewise, the issuer limit of 33% was broadly supported as a means to safeguard market functioning and price formation as well as to mitigate the risk of the ECB becoming a dominant creditor of euro area governments.",
        "To this end, it was judged appropriate to apply the 33% limit to the universe of eligible assets in the two to thirty-year range of residual maturity.",
        "Moreover, to ensure compliance with the monetary financing prohibition laid down in the Treaty, the application of an appropriate blackout period was viewed as important.",
        "Against this background, and taking into account the views expressed by the members of the Governing Council, the President concluded that a large majority of voting members supported a decision to launch an expanded asset purchase programme, comprising the existing purchase programmes for ABS and covered bonds as well as purchases of euro-denominated securities issued by euro area governments and agencies and supranational institutions.",
        "This programme would start in March 2015 and involve monthly purchases of €60 billion which were intended to last until the end of September 2016, and, in any case, until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with the aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2%.",
        "As regards the risk-sharing regime, the consensus reached was that 20% of the overall additional asset purchases would be subject to sharing of hypothetical losses.",
        "This included the sharing of possible losses on the NCB purchases of the bonds of supranational institutions, amounting to 12% of the additional asset purchases, as well as the sharing of possible losses on the 8% holdings of the additional purchases by the ECB.",
        "In addition, it was decided to set the interest rate for the remaining six TLTROs at a rate equal to the rate on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations prevailing at the time when each TLTRO was conducted.",
        "Finally, with regard to interest rates, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.20% respectively.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed recent financial market developments.",
        "Since the previous Governing Council monetary policy meeting on 15-16 July, events in China had been the main driver of global financial markets, with significant spillover effects in commodity markets.",
        "The decline in oil prices had also triggered a downward adjustment in market-based measures of inflation expectations in the euro area and had contributed to a decline in bond yields and significantly higher market volatility.",
        "Nevertheless, the implementation of the asset purchase programme (APP) had been in line with the pre-defined targets and had not been hampered by the global developments and lower market liquidity observed over the summer months.",
        "In the foreign exchange market, the euro had risen against most major currencies, including the US dollar, in part supported by expectations of a postponement of a first rise in official interest rates in the United States since 2006.",
        "With regard to international markets, the main theme over the summer had been the decline in growth prospects in China, developments in the Chinese stock market, and the decision by the People’s Bank of China to reform the daily fixing mechanism for the renminbi, announced on 11 August 2015.",
        "Accordingly, the new daily fixing would no longer be based on the previous day’s central parity, but on the previous day’s closing spot price, thereby moving closer to a market-determined mechanism.",
        "The spillovers to international markets had been strong, with European, US and Japanese stock markets declining by 7% to 13%, after having traded sideways during the summer.",
        "However, these markets had subsequently rebounded somewhat following actions by the Chinese authorities and perceived accommodative comments from ECB and Federal Reserve officials.",
        "Most market analysts deemed the spillover to developed equity markets to be excessive and to have been exacerbated by one-sided positioning as well as thin liquidity during the summer months.",
        "The turmoil in Chinese equities had also had strong spillover effects on commodities markets.",
        "Oil and industrial metal prices had continued to decline to levels not seen since 2009 as a result of oversupply and expectations that demand would remain subdued owing to the slowdown in global growth.",
        "Accordingly, forward contracts up to two years ahead suggested that the market was expecting oil prices to stay lower for longer, as some forward prices had declined by up to USD 17 per barrel during the previous six months.",
        "Regarding exchange rates, the euro had appreciated in terms of its nominal effective exchange rate against the currencies of major trading partners.",
        "It had also strengthened to an intraday high of 1.17 against the US dollar on 24 August before falling back to USD 1.125 on 1 September.",
        "The moves were attributed to the lower probability of an imminent rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee in the light of international developments, as well as to the unwinding of carry trades funded in euro, as confirmed by the reduced short positions in the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission weekly data.",
        "With respect to developments in euro area financial markets, the decline in oil prices had also triggered a decrease in market-based measures of inflation expectations and contributed to a decline in bond yields and higher market volatility.",
        "The fall in nominal yields had not been accompanied by a similar decline in real yields, given that market-implied inflation rates had also declined.",
        "Looking at market conditions in the euro area fixed income markets in recent months, volumes in ten-year German Bund futures on Eurex had consistently been below their five-year seasonal average, with the exception of the high-volatility episodes in May 2015 and the recent uncertainty related to China.",
        "Investor activity in the cash bond market had been similarly subdued, with volumes in stressed jurisdictions having declined by less than those elsewhere.",
        "Turning to the execution of the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), lower liquidity had become more apparent in some market segments, for example for supranational bonds or in smaller jurisdictions as well as at the very long end of the curve.",
        "With regard to the pace of purchases under the APP, the ECB had undertaken – as would be published on Monday, 7 September 2015 – purchases of €51.6 billion in August.",
        "Given the modest frontloading of purchases in previous months, the Eurosystem had now bought assets amounting to, on average, around €60 billion per month over the first six months of the APP.",
        "Purchases under the third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3) had amounted to €7.5 billion in August, with the book value of CBPP3 holdings having stood at around €111.5 billion at the end of that month, and with primary market purchases amounting to a share of 17.9%.",
        "With regard to purchases of asset-backed securities (ABS), the Eurosystem had bought €1.3 billion of such securities in August, bringing the book value of holdings under the ABS purchase programme to €11.1 billion at the end of that month, with 27.2% purchased in the primary market.",
        "From September to November 2015, purchases under the APP would again be somewhat frontloaded to prepare for the expected decline in market liquidity in December.",
        "Finally, turning to money markets and liquidity, excess liquidity had been building up steadily.",
        "It had risen by €100 billion over the current maintenance period to reach €499 billion on 1 September 2015.",
        "Interbank market activity was declining somewhat overall, as a result of the high levels of excess liquidity and also banks’ reluctance to trade in the money market at levels that were close to -20 basis points.",
        "In this context, money market rates had remained steady at low levels.",
        "Increasing excess liquidity was reflected in short-term rate expectations.",
        "EONIA forward rates had decreased further in August.",
        "Three-month EURIBOR futures-implied rates had also turned negative for maturities up to and including September 2016, such that the whole EURIBOR curve was currently negative for the year ahead.",
        "In the cash market, new lows had been recorded for the three-month EURIBOR rates.",
        "The impact on euro area money markets of the global market turbulence and developments in China had so far remained very muted.",
        "The ECB’s actions, in the form of the Governing Council’s forward guidance, the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and the asset purchase programmes, had ensured that the money market curve had remained very stable and euro area money market conditions had been resilient to, and well protected from, global shocks.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Global growth had remained gradual and uneven across regions.",
        "The global manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had dropped to 50.7 in August 2015, from 51.0 in the preceding two months.",
        "Global trade momentum had remained weak in the first half of 2015.",
        "The volume of world imports of goods had decreased by 0.9%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2015, after a decline of 1.7% in the first quarter.",
        "The global PMI for new export orders had remained below 50 in August, at 49.9, unchanged from July.",
        "Global inflation had remained moderate.",
        "Annual headline inflation in the OECD area had been unchanged in July, at 0.6%, while inflation excluding food and energy had edged up slightly to 1.7%, from 1.6% in June, in a context of volatile oil prices and abundant spare capacity.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting in mid-July 2015, Brent crude oil prices had fallen by 13% to stand at USD 50 per barrel on 1 September, and were 15% lower in euro terms, while non-oil commodity price declines could be observed in particular for metal and food prices.",
        "Over the same period, the euro exchange rate had appreciated by 1.8% against the US dollar and by 2.6% and 4.1% in nominal effective terms vis-à-vis 19 and 38 major trading partners respectively.",
        "Turning to the euro area, according to the available flash estimate from Eurostat of 14 August 2015, real GDP had risen by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2015, following growth of 0.4% in the first quarter.",
        "While no breakdown at the euro area level was as yet available, short-term indicators and available country data suggested that domestic demand and net exports had contributed positively, while the contribution of changes in inventories had been negative.",
        "Industrial production excluding construction had declined by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2015, while the ECB indicator on euro area industrial new orders had grown strongly in the second quarter.",
        "Both the composite output PMI and the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator stood on average in July and August above their respective average levels in the second quarter of 2015.",
        "In addition, both indicators currently stood at levels above their respective long-term averages.",
        "Looking ahead, private consumption expenditure should remain the key driver of the euro area economic recovery, while the modest recovery of business investment in the first half of 2015 was expected to continue, as capacity utilisation had returned to levels close to its long-term average, impediments to production had lessened and credit supply constraints had eased.",
        "Regarding slack in the euro area economy, a range of estimates and indicators suggested a large degree of uncertainty while in general pointing to significant levels of slack.",
        "Looking ahead, the negative output gap was expected to close gradually in the coming years.",
        "Labour markets were still relatively weak, but conditions had been improving overall.",
        "Employment had risen further, by 0.1% quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2015.",
        "The unemployment rate for the euro area, which had started to decline in mid-2013, had fallen further between the first and second quarters of 2015 and stood at 10.9% in July.",
        "Available survey data pointed to continued moderate employment growth in the period ahead.",
        "The September 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections foresaw euro area real GDP growth to be 1.4% in 2015, 1.7% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017.",
        "This was somewhat lower than envisaged in the June 2015 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Downward revisions primarily reflected lower external demand owing to weaker growth in emerging markets and a lower import content of global growth.",
        "Since the cut-off date of 12 August for the technical assumptions underlying the projections, the effective exchange rate of the euro had appreciated and oil prices had declined.",
        "On balance, this pointed to somewhat higher downside risks to the euro area growth outlook.",
        "Turning to price developments in the euro area, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 0.2% in August, unchanged from July and June.",
        "The unchanged headline rate had resulted from a further decline in energy price inflation that had been compensated for by increases in the annual rates of change of the unprocessed food and non-energy industrial goods components.",
        "HICP inflation excluding food and energy was also unchanged from July, standing at 1.0% in August.",
        "Overall, looking at a broad range of measures of underlying inflation and at the evolution of individual HICP components, it remained premature to conclude with certainty that a turning point in inflation dynamics had been reached earlier in the year.",
        "As regards a number of other price indicators, the latest price survey data had shown a dampening of the upward trend observed since the start of the year.",
        "Euro area PMI survey indices for input prices had declined in August, while those for output prices had remained broadly stable.",
        "Their levels were nevertheless still higher than at the start of the year.",
        "The European Commission survey data on selling prices for the retail and services sectors of the euro area economy had also declined in July.",
        "In August they had rebounded slightly for the retail sector, remained stable for the services sector and fallen further for the industry sector.",
        "Import prices remained the main source of upward pipeline price pressure for consumer goods.",
        "While import prices stood at elevated levels for non-food consumer goods and, to a lesser extent, for food, domestic sources of pipeline price pressures were still weak.",
        "Producer price indices for June and July, which had become available since the Governing Council meeting on 15-16 July, indicated that producer prices for non-food consumer goods had started to increase slightly, standing at 0.2% in July.",
        "Although producer prices for non-food consumer goods had been subdued, historical regularities suggested that an upturn was likely, as soon as the pass-through of the strong past depreciation of the euro started to gain traction.",
        "The September 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections foresaw HICP inflation to average 0.1% in 2015 and to pick up to 1.1% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017.",
        "In comparison with the June 2015 Eurosystem staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised down, largely owing to lower oil prices.",
        "Also taking into account the developments in oil prices and exchange rates after the cut-off date for the technical assumptions of 12 August, there were downside risks to the September staff inflation projections.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, market-based measures had declined again over the summer, following the recovery from their troughs in mid-January.",
        "For example, the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead stood at 1.7% on 1 September 2015, after 1.8% in mid-July 2015.",
        "No new release of the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters had become available since the last monetary policy meeting.",
        "Turning to financial and monetary conditions, the EONIA forward curve had slightly steepened at longer maturities.",
        "Despite the recent financial market repricing, and reflecting the lag in the pass-through of monetary policy rates to bank lending rates, the composite lending rate for non-financial corporations (NFCs) had declined between end-2014 and July 2015.",
        "Rates on loans to households for house purchases had declined overall in the second quarter of 2015 but had started to increase in June and July.",
        "The overall nominal cost of external financing for euro area NFCs was estimated to have increased modestly in August, after declining marginally in July.",
        "The increase in August reflected mainly a higher equity risk premium resulting from a decline in stock prices.",
        "In July and August, the cost of equity and market-based debt for NFCs stood on average around 45 basis points higher than in February 2015.",
        "Monthly data showed that the net issuance of debt securities by NFCs had moderated in May and June 2015.",
        "This development followed the surge in issuance activity in the first quarter of 2015, associated with the launch of the expanded APP.",
        "Turning to other stock market indicators, the price-to-earnings ratios of both financial and non-financial corporations had recovered from their trough in late 2011, but had been declining again sharply since May.",
        "Price-to-book ratios had diverged since 2012, with the ratio of financial corporations having increased less than that of non-financial corporations.",
        "Regarding money and credit developments, the data for July pointed to robust growth in broad money, skewed towards its most liquid components.",
        "In July the annual growth rate of M3 had increased to 5.3%, up from 4.9% in June.",
        "M3 growth had continued to be driven by M1 (with annual growth picking up further in July to stand at 12.1%, after 11.7% in June), reflecting the low opportunity costs of holding the most liquid instruments as well as sales of public sector bonds and covered bonds by the money-holding sector in the context of the APP.",
        "Among the counterparts of M3, shifts away from longer-term financial liabilities – partly linked to the attractiveness of the TLTROs – towards instruments included in M3 and increased credit from MFIs (including the Eurosystem) to general government, reflecting purchases under the PSPP, had been the main contributors to annual money growth in recent months, while the contribution from credit to the private sector had turned marginally positive.",
        "MFI lending to the non-financial private sector had continued to recover until July, but MFI loan dynamics remained weak overall.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to NFCs had recovered further in most euro area countries.",
        "MFI loan growth to households had also recovered further in the second quarter of 2015.",
        "Specifically, the annual rate of change of loans to NFCs (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.9% in July, up from 0.2% in June, continuing its gradual recovery since the beginning of 2014.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.9% in July 2015, after 1.7% in June.",
        "As regards fiscal policies, the government deficit and debt ratios were expected to decline over the projection horizon.",
        "The projected decline in the general government deficit-to-GDP ratio was due to the cyclical improvement in the euro area economy and declining interest expenditure.",
        "At the same time, the average euro area fiscal stance, measured as the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was expected to remain broadly neutral over the projection horizon.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet noted that the euro area economic recovery was expected to continue at a somewhat slower pace than previously anticipated, largely reflecting the slowdown in emerging market economies.",
        "Although it was still premature to conclude whether these developments could have a lasting impact on euro area output and HICP inflation, downside risks had intensified.",
        "Challenges facing emerging market economies were clouding the global outlook and were unlikely to recede quickly, while lower oil prices were expected to support domestic demand in the euro area, but not to fully compensate for the impact of weaker global demand and a stronger euro exchange rate.",
        "Overall, lower than expected commodity prices, the recent euro exchange rate appreciation and somewhat lower than expected economic growth had increased the downside risk to achieving a sustainable path of inflation towards 2%.",
        "This was reflected in the downward revisions in the latest ECB staff projections and had been reinforced by the most recent economic and financial developments.",
        "At the same time, monetary and financial conditions remained supportive, largely due to the accommodative monetary policy stance – even though sharp fluctuations in asset prices were having an impact on financial conditions and risk premia.",
        "Cross-checking the results of the economic analysis with those of the monetary analysis indicated the need to firmly implement the Governing Council’s monetary policy decisions and to monitor closely all relevant incoming information as concerned their impact on the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "In the light of these developments and the new sources of uncertainty, there was no need to act at the present meeting, but it was very important that the Governing Council found the right balance between, on the one hand, not drawing premature conclusions on the lasting impact of the latest economic and financial developments and, on the other hand, recognising that downward risks had clearly increased.",
        "Against this background, appropriate monetary policy communication remained essential.",
        "The Governing Council could communicate that it assessed that the downside risks to the growth and inflation outlook had increased and that it would closely monitor the risks to the outlook for euro area price developments over the medium term.",
        "The Governing Council could also forcefully underline its willingness and ability to act, if warranted, by using all the instruments available within its mandate, and stress that its asset purchase programme provided sufficient flexibility.",
        "Mr Cœuré introduced the operational details regarding the proposed increase of the PSPP issue share limit from the current 25% to 33%, which was put forward for two reasons.",
        "First, Article 5 of Decision ECB/2015/10 adopted on 4 March 2015 foresaw a review of the limit after the initial six months of purchases.",
        "Second, increasing the limit would benefit the implementation of the expanded asset purchase programme, safeguarding sufficient flexibility in the implementation of the PSPP.",
        "An important consideration when adopting the issue share limit had been to avoid a situation whereby the Eurosystem could acquire a blocking minority for the purposes of collective action clauses in a potential debt restructuring.",
        "In some cases, the Eurosystem could therefore not buy more than 25% of the issue, but these cases represented a small share of the overall outstanding amount of the PSPP-eligible universe.",
        "Against this background, it was proposed to increase the issue share limit to 33% for all PSPP-eligible bonds but, for any bond where a blocking minority could arise below 33%, purchases would be limited to 25%.",
        "Bonds for which the blocking minority was below 33% would accordingly have to be checked on a case-by-case basis.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2015 had been weaker than expected, while recent economic data, including survey evidence available up to August, were seen as broadly consistent with a continued moderate economic recovery in the euro area.",
        "However, the recovery was now expected to proceed at a somewhat weaker pace than previously anticipated.",
        "While domestic demand in the euro area appeared to be relatively resilient, since the Governing Council meeting in mid-July some further weakness had been evident in the international environment.",
        "The slowdown in activity in emerging market economies, in particular, was weighing on global growth and trade, leading to lower growth in foreign demand for euro area exports.",
        "This assessment was broadly reflected in the September 2015 ECB staff projections, which incorporated a downward revision to the outlook for growth compared with the June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "Members discussed the outlook and the risks for the international environment.",
        "It was noted that a slowdown in the growth of world trade had been observed for some time, with signs of a lower trade elasticity of global growth possibly pointing to a structural change since the onset of the financial crisis.",
        "It was therefore likely that the recent slowdown reflected a combination of both structural and cyclical factors.",
        "In addition, uncertainty arising from developments in economic and financial conditions in emerging market economies, particularly China, had clearly increased.",
        "It was emphasised that the interpretation of the latest developments in China was very challenging, and more time and analysis were needed to better understand these developments and their implications for the euro area from a medium-term perspective.",
        "Although the possible impact of slower growth in China on euro area growth should not be overestimated, it had to be acknowledged that China had been an important driver of global growth over the past 20 years, with an increasing role in global value chains.",
        "Moreover, the slowdown in demand in China could contribute to greater global uncertainty and a possible loss of confidence, which could have a more substantial impact on global growth.",
        "The recent volatility in global markets was overall judged to clearly indicate that the economic outlook was subject to increased risk and heightened uncertainty.",
        "However, it was seen as premature to gauge whether a reassessment of fundamentals was warranted, namely with respect to lower growth prospects in China and other emerging market economies, or whether other factors were behind the recent high level of volatility in global markets, including reversals in trading behaviour and changes in the regulatory environment.",
        "All in all, it was considered too early to say whether recent external developments would have a material effect on the euro area, but the downside risks had clearly increased and there was a need to carefully monitor developments and policies outside the euro area.",
        "With regard to recent developments in the euro exchange rate, since the Governing Council meeting in mid-July the euro had appreciated somewhat both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms, particularly when considering the broader measure of the nominal effective exchange rate based on a basket of 38 currencies.",
        "While recent developments might have been driven in part by the unwinding of carry trades funded in euro in an environment of heightened risk aversion, changes in the outlook and associated market expectations about monetary policy in other currency areas – comprising both advanced and emerging economies – were also seen to have played a role.",
        "While the external environment was challenging and volatility had increased, there were a number of factors pointing to the resilience of the euro area.",
        "Looking ahead, the cyclical recovery in the euro area was expected to proceed in the second half of the year, with moderate real GDP growth continuing and the output gap gradually narrowing over the projection horizon.",
        "The latest economic sentiment data and purchasing managers’ surveys pointed to some robustness of the euro area to external developments, with no significant effects on activity apparent thus far.",
        "Among the main factors mentioned, low oil and commodity prices were seen to support purchasing power and the domestic side of the recovery.",
        "The steady decline in the euro area’s unemployment rate was another positive signal.",
        "Furthermore, it appeared that the process of internal devaluation within the euro area, involving adjustments in prices and costs in individual Member States, was largely complete, which implied diminishing downward short-term pressure on demand and prices in the respective economies, even if different views could be taken on the extent to which further rebalancing was still needed.",
        "Finally, fiscal consolidation was also no longer weighing on growth, while the extent of further balance sheet adjustments needed in the private sector was less clear.",
        "At the same time, the growth performance of the global economy and, in particular, of the euro area could be considered disappointing from a longer-term perspective.",
        "It was recalled that economic activity in the euro area had still not recovered to the level seen in 2008, and that investment was still far below its pre-crisis level.",
        "Recent developments pointed to the fragility of the growth model of the euro area, which appeared too reliant on external demand.",
        "Against this background, more active support for domestic demand was needed from other policy areas to underpin confidence – via structural reforms, the provision of an adequate public infrastructure and growth-supporting tax reforms – which would also provide greater insurance against external shocks.",
        "Members underlined that the role of investment was critical, both for the short-run outlook and in the medium term, as it was an important determinant of potential growth.",
        "It was observed that investment had remained very subdued in the wake of the crisis, with the current heightened uncertainty possibly weighing further on the investment outlook, beyond what was embodied in the September 2015 ECB staff projections, which showed investment picking up in 2015 and 2016, with a small downward revision in 2016.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the apparent disconnect between survey indicators and real economic performance in recent months, and the question was raised as to whether this could be due in part to insufficient progress with structural reforms needed to unlock growth and investment.",
        "Against this background, an improvement in the conditions for both public and private investment was called for and support was expressed again in this context for the European Commission’s investment plan and the growth-supportive role of a well-functioning public infrastructure.",
        "As on previous occasions, members also referred to the assessment of the degree of slack in the economy.",
        "While the output gap was expected to close gradually, there was a need to continue to analyse a wide range of indicators of slack.",
        "It was recalled that while a number of estimates, including those reported by international institutions, estimated the output gap in the euro area to be around 2½%, slack was very difficult to measure and was subject to a high degree of uncertainty.",
        "If the degree of slack was analysed jointly with inflation and with other variables, this could yield much larger estimates of the output gap.",
        "Such analysis could also account for the high level of unemployment, but would be difficult to reconcile with commonly used estimates of the level of structural unemployment, which, however, also varied when different methodologies were used.",
        "Overall, while the moderate recovery in the euro area economy was expected to continue, the risks to the outlook remained on the downside.",
        "This reflected, in particular, the heightened uncertainties related to the external environment.",
        "Notably, it was possible that recent developments in emerging market economies could have further adverse effects on global growth via both trade and confidence channels.",
        "In the exchange of views about fiscal developments it was noted that one of the key features of the current ECB staff projections – and one of the factors supporting economic growth – was that the fiscal stance was now broadly neutral, following the fiscal consolidation that had taken place in recent years.",
        "In this context, scope was seen for fiscal policy to further support the recovery by rebalancing the composition of expenditure towards more public investment and other growth-friendly measures geared to enhancing the quality of public finances, notwithstanding the fact that the degree of fiscal space was very limited for most euro area countries, taking into account the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact and current fiscal positions.",
        "With regard to price developments, members generally shared the assessment of the outlook and risks presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area inflation was 0.2% in August 2015, unchanged from the two previous months, with the annual rate of HICP inflation excluding food and energy also remaining stable in August, at 1.0%.",
        "Inflation was expected to remain very low in the near term before increasing towards the end of the year and rising further in 2016 and 2017.",
        "However, inflation was now expected to pick up more slowly than previously expected, due to lower commodity prices, the appreciation of the euro and the weaker outlook for growth.",
        "Recent oil price developments implied that the increase in headline inflation in the remainder of the year would be weaker than previously expected, as the upward impact of base effects would be smaller.",
        "This assessment was reflected in the September 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, where the inflation profile had been revised downwards in comparison with the June 2015 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Given the recent sharp fluctuations in oil prices, members discussed the factors underlying these developments.",
        "Overall, it appeared that the more recent downward movement in oil prices had mainly been driven by supply-side factors, such as increases in OPEC production and resilience in US shale oil production growth, while demand factors related to weaker global growth were also seen to have played a role, with crude oil demand picking up less than supply growth, resulting in further accumulation in inventories.",
        "Taking into account the most recent developments in oil prices and the euro exchange rate, there were downside risks to the September 2015 ECB staff projections for inflation.",
        "The magnitude of the changes to some of the technical assumptions underlying the projections since the cut-off date had been exceptional, reflecting the high level of market volatility.",
        "Depending on the exact cut-off dates and averaging procedures used, in most cases a mechanical update resulted in further downward revisions to the growth and inflation outlook.",
        "Hence, the latest developments and the impact of monetary policy measures, as well as geopolitical, energy price and exchange rate developments, warranted close monitoring.",
        "One conclusion that could be drawn from the high sensitivity of the outlook to the assumptions used, in particular the oil price, was that the Governing Council should be cautious in extrapolating from recent developments and not place too much weight on the latest data, as in the context of such high short-term volatility every update of the assumptions provided only a temporary snapshot of the economic environment.",
        "It would be unwise to draw premature conclusions from any short-term developments which might vary from one day to the next.",
        "By contrast, domestic price pressures, as captured for instance by measures of underlying inflation, were rising over the projection horizon and had largely developed in line with earlier expectations, although they had also been revised down slightly in the projections for 2017.",
        "At the same time, it was clear that the fall in oil prices affected the outlook for inflation via direct and indirect effects through a number of channels.",
        "It was also underlined that, while the revision to the inflation outlook had been driven mainly by oil prices and, to some extent, by the euro exchange rate and the external environment, the risk of second-round effects needed to be monitored closely in the period ahead.",
        "Moreover, the impact of lower inflation on inflation expectations and real debt burdens also needed to be taken into account.",
        "A number of comments were made by members on the importance of examining closely developments in measures of underlying inflation.",
        "Such measures were considered a useful analytical tool to give a broader and more complete picture of the underlying trend in inflation.",
        "Looking more closely at specific components of inflation, services price inflation had been relatively stable at just above 1% in recent months, while non-energy industrial goods price inflation had steadily increased over the past six months.",
        "The rise in the durables component was consistent with the increase in the consumption of durable goods observed over recent quarters and the sharp increase in import prices for non-food consumer goods, following the depreciation of the euro.",
        "This increase in non-energy goods price inflation could be a sign that firms were regaining pricing power.",
        "It was also an indication that the low underlying inflation rates in countries most affected by the crisis were converging with those recorded in other countries, so that inflation developments across the euro area were becoming more homogeneous.",
        "This implied that deflationary risks were receding for a greater part of the euro area.",
        "Compared with the turn of the year, the risk of broad-based deflation pressures was low and had decreased.",
        "At the same time, while it was necessary to look further into measures of underlying inflation, it was also recalled that in the euro area measures of underlying inflation, or core inflation, were not a very good predictor of future headline inflation.",
        "In their discussion of inflation expectations, members noted that market-based measures of inflation expectations had stopped increasing from the troughs reached at the beginning of the year and had declined somewhat since the last monetary policy meeting.",
        "With reference to evidence for both the euro area and the United States, which pointed to an increased correlation between current oil prices and inflation expectations, such as the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, it was puzzling that current oil prices should strongly affect inflation so far into the future.",
        "It was noted that the correlation between oil prices and inflation expectations had existed for some time, but in the past year and a half the link between current inflation and inflation expectations appeared to have strengthened considerably.",
        "This could be seen as a sign of an unanchoring of inflation expectations which required careful monitoring, while also pointing to possible shortcomings in the market-based indicators and in the functioning of the underlying market segments.",
        "Against this background, the need for the Governing Council to continue to conduct a broad-based analysis of all factors driving developments in inflation expectations was emphasised, together with the need for close monitoring of any possible signals of an unanchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "Overall, members shared the view that, while euro area inflation was expected to pick up, there had been a recent deterioration in the outlook for inflation which needed to be assessed further to distinguish between temporary and more persistent factors that were relevant for the medium term.",
        "In their assessment of the risks surrounding the inflation outlook, there was also broad agreement that the risks were tilted to the downside, given lower commodity prices, a stronger euro exchange rate and a somewhat lower growth outlook.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction that money and credit dynamics had continued their recovery, supported by the monetary policy measures in place.",
        "While exhibiting subdued growth for most of the period since 2010, recent data had confirmed a robust expansion in broad money (M3), with a further acceleration in July 2015.",
        "This expansion continued to be driven by the most liquid components of broad money.",
        "Encouraging signals were seen to come from recent loan dynamics, which had continued their gradual recovery since the beginning of 2014.",
        "The latest data on loans had shown continued improvements in lending conditions, with lending to both households and firms accelerating in July 2015, in part supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "This positive trend was broad-based, pointing to diminishing fragmentation and heterogeneity across the euro area.",
        "The recovery in loan dynamics had been supported by the widespread decline in lending rates since the announcement of the credit easing measures in the summer of 2014, as well as by favourable funding conditions for banks.",
        "This provided evidence that the ECB’s policy measures were effective, also considering that banks appeared to be beginning to rebalance their portfolios towards private sector assets.",
        "Overall, loan growth was considered to remain subdued, still standing well below the growth rates recorded during the previous, short-lived recovery in lending during 2010-11 and below the growth rates of the monetary aggregates.",
        "Subdued loan growth was seen in part to be still related to the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, particularly in some euro area countries in the wake of balance sheet recessions that were holding back more vigorous credit expansion by banks.",
        "In this context, reference was also made to the price-to-book ratios of listed financial companies, which remained low and had recently fallen again, notwithstanding the comprehensive assessment completed in 2014, the start of euro area-wide supervision by the SSM and the monetary policy measures in place.",
        "This suggested that the adjustment in the banking sector was far from complete, although more favourable price-to-book dynamics were visible when one considered only a sample of the largest euro area banks, which might benefit more from capital market activity.",
        "Members widely shared the assessment and policy considerations put forward by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "There was broad agreement that the overall economic situation in the euro area had become more challenging since before the summer.",
        "At the same time, the revisions to the outlook had not fundamentally changed the picture of an ongoing moderate recovery of the euro area economy and a gradual increase in inflation rates over the coming years.",
        "However, in the light of recent developments in the global economy – particularly in emerging market economies – and in financial, commodity and foreign exchange markets, the downside risks to the outlook for euro area growth and inflation had clearly increased.",
        "Against this background, there was wide agreement that, while recent market volatility was a sign of increased risk and heightened uncertainty over the economic outlook, it was too early to form a sound judgement on whether such developments would have a lasting impact on euro area economic developments and, in particular, the medium-term outlook for inflation.",
        "It was felt that more time was needed to gain a better understanding of the underlying driving forces and to analyse the factors behind the recent volatility in financial and commodity markets in greater depth.",
        "In particular, it was necessary to further assess whether these developments reflected changing macroeconomic fundamentals, such as a more durable shift in the growth prospects of the world economy, or whether increased volatility might be related to changes in financial market functioning and trading behaviour, for instance due to changes in the regulatory environment, with an impact on market liquidity and the role of banks as market-makers.",
        "Broad agreement was expressed with Mr Praet’s policy considerations, namely the need to find the right balance between recognising increased downside risks in the light of recent developments and new sources of uncertainty, while avoiding drawing premature conclusions regarding a possible longer-lasting impact on the euro area outlook and policy implications.",
        "In line with this overall assessment it was recalled, on the one hand, that the ECB’s monetary policy remained, overall, accommodative and provided support to the economic recovery and a gradual increase in inflation.",
        "It was stressed that the recent weakness in the growth momentum and the renewed risks to the inflation outlook were mainly related to external factors, which were outside the control of monetary policy but whose effects were likely buffered by the monetary policy measures in place.",
        "Additionally, since the decision to embark on a monetary easing programme at the beginning of the year, the euro area economy appeared to have evolved on a firmer footing, driven by domestic forces and with a modest cyclical recovery set to continue.",
        "Accordingly, deflation risks had diminished compared with the beginning of the year and more patience was needed to see inflation pick up more strongly, while money and credit growth already provided evidence of the impact of the monetary policy measures.",
        "Also in line with the overall assessment it was recalled, on the other hand, that financial conditions had tightened, which was evident from higher real interest rates, lower equity prices and a stronger euro exchange rate.",
        "Inflation expectations had also recently declined, despite the significant monetary easing in place.",
        "Moreover, it appeared that the liquidity injected through the Eurosystem’s policy measures had not been distributed evenly across the euro area and was feeding only very slowly into higher demand and activity.",
        "Against this background, there was a need to monitor closely all relevant incoming information with respect to potential implications for the monetary policy stance and for the outlook for price stability.",
        "Particular attention needed to be paid to the risks stemming from the external environment and possible signs of emerging second-round effects in the context of a pronounced and lasting fall in oil prices.",
        "While, overall, there was a need to await greater clarity as regards the medium-term implications of recent events, there was broad agreement that downside risks to the outlook for inflation had increased.",
        "Therefore, it was important to communicate the Governing Council’s willingness and ability to act, if needed, emphasising the flexibility embedded in the design of the APP in terms of its size, composition and duration.",
        "At the same time, it had to be affirmed that the APP would be implemented in full and would run until the end of September 2016, and beyond, if necessary, to ensure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "It was also felt that confidence should be placed in the effectiveness of the existing monetary policy measures, which required time to pass through to the euro area economy.",
        "It needed to be stressed, in this context, that the APP stood at only one-third of the trajectory that had been set out by the Governing Council, implying that a substantial degree of accommodation was still in the pipeline.",
        "Finally, a call was made to strengthen communication on the need for other policy areas to contribute decisively to supporting the euro area recovery with appropriate measures.",
        "In particular in the current environment, other policy areas besides monetary policy should stand ready to buffer possible external shocks to the euro area economy.",
        "Accordingly, it was considered important that fiscal policies should support the economic recovery while remaining in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.",
        "Moreover, further product and labour market reforms, and particularly actions to improve the business environment, including an adequate public infrastructure, were seen as vital to increase productive investment, boost job creation and raise productivity.",
        "The swift and effective implementation of such reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, would not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but would also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes and accelerate the benefits of reforms, thereby making the euro area more resilient to global shocks.",
        "As regards implementation aspects of the APP, members generally concurred with Mr Cœuré that sufficient experience in implementing the PSPP had been gained, which allowed an upward adjustment of the issue share limit in the context of the pre-announced review of this limit after the first six months of purchases.",
        "Increasing the issue share limit to 33% was seen to reduce implementation risks in the future and to permit purchases in line with the principle of market neutrality.",
        "At the same time, there was agreement that an increased issue share limit should not lead to a blocking minority of the Eurosystem in the event of a debt restructuring event.",
        "In this context it was noted that some uncertainty remained about the applicable threshold and the prevailing debt restructuring mechanism.",
        "It was highlighted that while at present there appeared to be no specific bottlenecks in the sourcing of bonds, it was generally regarded as important to act pre-emptively by adjusting the issue share limit in a timely and forward-looking fashion.",
        "Lifting the issue share limit at the present time, reflecting a technical adjustment in the PSPP parameters, was seen to contribute best to the continued smooth implementation of the APP, supporting the effectiveness of the programme as announced in January, and would also underline that the APP parameters could be flexibly adjusted.",
        "Taking into account the views expressed by the Governing Council, the President concluded that it remained premature to judge whether recent developments would have a lasting impact on the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "Accordingly, close monitoring of all relevant information was warranted.",
        "At the same time, the Governing Council remained willing and able to act, if necessary, by using all available tools within its mandate, including the flexibility of its asset purchase programmes in terms of adjusting their size, composition and duration.",
        "There was also wide agreement for stressing that the monthly asset purchases of €60 billion would be fully implemented until the end of September 2016, and beyond, if necessary, and, in any case, until a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, consistent with the Governing Council’s aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, was visible.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members and on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.20% respectively.",
        "Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council furthermore decided to increase the issue share limit from the initial limit of 25% to 33%, subject to a case-by-case verification that this would not create a situation whereby the Eurosystem would have blocking minority power, in which case the issue share limit would remain at 25%.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed recent financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 4-5 March 2015, the implementation of the ECB’s expanded asset purchase programme (APP) had had a significant impact on euro area financial markets, contributing to further declines in government bond yields, while higher levels of excess liquidity had put downward pressure on euro money market rates.",
        "The euro had continued to depreciate against the US dollar, reaching a low of USD 1.05 per euro.",
        "Since the start of purchases under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) on 9 March, sovereign bond yields had declined further, reaching new historical lows in almost all euro area jurisdictions, the impact being strongest at the longer end of the yield curve.",
        "However, over the course of the month, yields in some jurisdictions had partly reversed the earlier declines that had immediately followed the start of the programme.",
        "Yield curves had remained lower and flatter than on 4 March, i.e.",
        "just before the announcement of the details on PSPP implementation.",
        "The downward shift was even more apparent when comparing prevailing yield curves with those observed immediately before the announcement of the APP on 22 January.",
        "Daily purchases of securities under the PSPP had been around €3.2 billion on average.",
        "For the APP overall, the announced volume of €60 billion per month had been achieved in the first month of the programme’s implementation.",
        "The concerns of some market participants that the ECB would have difficulty meeting purchase targets had thus far not materialised.",
        "Such concerns were based on the presumption that the ECB would at some stage exhaust the supply from price-elastic sellers and on the expectation that the yield on an increasing number of bonds would fall below the ECB’s deposit facility rate.",
        "However, these issues did not seem to be pressing at this stage.",
        "During the first month of implementation, bond market conditions had been quite favourable and market liquidity had also remained good in most jurisdictions, as illustrated by the ready availability of bonds and transactions generally being priced at mid-price.",
        "Purchases of agency and supranational bonds had been conducted without major difficulty.",
        "However, implementation had proved to be more challenging than with government bonds because market liquidity in these bonds had already been thinner before the start of the programme.",
        "The announcement of the details of the securities lending programme on 1 April had been positively received by market participants.",
        "At the same time, some commentators saw a need to streamline the various avenues for securities lending and to move towards greater harmonisation in the modalities applied by the Eurosystem’s central banks.",
        "The performance of equity markets had been exceptionally strong.",
        "Since the monetary policy meeting of 4-5 March, total returns on the Euro Stoxx 50 and the Euro Stoxx Banks equity indices had been 7.5% and 10% respectively, which was much higher than the total returns on the sovereign bond markets.",
        "This strong reaction by the equity markets had, in the view of market participants, been driven by the decreasing returns on bond investments, and investors had clearly shifted from bonds to equities.",
        "The strength of the performance of bank stocks had been attributed by some market analysts to an increase in the valuation of the banks’ sovereign bond holdings.",
        "In the corporate bond market, price gains had been significantly lower than those of sovereign bonds when comparing the respective Markit iBoxx indices, with the sovereign index up by 1.6% and the non-financial corporate index up by 0.3%.",
        "Euro-denominated issuance outside the euro area by non-resident firms had increased.",
        "Foreign companies had benefited from a substantial funding advantage when issuing in euro and swapping back into US dollars, instead of issuing directly in US dollars, thus expanding the role of the euro as a funding currency.",
        "Issuance had been concentrated on longer-term maturities, which was consistent with the flattening of the yield curve for corporate bonds.",
        "Regarding the other constituent programmes of the APP, settled ABS purchases had reached €1.2 billion for March and cumulative purchases stood at €4.6 billion under the ABSPP at the end of March.",
        "The Eurosystem had participated in four primary market issuances and also in some retained deals.",
        "ABS issuance had been picking up, in line with its usual seasonal pattern and, based on this pattern, an increase in ABS issuance was expected in the second quarter of the year.",
        "Covered bond purchases had been €12.4 billion in March, also supported by participation in a number of primary issuances.",
        "Cumulative purchases under the programme amounted to €63.6 billion at the end of March, with primary market issuance accounting for 18.9%.",
        "Given the traditionally slow second quarter in primary market issuance in the covered bond market, such strong issuance and purchases might not be observed in subsequent weeks.",
        "Turning to the money markets and liquidity, the level of excess liquidity had increased since the start of the APP by over €100 billion to stand at €247 billion on 7 April.",
        "This was due to the combined impact of the PSPP and the settlement of the third targeted longer-term refinancing operation.",
        "A tentative analysis of excess liquidity holdings by individual counterparties suggested that excess liquidity had thus far continued to flow to the large international banks located in a few euro area jurisdictions.",
        "Money market rates, both secured and unsecured, had continued to decline.",
        "The three-month EURIBOR had declined to a new all-time low of 0.8 basis point on 14 April, while three-month EURIBOR futures-implied rates were being quoted at slightly negative levels for EURIBOR futures contracts as of June 2015.",
        "The EONIA was experiencing some downward rigidity, with the average standing at -5.6 basis points in the second reserve maintenance period, which was lower than at the end of 2014 but still significantly above the deposit facility rate.",
        "The EONIA forward rate for the end of 2015 was set at -15 basis points.",
        "It was possible that a deposit rate cut – albeit minor – was still priced in, as suggested by the negative tail of option-implied densities.",
        "In the foreign exchange market, the euro had reached a low of USD 1.05 per euro after the start of the APP, thus depreciating by 25% since May 2014.",
        "According to some market participants, this move had been underpinned by continued net outflows from euro area government bond markets, which had accelerated with the decline in sovereign bond yields.",
        "The effect of these outflows on the euro’s exchange rate had been somewhat mitigated by equity inflows from non-euro area investors.",
        "In January 2015, the net combined bond and equity flows to and from the euro area as reported in the balance of payments had been positive for the first time since June 2014, since equity inflows to the euro area had exceeded bond outflows.",
        "Anecdotal evidence suggested that equity inflows had gathered momentum in February and March, which was consistent with the rise in euro area equity issuance observed in the first quarter.",
        "In the view of market participants, the impact of capital flows on the exchange rate had been mitigated by the hedging strategies of investors.",
        "Recent trends in foreign exchange hedging behaviour suggested that the share of non-euro investors hedging their portfolios had increased, which reduced the impact of portfolio inflows on the exchange rate.",
        "With regard to international developments, the release of the Federal Open Market Committee’s statement on 18 March had had a strong impact on global financial markets.",
        "The Committee had lowered its projections for GDP growth and core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation, as well as its expectations for the appropriate pace and magnitude of monetary policy tightening, as reflected by the midpoints of target ranges or the target level for the federal funds rate.",
        "The release of unexpectedly weak non-farm payroll data on 3 April 2015 had further increased the expectation that a rate hike would come later in 2015, even though a hike in June was still not completely ruled out by market participants.",
        "Intraday volatility in the foreign exchange market had been exceptionally high on 18 March 2015.",
        "The euro’s exchange rate against the US dollar climbed from USD 1.06 to USD 1.10 within a few hours, resulting in an overall intraday move of around 4.4%, the second largest intraday move since the creation of the euro.",
        "The only bigger move in the USD/EUR exchange rate had taken place on 22 September 2000, when the ECB intervened in the foreign exchange market.",
        "According to some analysts, the March move had been amplified by thin liquidity – as it occurred just after the close of the New York session, when the market volume is usually at its lowest over the daily cycle – and by the unwinding of very large non-commercial short euro positions.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had increased further in March, pointing to sustained real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2015.",
        "However, the global recovery was expected to remain gradual and uneven across regions, with survey indicators of output standing above long-term averages in advanced economies and well below in a number of emerging market economies.",
        "Global trade had recently also shown signs of softening.",
        "World merchandise trade had plunged in January, driven mainly by declining import volumes in emerging market economies.",
        "Meanwhile, the pace of growth in imports had improved among advanced economies.",
        "The global PMI for new export orders had declined slightly in March 2015, indicating stable momentum in global trade.",
        "Annual OECD CPI inflation had remained subdued and had stood at 0.6% in February.",
        "Excluding food and energy, it was 1.7%.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s March monetary policy meeting, the price of Brent crude oil had decreased by about 7% to stand at around USD 57 per barrel on 13 April, although it remained more than 20% above its mid-January lows.",
        "Non-energy commodity prices had declined slightly by 3.5%, mainly on account of lower food prices.",
        "The euro had depreciated by 5.7% against the US dollar and by 4.3% in nominal effective terms.",
        "Euro area real GDP growth had been confirmed at 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2014, with a positive contribution from domestic demand and net exports partly offset by a negative contribution from inventories.",
        "Both private consumption and total investment rose by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the last quarter of the year, with investment driven by construction.",
        "For 2014 as a whole, real GDP had grown by 0.9%, having contracted by 0.5% in 2013.",
        "The euro area economy had gained further momentum at the beginning of 2015.",
        "More specifically, both the composite output PMI and the European Commission’s economic sentiment indicator had improved between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015.",
        "Both indicators had stood, in the first quarter of 2015, above their respective long-term averages.",
        "In February 2015, industrial production (excluding construction) had increased by 1.1%, month on month, and, on average, in January and February the index had stood 0.7% above its average level in the fourth quarter of 2014.",
        "Private consumption dynamics appeared to have held up.",
        "The combined indicator of retail sales and new passenger car registrations for January and February stood, on average, almost 2% above its average level for the last quarter of 2014.",
        "Moreover, consumer confidence had risen further in March to levels not seen since the summer of 2007.",
        "As regards labour markets, employment had risen by 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the last quarter of 2014, while the unemployment rate had declined further, by 0.1 percentage point, to 11.3% in February 2015.",
        "Available survey data pointed to continued moderate employment growth in the first quarter of 2015.",
        "While output had grown in recent quarters and the unemployment rate had declined from its peak in 2013, there was still considerable slack in the economy.",
        "According to available estimates, the negative output gap was as large as in 2009.",
        "Although the output gap was expected to close and potential growth to pick up in the coming years, the loss in actual and potential output owing to the crisis and to structural impediments to growth was likely to remain substantial in the medium term.",
        "Turning to prices, there were signs that the downward trend in euro area headline inflation had recently come to a halt.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation had recovered in March to ‑0.1%, from -0.3% in February and -0.6% in January.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food had stood at 0.6% in March, after 0.7% in February and 0.6% in January.",
        "A similar pattern in inflation dynamics was also becoming visible in PMI survey data on input and output prices and European Commission survey data on selling price expectations.",
        "In addition, a recovery of price pressures along the pricing chain, such as those due to producer prices, was likely to materialise.",
        "Selling price expectations in the retail sector had likewise been improving in almost all the large euro area economies.",
        "Annual growth in compensation per employee had increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2014.",
        "Second-round effects from the past oil price decline were assessed to be limited and, looking ahead, should have become less likely with the set of monetary policy measures in place.",
        "Also, in view of the recent improvement in euro area households’ willingness to make major purchases, there was no evidence that the protracted disinflationary process and the low and negative inflation rates of past months had led to a postponement of expenditure in the expectation of lower prices.",
        "Regarding inflation expectations, the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the second quarter of 2015 indicated that the expected five-year-ahead inflation rate stood at 1.84%, after 1.77% in the previous survey.",
        "At the same time, longer-term market-based inflation expectations in the euro area had recovered from their low mid-January levels.",
        "For instance, on 13 April the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead stood at 1.7%, after a trough of around 1.5% in mid-January.",
        "Shorter-term market-based measures had also increased since mid-January, more markedly so in the weeks leading up to the present meeting.",
        "Turning to monetary and financial conditions, nominal yields had declined further to historically low levels.",
        "This had also been the case for corporate bond spreads over the past few months in the majority of euro area countries and for the overall nominal cost of external financing for euro area non-financial corporations (NFCs).",
        "Bank lending rates remained on a declining trend amid monthly volatility.",
        "The composite bank lending rates for euro area NFCs had declined to 2.3% in February, after 2.8% in June 2014.",
        "Bank lending rates on loans to households for house purchase stood at just under 2.4%, down from 2.9% in June 2014.",
        "As regards money and loan dynamics, the latest data for February confirmed the gradual recovery from low levels.",
        "Annual M3 growth had risen to 4.0% in February, after 3.7% in January, mostly driven by M1.",
        "The annual growth rate of M1 had picked up further and had stood at 9.1% in February, after 8.9% in January, mainly due to significant flows into overnight deposits.",
        "The recovery in loan dynamics had also continued.",
        "The annual rate of change in loans to NFCs originated by monetary financial institutions (MFIs), adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, had recovered to -0.4% in February, after -0.9% in January.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households originated by MFIs, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, had increased marginally to 1.0%, after 0.9% in January.",
        "In the same vein, the April 2015 bank lending survey pointed to improving loan supply and demand conditions.",
        "Turning to other M3 counterparts, the reduction in net external inflows had continued in February 2015.",
        "The net external asset position of the euro area MFI sector had increased further over the twelve months to February, while longer-term MFI liabilities, including capital and reserves, had continued to decline, falling by 2.6% in February.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, while the 2014 outcomes had been slightly better than projected, the average euro area fiscal stance was expected to remain broadly neutral.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet noted that the euro area economy had gained further momentum since the end of 2014, with increasing signs that the economic recovery would broaden and strengthen gradually – consistent with what had been expected in the March 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area.",
        "Moreover, risks surrounding the economic outlook, while remaining on the downside, had become more balanced.",
        "The downward trend in headline inflation also appeared to have come to a halt and most measures of inflation expectations had recovered from their troughs in mid-January.",
        "The monetary policy decisions taken by the Governing Council in January had made a strong contribution in confronting the risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation.",
        "Cross-checking the results of the economic analysis with the evidence from the monetary analysis, money and credit dynamics had strengthened further in a context of improving financial conditions and were also consistent with the outlook of a gradual recovery in euro area growth and inflation.",
        "While there was a case for guarded optimism on the short to medium-term outlook for the euro area economy, taking into account initial evidence that the Governing Council’s monetary policy measures were proving effective, it was important to remain cautious, also considering that it was only one month into the expanded APP and that the outlook for growth and inflation was conditional on the full implementation of all the monetary policy measures that had been decided.",
        "Moreover, the economic recovery still faced headwinds, related to necessary balance sheet adjustments in various sectors of the economy and, as yet, insufficient structural reforms to improve the business environment and investment activity.",
        "Structural reforms were needed to boost euro area potential output, which monetary policy by itself could not achieve.",
        "It was therefore essential that the current accommodative monetary policy stance found its natural complement in the right set of structural reform policies in order to support the cyclical recovery and ensure that it also translated into higher potential output growth and lower structural unemployment.",
        "The focus would need to be placed on structural reform measures which would not only help to lift medium to longer-term growth potential, but could already, in the short term, raise expectations of permanently higher incomes and thereby encourage both households to expand consumption and firms to increase investment.",
        "Assessing the policy options, Mr Praet deemed that the information that had become available since the previous monetary policy meeting on 4-5 March did not give grounds to reconsider the monetary policy stance or any of the APP parameters.",
        "Accordingly, the focus should continue to be on the firm implementation of the announced measures.",
        "To this end, the Governing Council needed to reconfirm that the APP purchases were intended to be carried out until the end of September 2016 – and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that was consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "The Governing Council should also stress that the implementation of asset purchases was proceeding smoothly, with volumes in line with the announced figure of €60 billion of securities per month, as had been presented by Mr Cœuré.",
        "In evaluating whether such a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation was materialising, the Governing Council would follow its monetary policy strategy and concentrate on trends in inflation, looking through unexpected outcomes in measured inflation in either direction if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "Accordingly, it would continue to assess the outlook on the basis of various tools and indicators of realised and expected inflation, and not mechanically adjust its stance in response to any isolated macroeconomic indicator.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, the members of the Governing Council concurred with the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The latest data and survey evidence confirmed that economic growth had gained further momentum.",
        "Looking ahead, improved financial conditions, the lower price of oil and the depreciation of the euro were seen to be supportive of a gradual broadening and strengthening of the recovery, while further balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of structural reforms were expected to dampen its pace.",
        "Several comments were made on the relationship between the non-standard monetary policy measures adopted by the Governing Council and the outlook for economic activity, with broad agreement prevailing that these measures played an important role in supporting economic growth by lowering borrowing costs, by working through confidence and financial channels and via the impact on exchange rates.",
        "Looking ahead, members recalled that a sustained pick-up in growth, as had been projected in the March 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, was predicated on the full implementation of all the monetary policy measures in place.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that caution was warranted not to overrate the impact of monetary policy measures on economic activity, given the difficulties in differentiating the monetary policy impact from the effect of other variables in the current favourable environment.",
        "A number of considerations were put forward on the outlook for individual demand components.",
        "Consumption was expected to be the main driver of domestic demand, reflecting positive developments in real disposable income.",
        "At the same time, some caution was expressed that consumption growth could lose momentum, also in view of the continued need for balance sheet repair by households and banks in some parts of the euro area.",
        "A recovery in investment was seen as crucial for ensuring a sustained improvement in overall economic growth.",
        "While a number of conditions appeared to be in place for a pick-up in private investment, most notably favourable financing conditions for debt and equity, other indicators such as profit developments and the business climate were still mixed and did not, for the time being, provide support for a substantial acceleration in investment growth.",
        "Finally, it was noted that net exports had provided considerable support to growth, but it remained to be seen whether this would continue in the future, given the generally weak outlook for global trade and the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties.",
        "With respect to the analysis of the economic outlook, it was seen as useful to disentangle developments in actual and potential output growth in order to clarify the respective roles of demand-side and supply-side policies.",
        "The cyclical nature of the projected recovery was emphasised, with potential growth remaining low, curtailing the scope for a sustained recovery.",
        "In particular, the key role of investment in supporting demand and enhancing productive capacity was recalled.",
        "Some interrelationship was highlighted between investment and potential growth, as current investment choices largely depended on potential growth prospects, while the potential growth profile was in turn shaped by current investment demand.",
        "In this context, it was also underlined that estimates of potential growth and the output gap were surrounded by substantial measurement uncertainties.",
        "Overall, members considered that the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area, while remaining on the downside, had become more balanced as a result of the recent monetary policy decisions, the past decline in oil prices and the depreciation of the euro.",
        "Downside risks to growth were seen to stem from the external environment, as geopolitical risks remained high in several neighbouring regions of the EU.",
        "Furthermore, financial turbulence emanating from political developments and stalling programme negotiations in Greece was considered to be a source of downside risks.",
        "An additional downside risk related to potential further deleveraging in a number of sectors of the economy, including the banking sector and non-financial private sectors in some parts of the euro area.",
        "Complacency about structural reforms and sound public finances constituted a further downside risk to the outlook for economic activity.",
        "Governments currently benefited from a benign environment of a strengthening economic recovery, low interest rates and favourable financing conditions.",
        "It was stressed that this benign environment and the resulting windfall gains should be used to step up reforms decisively at both the EU and national levels.",
        "Members emphasised that the risk of insufficient reform progress was particularly pronounced with regard to structural policies, which were hampered by resistance to change.",
        "In the absence of structural reforms, there were serious risks that potential output growth would remain low and investment demand would not pick up as strongly as expected.",
        "Measures to enhance potential output growth were considered essential, not least in view of the declining working-age population in the euro area and the ensuing funding difficulties for pension systems, which could only be addressed through determined measures to lift total factor productivity.",
        "Furthermore, a lack of structural reforms could dampen not only potential growth but also actual economic growth in the euro area.",
        "In that context, it was recalled that, while the long-term demand effects of structural reforms were undisputedly positive and should be seen as the main motivation for such reforms, the short-term effects were less clear and largely depended on the nature of the policy measures taken.",
        "For instance, while reforms of judicial systems would most likely yield immediate benefits, this was less obvious in the case of labour market reforms, as increased flexibility in labour markets could initially depress demand, a point that had been underlined in work undertaken by the OECD.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that labour and product market reforms could have a positive short-run effect on demand, as expectations of rising permanent income could help bring forward both investment and consumption demand and higher potential output could reduce concerns about debt sustainability, thereby generating fiscal space and mitigating the incentive for consumers to save in anticipation of future tax liabilities.",
        "Overall, it was seen as important to prioritise those structural reforms with a frontloaded positive impact on growth.",
        "Structural reforms were seen as essential to complement the monetary policy actions of the ECB.",
        "It was therefore important to stress that monetary policy could not replace structural reforms.",
        "In addition, there was some risk that the lower bound to monetary policy rates could be invoked as an excuse to delay structural reforms in an environment of low inflation.",
        "Some recent academic literature suggested that structural reforms could be contractionary when interest rates were at the zero lower bound, as they could reduce inflation, raise real interest rates and thus depress domestic demand.",
        "However, these research findings were explicitly predicated on the absence of an appropriate monetary stimulus and were hence not currently applicable to the euro area, following the non-standard monetary policy measures put in place by the Governing Council, which provided additional monetary accommodation supporting inflation expectations and low real interest rates.",
        "Turning to fiscal policy, it was recalled that fiscal discipline remained essential in view of the high public debt levels and the need to recreate fiscal space as a buffer for future shocks.",
        "Concerns were expressed that governments might not put windfall gains from favourable financing conditions to productive use and would unduly relax fiscal discipline, thereby negatively affecting the sustainability of public finances.",
        "With regard to price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the outlook presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Headline HICP inflation appeared to have bottomed out, as the annual rate of change had been -0.1% in March 2015, up from -0.3% in February and -0.6% in January.",
        "Reference was also made to the latest evidence on the recovery of survey and market-based inflation expectations.",
        "Overall, it was noted that the Governing Council’s monetary policy measures had contributed to the improved outlook for inflation.",
        "While the immediate impact of the measures appeared to be less strong on the nominal side than on the real side, confidence was expressed that the full implementation of the monetary policy measures would help bring price developments further back into line with the Governing Council’s aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term and would dispel concerns about downside risks to price stability.",
        "It was also noted that, in any event, there appeared to be no signs of deflationary behaviour among consumers, as consumption of durable goods, which typically would be deferred in a deflationary environment, had been growing strongly over recent quarters.",
        "In their assessment of the risks surrounding the inflation outlook, members referred to the pass-through of the monetary policy measures, as well as geopolitical, exchange rate and energy price developments.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction that money and loan dynamics had strengthened further.",
        "Growth in broad money continued to be supported by its most liquid components.",
        "Loan dynamics had gradually improved further, confirming the turnaround in loan dynamics that had been under way since the first half of 2014.",
        "This appeared to be due to improvements in both credit demand and supply, reflecting, in particular, banks’ improved capital positions and the monetary policy measures in place.",
        "Despite these improvements, the dynamics of loans to non-financial corporations had remained subdued and uneven across euro area countries.",
        "This reflected the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, which was as yet incomplete.",
        "It was highlighted that borrowing conditions for firms and households had improved further since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, which was seen as a sign of receding impairments in the credit channel of monetary policy, permitting the effective transmission of the policy measures taken by the Governing Council.",
        "Bank lending rates for non-financial corporations and households had continued their declining trend, despite some monthly volatility, thereby supporting credit demand.",
        "This was consistent with the evidence from the April 2015 bank lending survey, which showed a further net easing in credit standards and credit terms and conditions.",
        "Nonetheless, it was cautioned that lending rates had not fallen as much as might have been expected given the current level of policy rates, which was possibly related to the continued need for adjustments in banks’ balance sheets in some parts of the euro area.",
        "The prospective impact of the APP on monetary developments was seen to depend to a large extent on the sector and the geographical location of the ultimate sellers from which the Eurosystem acquired the assets, as well as on the portfolio rebalancing following the asset sale.",
        "There was agreement to carefully monitor the liquidity flows arising from the APP and their implications for monetary developments going forward, also with regard to the assessment of inflationary pressures.",
        "However, such pressures were seen to be likely to arise only gradually via this channel.",
        "A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis was seen to confirm the need to implement firmly the Governing Council’s recent decisions.",
        "The full implementation of all the monetary policy measures adopted would support further improvements in credit flows, provide the necessary support to the euro area recovery and bring inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members generally shared the assessment that a significant number of positive effects were visible from the expanded APP, in conjunction with the package of measures decided in June-September 2014 – namely an easing in financial market conditions and in the cost of external finance for the private sectors.",
        "Moreover, most recent data and survey evidence suggested that the euro area economy had gained further momentum since the end of 2014, that there were signs of an improvement in inflation dynamics and that money and credit were firming.",
        "This provided support for a scenario of a gradual broadening and deepening of the recovery and a return of inflation rates towards 2%.",
        "It was recalled, however, that such a scenario was predicated on the full implementation of all monetary policy measures taken by the Governing Council since mid-2014.",
        "In greater detail, encouraging evidence was seen with regard to the effectiveness of the monetary policy measures in place.",
        "In particular, their impact on financial markets was clearly visible, as highlighted by Mr Cœuré in his introduction.",
        "Financial market conditions and the cost of external finance for the private sector had eased considerably over the past few months, reflecting the transmission of the monetary policy measures through the financial intermediation chain, particularly to borrowing costs for households and firms.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that the impact on the real economy and inflation required more time to unfold and that the PSPP had been running for just over one month.",
        "The broad-based improvement in financial conditions for the time being confirmed that the monetary policy measures were working in the intended direction, lending support for the economic recovery to proceed in line with the outlook contained in the March ECB staff projections.",
        "It was also noted that market-based measures of inflation expectations had recovered from the low levels observed in mid-January 2015, even though further improvements should materialise.",
        "Moreover, it appeared that the decisive policy action by the ECB had dispelled market fears of deflation, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the price of deflation protection.",
        "Against this background, members generally agreed that a steady hand and the firm implementation of the measures decided in January 2015 would best serve to support the economic recovery and a return of inflation towards 2%.",
        "There was hence no need to consider any change in the monetary policy stance at present or to reconsider any of the parameters of the PSPP decided on 22 January 2015.",
        "This also applied to the understanding that policy rates had reached their effective lower bound, as had been discussed and affirmed on previous occasions.",
        "It was important to implement firmly the ECB’s expanded APP as announced in order to reap its full effects in terms of euro area output and inflation developments.",
        "Indeed, the positive economic outlook for the euro area, as embedded in the March ECB staff projections, depended on the full implementation of the programme and was still subject to a number of downside risks and uncertainties.",
        "There was wide agreement that the expanded APP had been progressing smoothly since the start of the public sector securities purchases on 9 March 2015, with purchase volumes in line with the announced monthly figure of €60 billion.",
        "Liquidity was generally ample across markets and jurisdictions, while market concerns about scarcity in some market segments appeared to be overstated.",
        "It was underlined that the design of the programme provided sufficient flexibility for it to be adapted if circumstances were to change and should the need arise.",
        "In any case, the implementation aspects of the programme and its various parts would be closely monitored, ensuring the APP’s continued smooth functioning and a consistent implementation across the Eurosystem.",
        "Members also raised a few issues of a more structural nature and with more medium to longer-term implications for future reflection.",
        "First, given the impact of the purchases under the APP on the size and composition of the Eurosystem balance sheet, it was suggested to study further the risk implications emanating from the evolution of the balance sheet, including possible risk-mitigating measures, such as additional risk provisioning, which had already been undertaken by some national central banks.",
        "Second, it was felt that potential financial stability implications of the low interest rate environment and recent increases in asset prices warranted some attention by the relevant bodies.",
        "An analysis of possibly more fundamental changes in the structure and functioning of financial intermediation was also seen as needed.",
        "Fourth, it was felt that the distributional consequences of asset purchases merited consideration, in view of the impact of asset prices on wealth and income distributions.",
        "While this would not have a direct bearing on monetary policy in the euro area, such an analysis would help to foster the understanding of and communication on the transmission of non-standard monetary policy measures and would address related issues which had become the subject of public and academic debate.",
        "Moreover, additional efforts could be made to explain to the public that measures taken to support the functioning of the banking sector and the financial markets at times of stress ultimately served to safeguard the real economy.",
        "Overall, members agreed that emphasis needed to be placed on a steady course of monetary policy with a focus on the firm implementation of the Governing Council’s recent monetary policy decisions.",
        "The Governing Council therefore reaffirmed its intention to conduct purchases until the end of September 2016 and, in any case, until a sustained adjustment was visible in the path of inflation consistent with the Governing Council’s aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "It was also stressed that, when carrying out its assessment, the Governing Council would follow its monetary policy strategy and concentrate on trends in inflation, looking through unexpected outcomes in measured inflation in either direction if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "At the same time, a strong signal needed to be sent to euro area governments urging them to press ahead with structural reforms and to take measures to improve the business environment.",
        "Only with such complementary action could the full benefits of the monetary policy measures be reaped.",
        "Swift and effective implementation of appropriate reforms in the euro area would not only lead to higher sustainable growth in the medium to long term but also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes and encourage households to expand consumption and firms to increase investment already in the near term.",
        "In addition, fiscal policies should support the economic recovery while remaining in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.",
        "With regard to interest rates, taking into account the foregoing and on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.20% respectively.",
        "With regard to the eligibility of agency issuers for the PSPP, the Governing Council decided on a list of additional eligible agencies located in the euro area, which would apply from 16 April 2015 for purchases under the PSPP.",
        "The list would be published on 15 April on the ECB’s website.",
        "The Governing Council clarified that the full list may be amended further on the basis of monetary policy considerations and duly reflecting risk management issues.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed recent financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 2-3 June 2015, financial markets had again been characterised by volatility, in part driven by uncertainty related to developments in Greece.",
        "The Eurosystem nevertheless continued to smoothly execute the expanded asset purchase programme (APP), in line with the announced moderate frontloading of purchases.",
        "Starting with developments in the euro area bond markets, the period around early June 2015 had been characterised by a second sell-off, following the earlier episode from late April to mid-May.",
        "Between 1 June and 10 June the yields on 30-year German government bonds had risen by 64 basis points, to 1.79%, while those on ten-year benchmark bonds had risen by 52 basis points, to 1.06%, and on 10 June 2015 stood at their highest level since September 2014.",
        "The largest yield changes had taken place at longer maturities, leading to a further steepening of the yield curve, whereas the short end of the curve remained well anchored.",
        "The bond yields of several other euro area countries had also been affected, albeit to a lesser extent.",
        "Over the same period the yields on the ten-year and 30-year Spanish, Italian and Portuguese government bonds had risen by 44 basis points on average, leading to a spread compression of around 20 basis points on 30-year bonds.",
        "According to market participants, the two sell-off episodes had been partly the result of an overvaluation of euro area government bonds, when assessed against traditional valuation measures.",
        "In addition, one‑way market positioning related to the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) and improvements in the euro area macroeconomic and inflation outlook might have also contributed.",
        "The increased volatility, in turn, contributed to some forced selling by risk-constrained investors.",
        "Furthermore, the trough that euro area 10-year bond yields reached earlier in the year had coincided with a significant increase in bond issuance, as both non-financial corporations (NFCs) and governments had made use of the favourable environment for long-term funding.",
        "Despite volatile market conditions, the Eurosystem had continued to smoothly implement a moderate frontloading of purchases and, as a result, Eurosystem APP holdings had risen by €63.2 billion in June, following a similar increase in May.",
        "This frontloading had to be seen against the background of the usual decline in market activity during the holiday seasons, particularly in August and December, which would see, as stated on previous occasions, a corresponding reduction in asset purchases.",
        "The universe of eligible securities under the PSPP was enlarged with effect from 2 July 2015, with the addition of 13 public sector entities to the list of eligible agencies.",
        "Furthermore, also with effect from 2 July, following the positive outcome of the review by the Board of Directors of the European Stability Mechanism, Cypriot government bonds had become eligible for PSPP purchases, in line with the ECB’s Decision of 4 March 2015 on a secondary markets public sector asset purchase programme (ECB/2015/10).",
        "Purchases under the third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3) had amounted to €10.2 billion in June and the book value of CBPP3 holdings stood at around €95 billion at the end of June, with primary market purchases amounting to a share of 17.6%.",
        "Portfolio managers had reported that purchases of eligible covered bonds were becoming more challenging.",
        "Several factors had contributed to this situation.",
        "First, euro area covered bond supply had slowed since the end of May and had remained quite low compared with previous years.",
        "Second, the period of volatility had reinforced the status of covered bonds as a safe-haven instrument, which was also consistent with their favourable regulatory treatment, including the no bail-in treatment under the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive.",
        "Covered bonds had thus benefitted from the flight to quality and this had possibly deterred some investors from reducing their covered bond positions in favour of other assets with better relative value.",
        "With regard to purchases of asset-backed securities (ABS), the Eurosystem had bought €1.6 billion in June, bringing the book value of holdings under the ABS purchase programme to €8.8 billion at the end of that month, with 25% purchased in the primary market.",
        "Asset purchases by the Eurosystem had been one of the two main drivers of the increase in excess liquidity in the euro area, with a net injection of €81 billion through monetary policy portfolios since the previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "The second major driver had been the settlement of the fourth targeted longer-term refinancing operation (TLTRO), which had added €74 billion of liquidity on 24 June 2015.",
        "Taking into account all factors, excess liquidity had increased by €100 billion since the monetary policy meeting in early June and currently stood above €400 billion.",
        "In the euro area money market, the decline in interest rates had been limited, despite the large increase in excess liquidity.",
        "The EONIA had averaged -11.8 basis points since the beginning of the current maintenance period, compared with -9.8 basis points in the previous period.",
        "Overall, short-term money market rates had remained broadly stable, unaffected by the re-pricing in bond markets and by the uncertainty related to Greece.",
        "Turning to Greece, the unexpected decision on 27 June 2015 by the Greek Prime Minister to call a referendum and the subsequent “No” vote on 5 July had led to a significant re-pricing of Greek government bonds, notably for shorter maturities.",
        "Subsequently the agreement by the euro area Heads of State and Government on 13 July 2015 was accompanied by a strong rebound in the value of Greek bonds.",
        "Some spillover effects from the events in Greece had been observed in the euro area bond and equity markets, but, overall, contagion to other euro area countries had been limited.",
        "After the agreement on Greece had been reached on 13 July, key financial indicators for the euro area had broadly recovered.",
        "Market analysts commented, however, that the risks had not subsided completely, in view of the significant challenges associated with the negotiation and implementation of a third economic adjustment programme for Greece.",
        "Moreover, in the money markets, there had been no signs of contagion to banks in more vulnerable countries and normal funding conditions had been reported.",
        "Similarly, the forward EURIBOR-OIS spread, a measure of credit risk, had increased only marginally and thereafter had returned to levels close to those prevailing before the announcement of the referendum.",
        "In the foreign exchange market, the value of the euro had remained relatively stable, in nominal effective terms.",
        "Implied volatility had risen only temporarily and there had been no signs of increased tensions in the EUR/USD basis swap.",
        "Short positions in the euro had remained small, with market participants reporting limited appetite for positioning by hedge funds.",
        "Developments in equity markets had been mainly dominated by the negotiations with Greece.",
        "European stocks had seen the largest moves, falling sharply after the breakdown of negotiations and the referendum, but recovering the losses after an agreement on Greece was reached on 13 July.",
        "US and Asian stocks had shown a similar pattern to their European counterparts, including with respect to volatility.",
        "Finally, with regard to developments in international markets, following the agreement on Greece on 13 July the focus had seemed to be shifting towards China and the United States.",
        "In China, the Shanghai Composite Index had declined by more than 20% since 12 June 2015, after having risen by more than 150% in less than a year, accompanied by growing concerns about the valuation of the Chinese equity markets.",
        "The People’s Bank of China had reacted to this decline by cutting benchmark interest rates and decreasing reserve requirements.",
        "Developments in Chinese financial markets had reportedly exerted some pressure on commodity prices.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had declined since 1 June, falling by more than 12% at the trough.",
        "In market analysts’ view, the greater odds of a successful deal in the nuclear negotiations with Iran, as well as the International Energy Agency’s report on the oversupply of oil, had also contributed to the decline.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Following a slowdown in the pace of economic expansion in early 2015, the latest surveys suggested that the global economy had returned to a modest and uneven recovery path in the second quarter.",
        "While the average global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the second quarter of 2015 had fallen slightly compared with the previous quarter, it remained above the level recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014.",
        "At the same time, quarterly PMIs had declined for major emerging market economies (EMEs).",
        "Global trade momentum had remained weak, with the volume of world imports continuing to decline, falling by 1.1% in three-month-on-three-month terms in April, although at a slower pace than in the first quarter.",
        "This mainly reflected continued weakness in activity in EMEs.",
        "Annual OECD CPI inflation had increased to 0.6% in May, from 0.4% in April, while inflation excluding food and energy had remained unchanged at 1.6% in May.",
        "Since early June Brent crude oil prices had fallen by 9%, to stand at USD 57 per barrel on 14 July, and were 10% lower in euro terms, while a decline could also be observed in metal prices.",
        "As regards exchange rate developments, since the Governing Council’s early June meeting the euro’s exchange rate had remained broadly unchanged.",
        "Turning to the euro area, the latest data had continued to point to an ongoing, broad-based, moderate economic recovery.",
        "Real GDP growth had been confirmed at 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2015.",
        "Domestic demand had continued to be the main driver of output growth, making a contribution of 0.5 percentage point, with some broadening of the recovery being reflected in a pick-up in investment.",
        "In contrast, net exports had made a negative contribution (-0.2 percentage point).",
        "Industrial production excluding construction had declined by 0.4%, month on month, in May and stood 0.2% below its average level in the first quarter, although seasonal and statistical factors could explain part of the decrease.",
        "Conversely, a strong pick-up in the ECB indicator on euro area industrial new orders in April suggested that the dip in new orders in the first quarter could be short-lived and was a positive factor for industrial production in the period ahead.",
        "Survey results available up to June were in line with continued real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2015.",
        "Following declines in April and May, the composite output PMI had risen in June, reflecting developments in manufacturing, as well as in services, and more than recouping the fall in the two previous months.",
        "At the same time, the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) had edged down in June, following two months of stable developments.",
        "Both the PMI and the ESI had improved between the first and the second quarter and remained in June at levels above their respective long-term averages.",
        "Regarding slack in the euro area economy, a range of estimates and indicators showed a large degree of uncertainty while in general pointing to significant levels of slack.",
        "Looking ahead the output gap was expected to close and potential growth to pick up in the coming years.",
        "Consumption should remain the main driver of the recovery in the euro area, with the past falls in oil prices supporting households’ purchasing power.",
        "Real disposable income growth in the euro area as a whole had picked up strongly in the first quarter of 2015, to 2.2%, year on year, and had been broad-based across the largest euro area economies.",
        "However, considerable heterogeneity across countries remained when looking at longer-term real income developments.",
        "Investment had also increasingly become a driver of the recovery.",
        "A further recovery in investment could be expected later on in view of favourable financing conditions and lower energy prices, while net retained earnings as a percentage of value added continued to be high.",
        "Labour markets were still relatively weak, but were improving overall.",
        "Employment had risen further, by 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2015, while unemployment had remained unchanged at 11.1% between April and May.",
        "Available survey data pointed to continued moderate employment growth in the period ahead.",
        "As regards real GDP forecasts, new evidence had become available from the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), with the aggregate probability distributions shifting towards somewhat higher outcomes.",
        "Turning to price developments in the euro area, according to Eurostat, annual HICP inflation had decreased slightly to 0.2% in June, from 0.3% in May.",
        "The decline, which had followed four consecutive months of increases, was essentially due to calendar effects in the services component in May.",
        "For this reason, the HICP excluding food and energy had declined to 0.8% in June, after 0.9% in May, despite a further increase in non-energy industrial goods inflation.",
        "Nonetheless, there was still some uncertainty as to whether the uptick in HICP inflation excluding food and energy from the historical low of 0.6% in April implied a turning point.",
        "In this context, looking at a range of measures of underlying inflation may be helpful, as they aim to look through short-term movements in specific indices and to capture trend developments in inflation.",
        "Reference was made, for example, to a measure based on a dynamic factor model which aimed at capturing the common and persistent component in the inflation rates of individual HICP components.",
        "In addition, a diffusion index was referred to, which showed the share of HICP components that had seen an increase in their annual rate of change over three months.",
        "Moreover, the seasonally adjusted six-month annualised rate of the HICP excluding food and energy could help to shed some light on more persistent developments over the past few months.",
        "Overall, inflation rates based on such measures had increased since the start of the year, but more data was required before it would be safe to conclude that a turning point in inflation developments had been reached.",
        "The latest data on labour costs and profit margins suggested that domestic price pressures had stabilised for the time being.",
        "The annual rate of change of the GDP deflator had increased slightly to 1.0% in the first quarter of 2015, from 0.9% in the previous quarter.",
        "This reflected a higher contribution from unit profits, which was offset by a lower contribution from unit labour costs, as productivity growth had accelerated more strongly than growth in compensation per employee.",
        "Euro area annual wage growth had increased to 1.5% in the first quarter of 2015, from 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2014, when measured in terms of compensation per employee, and to 1.6%, from 1.1%, when measured in terms of hours worked.",
        "The pass-through of exchange rate changes to underlying inflation appeared to be proceeding broadly as expected and was mainly visible in earlier stages of the pricing chain, with import prices for both consumer and intermediate goods increasing strongly in recent months, alongside the depreciation of the euro.",
        "Pipeline price pressures on the domestic side, however, continued to be weak.",
        "Signals of a turnaround in inflationary pressures were also visible in incoming survey data.",
        "Although PMI survey data on input and output prices for June had generally decreased slightly (except for output prices in the manufacturing sector), their levels were higher than at the start of the year, with input prices for both manufacturing and services significantly higher.",
        "Further along the pricing chain, selling price expectations across the main sectors of the euro area economy had continued to recover.",
        "In particular, the percentage balance for services had moved above its long-term average, while the percentage balances for industry and the retail sector remained below their respective long-term averages.",
        "Regarding recent euro area HICP inflation forecasts, the SPF for the third quarter of 2015 had revised its forecast of annual HICP inflation slightly upwards for 2015 and 2016, to 0.2% and 1.3% respectively, while leaving it virtually unchanged for 2017 at 1.6%.",
        "As regards long-term inflation expectations in the euro area, both survey and market-based measures had moved up slightly.",
        "According to the latest SPF, the expected five-year-ahead inflation rate had been revised upwards to 1.86%, after 1.84% in the second quarter.",
        "The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead stood just above 1.8% on 14 July 2015, up from an average level of 1.6% in early January.",
        "Turning to monetary and financial conditions, the EONIA forward curve had steepened notably at medium to longer-term horizons.",
        "Given that market-based measures of inflation expectations had not changed substantially, this was, in turn, reflected in higher real interest rates.",
        "The overall flow of external financing to NFCs in the euro area had increased further in the first quarter of 2015, after recovering in 2014, reflecting positive developments in loans to NFCs originated by monetary financial institutions (MFIs) and by non-MFIs, as well as the resilient net issuance of quoted shares and debt securities by NFCs.",
        "Monthly data showed that market-based financing had clearly moderated in May 2015, while bank lending had continued to edge up.",
        "As a result, the overall flow of external financing to NFCs was expected to have stabilised in the second quarter of 2015.",
        "The composite bank lending rate for NFCs had declined further, by 6 basis points, to 2.24% in May.",
        "The overall nominal cost of external financing for euro area NFCs was estimated to have increased slightly further in June, mainly reflecting the higher cost of equity.",
        "Regarding money and credit developments, the latest data for May had confirmed robust dynamics in monetary growth.",
        "In May the annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 had stood at 5.0% (down from 5.3% in April).",
        "M3 growth had continued to be driven by M1, with annual growth in M1 picking up further in May to stand at 11.2%, after 10.5% in April, reflecting the low opportunity costs of holding the most liquid instruments and also reflecting inflows related to the APP and the TLTROs.",
        "Strong improvements in the cost of bank borrowing for NFCs had been observed since May 2014, before the decision on the ECB’s credit easing package in June 2014.",
        "It had declined by 67 basis points, while the rate on the main refinancing operations had fallen by 20 basis points and the EONIA had declined by 35 basis points over the same period.",
        "The TLTROs had contributed to expanding the volume of excess liquidity.",
        "Total gross take-up in the four TLTROs conducted thus far had amounted to €384 billion and it appeared that they had delivered tangible effects in easing financing conditions for the real economy.",
        "Loan dynamics were recovering, but remained weak.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, had increased slightly to 1.0% in May.",
        "The annual rate of change in loans to NFCs, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, had been marginally positive in May at 0.1%, after -0.1% in April.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, had increased marginally to 1.4%, after 1.3% in April.",
        "The bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2015 showed that the recovery in loans to enterprises was supported by both easing supply conditions and increasing demand.",
        "On the supply side, the net easing of credit standards had continued – although at a slower pace – driven, in particular, by increasing competitive pressures.",
        "The only factor that had contributed to a tightening in standards was risk tolerance.",
        "On the demand side, the considerable improvement was driven mainly by the low level of interest rates.",
        "Fixed investment had also contributed to the increase in demand, further supporting the recovery in loans.",
        "As regards fiscal policies, there were no substantial changes with respect to the situation at the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting in early June.",
        "After a period of sizeable consolidation measures, the euro area fiscal stance, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was expected to remain broadly neutral.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet noted that the data that had become available since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting in early June had broadly confirmed expectations.",
        "Real GDP growth in the euro area was proceeding in line with a broad-based moderate recovery, while downside risks prevailed.",
        "The outlook for price developments over the medium term was also by and large unchanged.",
        "While it was still too early to confirm that a turning point had been reached in underlying inflation, the key drivers of an upturn appeared to be proceeding broadly as projected.",
        "Recent weakness in oil prices had added some renewed downward pressure on headline inflation in the near term, but inflation rates were expected to increase towards the year‑end.",
        "At the same time, medium-term inflation expectations had recovered some of the ground lost since the summer of last year.",
        "Monetary and loan dynamics had continued to recover.",
        "Cross-checking the results of the economic analysis with those of the monetary analysis, the picture remained consistent with the outlook of a gradual increase in inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Overall, the Governing Council’s monetary policy stance remained accommodative.",
        "Notwithstanding recent increases in long-term market interest rates, credit markets had continued to improve, both in terms of prices, when looking at bank lending rates, and in terms of non-price conditions.",
        "It was noteworthy that the range of monetary policy tools available – notably the TLTROs, the APP and the Outright Monetary Transactions – had preserved the accommodative monetary policy stance in an environment which remained difficult and subject to financial market and confidence shocks, thereby supporting the Governing Council’s baseline scenario.",
        "With regard to monetary policy decisions at the current meeting, the medium-term outlook for euro area inflation did not call for a reconsideration of the monetary policy stance, but remained conditional on the full implementation of all the monetary policy measures in place.",
        "In particular, the expanded APP should proceed as communicated, taking into account the slight adjustments that were needed to account for periods of lower market liquidity in August and December.",
        "At the same time, with regard to communication, given the challenging environment, there was a need to continue to signal the readiness of the Governing Council to use all the instruments available within its mandate, if necessary, as already referred to previously in the monetary policy accounts and in the press release of 28 June on emergency liquidity assistance.",
        "Accordingly, close monitoring of developments with potential implications for the monetary policy stance or for the outlook for price stability over the medium term was warranted.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, the members of the Governing Council generally shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area, as presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Incoming data pointed to a continuation of the moderate economic recovery, in line with earlier expectations.",
        "Looking ahead, the recovery was expected to broaden further, as foreseen in the June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, with risks remaining tilted to the downside.",
        "Recent data broadly confirmed the continuation of moderate growth during the second quarter of 2015.",
        "Uncertainties stemming from developments in the Greek programme negotiations and from the deteriorating economic and financial conditions in some EMEs, most notably China, did not appear to have had a discernible impact on euro area economic activity.",
        "This pointed to a certain degree of robustness of the ongoing recovery, as supported by some country-specific developments.",
        "At the same time, there was a continued need for caution as some recent data had been weaker than expected.",
        "In particular, the decline in euro area industrial production in May 2015 – down 0.4% from April – pointed to remaining weaknesses and uncertainties surrounding current economic developments, although it was noted that these data were typically volatile and could have been influenced by seasonal and statistical effects.",
        "Moreover, the data were counterbalanced by strong growth in industrial new orders in April, suggesting a more favourable outlook for industrial production in the months ahead.",
        "Looking ahead, members generally expected a further gradual broadening of the economic recovery in the euro area.",
        "Favourable financial conditions, progress with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, and the recent renewed decline in oil prices – together with the lagged effects from earlier declines – were seen to support domestic demand.",
        "Net exports – supported by improved price competitiveness and lower energy prices – were also expected to contribute to the recovery, even though they had contributed negatively to economic growth during the first quarter of 2015.",
        "Overall, the recovery in the euro area was expected to remain moderate and gradual, which was considered disappointing from both a longer-term and an international perspective, as real GDP currently stood only close to its 2008 level in the euro area, while in the United States it had registered a significant rebound.",
        "The balance of risks to the economic outlook for the euro area was seen to remain on the downside.",
        "The outlook for net exports, while benefiting from lower energy prices and improved price competitiveness, remained subject to downside risks related to a possible reversal of recent energy price and exchange rate developments, as well as lower than expected global trade growth.",
        "In particular, financial developments in China could have a larger than expected adverse impact, given this country’s prominent role in global trade.",
        "This risk could be compounded by negative knock-on effects from interest rate increases in the United States on growth in EMEs.",
        "Risks stemming from developments related to Greece and the ongoing negotiations with its creditors appeared to be generally contained.",
        "It was also felt that recently improved prospects for the negotiations of a third financial programme for Greece could be expected to contribute to a firming of confidence across the euro area.",
        "Nevertheless, setbacks in those negotiations could still negatively affect confidence and activity, and some caution was expressed regarding potential contagion risks in particularly adverse scenarios, which should not be underestimated.",
        "Members deemed it important to continue deepening the analysis of potential growth and the output gap.",
        "It was recalled that potential output estimates were surrounded by high levels of uncertainty and that different approaches, including production function-based estimates and other methodologies, needed to be carefully cross-checked.",
        "In this context, it was suggested to more closely examine the services sector, where the degree of slack – although difficult to measure – appeared to be relatively low and structural bottlenecks were dampening potential growth.",
        "As discussed on previous occasions, the role of investment would be essential for the prospects of both demand and supply capacity over the longer term.",
        "It was recalled that a sustained improvement in the outlook for economic growth, beyond a cyclical recovery, was not in the hands of monetary policy but required determined contributions from other policy areas, including fiscal policy and structural reforms.",
        "It was therefore suggested to continue deepening the analysis and discussion of the overall rebalancing and adjustment process across euro area economies.",
        "All in all, members agreed that the economic recovery was taking shape in line with the Governing Council’s earlier expectations and with the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "At the same time the balance of risks, which was still tilted to the downside, was considered to have remained broadly unchanged.",
        "With regard to price developments, members generally shared the assessment of the outlook and risks provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The outlook for price developments had not changed materially since the previous monetary policy meeting in early June, with inflation remaining low but expected to rise later in the year, broadly in line with earlier expectations and with the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "There was increasing evidence that the annual inflation rate had bottomed out, even if it was considered too early to firmly declare that the range of available measures of underlying inflation showed a turning point.",
        "Survey and market-based measures of inflation expectations had risen since the start of the year and had stabilised or recovered further since early June.",
        "As concerns the most recent data, euro area annual HICP inflation had stood at 0.2% in May 2015, in line with earlier expectations.",
        "It was remarked that there was considerable heterogeneity across countries in the latest inflation data.",
        "A reference was made to the recent decline in metal prices as appearing to have not yet passed through to non-energy industrial goods prices, which had picked up relatively strongly.",
        "It was underlined that, despite the increase observed since the start of the year, consumer price inflation had remained unusually low.",
        "The view was put forward in this context that the potential measurement bias in inflation statistics also needed to be taken into account and, accordingly, the currently low but positive measured inflation rate might mask a “true” negative inflation rate in the euro area.",
        "At the same time, in the case of the euro area, measurement errors had been mitigated by improvements in statistical methods and were judged to be very low.",
        "A number of comments were made on recent wage developments.",
        "It was noted that, despite picking up recently, wage increases remained subdued in some countries when considering improvements in economic growth and labour market conditions, as well as high current account surpluses.",
        "This called for a better understanding of the role of structural changes in wage-setting practices and behaviour in the countries concerned.",
        "Members put forward some remarks on developments in underlying inflation.",
        "It was felt that a range of different approaches could be usefully explored to determine whether a turning point had been reached.",
        "These included a deeper look at micro-level data, which might provide insight that could not necessarily be obtained from aggregate numbers.",
        "Overall, there appeared to be a growing number of indications that a turning point might well have been reached, even if it was premature to draw a firm conclusion, and additional observations would be needed.",
        "The remark was also made that a turning point in inflation dynamics, according to some measures, appeared to have preceded the January monetary policy decisions.",
        "This raised the question of whether the January measures could be seen as a decisive trigger for an adjustment in inflation and inflation expectations, or whether the anticipation of those measures or the earlier monetary policy decisions taken during 2014 had been the main drivers of the turnaround, in conjunction with developments in energy prices and the exchange rate.",
        "Concerning inflation expectations, members noted that both survey-based measures, as conveyed by the SPF, and, in particular, market-based measures had shown an upward trend since the start of the year.",
        "Reference was made to signs that inflation expectations had started to become better anchored but further analysis was necessary to determine when expectations could again be considered well anchored.",
        "Longer-term inflation expectations, in particular, had recovered from the low levels seen in early January and had been relatively stable in recent months, as conveyed, for instance, by the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, which had stood just above 1.8% on 14 July 2015.",
        "At the same time, several remarks were made that it was too early to consider inflation expectations to be firmly anchored again.",
        "First, market-based measures of inflation expectations at shorter horizons were still considerably lower than at longer horizons and it would take some time for inflation to return to levels in line with the Governing Council’s aim of achieving medium-term price stability.",
        "Second, even though inflation expectations had picked up since the start of the year, they were still – across most horizons – well below past levels, for instance levels observed one year earlier or longer-term averages.",
        "It was recalled, for example, that the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had traditionally stood above 2%, which at the time, on account of technical factors, had been considered to be in line with medium-term price stability.",
        "Overall, members concurred that euro area inflation, while remaining low, was expected to develop in line with earlier expectations and with the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "It was recalled that this outlook was predicated on the full implementation of the range of monetary policy measures that had been adopted by the Governing Council.",
        "Looking ahead, a continued close monitoring of the risks to the outlook for price developments was seen as warranted, with a particular focus on the impact of the monetary policy measures as well as geopolitical, energy price and exchange rate developments.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members agreed with the assessment, presented by Mr Praet in his introduction, that money and credit dynamics had continued to recover, with credit growth gradually improving further, although it remained subdued overall.",
        "Recent data had confirmed robust growth in broad money (M3), which continued to be strongly supported by a further pick-up in the narrow monetary aggregate M1.",
        "An encouraging signal was seen to come from the continued normalisation in loan dynamics and visible improvements in credit conditions.",
        "While recovering only gradually, the annual rate of change in loans to NFCs had turned positive for the first time since mid-2012, continuing its upward trend from the trough of -3.2% in February 2014.",
        "Similarly, growth in bank lending to households had recovered further.",
        "Evidence from the recent bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2015 suggested that the favourable interest rate environment was increasingly translating into easier bank lending conditions, alongside rising loan demand particularly for fixed investment.",
        "Banks had reported a continued net easing of credit standards on loans to enterprises, which was stronger than had been expected in the previous survey round.",
        "While differences across countries persisted, the improvements in credit conditions were widespread across the euro area.",
        "It was cautioned, however, that despite the overall net easing in credit standards, banks’ lower risk tolerance appeared to work somewhat against further improvements in credit provision.",
        "At the same time, recent developments in fixed income markets had prompted a slight deterioration in the conditions of debt financing for banks and NFCs.",
        "The overall improvement in the credit channel was seen to provide evidence of the effectiveness of the monetary policy measures that had been put in place since June 2014.",
        "Improved funding conditions were feeding through to borrowing conditions for firms and households and, thereby, were helping to strengthen, albeit not uniformly across the euro area, both credit supply and demand.",
        "In particular, the TLTROs had helped to improve credit supply, possibly more than generally expected, as reflected in credit terms and conditions.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that the successful conduct of the comprehensive assessment in 2014 had also been instrumental in helping to bring about the recent positive developments, as it had – in contrast to previously held concerns in some quarters – built confidence and strengthened banks’ balance sheets, thereby supporting overall lending conditions and credit provision.",
        "Members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that the information that had become available since the Governing Council’s early June monetary policy meeting had been broadly in line with expectations.",
        "Accordingly, the Governing Council did not change its assessment of a broadening of the euro area’s economic recovery and of a gradual increase in inflation rates over the coming years, which was predicated on the full implementation of all monetary policy measures taken by the Governing Council.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement that cross-checking the assessment of economic and monetary developments did not give reason to reconsider the current monetary policy stance or to materially change the modalities of the APP.",
        "The Governing Council thus reaffirmed that it would maintain a steady monetary policy course, firmly implementing the monetary policy measures that had been decided.",
        "Nonetheless, a careful monitoring of financial market conditions appeared necessary, whereby the Governing Council would respond to an unwarranted tightening in the monetary policy stance or a material change in the outlook for price stability by using all the instruments available within its mandate.",
        "There was general agreement among members that, despite some volatility in financial markets, the ECB’s monetary policy stance remained accommodative overall, providing the appropriate degree of monetary stimulus.",
        "Financial market conditions had somewhat tightened over recent months, in the context of the re‑pricing observed in bond markets.",
        "This, in part, reflected heightened uncertainty and a related rebound in term premia.",
        "While these developments had translated into somewhat tighter market-based debt financing conditions, the overall monetary policy stance was seen to remain accommodative by various measures.",
        "Money market rates and, hence, the shorter-term funding conditions of banks had remained resilient to the recent bond market developments.",
        "In addition, the broad financing conditions relevant for final borrowers remained favourable, with bank lending rates to firms and households continuing their downward trend largely unaffected by the recent rise in bond yields.",
        "Turning to the effectiveness of the ECB’s non-standard monetary policy measures, both the asset purchase programmes and the TLTROs were widely viewed to be on track, having contributed to marked improvements in confidence, and providing support to economic growth, to a reduction in economic slack and to money and credit expansion.",
        "Despite recent financial market developments and notwithstanding transmission lags, the latest information remained consistent with a continued pass-through of the monetary policy measures to the cost and availability of credit for firms and households.",
        "This was seen to be reflected in the latest bank lending survey results, which had indicated an overall net easing in credit conditions and suggested that the additional liquidity from the TLTROs was being used for granting loans.",
        "Nonetheless, there was no reason for complacency, not least as risks and vulnerabilities remained, in particular related to geopolitical factors, the programme negotiations with Greece and the growth prospects in emerging markets, including China.",
        "The present degree of monetary accommodation needed to remain in place as the overall recovery in growth and inflation remained modest and, in any case, was conditional on the full implementation of all the monetary policy measures taken by the Governing Council.",
        "Against this background, members generally agreed that a steady course remained warranted, as current conditions did not call for any change in the monetary policy stance.",
        "This included leaving the key ECB interest rates unchanged in line with the Governing Council’s forward guidance and firmly implementing the non‑standard monetary policy measures already decided.",
        "In particular, asset purchases should proceed at a monthly pace of €60 billion until end-September 2016 and, in any case, until a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation was visible, in line with the Governing Council’s aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "At the same time, as anticipated with some modest frontloading of purchases since May, seasonal patterns in market activity needed to be taken into account to accommodate the reduced depth and liquidity of markets over the summer and winter periods, as indicated by Mr Cœuré in his introduction.",
        "Moreover, while recent market volatility had not materially changed the assessment of the economic outlook, continued elevated uncertainty called for alertness and a readiness to respond, if necessary.",
        "Therefore, it appeared warranted to continue to closely monitor the situation in financial markets, with a view to potential implications for the monetary policy stance and for the outlook for price stability.",
        "This included, in particular, ensuring that expectations of future short-term money market rates remained consistent with the Governing Council’s forward guidance.",
        "More generally, broader financing conditions for households and firms had to be monitored to ensure that they did not change in directions that could endanger the recovery and hamper the normalisation of inflation trends.",
        "Attention also needed to be paid to possible changes in commodity prices, to the slowdown in emerging markets and to exchange rate developments to the extent that they could affect the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "There was general agreement among members on the need to respond to an unwarranted tightening of the monetary policy stance or a material change in the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "In such a case, all instruments available within the Governing Council’s mandate could be employed.",
        "In this context, members also reaffirmed, as on previous occasions, that the design of the asset purchase programmes provided sufficient flexibility for them to be adapted if circumstances were to change and should the need arise.",
        "As regards communication, it was highlighted that the macroeconomic environment had so far proved resilient to the recent heightened uncertainty and market volatility.",
        "The baseline outlook remained intact and the latest agreement to commence negotiations on a new macroeconomic adjustment programme for Greece had significantly reduced possible downside risks.",
        "While the monetary policy stance, therefore, remained fully appropriate, the present situation remained challenging and subject to downside risks.",
        "Accordingly, the confirmation of a steady monetary policy course needed to be complemented by communicating the Governing Council’s willingness to respond, if needed.",
        "Overall, taking into account the views expressed, the President concluded that the Governing Council was unanimous in its assessment that a steady monetary policy course should be maintained.",
        "It stood ready to use all available tools within its mandate, if necessary.",
        "This entailed reaffirming that the full implementation of all adopted monetary policy measures was needed to provide the necessary support to the economic recovery in the euro area, to achieve a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term, and to underpin a firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations.",
        "At the same time, this also entailed the need for a close monitoring of the situation in financial markets, with a view to their implications for price stability, and a readiness to respond to an unwarranted tightening of the monetary policy stance or a change in the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing and on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.20% respectively.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting."
    ],
    "2017": [
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 19-20 July 2017 two noteworthy developments had taken place in government bond markets.",
        "First, the widening of the spread between the yields on ten-year US Treasury and ten-year German government bonds, which had emerged in the wake of the US presidential election and had narrowed throughout most of 2017, had now practically been reversed.",
        "Second, long-term government bond yields in both the United States and the euro area had fallen back to levels last seen around the end of June 2017, thereby reversing most of the rise in yields seen in the run-up to the July 2017 Governing Council meeting.",
        "A combination of two factors was likely to have driven this correction.",
        "First, renewed geopolitical concerns – related in particular to developments on the Korean peninsula – and global risk-off sentiment had led to increased demand for safe assets.",
        "A possible second explanation for the decrease in long-term government bond yields related to evolving expectations on monetary policy.",
        "In this context, euro area government bond markets might also have been impacted by market participants’ increased focus on expected reinvestment flows under the asset purchase programme (APP), contributing to lower yields.",
        "Another noteworthy development was related to a disconnect that had started to emerge between the long-term interest rate differential, as measured by the spread between ten-year US Treasury and German government bond yields, and the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar.",
        "Until the Governing Council’s July monetary policy meeting, the appreciation of the euro against the US dollar had been consistent with the reappraisal by the market of the long-term interest rate differential.",
        "This link had broken recently, suggesting that factors unrelated to long-term economic prospects or expectations of asset purchases were having an impact on the exchange rate.",
        "One factor likely related to the short-term outlook for monetary policy, as anticipated interest rate increases had been pushed back in both the United States and the euro area.",
        "A second factor could have related to recent investment flows.",
        "There was evidence that foreign investment had been gradually returning to the euro area in particular in the equity market and in the wake of the French presidential election, which had reduced political uncertainty in the euro area.",
        "The stronger euro might have contributed to some decline in euro area equity markets.",
        "This could have been associated with a revision of expected earnings for those euro area firms generating a large share of their revenue outside the euro area.",
        "Compared with companies whose earnings mostly originated from within the euro area, export-oriented firms had clearly underperformed, owing to the appreciation of the euro.",
        "This had happened despite the increase in investment inflows from abroad and analysts maintaining a constructive view on euro area stocks.",
        "The slight equity market correction in the euro area was in contrast to the United States, where the S&P 500 index had increased by 3% since early May.",
        "Mr Cœuré also reported on the implementation of the APP over the summer.",
        "In August 2017 the Eurosystem had made net purchases of €50 billion.",
        "The smooth implementation in this period had been accompanied by some volatility in the relative purchase shares of different jurisdictions under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) owing to technical factors.",
        "He recalled that the applicable rules provided some flexibility on reinvestments in order to support the principle of market neutrality in the Eurosystem’s operations.",
        "In line with these rules, operational decisions had been taken to spread over several months the reinvestment of proceeds from French bonds maturing in July 2017, temporarily resulting in a decline in the share of French bonds in net PSPP purchases and a perceived over-allocation for other jurisdictions in July.",
        "The inverse phenomenon was then observed in August.",
        "This outcome had been misinterpreted by some market participants as an active policy choice by the ECB, which was not the case.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "The global recovery was broadening across regions, as also reflected in survey-based indicators.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had risen further in August.",
        "Monthly data pointed to a slowdown in global trade growth in the second quarter of 2017, but leading indicators still signalled positive prospects.",
        "In particular, the global PMI for new export orders had remained above its historical average.",
        "Global inflation had picked up moderately.",
        "In July annual OECD consumer price inflation had edged up slightly, to 2.0%, compared with 1.9% in June.",
        "Excluding food and energy, inflation had remained unchanged from June, at 1.8%.",
        "The slight increase in headline inflation in July had been mainly driven by higher energy prices.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had declined from USD 51 to USD 44 per barrel in June, before recovering to around USD 53 in July.",
        "Non-oil commodity prices had increased by 4.1% in US dollar terms since the July monetary policy meeting, driven by higher metal prices.",
        "Over the same period the euro had appreciated by 1.5% in nominal effective terms against the euro area’s 38 major trading partners.",
        "The economic expansion in the euro area continued to be solid and broad based.",
        "Real GDP had grown by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2017, after 0.5% in the first quarter.",
        "Private consumption growth continued to benefit from steady income growth and low interest rates.",
        "Favourable funding conditions supported investment spending, which was showing signs of acceleration.",
        "Capacity utilisation had continued to rise, reaching pre-crisis peaks.",
        "Employment growth was becoming more widespread, which was another sign of the breadth of the recovery and of underlying resilience.",
        "Looking ahead, survey-based indicators pointed to continuing robust economic growth in the second half of 2017.",
        "The composite output PMI had remained unchanged from July, at 55.7 in August.",
        "Likewise, confidence had remained high in all the main sectors covered in the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator.",
        "The broad-based global recovery had been supportive of total euro area exports, which had increased by 1.2%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2017.",
        "Monthly trade data for goods exports suggested ongoing robust momentum in the second quarter.",
        "In the September 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, euro area real GDP growth had been revised up for 2017, to 2.2%, while remaining unchanged at 1.8% for 2018 and at 1.7% for 2019, compared with the June 2017 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Euro area HICP inflation had increased from 1.3% in July to 1.5% in August, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, mainly reflecting higher energy inflation.",
        "Excluding food and energy, HICP inflation had remained unchanged at 1.2%.",
        "At the same time, measures of underlying inflation had ticked up moderately in recent months, but had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward adjustment.",
        "Price pressures in the early stages of the pricing chain had still not been transmitted to the later stages and faced headwinds from the recent euro appreciation.",
        "Moreover, a pick-up in wage growth had yet to appear.",
        "Annual growth in compensation per employee had stood at 1.2% in the first quarter of 2017, down from 1.4% in the final quarter of 2016.",
        "Negotiated wage growth had decreased from 1.6% in the first quarter of 2017 to 1.4% in the second quarter, driven largely by developments in one-off payments.",
        "Compared with the June 2017 Eurosystem staff projections, ECB staff had continued to see HICP inflation at 1.5% in 2017, while it had been revised down by 0.1 percentage point to 1.3% for 2018 and to 1.5% for 2019.",
        "The inflation projections for the euro area were at the lower end of the range compared with other major forecasts for 2017 and below other forecasts for 2018 and 2019.",
        "Surveys and market-based measures of inflation expectations had remained broadly unchanged since the 19-20 July monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council.",
        "For instance, the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead remained at around 1.6%.",
        "Turning to financial conditions, since the July monetary policy meeting the EONIA forward curve had shifted downwards.",
        "The move of the forward curve had been most notable for shorter maturities, suggesting some shift in expectations regarding the path of monetary policy.",
        "Longer-term risk-free rates had declined somewhat as well.",
        "Corporate bond spreads had declined somewhat further across all rating classes.",
        "Euro area equity prices had declined slightly since the July monetary policy meeting.",
        "Price-to-book ratios of euro area banks had increased over the past year and remained broadly in line with historical averages.",
        "The overall nominal cost of external financing for non-financial corporations, comprising bank lending, debt issuance in the market and equity finance, was estimated to have declined slightly, to 4.4%, in August 2017.",
        "Bank funding costs continued to remain favourable as a result of the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "Bank lending rates for households had remained broadly unchanged, while those for non-financial corporations had declined in July to the historical low observed in February 2017.",
        "The spread between large loans and very small loans had remained broadly stable at low levels.",
        "The annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 had remained solid in July 2017, having hovered at around 5% since the start of the APP, with domestic sources of money creation remaining the main driver of broad money growth.",
        "Lending to the non-financial private sector had continued its gradual recovery in July.",
        "The recovery in loan growth had been widespread across euro area countries.",
        "Finally, the euro area fiscal stance, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was expected to turn mildly expansionary in 2017 and to be broadly neutral in 2018 and 2019.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet remarked that, since the Governing Council’s meeting on 19-20 July 2017, financial conditions had tightened to some degree.",
        "The appreciation of the exchange rate had been partly offset by a retreat of the expected path of interest rates.",
        "Borrowing conditions for firms and households had remained very supportive.",
        "At the same time, the recent volatility in the exchange rate represented a source of uncertainty that required close monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "The economic upturn continued to be solid and broad based, with the September 2017 ECB staff projections pointing to faster growth for 2017 than had been expected in the June 2017 Eurosystem staff projections and no change for 2018 and 2019.",
        "Resilient domestic demand was projected to offset the headwinds from a stronger euro.",
        "Risks to the growth outlook remained broadly balanced.",
        "The ongoing economic expansion supported confidence that inflation would gradually head towards levels in line with the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Nonetheless, the September 2017 ECB staff projections indicated a somewhat slower path for inflation convergence than the June projections, on account of the stronger euro.",
        "While measures of underlying inflation had ticked up moderately in recent months, they had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.",
        "In addition, progress towards a durable and self-sustaining convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim remained conditional on a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Against this background, the Governing Council would need to decide in the coming months on the calibration of its policy instruments, based on a thorough assessment of the outlook for inflation and of the degree of accommodation needed to ensure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that were below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "In the meantime, Mr Praet proposed to maintain the monetary policy stance and all elements of the forward guidance unchanged.",
        "This included the pledge to increase asset purchases in terms of size and/or duration should the outlook for price stability become less favourable or should financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.",
        "Regarding communication, it was important for the Governing Council to, first, confirm its assessment of strong momentum in the euro area economy, but with still subdued inflation dynamics; second, indicate that the risks to the growth outlook remained broadly balanced; third, stress that the recent volatility in the exchange rate represented a source of uncertainty, requiring close monitoring with regard to possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability; fourth, confirm all the elements of forward guidance and reiterate that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation was still needed for inflation pressures to build up; and, fifth, signal that in the coming months it would decide on the course of monetary policy beyond the end of the current year, taking into account the expected path of inflation and the financial conditions needed for a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "According to recent data and survey indicators, the economic expansion had continued to be solid and broad-based across countries and sectors, but had accelerated more than expected in the first half of 2017.",
        "Looking ahead, economic growth was expected to remain robust, with stronger domestic demand expected to offset the impact of the appreciation of the euro on exports.",
        "This assessment was reflected in the outlook for growth contained in the September 2017 ECB staff projections.",
        "Compared with the June 2017 Eurosystem staff projections, the outlook for real GDP growth had been revised up for 2017, reflecting the recent stronger growth momentum, and was broadly unchanged for 2018 and 2019.",
        "The risks to the growth outlook were assessed to have remained broadly balanced, in line with the assessment made at the previous monetary policy meeting, with upside risks to domestic demand, primarily in the short run owing to the positive cyclical momentum.",
        "Downside risks related mainly to global factors and developments in foreign exchange markets.",
        "Regarding the outlook and risks for the external environment, the global economy was viewed as expanding at a solid pace, with the assessment that external demand would continue to support the economic expansion in the euro area remaining intact.",
        "However, the balance of risks to the global economic recovery was considered to remain tilted to the downside, reflecting, inter alia, uncertainties about macroeconomic policy choices in the United States and the negotiations on the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, as well as possible balance sheet adjustments in a number of emerging market economies.",
        "Turning to the euro area, there was broad agreement with the growth outlook embedded in the September ECB staff projections.",
        "Members concurred with the view that recent indicators had been stronger than expected and had provided further confirmation of continued robust growth.",
        "Both the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator and the composite output PMI stood at, or close to, their post-crisis peaks and were well above their long-term averages.",
        "It was also noted that euro area labour markets had improved further and it was recalled that since the start of the recovery in 2013 around six million jobs had been created in the euro area.",
        "Members generally agreed that the ECB’s monetary policy measures had contributed significantly to the ongoing economic expansion and that a sustained momentum in economic growth was still conditional on continued favourable financing conditions.",
        "At the same time, it was also remarked that there were indications that the economic expansion was becoming increasingly self-sustaining.",
        "The euro area had now exhibited positive economic growth for 17 consecutive quarters, starting in the second quarter of 2013.",
        "Taking a longer-term perspective, a comparison was made between the current outlook for growth in 2017, according to the September 2017 ECB staff projections, and the outlook for growth in 2017 projected a year earlier, which had been markedly less positive.",
        "Despite being subject to considerable uncertainty, the euro area output gap was now expected to close sooner.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that broader measures of the degree of slack remained elevated.",
        "Considering the main components of demand in more detail, private consumption growth remained strong, supported by ongoing gains in employment and by increasing household wealth.",
        "The recovery in investment was also continuing to benefit from very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability.",
        "The broad-based global recovery was expected to support euro area exports, notwithstanding a dampening effect from the euro’s appreciation.",
        "Concerning risks to the euro area growth outlook, members agreed that risks to activity remained broadly balanced.",
        "On the one hand, upside risks were related to the possibility that the current positive cyclical momentum could lead to a stronger than expected economic upswing.",
        "On the other hand, downside risks were seen to stem mainly from the global environment, related to geopolitical factors and vulnerabilities in some emerging market economies.",
        "In addition, it was also considered that, while the strong domestic growth momentum could, to some extent, mitigate the impact on the euro area economy from the stronger euro, developments in foreign exchange markets nevertheless posed a downside risk to euro area growth and inflation.",
        "A number of remarks were made about recent exchange rate developments.",
        "In assessing these developments it was deemed important to take into account, as was done in the September 2017 ECB staff projections, the main factors behind the euro’s appreciation, since the implications for the outlook for growth and inflation depended on the underlying causes.",
        "Some support was expressed for the approach taken by staff with regard to a model-based shock decomposition, which had attributed roughly one-third each to the contributions coming from demand, monetary policy and exogenous exchange rate shocks.",
        "It was considered that the euro’s appreciation to date could, to some degree, be seen as endogenous and as reflecting more positive euro area developments, pertaining to both stronger growth and reduced perceptions of political risk.",
        "At the same time, some questions were raised about the approach taken by staff in treating the impact of the exchange rate in the September projections.",
        "It was underlined that the pass-through of the euro’s appreciation to growth and inflation was uncertain.",
        "The identification of the sources of the exchange rate appreciation was seen as model-dependent and thus required further analysis.",
        "Even if some of the recent appreciation was related to positive growth developments in the euro area, a sizeable part could still be considered to be exogenous, including the part attributed to relative monetary policy shocks.",
        "While the euro’s appreciation could be related to more positive sentiment towards the euro area, it was pointed out that movements in the exchange rate also reflected developments elsewhere.",
        "Notably, market expectations as regards US growth had been revised, compared with the start of the year, as had expectations about the monetary and fiscal policy outlook in the United States.",
        "Members expressed concerns about the risk of exchange rate overshooting.",
        "It was recalled that in the September 2017 ECB staff projections the exchange rate was assumed to be constant over the projection horizon.",
        "In this context, the speed of the recent appreciation was underlined, including after the cut-off date of the projections.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement among members that the recent volatility in the exchange rate of the euro was a source of uncertainty which required monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "Regarding price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Euro area headline HICP inflation had been 1.5% in August 2017, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 1.3% in the previous two months.",
        "Members agreed that, while measures of underlying inflation had ticked up slightly in recent months, they had nevertheless remained at subdued levels overall.",
        "Underlying inflation in the euro area was expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the gradual absorption of economic slack and rising wages.",
        "However, while underlying inflation was expected to show a continuous upward trend, on the basis of current oil futures prices annual rates of headline inflation were likely to decline temporarily towards the end of the year, mainly reflecting negative base effects in energy prices.",
        "This assessment was broadly reflected in the September 2017 ECB staff projections, where the outlook for HICP inflation was unchanged for 2017 but had been revised down slightly for 2018 and 2019, reflecting mainly the recent appreciation of the euro.",
        "At the same time, the questions raised about the treatment of the exchange rate in the current projections might imply some downside risks.",
        "In discussing the outlook for inflation included in the September staff projections, concern was again voiced about the possibility of changes in the inflation process that might lead to low inflation rates being more persistent, including the role of changes in inflation expectations and wage indexation practices.",
        "Commenting on measures of underlying inflation, members agreed that there were not yet convincing signs of a sustained convergence towards levels compatible with the ECB’s inflation aim.",
        "At the same time, a number of measures of underlying inflation had increased moderately compared with the second half of 2016.",
        "HICP inflation excluding food and energy, for example, had risen to 1.2% in August this year, from around 0.8% a year earlier.",
        "This pointed to tentative signs of reflationary forces slowly taking hold as the economic expansion gathered pace.",
        "It was argued that there was little doubt about the direction but more uncertainty about the pace of underlying inflation.",
        "In considering labour cost pressures in the latest staff projections, it was noted that wage developments had remained subdued, with annual growth in compensation per employee declining from 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 1.2% in the first quarter of 2017.",
        "The argument was advanced that, even if wage dynamics had so far been disappointing, cost pressures should gradually increase as the economic expansion continued.",
        "Attention was again drawn to the increasing importance of non-wage components of labour costs, which might reflect a shift in focus in wage negotiations in a number of countries.",
        "Labour market slack, although still significant, was following a clear downward path, which should ultimately translate into higher wage growth.",
        "Moreover, surveys of firms pointed to emerging labour shortages in a number of skill categories.",
        "However, there were also still seen to be some downside risks to the wage outlook incorporated into the baseline of the latest ECB staff projections, not least in view of the persistent overestimation of wages in past projections.",
        "Members also referred to recent developments in inflation expectations.",
        "Both market-based and survey-based longer-term measures had remained broadly unchanged.",
        "While in the Survey of Professional Forecasters the measure of longer-term inflation expectations five years ahead stood at 1.8%, the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead remained at 1.6%.",
        "Overall, recent developments indicated that inflation expectations remained broadly anchored, and the risk of deflation had largely disappeared.",
        "At the same time, some concern was expressed that a longer period of inflation below the ECB’s definition of price stability could have an adverse impact on inflation expectations.",
        "Overall, while members considered that the ongoing economic expansion increased confidence that inflation dynamics would strengthen over time, they continued to emphasise that patience, persistence and prudence were still needed, as this process was expected to take time and remained contingent on a very substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3), despite some monthly volatility, continued to expand at a robust pace and the gradual recovery in loan growth to the private sector, visible since the start of 2014, was proceeding, with a further pick-up in loan growth to non-financial corporations.",
        "The cost of market-based financing, as well as bank lending rates for firms and households, had remained near historical lows, supporting euro area credit flows and a continued pass-through of monetary policy accommodation in the ongoing euro area economic expansion.",
        "It was seen as encouraging that the stock of non-performing loans had declined further in the first quarter of 2017, amid strengthened bank capital positions and an improving earnings outlook, even though overall bank profitability remained at low levels.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that the available information overall confirmed a broadly unchanged medium-term outlook for euro area economic growth and inflation, as also entailed in the September 2017 ECB staff projections.",
        "While the economic expansion continued to be solid and broad-based across countries and sectors, inflation dynamics remained subdued and signs of progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation were generally judged to still be insufficient.",
        "At the same time, there were grounds for confidence that inflation would gradually converge to levels in line with the Governing Council’s aim of inflation below, but close to, 2%.",
        "Members broadly agreed with Mr Praet’s assessment that financial conditions had tightened to some degree in the period since the July 2017 monetary policy meeting, notably on account of the stronger euro, although, overall, they had remained supportive of the ongoing economic expansion.",
        "Long-term interest rates had fallen and borrowing conditions for firms and households remained favourable.",
        "While the recent appreciation of the euro exchange rate was seen to reflect to some degree the improved macroeconomic environment in the euro area and the associated market assessment of the outlook for the ECB’s monetary policy relative to that of other major central banks, concerns were expressed, notably about the recent momentum.",
        "There was wide agreement that the recent movements in the euro exchange rate represented a source of uncertainty, which required monitoring with respect to its medium-term implications for price stability.",
        "It was underlined that, while confidence in the projected path of inflation had continued to firm, the ongoing economic expansion had yet to translate more convincingly into stronger inflation dynamics.",
        "Hence, from today’s perspective, the available evidence continued to indicate that the progress towards a durable and self-sustaining convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim was not yet fully convincing and that patience was still needed.",
        "Inflation was expected to remain some distance from the Governing Council’s inflation aim for some time, not least as medium-term inflation expectations were still muted and a number of structural factors were holding back a more dynamic adjustment in inflation.",
        "At the same time, confidence in the expected convergence of inflation to the objective was bolstered by the up-tick in measures of underlying inflation, a stabilisation in inflation expectations despite the appreciating exchange rate, and the increasingly solid growth environment.",
        "The point was also made that some comfort could be drawn from the level and direction of inflation foreseen at the end of the projection horizon.",
        "However, it was highlighted that the baseline scenario for inflation remained crucially conditional on the very favourable financing conditions that, in turn, largely depended on the current accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "Against this background, there was broad agreement among members that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation was still needed for inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation over the medium term.",
        "For the present meeting, this argued for keeping the monetary policy stance unchanged.",
        "This included keeping in place all elements of the Governing Council’s forward guidance pertaining to the ECB’s key interest rates and the pace and horizon of APP purchases, as well as the implicit sequencing of policy instruments embedded in the forward guidance, and the indication that the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP would be reinvested for as long as necessary.",
        "Moreover, as the end of the intended horizon of the net asset purchases was approaching, members reiterated that a decision was warranted in the autumn on the ECB’s policy instruments beyond the end of the year.",
        "This decision would need to be based on a thorough assessment of the outlook for inflation, the risks surrounding this outlook, and the monetary policy stance and financial conditions needed for a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "Accordingly, the Eurosystem committees would continue their technical work on examining possible scenarios for the future evolution of policy instruments, considering their impact on financial conditions and the medium-term outlook for inflation and also looking at the experience of other central banks.",
        "Subsequently members had a very preliminary exchange of views about the future monetary policy stance and the considerations that might guide a recalibration of instruments and the transmission channels through which they shape financial conditions and the outlook for price stability.",
        "There was broad agreement that continued substantial support from monetary policy was still needed to ensure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "At the same time, a stronger euro area economy and the dissipation of deflationary risks underpinned increased confidence that the Governing Council’s inflation aim would be achieved over the medium term.",
        "A view was put forward that conditions were increasingly falling into place that would allow the intensity of monetary policy accommodation to be adapted and would provide an opportunity to scale back the Eurosystem’s net asset purchases.",
        "In this context, a view was reiterated that, looking ahead, the Governing Council needed to regain more policy space and flexibility to adjust policy and the degree of monetary policy accommodation in either direction, if and when needed, to cope with a maturing business cycle and potential future shocks.",
        "However, it was remarked that policy space would naturally emerge from a successful conduct of monetary policy that supported the recovery of the euro area economy and a swift return of inflation to levels in line with the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that a very substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation was still needed for inflation to converge sustainably to levels in line with the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "Discomfort was widely expressed about the very prolonged period over which inflation had been – and was still expected to remain – distant from the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "The Governing Council needed to remain fully symmetric in its commitment to achieving its policy objective.",
        "Therefore, any reassessment of the monetary policy stance should proceed in a very gradual and cautious manner, while maintaining sufficient flexibility, also in the light of prevailing uncertainties with respect to the inflation outlook and financial conditions.",
        "In this context, on the one hand attention was drawn to the need to be mindful of market expectations and the risk of unwarranted movements in financial conditions, which could jeopardise progress towards a sustained adjustment in inflation.",
        "On the other hand it was argued that expectations of a recalibration of asset purchases in the euro area after the turn of the year were incorporated in market analysts’ views, possibly mitigating these concerns.",
        "Moreover, it was remarked that the assessment of the monetary policy stance needed to be firmly based on the Governing Council’s judgement regarding inflation convergence to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, without giving undue weight to market expectations.",
        "Members also discussed some general trade-offs inherent in various scenarios for the future recalibration of the APP and, in particular, the choice between the pace and the intended duration.",
        "Within the framework of the Governing Council’s forward guidance, the benefits from a longer intended purchase horizon, combined with a greater reduction in the pace, were compared with those from a shorter period of purchases and larger monthly volumes.",
        "In this context, the point was again made that both the costs and benefits of extending APP purchases, including possible financial stability risks, needed to be taken into account.",
        "It was also argued that the monetary policy stance would remain highly accommodative in either scenario on account of the range of policy instruments in place, most notably the reinvestment of the principal of maturing securities, the liquidity related to the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, and the forward guidance on the ECB’s key policy rates.",
        "Since the end of 2014 the Eurosystem had accumulated a very large stock of public and private sector assets, which would be maintained on the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, through the reinvestment of the principal payments, for as long as necessary.",
        "Moreover, it was highlighted that the forward guidance on policy interest rates formed an integral part of the overall monetary policy stance.",
        "More generally, the point was again made that the overall degree of accommodation was determined by the combination of all the monetary policy measures deployed by the ECB and that the Governing Council’s assessment of progress regarding a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation should apply to the overall design and direction of the ECB’s monetary policy stance as a whole, and not with reference to any particular instrument in isolation, such as the duration and pace of APP purchases.",
        "As regards the timing of prospective policy decisions by the Governing Council, there was broad agreement that the bulk of the decisions, including the strategy for recalibrating the policy instruments, could be taken at the forthcoming monetary policy meeting in October, while the possibility that some technical decisions could be taken at a later stage could not be ruled out.",
        "As regards communication, members broadly agreed with the suggestions made by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "It was important to emphasise that the continued strong momentum of the euro area economy supported confidence that inflation would gradually reach levels in line with the ECB’s medium-term objective.",
        "At the same time, it had to be acknowledged that inflation dynamics remained subdued and patience was still needed for inflation to converge sustainably to levels consistent with the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "In this context, it should be stressed that the recent volatility of the euro exchange rate represented a source of uncertainty, which required monitoring with respect to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "While it had to be recalled that the exchange rate was not a policy target for the ECB, it was very important for growth and inflation developments in the euro area.",
        "There was broad agreement to emphasise, as on previous occasions, the need for monetary policy to remain persistent and patient.",
        "A very substantial degree of monetary accommodation was still necessary for inflation pressures to build up.",
        "For the present meeting, this implied confirming that all elements of the Governing Council’s forward guidance would be maintained, including the implied sequencing of policy instruments embedded in the forward guidance, and reiterating the Governing Council’s continued readiness to increase the size and/or duration of its asset purchases, if needed.",
        "Looking ahead, there was a benefit to clear and forward-looking communication by the Governing Council, while some flexibility was required in order to appropriately prepare and calibrate the necessary degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Therefore, it needed to be reiterated that the Governing Council would decide in the autumn on the calibration of its policy instruments beyond the end of the year, taking into account the expected path of inflation and the financial conditions required for a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "In this context, it needed to be highlighted that any reassessment of the monetary policy stance was based on the Governing Council’s assessment of the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and −0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.",
        "Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirmed that the net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of €60 billion, were intended to run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "The net purchases would be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme.",
        "If the outlook became less favourable, or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stood ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 18-19 January 2017, two key developments had taken place.",
        "First, financial markets had significantly repriced monetary policy expectations in the United States.",
        "Second, events in the euro area had impacted both the short and the long end of the yield curve.",
        "In the United States, financial markets had significantly repriced expectations of an interest rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in March 2017.",
        "The probability of a March hike, as implied by the Fed funds futures market on 8 March, stood at 96%, compared with 15% at the time of the Governing Council’s January monetary policy meeting.",
        "As a consequence, market expectations of the future path of US rates had moved closer towards the forecasts of the median of FOMC members for 2017, which predicted three hikes in 2017, while longer-term rate expectations were largely unchanged.",
        "Separately, on the fiscal side, market participants had scaled down their expectations regarding stimulus from the new US Administration’s fiscal measures and appeared rather to be in a wait-and-see mode.",
        "Turning to the euro area, since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, the aggregate synthetic euro area yield curve for central government bonds and the yield curve for AAA-rated central government bonds had evolved differently.",
        "The former had steepened due to an increase in yields at the long end of the curve, whereas the short end of the curve was broadly unchanged.",
        "The latter had steepened due to a decrease at the short end, whereas the increase at the long end had been more muted.",
        "Mr Cœuré highlighted some of the factors driving these developments.",
        "One factor was related to safe-haven flows.",
        "Faced with a series of political surprises last year, including the outcomes of the UK referendum on EU membership and the US presidential elections, market participants appeared to have become more sensitive to political tail risk events.",
        "This uncertainty had led to increased safe-haven flows, in particular into German short-term government bonds, which had pushed yields down at the short end of the German curve while widening long-term spreads in some other jurisdictions.",
        "Another factor related to the availability of bonds.",
        "Flight to quality and, generally, demand for safe assets, had exacerbated the scarcity of short-term safe bonds available to private investors.",
        "Bearing in mind that short-term yields of some highly rated euro area jurisdictions had been gradually decoupling from equivalent overnight index swap (OIS) rates for some time, this implied a sustained demand, particularly for German short-term bonds, linked to a generally higher need for safe collateral, in an environment in which issuance had been shifting from short-term to long-term bonds.",
        "Beyond regulatory reasons that could explain this development, as shown by acute end-month and end-quarter tensions, other elements might come into play, in particular the demand for safe assets by investors with no access to the ECB’s deposit facility, namely non-bank investors, such as asset managers and central counterparties, which had to invest their liquidity.",
        "In addition, non-euro area investors, with no access to the deposit facility either, had to buy bonds to keep liquidity in euro.",
        "These elements might have added to the downward pressure on German bond yields.",
        "Moreover, since investors now expected higher yields in the United States, there may have been a general reluctance by private investors to take duration risk, which further added to the demand for short-term bonds.",
        "Money therefore remained parked at the short end of the curve and was not moving to the longer end, which itself contributed to a further steepening of the curve.",
        "Although more tentative, a third factor related to lower bond market liquidity, which may have amplified the widening of sovereign spreads in some jurisdictions, against the background of a reduced capacity of bond dealers to cushion volatility shocks.",
        "A fourth factor was the Eurosystem’s ongoing asset purchases, now also including securities with yields below the deposit facility rate, which, in conjunction with market participants’ expectations of the future availability of bonds, might have contributed to the decline in rates at the front end of the curve in some jurisdictions in the weeks before the meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré then highlighted that the repo market had remained fairly stable over recent weeks.",
        "For instance, the decline in the two-year German bond yield on the cash bond market had not been matched by a similar development in the repo market.",
        "Also, money market rates and general collateral repo rates had been relatively stable and continued to be mostly driven by structural factors – such as supply and demand imbalances in the collateral market – and, to a lesser extent, by short-term volatility and political uncertainty.",
        "The Eurosystem cash collateral facility had been instrumental in mitigating pressures in the repo market.",
        "The high level of excess liquidity, together with regulation, had also played a positive role in preventing a larger spillover of the tensions on the bond market to short-term funding markets.",
        "As euro area banks’ liquidity buffers were generally ample, their short-term borrowing needs remained limited, preventing an abrupt increase in the cost of unsecured borrowing.",
        "Mr Cœuré recalled that market-implied inflation expectations had remained broadly unchanged since the Governing Council’s January monetary policy meeting and maintained their close correlation with spot energy prices in the euro area.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "With regard to the global economy, survey indicators continued to suggest a rebound in activity, with some signs of a resynchronisation of the business cycle across major regions.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) stood at 53.5 in February, close to its long-term average.",
        "Global trade was gaining strength while remaining at modest levels.",
        "Global inflation had continued to pick up gradually in January, to 2.3% overall and to 1.9% excluding food and energy.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had declined marginally since the 18-19 January meeting of the Governing Council, while non-oil commodity prices had increased somewhat.",
        "In addition, the euro had depreciated by 1.1% in nominal effective terms vis-à-vis the currencies of 38 of the euro area’s major trading partners.",
        "Turning to the euro area, incoming information, notably sentiment indicators, continued to point to a firming and broadening of the recovery.",
        "Real GDP had increased by 0.4% quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016, after 0.4% in the third quarter and 0.3% in the second, mainly driven by domestic demand on the back of sustained employment gains and higher labour income.",
        "The unemployment rate had decreased further from the fourth quarter of 2016, to 9.6% in January 2017.",
        "Private consumption had continued to increase in the fourth quarter and the cyclical recovery in business investment proceeded, benefiting from the prevailing very favourable financing conditions.",
        "Euro area export dynamics in December 2016 had been broadly in line with developments in global trade.",
        "In their March 2017 macroeconomic projections, ECB staff saw annual real GDP as growing by 1.8% in 2017, 1.7% in 2018 and 1.6% in 2019.",
        "Compared with the December 2016 Eurosystem staff projections, the growth outlook had been revised upwards slightly for 2017 and 2018.",
        "The March staff projections for growth were slightly above those of other institutions.",
        "Turning to euro area prices, annual HICP inflation had increased further in February, to 2.0%, up from 1.8% in January and 1.1% in December 2016, reflecting mainly a strong increase in annual energy and unprocessed food price inflation.",
        "Excluding food and energy, inflation had stood at 0.9% in February, unchanged since December 2016.",
        "Annual industrial producer price inflation, excluding energy and construction, had also increased, to 1.5% in January.",
        "While indicators of pipeline pressures were showing tentative signs of emerging upward pressures at the earlier stages of the production chain, domestic producer prices for non-food consumer goods had yet to show an upward trend.",
        "Wage growth in the euro area had remained subdued.",
        "In the March 2017 ECB staff projections, annual HICP inflation was seen at 1.7% in 2017, 1.6% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019.",
        "Compared with the December 2016 Eurosystem staff projections, the inflation outlook had been revised upwards significantly for 2017 and slightly for 2018, while it was unchanged for 2019.",
        "The March staff projections for inflation were slightly above those of other institutions.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation expectations, derived from inflation-linked swap rates, had been slightly lower compared with levels observed at the 18-19 January meeting of the Governing Council.",
        "As regards financial and financing conditions, the EONIA forward curve had increased marginally since the previous monetary policy meeting, while the overall nominal cost of external financing for non-financial corporations had remained broadly stable.",
        "The nominal cost of bank borrowing for both non-financial corporations and households remained at low levels.",
        "Turning to money and credit, the annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 had remained broadly stable in January 2017, at 4.9%, after 5.0% in December 2016, with robust M1 growth as the main driver.",
        "The gradual recovery in loan growth had continued and was becoming more widespread across euro area countries, although differences persisted.",
        "Bank lending dynamics were broadly in line with historical patterns at the euro area level.",
        "Credit standards for loans had remained broadly stable, while net demand for loans had continued to increase.",
        "Finally, the fiscal stance in the euro area, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was estimated to have been slightly less expansionary in 2016, compared with the assessment at the January monetary policy meeting.",
        "The fiscal stance continued to be seen as broadly neutral over the remainder of the projection horizon.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet concluded that the Governing Council’s monetary policy measures had continued to preserve very favourable financing conditions.",
        "Their ongoing pass-through supported the economic upturn, which was steadily firming and broadening across sectors.",
        "Strong sentiment among consumers and businesses furthermore suggested that the cyclical recovery might be gaining momentum.",
        "The latest ECB staff projections saw euro area real GDP as growing at a slightly stronger pace in 2017 and 2018 than had been expected in December.",
        "At the same time, the risks to the economic outlook, while becoming less pronounced, remained tilted to the downside.",
        "As expected, headline inflation had continued to increase.",
        "This had mainly reflected a sharp rise in energy and, more recently, food price inflation.",
        "The staff projections for HICP inflation had been revised upwards significantly for 2017.",
        "Underlying inflation dynamics continued to be subdued.",
        "As regards the medium-term outlook, the March ECB staff projections – which included the effects of the latest non-standard measures – broadly confirmed the December 2016 Eurosystem staff projections, with inflation moving towards levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "However, as yet, one could not be sufficiently confident that inflation would converge towards levels consistent with the Governing Council’s aim in a durable and self-sustaining manner.",
        "Inflation dynamics continued to be conditional upon the present, very substantial degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Against this background, it was important to confirm the Governing Council’s monetary policy stance, including its forward guidance, which had contributed to the present, very substantial degree of accommodation.",
        "This was still needed to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Moreover, it was a safeguard in the face of the downside risks still being confronted.",
        "In terms of communication, Mr Praet considered it important to acknowledge the steady firming of the economic recovery, while stressing that the risks, although becoming less pronounced, remained tilted to the downside and that the staff projections were conditional on the full implementation of the Governing Council’s monetary policy measures.",
        "It was likewise important to clarify that, in view of the upward revision to inflation for 2017, the Governing Council would look through changes in HICP inflation, to the extent they were judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "Finally, it was important to confirm both the intended pace and horizon of the asset purchases and to reassert the forward guidance on policy rates and on the asset purchase programme (APP), as previously communicated.",
        "It was furthermore appropriate to de-emphasise the sense of urgency towards taking further actions that had been communicated in the past.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area, provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Recent data and survey results pointed to the economic recovery in the euro area steadily firming and broadening, supported by the pass-through of the ECB’s monetary policy measures, while sentiment indicators, in particular, suggested that the cyclical recovery might be gaining momentum.",
        "Looking ahead, the expansion of the euro area economy was expected to continue to be driven by private consumption, supported by rising employment and wages, and by a cyclical recovery in business investment.",
        "At the same time, growth prospects were dampened by the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms and remaining balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors.",
        "This assessment was broadly reflected in the outlook for growth in the March 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "Compared with the December 2016 Eurosystem staff projections, the outlook for growth had been revised up slightly for 2017 and 2018 and was unchanged for 2019.",
        "As regards the external environment, it was noted that the latest staff projections pointed to a strengthening in global growth momentum and a cyclical recovery in global trade.",
        "However, the external outlook was perceived to remain very uncertain, with reference made to a number of factors that were seen as contributing to this uncertainty, including the nature and timing of future policy choices by the new US Administration, the economic impact of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, the transition towards lower growth and the rebalancing of demand in China, and developments in other emerging market economies.",
        "The balance of risks to the outlook for global growth was generally viewed as remaining on the downside.",
        "Turning to the euro area, there was broad agreement with the growth outlook embodied in the March 2017 ECB staff projections, which provided confirmation that the recovery in the euro area economy was continuing, with small upward revisions to the outlook for 2017 and 2018.",
        "The latest projections, while broadly confirming the December projections, were seen as providing further evidence of the robust nature of the ongoing economic upturn, although significant risks and uncertainties remained.",
        "Members observed that the large contribution from domestic demand – with net trade providing only a small contribution to growth – rendered the economy more resilient to adverse shocks.",
        "It was underlined that the forecast for real GDP growth in 2017 had gradually been revised upwards over time, from 1.6% in the September 2016 projections to 1.7% in the December 2016 projections, and then to 1.8% in the March 2017 projections.",
        "Including the first quarter of 2017, there were now eleven consecutive quarters of quarter-on-quarter growth above the potential growth rate.",
        "The European Commission’s latest Economic Sentiment Indicator and euro area PMIs were very positive, with the composite output PMI for the euro area at its highest level for almost six years.",
        "Incoming data had surprised on the upside for some time.",
        "The labour market had continued to improve, with unemployment declining steadily and a recovery now taking place in the housing and construction sectors.",
        "Considering the components of demand, it was noted that, while improving corporate profitability and very favourable financing conditions should also continue to support a recovery in investment, private consumption remained a key element in the growth outlook.",
        "Rising employment, which was also benefiting from past structural reforms, was having a positive impact on households’ real disposable income, thereby providing support for private consumption.",
        "Looking ahead, it was highlighted that the robustness of real income growth in the staff projections crucially depended on further growth in employment and on nominal wage growth over the projection horizon to more than offset the adverse impact of higher energy prices.",
        "It was remarked that at present inflation was driven mainly by higher energy prices, which represented worsening terms of trade and a negative supply shock for households and firms.",
        "Hence the baseline outlook for activity embodied in the projections might turn out to be overly optimistic.",
        "Moreover, the ECB staff projections saw employment growth as slowing, while a projected strong pick-up in wages was expected to soften the impact of higher energy prices on real income growth.",
        "Together with an assumed decline in the saving ratio, this underpinned private consumption growth in the staff projections.",
        "The argument was made that the projected strength in consumption was open to question, given its reliance on a future pick-up in wages and the assumed intertemporal consumption smoothing behaviour by households.",
        "In this context, it was also noted that the ECB staff projections for euro area growth were slightly above the forecasts published by other institutions.",
        "There was broad agreement among members that risks to euro area activity were becoming more balanced but remained on the downside.",
        "Views were exchanged on the extent to which downside risks to the growth outlook had diminished and on the characterisation of the balance of risks.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that the projections’ reliance on stronger wages and a declining saving ratio to offset the adverse impact of higher energy prices on real income growth pointed to some downside risk to domestic demand looking ahead.",
        "Furthermore, political and economic uncertainty remained high, and it was possible that the negative effects on the euro area economy from external risks – notably from the United States and Brexit – might be underestimated.",
        "While there was no clear evidence of a negative impact of uncertainty so far, it was too early to draw the conclusion that there would be no adverse effects on the economy, with the impact of Brexit, for example, likely to become more apparent in the medium term.",
        "It could also be argued that uncertainty had not had much of an effect so far because there had been an offsetting impact from monetary policy measures, which had contributed to maintaining favourable financing conditions.",
        "On the other hand, the latest data were indicative of the euro area economy gaining cyclical momentum, with the possibility that growth might turn out to be stronger, at least in the short run, than anticipated in the March 2017 ECB staff projections.",
        "In addition, it was noted that, although political uncertainty was very high at the moment, some reassurance could be taken from analysis suggesting the effect of elevated political uncertainty on economic activity was not significant.",
        "It was noted that other measures of uncertainty which appeared to be more relevant with respect to economic developments remained low.",
        "It was also remarked that the relevant benchmark for the risk analysis was the degree to which specific risks were already priced into financial markets.",
        "This suggested that, if any of the downside risks under consideration failed to materialise, an upward impact should be anticipated, relative to market expectations, which also needed to be part of the picture.",
        "Against this background, there was broad agreement that risks to euro area activity had become more balanced, while remaining tilted to the downside and related predominantly to global factors.",
        "In view of the evolution of recent data and indicators, a number of members considered that risks could be characterised as broadly balanced.",
        "At the same time, other members made the point that there were still substantial downside risks to real GDP in view of the fragility of some of the assumptions underpinning the baseline projection and the prevalence of fundamental risks and uncertainties, both globally and in the euro area.",
        "It was recalled that the recent trends and the outlook of a firming and broadening recovery were largely benefiting from the exceptionally favourable financing conditions and were reliant on continued support from the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "In order to reap the full benefits from the ECB’s measures, however, other policy areas needed to contribute much more decisively to supporting economic activity.",
        "The implementation of structural reforms needed to be stepped up substantially in order to increase the resilience of the euro area economy, as well as to reduce the level of structural unemployment and to raise potential growth.",
        "As regards fiscal policies, it was essential that all countries intensified their efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances, while remaining in compliance with the EU fiscal rules.",
        "The full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact over time and across countries remained crucial to ensure confidence in the EU’s governance framework.",
        "Turning to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment of the outlook presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "To a large extent, the recent increase in headline inflation reflected an increase in energy price inflation and, in February, was also related to an increase in unprocessed food price inflation.",
        "In the coming months headline inflation was expected to remain at levels close to 2%, mainly as a result of movements in the annual rate of change of energy prices.",
        "This assessment was reflected in the March 2017 ECB staff projections, where the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised up significantly for 2017 and slightly for 2018, while remaining unchanged for 2019.",
        "Commenting on this outlook, it was pointed out that higher headline inflation reflected the fact that energy prices were 9.2% higher in February 2017 than one year ago, but that base effects were expected to turn negative over time.",
        "It was also recalled that the rise in unprocessed food prices observed in recent months was likely to be reversed, while the latest downward movement in oil prices suggested that a continued upward impact of higher energy prices on overall inflation could not be taken for granted in the period ahead.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that the downward-sloping profile of oil prices derived from the futures markets played a crucial role in the HICP projections.",
        "In this context, it was remarked that alternative models and tools for gauging the outlook for the oil markets pointed to some upside risks to prices.",
        "It was observed that measures of underlying inflation remained subdued and, according to the ECB staff projections, were expected to increase only gradually over the medium term, supported by the projected continuation of the economic recovery, the gradual absorption of economic slack and the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "Annual HICP inflation excluding food and energy had been fluctuating within a range of 0.7-0.9% since April 2016.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that the impression should be avoided that the ECB’s price stability objective was based on underlying inflation.",
        "It was recalled in this context that underlying inflation was not an unbiased predictor of headline inflation, having been significantly below headline inflation and averaging 1.4% since 1999, in the case of HICP inflation excluding food and energy.",
        "It was noted that this measure, according to the latest ECB staff projections, would reach 1.8% at the end of the projection horizon, which was well above this historical average and also slightly above headline inflation.",
        "Members also discussed the outlook for wages and the possible impact of second-round effects.",
        "It was underlined that the projected increase in HICP inflation excluding food and energy, from the current level of 0.9% to 1.8% in 2019, was based on a strong pick-up in wage growth.",
        "It was argued that a turnaround in wage dynamics was thus the linchpin for the upward profile in underlying inflation to materialise.",
        "However, wage developments had so far remained moderate and there was no evidence yet of second-round effects on inflation.",
        "As a large number of wage negotiations had already been concluded for this year, it was suggested that the increase in headline inflation seen for 2017 was likely to have a stronger effect on the wage bargaining process only in 2018.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the proportion of collective bargaining agreements that included some degree of indexation had decreased over time in parts of the euro area, which might suggest that second-round effects would be contained.",
        "Members considered the influence of labour market slack on the wage outlook.",
        "Attention was drawn to the expectation that, in the context of the March 2017 projection exercise, labour market slack would prevail for longer than previously thought.",
        "Moreover, broader measures of labour underutilisation, which took into consideration groups that are marginally attached to the labour market, such as discouraged workers, and the underemployed, pointed to a much higher degree of labour market slack than was evident from the unemployment statistics.",
        "This argued in favour of caution with regard to the wage outlook, as the level of slack in the labour market was likely to be an important factor in determining wage growth.",
        "At the same time, questions were raised about the likely impact of the economic recovery on the labour force participation rate, and doubts were expressed about the extent to which unemployed persons and discouraged workers would return to the labour market and thus continue to exert downward pressure on wages.",
        "It was argued that, if no such reintegration materialised, inflationary pressures could become stronger than anticipated.",
        "Members also took note of recent developments in inflation expectations for the euro area.",
        "Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, such as the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, as well as market-based measures of inflation expectations, were broadly unchanged.",
        "For example, the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had been broadly stable around 1.7% since the Governing Council’s January monetary policy meeting, following an earlier upward trend.",
        "Market expectations also indicated that the probability of a deflationary scenario was very low.",
        "Overall, while the outlook for headline inflation had been revised upwards, notably for 2017, owing mainly to higher oil prices, measures of underlying inflation remained low and were expected to rise only gradually over the medium term, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures and the continued economic recovery.",
        "The Governing Council would continue to look through changes in HICP inflation if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "At the same time, there was broad agreement that the risk of deflation and of an unanchoring of inflation expectations had largely disappeared.",
        "Adverse downside scenarios were thus judged to have become less likely.",
        "As with the discussion on the risks surrounding the outlook for growth, views were exchanged about the extent to which the risks to medium-term price stability had become more balanced.",
        "It was underlined that the inflation profile in the March 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections was above forecasts by other institutions and that underlying price pressures remained weak.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that the risk assessment might be unduly backward-looking and coloured by persistent past forecast errors, and that such errors would typically change signs around cyclical turning points.",
        "All in all, there was broad agreement that both downside and upside risks to the inflation outlook continued to warrant close monitoring.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) had continued to expand at a robust pace, mainly supported by its most liquid components.",
        "Loan growth had proceeded on the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014.",
        "The observation was made that credit growth had reached an eight-year high and that the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014, reinforced by the December 2016 decisions, had continued to pass through effectively to the borrowing conditions for firms and households and to credit flows across the euro area.",
        "This was supported by continued favourable bank funding costs, even though the scope for lowering bank deposit rates was becoming increasingly limited, with possible implications for lending rates, margins and ultimately bank profitability in the period ahead.",
        "In this context, the constellation and slope of yield curves – in conjunction with differences across jurisdictions in terms of the prevalence of fixed or floating rate debt instruments – were seen to merit attention with regard to the consequences for the bank-based transmission of monetary policy across the euro area.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that vulnerabilities in some parts of the banking sector persisted.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that, while inflation had continued to increase, largely on account of rising energy and food price inflation, underlying inflation pressures had remained subdued and signs of a convincing upward trend were still lacking.",
        "There was therefore broad agreement that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation continued to be needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up and to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Members expressed satisfaction that the ECB’s monetary policy measures, notably supported by the decisions taken in December 2016, had continued to preserve the very favourable financing conditions that were necessary to secure such a sustained convergence of inflation towards the objective.",
        "Financial conditions, overall, had remained broadly stable at very accommodative levels since the first half of 2016, with some further easing seen recently, reflecting mainly an increase in share prices and a weaker euro.",
        "This had been offset to some extent by a slight increase in bond yields, largely owing to a widening of sovereign bond spreads in some jurisdictions, which was judged to mainly reflect country-specific factors.",
        "The argument was made that, as the economy continued to recover and as inflation rose, some indicators were starting to point to an increasingly expansionary monetary policy stance, for example when considering recent declines in real interest rates, in particular, those based on actual inflation.",
        "It was, however, also remarked that, while short-term real interest rates had declined with the rise in headline inflation, medium to longer-term rates had declined only marginally since the January meeting.",
        "Moreover, it was highlighted that the decline in short-term real interest rates was mainly driven by an increase in energy and food prices.",
        "This suggested that any positive impact of a lower real rate was likely to be counterbalanced by a corresponding negative impact of rising food and energy prices on real disposable incomes.",
        "The ongoing pass-through of the ECB’s stimulus to the borrowing conditions for firms and households was seen to benefit credit creation and to support the steadily firming recovery of the euro area economy and its resilience to external influences.",
        "While more time was still needed for the effects of the policy measures on growth and inflation outcomes to unfold fully, they were regarded as an important factor behind the positive trend in the overall macroeconomic climate and its resilience to adverse shocks and prevailing uncertainties.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that the sluggish reaction of underlying inflation in the wake of the financial crisis was not confined to the euro area but appeared to be a global phenomenon.",
        "As regards the medium-term outlook, inflation was seen to gradually move towards levels below, but close to, 2%, as also reflected in the March 2017 ECB staff projections, which broadly confirmed the December 2016 projections.",
        "However, it was generally felt that, as yet, one could not be sufficiently confident that inflation would converge towards levels consistent with the Governing Council’s aim in a durable and self-sustaining manner.",
        "Notably, the dynamics of underlying inflation were seen still to give scant indication of a convincing rebound, particularly as wage growth also remained subdued.",
        "Considering that increases in headline inflation were mainly due to rising energy and food price inflation and that these inflation developments might only be temporary, it was generally still seen as premature to draw firm conclusions regarding implications for the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Accordingly, the Governing Council was well advised to continue to look through changes in HICP inflation if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "Moreover, while deflationary risks had largely disappeared and medium-term inflation expectations had recovered some ground, market-based indicators of inflation expectations had remained at relatively low levels for an extended period of time.",
        "The assessment was complicated, however, by the presence of risk premia in the market-derived measures.",
        "Finally, the prospect of an upward trend in inflation still depended on the prevailing very favourable financing conditions, which were judged to be, to a large extent, conditional on the current accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "All in all, there was broad agreement among members that the current monetary policy stance remained appropriate.",
        "Against the background of a largely unaltered outlook for medium-term price stability, the view was widely shared that patience and maintaining a steady hand remained warranted at the current meeting, coupled with a more confident tone on the underlying economic conditions in the euro area and a reduced sense of urgency for further policy action.",
        "A very substantial degree of monetary accommodation was seen to be still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up and durably support the convergence of headline inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "This entailed keeping the ECB’s policy rates unchanged, as well as confirming both the intended pace and horizon of APP purchases and the Governing Council’s forward guidance on policy rates and the APP.",
        "Accordingly, it was seen as paramount for the Governing Council to fully implement its asset purchases as decided in December 2016, while remaining prepared to adjust the APP in terms of size and/or duration should the outlook become less favourable, or should financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that it could be acknowledged that recourse to these options for providing further accommodation was becoming less likely, in line with the Governing Council’s evolving assessment.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that the Governing Council’s December decision to continue APP purchases but to reduce the monthly pace to €60 billion as of April 2017, as well as the forthcoming expiry of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the last of which would be conducted at the end of March 2017, already reflected disappearing deflationary risks and the Governing Council’s growing confidence in the outlook for the euro area economy.",
        "Members continued to view the implementation of the APP as proceeding smoothly.",
        "In this context, it was noted that developments at the short end of the yield curve had continued to show divergent dynamics across maturities and jurisdictions.",
        "In particular, the short end of the German government bond curve had continued to decline on account of safe-haven flows, high demand for high-quality liquid assets and the start of the APP purchases below the deposit facility rate, as had been explained by Mr Cœuré in his introduction.",
        "While these developments had to some degree been mitigated by the enhancements made to the Eurosystem’s securities lending facility, notably to accept cash collateral, they required further close monitoring.",
        "As regards communication, members generally agreed with the proposals made by Mr Praet in his introduction to keep the communication with respect to the Governing Council’s monetary policy stance and its forward guidance unchanged, while acknowledging that the economic expansion in the euro area had become more robust as the recovery was firming and broadening further, and that the risks to the economic outlook had become less pronounced, though they still remained tilted to the downside.",
        "An overall more positive tone in the Governing Council’s communication with respect to the economic prospects of the euro area was seen to be conducive to supporting confidence among businesses and consumers.",
        "At the same time, remaining uncertainties and fragilities, notably related to the external environment but also to political developments in the euro area, continued to call for caution.",
        "In this context, views were also exchanged on whether conditions had already improved to an extent that would allow for an attenuation of the “easing bias” embodied in the Governing Council’s forward guidance.",
        "In this regard, it was recalled that the Governing Council’s forward guidance represented a clarification of its policy reaction function that conveyed the Governing Council’s expectation about its policy intentions, which was dependent on its assessment of economic conditions and the risks to the price outlook.",
        "Against this background, the view was put forward that removing the downward bias regarding interest rates would be in line with a gradual and cautious adjustment of the Governing Council’s forward guidance, in step with changes in the Governing Council’s assessment.",
        "Keeping the Governing Council’s forward guidance well aligned with its evolving assessment was seen to underpin the consistency and credibility of the Governing Council’s communication, as both deflationary risks and associated market expectations of further rate cuts had largely vanished.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that the easing bias was an integral part of the Governing Council’s forward guidance and of the monetary policy stance, which contained an important forward-looking signalling component.",
        "Changes in the formulation at the current juncture could lead to an undue upward shift in market interest rates and tighten financial conditions to an extent that was not warranted by the prevailing outlook for price stability.",
        "Accordingly, there was broad agreement to keep the communication with respect to the Governing Council’s monetary policy stance and its forward guidance unchanged.",
        "This implied reiterating that asset purchases under the APP would continue at the current monthly pace of €80 billion until the end of the month, and from April 2017 at a monthly pace of €60 billion until the end of the year and, in any case, until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "This also included preserving the forward guidance on the ECB’s key policy rates and the APP as previously communicated.",
        "At the same time, economic conditions and the balance of risks had clearly improved, and, notably, deflationary risks had largely disappeared.",
        "As had been suggested by Mr Praet in his introduction, nuances in the communication could convey a more positive tone on the state of the euro area economy, while signalling less urgency for further monetary policy action.",
        "In particular, it was felt that there was no longer a need to emphasise the Governing Council’s readiness to act by using all the instruments available within its mandate, reflecting that negative scenarios, which could trigger further monetary policy action, were assessed to have become less likely, even if they could not be fully excluded.",
        "Looking ahead, it was recalled that, if the euro area economy were to recover further and as inflation proceeded further on its path towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner, a discussion on policy normalisation would become warranted in the future.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided to keep the interest rates on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council continued to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.",
        "Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirmed that it would continue to make purchases under the APP at the current monthly pace of €80 billion until the end of March and that, from April 2017, the net asset purchases were intended to continue at a monthly pace of €60 billion until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "The net purchases would be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP.",
        "If the outlook became less favourable, or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stood ready to increase its asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 6-7 September 2017 a positive underlying tone had persisted in financial markets.",
        "Two main factors seemed to have driven cross-asset price correlations: first, the return of the “reflation trade” that had pushed long-term interest rates, equities and the US dollar broadly higher; and, second, the euro area had been shielded to some extent from the upward pressure on yields, mainly owing to expectations of continued ECB monetary policy accommodation.",
        "In recent weeks there had been a significant reversal of the global retrenchment in sovereign bond yields that had been recorded over the summer.",
        "This global phenomenon was reflected in a substantial repricing in the US Treasury market.",
        "Ten-year US Treasury yields had increased by around 35 basis points since the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting.",
        "The euro area sovereign bond market had only been affected to a limited extent by this broad shift in global yields, in spite of the usual co-movement observed between the ten-year US Treasury yield and the ten-year German government bond yield.",
        "Euro area sovereign bond yields had not increased markedly since late September 2017 and market volatility remained very low.",
        "There was a strong market consensus that net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) would extend into 2018 and euro area sovereign bond spreads had generally declined in October.",
        "With regard to monetary policy expectations for the United States, after the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting the probability of a rate hike in December 2017 had risen from 25% to nearly 90%.",
        "A repricing of interest rate expectations had also taken place in the United Kingdom after the release of the minutes of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 14 September 2017, which indicated that a majority of the Committee members had expressed the view that some withdrawal of monetary stimulus was likely to be appropriate over the coming months.",
        "In the euro area there had been no significant change in market expectations regarding ECB policy rates.",
        "The first 10 basis point increase in the deposit facility rate continued to be priced in for the beginning of the second quarter of 2019.",
        "This confirmed that the Governing Council’s forward guidance had anchored euro area short-term rates very well despite changing market expectations of interest rate hikes in the United States and the United Kingdom.",
        "A stronger US growth outlook, as well as diverging monetary policy expectations between the euro area and the United States, had also had an impact on global equity and foreign exchange markets.",
        "Stock prices had continued to rise worldwide and the broad strengthening of the US dollar against most other currencies reaffirmed that developments in the United States, with regard to monetary policy and the budget outlook, had been dominating market sentiment lately.",
        "Mr Cœuré remarked that equity investors currently appeared to be trying to manage the trade-off between the search for yield and the risks related to stretched valuations.",
        "The latest surveys of fund managers suggested increasing outflows from US equity markets and continued inflows into stock markets in the euro area, Japan and emerging markets, especially in Asia.",
        "Balance of payments data in Europe also confirmed this diversification away from the US market towards the rest of the world with, in particular, continuing net inflows into European equities.",
        "Volatility, expressed in terms of standard deviation from18-year historical averages, had trended even lower in recent weeks across asset classes, such that it had now reached levels only seen a few times during the past 18 years.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "As regards the external environment, survey-based indicators pointed to stable global growth in the third quarter of 2017.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had remained unchanged in September, close to its long-term average.",
        "The global recovery continued to show signs of synchronisation.",
        "A similar broadening of momentum was seen in global trade; having slowed in the second quarter of 2017, it had rebounded according to the latest monthly data.",
        "Leading indicators continued to signal positive near-term prospects.",
        "Global inflation had picked up in August.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area had risen to 2.2%, driven by rising energy prices.",
        "Excluding food and energy, inflation had remained stable at 1.8%.",
        "Global producer price inflation excluding food and energy had picked up recently, which could signal some inflationary pressures in the pipeline.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had trended upwards since mid-2017, standing at USD 58.1 per barrel on 24 October.",
        "Over the same period the euro had depreciated by 1.1% vis-à-vis the US dollar, but had remained broadly stable in nominal effective terms against the currencies of the euro area’s 38 major trading partners.",
        "Exchange rate volatility had receded.",
        "Turning to the euro area economy, the economic expansion had continued to be solid.",
        "Euro area quarterly GDP growth in the second quarter of 2017 had been revised up from 0.6% to 0.7%, mostly on account of rounding effects.",
        "The rise in output had been broad-based across countries.",
        "Incoming data since the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting was generally better than expected.",
        "Favourable financing conditions and steady income and profit growth had continued to support domestic demand, amid a continuation of the labour market recovery.",
        "Looking ahead, survey indicators pointed to unabated growth momentum in the second half of 2017.",
        "According to the European Commission’s business and consumer surveys, confidence levels in all the main sectors of the euro area economy currently stood well above their historical averages.",
        "Confidence in the retail and household sectors was particularly strong and currently stood above the 90th percentile, signalling strong consumption dynamics in the third quarter of 2017.",
        "Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector was also rising further and firms were increasingly reporting shortages of labour and equipment as a constraint on production.",
        "Moreover, indicators pointed to an ongoing recovery in euro area exports, with stronger foreign demand offsetting the appreciation of the euro.",
        "A review of forecasts by other public and private institutions suggested that recent revisions to the euro area growth outlook had been positive.",
        "Turning to price developments, euro area HICP inflation had stood at 1.5% in September, unchanged from August, remaining below its long-term average of 1.7% since 1999.",
        "Excluding food and energy, HICP inflation had decreased slightly, from 1.2% in August to 1.1% in September.",
        "There was further evidence that a broad range of measures of underlying inflation had ticked up moderately, but they had yet to show more convincing signs of a sustained upward adjustment.",
        "Most measures clearly signalled a higher level of underlying inflation during recent months than at the end of 2016.",
        "Based on recent data, wage growth was picking up.",
        "Eurostat had revised growth in compensation per employee in the first quarter of 2017 up from 1.2% to 1.5%.",
        "In the second quarter annual growth in compensation per employee had increased further, to 1.6%.",
        "Since reaching a trough of 1.1% in the second quarter of 2016, growth in compensation per employee had increased continuously.",
        "As regards inflation expectations, the results of the October ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the fourth quarter of 2017 showed average inflation expectations of 1.5%, 1.4% and 1.6% for 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively, unchanged from the previous quarter.",
        "Average longer-term inflation expectations, which referred to 2022, had been revised up slightly, to 1.9%.",
        "Longer-term market-based measures of inflation expectations had steadily drifted upwards since the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting, with the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead up slightly, at 1.65%.",
        "Financial conditions had loosened somewhat since the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting, mainly on account of higher equity prices.",
        "Since that meeting, euro area equity prices had been supported by firming economic sentiment and by an easing of geopolitical tensions.",
        "In a historical context, valuations of euro area equities did not appear overly stretched.",
        "Financing conditions for euro area non-financial corporations (NFCs) had remained very favourable overall.",
        "The overall nominal cost of external financing for NFCs, comprising bank lending and the issuance of equity and market-based debt, was estimated to have declined further.",
        "Turning to money and credit, the latest data confirmed robust money growth.",
        "The gradual recovery in loan growth to the non-financial private sector had continued.",
        "Bank funding and the cost of borrowing had continued to be favourable.",
        "According to the results of the bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2017, credit standards had eased for loans to households, while they had remained broadly unchanged for loans to enterprises.",
        "Loan demand had continued to increase across all categories.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, the main news since the September monetary policy meeting had been the submission of the 2018 Draft Budgetary Plans to the European Commission.",
        "A preliminary assessment of the impact of these plans pointed to a more expansionary fiscal stance in 2018.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet recalled that since the 6-7 September Governing Council meeting, financial conditions had remained broadly stable overall, while exchange rate volatility had partly receded.",
        "At the same time, borrowing conditions for firms and households remained very supportive.",
        "Incoming information pointed to continued solid economic expansion in the second half of 2017.",
        "Risks to the growth outlook remained broadly balanced, with some upside risk in the near term.",
        "However, inflation developments still remained subdued.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation had ticked up moderately since early 2017, but they had yet to show more convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.",
        "In addition, the convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s aim remained conditional on a substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "In line with the forward guidance on the APP, an extension of the programme was warranted.",
        "The recalibration needed to take into account the fact that the degree of monetary accommodation was also determined by the stock of acquired assets with forthcoming reinvestments, and the forward guidance on policy rates.",
        "Regarding the first dimension, the pace, brighter economic prospects had increased confidence in the gradual convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "This called for a slower pace of purchases.",
        "Regarding the second dimension, the time horizon, monetary policy needed to be persistent and patient for underlying inflation pressures to build up gradually.",
        "This suggested a sufficiently long horizon of additional net purchases.",
        "Importantly, this would also anchor short-term interest rate expectations for a longer period, thereby reinforcing the forward guidance on policy rates.",
        "Regarding the third dimension, optionality, given the current assessment of the progress towards the inflation aim, it would be premature to set an end date for net purchases.",
        "Retaining the option to recalibrate the APP, if warranted, was consistent with the forward guidance on the APP.",
        "On the basis of these considerations, Mr Praet proposed to extend the net asset purchases at a monthly pace of €30 billion for nine months until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary; to keep the forward guidance on policy rates and on the APP unchanged; and to clarify the forward guidance on reinvestments, stating that the principal payments received under the APP would be reinvested for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary.",
        "Regarding communication, it was important to (a) point to the unabated growth momentum in the euro area economy, while inflation dynamics remained subdued; (b) underline that progress towards the inflation aim continued to require a substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation; (c) emphasise that an extension of the net asset purchases at a monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, reflected growing confidence in the gradual convergence of inflation towards the ECB’s aim, while at the same time supporting the continued build-up of underlying inflation pressures; (d) confirm the forward guidance on policy rates and on the APP; (e) communicate that the Governing Council would continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary; and (f) stress that the additional net asset purchases, together with the stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and the forward guidance on interest rates, would provide the monetary stimulus necessary for a sustained convergence of inflation towards the ECB’s aim.",
        "Complementing Mr Praet’s policy considerations, Mr Cœuré presented a proposal for extending the minimum period over which the fixed rate full allotment procedure would be applied in all regular refinancing operations, as the current horizon covered the period until the last reserve maintenance period of 2017, which would end on 20 January 2018.",
        "Mr Cœuré added that the application of the allotment procedure to the average main refinancing operation (MRO) rate for the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) should also be reaffirmed for the same new time horizon, i.e.",
        "until at least the last reserve maintenance period of 2019.",
        "In addition, Mr Cœuré introduced a proposal on enhancing the transparency of the APP with regard to redemptions and related reinvestments, and to private sector contributions.",
        "The suggestion was to publish the estimated monthly redemption amounts for each of the four components of the APP over a rolling 12-month horizon, as well as the most recent month’s actual redemption amount.",
        "Publication would begin with the release of the next monthly APP dataset on 6 November 2017.",
        "Moreover, the history of actual redemption amounts since the start of the APP would be published for market participants to have a comprehensive overview of the redemption profile.",
        "Furthermore, three aspects should be highlighted.",
        "First, that published monthly purchase amounts were likely to become more volatile relative to the ECB’s capital key, owing to the flexibility granted to the NCBs and the ECB by the Governing Council to spread out the reinvestment of redemptions.",
        "Second, as a rule, reinvestments under the public sector purchase programme would take place in the same jurisdiction as principal redemptions, at least until the end of the net purchase period.",
        "Finally, the purchase volumes under the three private sector purchase programmes would remain sizeable and the private sector programmes would not be adjusted in strict proportion to the overall scaling-down of the APP.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "According to recent data and survey results, the economic expansion had continued to be solid and broad-based across countries and sectors, supporting the positive outlook for growth embedded in the September 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "Incoming information pointed to stronger than expected growth momentum in the second half of the year.",
        "The risks to the euro area growth outlook were assessed to have remained broadly balanced.",
        "Commenting in more detail on the outlook and risks for the external environment, members agreed that global economic activity was improving, with the upswing showing further signs of synchronisation.",
        "In particular, the improvement in emerging market economies was highlighted.",
        "In this context, it was underlined that global trade had recently been growing at rates above those of global activity.",
        "It was also noted that emerging market economies were making a significant contribution to global producer price developments.",
        "More broadly, there had been a modest pick-up in global inflation.",
        "Overall, however, the balance of risks to the global economic outlook over the medium term was considered to remain tilted to the downside.",
        "This reflected, inter alia, the possibility of balance sheet adjustments in a number of emerging market economies; uncertainties about macroeconomic policy choices in the United States and potential spillovers to the global economy; and a number of uncertainties within Europe, including those surrounding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU.",
        "As regards developments in the euro exchange rate, while still considered a downside risk, members took note that exchange rate volatility had receded since the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting.",
        "Recent movements were assessed to be driven primarily by developments in the United States, rather than by shocks originating in the euro area.",
        "Turning to the euro area, members agreed that recent indicators had provided further confirmation of increasingly robust and broad-based growth, and had again been generally stronger than expected.",
        "Real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2017 had been revised upwards slightly, to 0.7%, quarter on quarter.",
        "Survey data continued to point to solid growth in the period ahead, with both the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator and the composite output PMI standing well above their long-term averages and currently at levels above, or close to, their post-crisis peaks.",
        "Households and firms appeared to be very optimistic about the economy and the outlook, suggesting that growth momentum was likely to remain strong.",
        "Given recent better than expected outcomes for economic activity, members considered the possibility that real GDP growth in the second half of 2017 could also turn out to be higher than previously expected.",
        "In addition, incoming information appeared to validate the cautious approach taken by ECB staff in the September 2017 projections regarding the possible negative effects of the euro’s earlier appreciation on growth and inflation.",
        "It was recalled that labour markets had improved further, with around seven million jobs created in the euro area since the start of the recovery.",
        "Although the euro area unemployment rate had been unchanged in August, at 9.1%, it stood at its lowest level since early 2009.",
        "Reference was made to survey evidence of an incipient tightening in labour markets.",
        "It was highlighted that firms considered weak demand less of a factor constraining activity.",
        "It was pointed out that the economic expansion had been under way for 17 consecutive quarters and the output gap was closing steadily, as actual growth rates had been exceeding potential growth for some time.",
        "Progress on private sector deleveraging in the euro area was seen as a further positive factor for the sustainability of the ongoing expansion.",
        "In particular, it was noted that, in contrast to the evidence for G20 countries as a whole, as presented recently by the IMF in its October 2017 Global Financial Stability Report, household and corporate debt ratios for the euro area were still declining.",
        "Nonetheless, leverage dynamics differed considerably across euro area countries.",
        "Regarding the main components of demand, private consumption growth had remained strong, underpinned by ongoing gains in employment and disposable income.",
        "The upswing in business investment was continuing to benefit from very favourable financing conditions, as well as improvements in corporate profitability.",
        "Construction investment had also strengthened.",
        "Meanwhile, euro area exports were being supported by the broad-based global recovery, notwithstanding the dampening effect of the earlier appreciation of the euro.",
        "Moreover, fiscal plans in a number of countries that suggested a slightly more expansionary stance were mentioned as a reason to expect higher growth in the medium term.",
        "Overall, risks to the euro area growth outlook were considered to remain broadly balanced.",
        "On the one hand, there were some upside risks to activity associated with the strong cyclical momentum, as reflected in recent survey data, which could lead to further positive growth surprises.",
        "On the other hand, downside risks continued to be related mainly to global factors and developments in foreign exchange markets.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation were likely to decline temporarily towards the end of the year, mainly reflecting negative base effects in energy prices.",
        "Annual HICP inflation excluding food and energy had declined slightly, to 1.1% in September 2017, following 1.2% in August and July.",
        "Members agreed that, although measures of underlying inflation in the euro area had ticked up moderately in recent months, overall they had remained at subdued levels despite benign growth developments.",
        "Moreover, there were not yet sufficient convincing signs of a sustained convergence towards levels compatible with the ECB’s inflation aim.",
        "However, underlying inflation was expected to continue to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the gradual absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth.",
        "In particular, it was suggested that the positive incoming information on activity provided the basis for greater confidence about the baseline outlook for inflation.",
        "It was noted that measures of underlying inflation had remained stable despite the earlier appreciation of the euro.",
        "There were as yet no signs that lower prices for imported consumer goods resulting from the appreciation were feeding through to domestic producer prices.",
        "At the same time, subdued inflation developments could be considered indicative of the still sizeable degree of slack in labour and product markets.",
        "In addition, although measures of underlying inflation had ticked up somewhat, they remained below what appeared consistent with the ECB’s inflation aim.",
        "Wage growth, as reflected in annual increases in compensation per employee, now exhibited an upward trend, standing at 1.6% in the second quarter of 2017, following upward revisions to earlier data releases.",
        "Cost pressures were expected to increase gradually as the economic expansion continued, even though wage dynamics were still assessed to be somewhat subdued.",
        "Members again drew attention to the discrepancy between the ongoing expansion in economic activity and the relatively subdued inflation and wage dynamics, which was also observed in other major economies.",
        "A number of explanatory factors had previously been put forward to account for this discrepancy, including the role of external price shocks, greater labour market slack and lags in the process of wage and price formation.",
        "However, concern was again expressed about the possibility of changes in the inflation process which might lead to low inflation rates being more persistent, inter alia, owing to the degree of global slack, the effects of digitisation on retail activity and structural changes in the labour market.",
        "It was deemed important to continue monitoring the extent to which these various factors might be temporary or more lasting, and likely to be of a more structural nature.",
        "Members also referred to recent developments in inflation expectations.",
        "Both longer-term market-based measures and survey-based measures had been relatively stable.",
        "According to the Survey of Professional Forecasters for the fourth quarter of 2017, inflation expectations five years ahead had increased slightly, to stand at 1.9%, compared with 1.8% in the previous survey, while the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead currently stood marginally above the level observed prior to the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting.",
        "It was considered that the risk of deflation and the associated risk of an unanchoring of expectations had largely disappeared.",
        "At the same time, concerns were reiterated that a prolonged period of weak inflation could feed into price and wage-setting, with long-lasting adverse consequences.",
        "Overall, members continued to emphasise that, while the ongoing economic expansion increased confidence that inflation dynamics would strengthen over time, patience, persistence and prudence were still required, as this process was expected to take time and remained contingent on a substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) had continued to expand at a robust pace, which, as in previous months, reflected mainly growth in its most liquid components.",
        "The gradual recovery in loan growth to the private sector, visible since the start of 2014, was proceeding amid a further pick-up in the growth of loans to NFCs.",
        "The further expansion in credit continued to be supported by very favourable borrowing costs for firms and households, which had remained at, or near, historic lows, and a further easing in credit conditions.",
        "Reference was made to the latest bank lending survey, which indicated that in the third quarter of 2017 banks’ credit standards had eased further for loans to households, while they had remained broadly unchanged for loans to enterprises.",
        "Banks’ overall terms and conditions on new loans had also continued to ease for all categories of loans.",
        "Moreover, loan growth continued to be supported by strong demand across all categories.",
        "However, the observation was also made that, from a prudential perspective, caution was warranted as regards the implications of the very easy credit conditions and low lending rates for banks’ capacity to properly price and account for credit risk.",
        "All of this suggested that the pass-through of the policy measures put in place since June 2014 was continuing and was providing significant support to borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing and credit flows across the euro area.",
        "In this context, it was highlighted that the monetary policy measures had been particularly successful in supporting lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), while larger firms relied less on bank credit in view of the very favourable market funding conditions, which were underpinned by the purchases under the ECB’s corporate sector purchase plan (CSPP).",
        "Evidence from the recent bank lending survey indicated that banks’ loan volumes were increasingly directed towards SMEs.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that the continued solid and broad-based expansion of the euro area economy, amid supportive financing conditions, had clearly reinforced confidence that inflation would eventually head to levels consistent with the ECB’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "At the same time, inflation dynamics remained subdued, with longer-term inflation expectations appearing to be still some distance away from the inflation aim and the recovery in inflation still reliant on supportive monetary conditions.",
        "Therefore, there was broad agreement that an ample degree of monetary stimulus was still needed to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that the improved outlook and confidence that inflation was approaching the Governing Council’s aim were consistent with a less intensive use of specific monetary policy instruments.",
        "The proposed package of measures was generally seen to be appropriate for delivering the necessary stimulus for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation over the medium term, in particular to avoid validating inflation expectations below levels consistent with the inflation aim.",
        "At the same time, a careful and gradual recalibration was warranted in a more benign economic environment, in line with the Governing Council’s established “reaction function”, as shown on earlier occasions when the pace of the APP had been adjusted, up or down, depending on developments in the data.",
        "In this context, it was highlighted that the proposed APP recalibration from the year-end was in line with prevailing market expectations and was hence unlikely to trigger significant movements in financial prices.",
        "It was, however, recalled that monetary policy decisions needed to be firmly based on the Governing Council’s judgement on what was required to achieve its medium-term objective, without giving undue weight to market expectations which, in turn, could be highly sensitive to central bank communication.",
        "Against this background, a large majority of members supported the proposal made by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "This comprised an extension of the net asset purchases, at a monthly pace of €30 billion, for nine months until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary; unchanged forward guidance on policy rates and on the APP; and a clarification of the forward guidance on the reinvestment of principal payments.",
        "In discussing this proposal, a range of views was expressed on specific elements.",
        "As regards the pace, the view was put forward that a reduction in monthly APP purchases was consistent with a larger impact of a given flow of net purchases, reflecting the growing stock of acquired assets and fewer bonds remaining available in the market.",
        "As the Eurosystem had already acquired a sizeable stock of assets, which would increase further over the coming months and would be maintained via reinvestments for as long as necessary, monetary policy would remain expansionary even with a slower monthly pace of purchases.",
        "The point was also made, however, that the asset purchase programmes might be subject to diminishing returns, as market conditions, the economy and the inflation outlook improved over time.",
        "Against this background, some initial preferences were expressed for a smaller overall envelope of intended APP purchases, as well as for a different monthly pace of purchases for a given intended envelope.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that a higher monthly purchase volume from January 2018 implied a more gradual reduction in the pace of purchases, thereby limiting the risk of “cliff effects”, which could arise from too abrupt a reduction in the purchase volume.",
        "On the other hand, some initial preferences were also expressed for a slower monthly pace of purchases from the start of 2018, or a declining path of purchases as of January 2018, as better suited to conducting the asset purchases over an extended horizon, or to exercising the optionality embedded in the Governing Council's forward guidance, within the agreed parameters governing APP purchases.",
        "All in all, broad agreement emerged among members that the proposed reduction to a monthly purchase volume of €30 billion could be considered adequate.",
        "The slower pace reflected, first and foremost, the growing confidence in the gradual convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "While there was a continued need for monetary policy to remain accommodative, robust growth momentum, very favourable financial market and borrowing conditions, dissipated deflation risks and nascent signs of rising price pressures made a strong case for scaling back the intensity of the monthly purchases.",
        "As regards the purchase horizon, members generally agreed with the proposed nine-month extension.",
        "While the strong, broad-based economic momentum had clearly increased the Governing Council’s confidence in a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council had to remain patient and persistent in order to continue to provide the necessary accommodation in the face of remaining uncertainties.",
        "A horizon of a further nine months of net purchases was considered sufficiently long to ensure a more lasting stimulus, supporting a gradual rise in inflation, also in view of the expected V-shaped pattern, and in the presence of structural factors preventing a more dynamic pick-up in inflation.",
        "In this regard, the envisaged purchase horizon served to underline the Governing Council’s commitment to its price stability objective and also entailed a prolonged market presence in view of possible future shocks.",
        "In addition, it was remarked that, in the current, more favourable financial and economic environment, investors had likely become more patient and discounted future purchases less heavily, which supported the effectiveness of a purchase plan to be executed at lower volumes for a longer period.",
        "Finally, spreading bond purchases over a longer horizon was also seen as having important implications for policy rate expectations via the sequencing embodied in the Governing Council’s forward guidance, which so far had provided a useful anchor for market expectations of future policy rates.",
        "On this basis, a longer life span for the net asset purchases should further reinforce the Governing Council’s forward guidance on policy rates, thereby enhancing the necessary monetary stimulus by anchoring rate expectations “well past” the end of the net asset purchases.",
        "At the same time, caution was expressed concerning an overly long horizon, which might be perceived as unduly limiting the Governing Council’s flexibility to respond appropriately to evolving data.",
        "Arguments were also put forward in favour of alternative purchase horizons.",
        "On the one hand, it was noted that the very robust economic recovery could be used to argue in favour of a shorter purchase horizon and, hence, a potentially swifter phasing-out of asset purchases in the future.",
        "On the other hand, the expected very gradual rise in inflation over the coming years, including a V-shaped pattern in the early part of the horizon, argued in favour of a somewhat longer purchase horizon, thereby providing more prolonged monetary support to accompany the sustained adjustment in inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "With regard to the dimension of optionality, different positions were put forward as to whether an open-ended state-contingent formulation remained appropriate or whether the announcement of an end date was preferable.",
        "A large majority of members supported keeping the current formulation of the Governing Council’s forward guidance on the APP in place, whereby the purchases were intended to be conducted until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "Allowing the path of the APP to be adapted in a data-contingent manner and, therefore, maintaining the flexibility to react to future shocks was seen to be an integral part of the Governing Council’s established “reaction function” and consistent with previous adjustments to the programme.",
        "Given the current assessment of the inflation outlook, when more convincing evidence of price pressures had yet to be observed in the data and uncertainties still prevailed, it was seen as more prudent to keep the flexibility to extend the programme further, if necessary.",
        "Therefore, retaining the open-endedness of the APP underscored the Governing Council’s steadfast commitment to preserve the degree of accommodation needed for inflation to return towards levels that were below, but close to, 2%.",
        "It was cautioned that any doubt about the Governing Council’s price stability commitment could entrench inflation expectations at low levels.",
        "Together with a lower equilibrium real interest rate, this could hamper the Governing Council’s capacity to respond to future shocks.",
        "In addition, the announcement of an end date could induce market participants to frontload possible price adjustments, which might lead to an undue tightening in financial conditions.",
        "In this overall context, broad support was also expressed for keeping the easing bias of the APP in place.",
        "It was seen as important to signal the Governing Council’s continued readiness and capacity to act in response to contingencies by changing the pace and/or horizon of APP purchases, notably if the outlook became less favourable, or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.",
        "Arguments were also put forward by a few members, reflecting also further members’ initial preferences, in favour of announcing a clear end date for the APP.",
        "Such an end date was viewed to be well justified in anticipation of further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation on the basis of the better than expected growth momentum, diminishing risks and continued favourable financing conditions for the real economy.",
        "Even if market participants were mostly not expecting an announcement of an end date, the impact on financial markets was seen to be limited.",
        "In addition, the economic expansion was judged to be sufficiently robust to cope with somewhat tighter financial conditions.",
        "An announcement of an end date was also seen as being consistent with a data-contingent conduct of monetary policy, as it would not preclude the Governing Council’s flexibility to react to incoming data in the future by adapting the monetary policy stance more broadly.",
        "Moreover, a view was put forward that there was no longer a case for an open-ended extension, unless deflation risks were to re-emerge.",
        "It was also argued that the balance of costs and benefits was becoming increasingly unfavourable as time progressed.",
        "Therefore, while it was acknowledged that continued accommodation was still needed, it was important to end the programme in a timely but orderly fashion.",
        "Some concerns were also expressed that the open-ended nature of the APP might generate expectations of further extensions as the intended end date of the programme approached.",
        "From the current perspective that did not appear justified in the absence of major new shocks.",
        "Hence, expectations needed to be managed carefully, depending on progress with a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.",
        "At the same time, as on previous occasions, it was highlighted that the in-built flexibility of the programme permitted the Governing Council to maintain the programme’s open-endedness and to respond to adverse contingencies, if necessary.",
        "As regards the composition of the asset purchases beyond the year-end, broad agreement was expressed with the proposal made by Mr Cœuré that the purchase volumes under the three private sector purchase programmes should remain sizeable.",
        "In this context, a remark was made that the CSPP was perceived as favouring large companies over SMEs.",
        "It was, however, clarified that purchases under the CSPP were conducted in a non-distortive and non-discriminatory manner, whereby bonds were purchased in line with the market capitalisation of the respective bond issuance.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that corporate bond purchases had been very effective in strengthening the credit-easing impact of the APP, contributing to the very favourable financing conditions of NFCs more broadly.",
        "This not only applied to the firms whose bonds were eligible for the CSPP, but to the whole corporate sector, as the improved market funding conditions for large firms had important spillover effects for the availability and pricing of bank credit to NFCs, including SMEs.",
        "Overall, it was agreed that some further assessment of the CSPP’s impact on market functioning and pricing should be carried out, also with a view to identifying relevant monetary policy transmission channels.",
        "Broad agreement was expressed among members to maintain the forward guidance on interest rates unchanged, as proposed by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "It was recalled that the forward guidance on policy rates formed an integral part of the overall monetary policy stance, which included the embedded sequencing of policy instruments.",
        "The view was reiterated by several members that the present forward guidance linking the APP purchases to the criteria for a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation should be replaced over time with a reference to the monetary policy stance, in all its dimensions.",
        "In this respect, it needed to be highlighted that the monetary policy stance would remain highly accommodative via the accumulated stock of assets and the forward guidance on policy rates, which would continue to accompany the cycle and the return of inflation to the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "As regards the reinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities, there was broad agreement on the proposal to clarify the forward guidance on the Eurosystem’s future reinvestments.",
        "It needed to be stressed that reinvestments would be conducted for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary.",
        "This was seen to contribute to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "In this context it was highlighted that, together with the forward guidance on interest rates, maintaining the accumulated stock of assets continued to ensure a highly accommodative monetary policy stance, which would continue to accompany the economic cycle and the return of inflation to the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Members welcomed the proposal made by Mr Cœuré to supplement the recalibration of the APP with increased transparency on the profile of redemptions and implied reinvestment amounts.",
        "In particular, in the light of the prevailing uncertainty among market participants over future reinvestments by the Eurosystem, there was broad support for the monthly publication of the expected monthly redemption amounts under the APP over a rolling 12-month horizon.",
        "This was seen as particularly important at the current juncture, given the increasing relevance of reinvestments owing to the sizeable redemptions that would be seen in 2018.",
        "Together with the announcement on the pace of net purchases, the additional information on redemptions would provide market participants with a precise indication of the expected gross purchases of the Eurosystem.",
        "The principal redemptions would be reinvested by the Eurosystem in a flexible and timely manner, depending on market liquidity conditions.",
        "Finally, members agreed to extend the fixed rate full allotment procedure for the MROs and three-month LTROs for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the last reserve maintenance period of 2019, as proposed by Mr Cœuré.",
        "The rates in these LTROs would be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO.",
        "The extension of the fixed rate full allotment procedure was seen as ensuring the continued smooth implementation of monetary policy as one element of the non-standard monetary policy measures in place, while safeguarding conditions in euro area money markets.",
        "It was argued, however, that the fixed rate full allotment procedure had become less relevant at the current juncture, given the prevailing levels of excess liquidity and overall improvements in banks’ financial soundness.",
        "As regards communication, there was wide agreement among members with the proposals put forward by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "It was thus seen as important to stress the unabated growth momentum, including the near-term upside risks, which clearly increased the Governing Council’s confidence in the sustained convergence of inflation towards its inflation aim.",
        "At the same time, it had to be acknowledged that inflation dynamics remained subdued overall.",
        "Accordingly, it needed to be highlighted that progress towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim still required an ample degree of monetary stimulus, which supported the Governing Council’s recalibration at the present meeting of its policy instruments beyond the year-end.",
        "Regarding the APP, it needed to be emphasised that its recalibration was appropriate, reflecting, on the one hand, the increasingly robust and broad-based economic expansion, an uptick in measures of underlying inflation and the continued effective pass-through of the ECB’s policy measures to the financing conditions of the real economy, and, on the other hand, the continued need for patience and persistence.",
        "Hence, it had to be underlined that the recalibration of policy instruments was entirely consistent with maintaining a substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation, preserving favourable financing conditions.",
        "In this context, and in the light of the reduction in the monthly pace of net asset purchases, it was seen as important to highlight that the monetary stimulus necessary to achieve a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation was provided by the full range of monetary policy measures in place, notably by the additional net asset purchases, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and by the forward guidance on interest rates.",
        "In this regard, the unchanged forward guidance on policy rates and on the APP needed to be highlighted, while underlining the clarification of the forward guidance on reinvestments.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the MROs and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and −0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council continued to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.",
        "As regards non-standard monetary policy measures, purchases under the APP would continue at the current monthly pace of €60 billion until the end of December 2017.",
        "From January 2018 the net asset purchases would continue at a monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "Purchase volumes under the three private sector programmes would remain sizeable.",
        "If the outlook became less favourable, or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stood ready to increase the APP in terms of size and/or duration.",
        "The Eurosystem would reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary.",
        "This would contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "The MROs and the three-month LTROs would continue to be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the last reserve maintenance period of 2019.",
        "Furthermore, the Governing Council decided to publish each month, starting immediately, the expected monthly redemption amounts under the APP over a rolling 12-month horizon.",
        "It also decided to provide additional details on the implementation of the programme, reflecting the ECB’s commitment to increase transparency further, via a separate press release (“Additional information on asset purchase programme”).",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 8-9 March 2017, longer-term US and euro area government bond yields had been on a declining trend before reversing some of their earlier decreases as of mid-April, while equity markets had remained buoyant.",
        "Despite this reversal, yields on ten-year US Treasuries and ten-year German government bonds remained below levels observed after the March meeting.",
        "At the same time, intra-euro area sovereign credit spreads had narrowed for some jurisdictions amid measurable volatility.",
        "Since movements at the short end of the yield curve had been less pronounced, the steepening of yield curves observed since September 2016 had been partly reversed in past weeks, in particular in the United States.",
        "Two main factors were likely to have weighed on the level of sovereign yields.",
        "The first factor related to uncertainty over the global growth outlook.",
        "While economic sentiment remained very positive overall, a notable break in the stream of positive economic data surprises across some G10 jurisdictions had been observed over the previous few weeks, especially in the United States.",
        "Moreover, the range of US growth forecasts for the first quarter of 2017 had widened, which reflected increased uncertainty.",
        "The second factor related to developments in inflation expectations, which had fallen marginally in the case of the United States, while the decline had been more pronounced for the euro area.",
        "The euro area five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had fallen back to around 1.6%.",
        "This decline had materialised in an environment in which spot oil prices had been rising for most of the period.",
        "The recent downward movement in euro area market-based inflation expectations was likely also to reflect diminishing prospects for global reflation.",
        "The cost to investors of protecting themselves against inflation in the euro area, which had increased markedly following the outcome of the US presidential election, had peaked in mid-February 2017.",
        "Meanwhile, the cost of protection against deflation had remained stable at very low levels.",
        "In this respect, the recent decline in inflation expectations was likely to be of a different nature than those observed in earlier episodes, but it nevertheless had contributed to the fall in expected forward inflation rates and, therefore, in medium and long-term nominal yields in recent weeks.",
        "Developments in inflation expectations and uncertainty over the growth outlook might have also affected, in conjunction with other factors, market expectations about the outlook for monetary policy in both the United States and the euro area.",
        "Ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on 15 March 2017, there had been widespread market expectations of an upward adjustment in the Committee’s projection for the Fed funds rate.",
        "These market-based expectations partially unwound after the meeting.",
        "Similar shifts had been observed for the euro area.",
        "Initially, forward EONIA swap rates had risen somewhat, as market participants had begun to price in an increase in the ECB’s deposit facility rate by May 2018.",
        "However, these developments had since reversed, following weaker-than-expected inflation data and a series of statements by Governing Council members that were considered to confirm the current policy stance and forward guidance.",
        "Volatility in equity markets had spiked both in the United States and in the euro area at the end of March and in early April, and was now back to low levels, suggesting that investors’ risk appetite had improved.",
        "Furthermore, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 in the United States had plateaued at record high levels, with the price/earnings ratio reaching its highest level in seven years, equity valuations in the euro area were close to their average for the last five years.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "With regard to the external environment, data that had become available since the 8-9 March Governing Council meeting pointed to a re-synchronised global economic recovery across major regions.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had risen further to 53.7 in the first quarter of 2017, up from 53.3 in the fourth quarter of 2016.",
        "Trade in goods had expanded at the strongest pace in a decade in February 2017.",
        "Inflation had continued to pick up gradually in the OECD area, increasing to 2.5% in February from 2.3% in January, while inflation excluding food and energy had remained at 1.9%.",
        "Both Brent crude oil prices and non-oil commodity prices had declined overall from their early March levels, while the euro had appreciated by 1.0% in nominal effective terms vis-à-vis the currencies of 38 of the euro area’s major trading partners.",
        "Turning to the euro area, survey information, notably on business and consumer sentiment, confirmed that the economic recovery was becoming increasingly solid, mainly driven by domestic demand on the back of continued improvements in labour markets.",
        "Real GDP had increased by 0.5% (revised up by 0.1 percentage point) quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016, after 0.4% in the third quarter.",
        "Employment had increased by 0.3% quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the unemployment rate continued to decline, easing to 9.5% in February 2017 after 9.6% in January.",
        "As a result, private consumption remained strong, while investment should continue to benefit from very favourable financing conditions.",
        "This was also underpinned by higher readings for the composite output and employment PMIs, the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator and consumer confidence in the first few months of 2017.",
        "The improving external environment was expected to provide additional support to euro area economic activity.",
        "Euro area annual HICP inflation had declined to 1.5% in March, down from 2.0% in February, mainly reflecting lower annual energy and unprocessed food price inflation, but also likely calendar effects owing to the timing of the Easter holidays, relating primarily to the decline in services price inflation.",
        "Annual HICP inflation excluding food and energy had declined to 0.7% in March, down from 0.9% in the preceding three months.",
        "While producer price indicators had shown some signs of a build-up of upward pressures early in the pricing chain, domestic producer price inflation for non-food consumer goods had not yet shown clear signs of an upward trend.",
        "Wage growth had been picking up slightly from a subdued level.",
        "Inflation forecasts by other public and private institutions that had become available since the Governing Council’s 8-9 March meeting remained below the March ECB staff projections for 2017 and 2018, but were broadly in line for 2019.",
        "As regards inflation expectations, compared with the January round the ECB’s April Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the second quarter of 2017 showed upward revisions, to 1.6% in 2017 and 1.7% in 2019, while the outlook for 2018 and expectations five years ahead remained unchanged at 1.5% and 1.8% respectively.",
        "By contrast, market-based measures of inflation expectations had decreased overall since the Governing Council’s early March meeting, despite some more recent increases.",
        "The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had fallen by around 10 basis points to 1.6% since then, while remaining considerably higher than in summer 2016 but low relative to historical averages.",
        "With regard to financial and financing conditions, the EONIA forward curve currently stood close to its level prior to the 8-9 March Governing Council meeting, following some volatility after the meeting.",
        "Likewise, the overall nominal cost of external financing for non-financial corporations had remained broadly stable at very low levels.",
        "Bank lending rates remained very favourable for both households and firms, with reduced dispersion across euro area countries, showing that banks had been passing on the decline in their funding costs to the euro area economy through lower lending rates.",
        "The annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 had remained broadly unchanged in February 2017, at 4.7%, after 4.8% in January, with robust M1 growth as the main driver.",
        "The gradual recovery in loan growth had been supported by significant decreases in bank lending rates since summer 2014, as well as by rising demand for bank loans.",
        "According to the April 2017 bank lending survey for the euro area, loan growth had been supported by looser lending conditions and increasing demand across all loan categories in the first quarter of 2017. Credit standards had eased for all loan categories in the first quarter of 2017, driven mainly by competitive pressures.",
        "At the same time, the ongoing consolidation of financial and non-financial balance sheets and the continued need for adjustment of bank business models in some euro area countries remained a drag on loan growth.",
        "Finally, the fiscal stance in the euro area, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was expected to be broadly neutral over the 2017-19 projection horizon.",
        "Government deficit and debt ratios were still expected to be on a downward path over the horizon, owing to declining interest payments and improving cyclical conditions.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet concluded that the Governing Council’s monetary policy had contributed crucially to preserving the very favourable financing conditions that supported the economic upturn and the sustained adjustment in the inflation path towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Data that had become available since the Governing Council’s 8-9 March meeting confirmed that the cyclical recovery was becoming increasingly solid.",
        "In particular, survey data pointed to some acceleration in growth in the first half of the year.",
        "Downside risks to growth had further diminished.",
        "Headline inflation had been volatile over recent months, largely on account of energy and food price developments.",
        "Despite the cyclical recovery, underlying price pressures remained subdued, as unutilised resources continued to weigh on domestic wage and price formation.",
        "Underlying inflation was expected to rise only slowly over the medium term and its upward path remained conditional on the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "As the evidence continued to indicate insufficient progress towards a durable and self-sustaining convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s medium-term aim, it was important for the time being to confirm the present monetary policy stance, including the forward guidance.",
        "Accordingly, it needed to be emphasised that the economic recovery was increasingly solid, that the risks to the growth outlook had further diminished, while being still tilted to the downside, and that underlying price pressures remained subdued and the inflation path conditional on the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Finally, Mr Praet considered that, at the current juncture, the Governing Council had to be particularly cautious regarding the future evolution of its policy communication.",
        "After a prolonged period of exceptional monetary policy accommodation, financial market participants were particularly sensitive to any perceived change in the future course of monetary policy.",
        "Any substantial change in communication needed to be motivated by some more evidence that the present indications of acceleration in activity found confirmation in hard data and fed through to a sustainable adjustment in inflation.",
        "Looking ahead to the Governing Council’s 7-8 June monetary policy meeting, a new round of Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections and a new assessment of the risks to the outlook would become available to inform discussions on the way forward.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Members exchanged views on the outlook and risks for the external environment, also taking into account the latest IMF World Economic Outlook, which had been released after the Governing Council meeting in early March, and the related discussions at the IMF spring meetings.",
        "It was underlined that the latest data on global activity and trade pointed to stronger global growth momentum and a re-synchronisation of the recovery, between global growth and trade and between advanced and emerging economies.",
        "However, the external outlook was considered to be still subject to elevated uncertainty, and the balance of risks to the outlook for global growth was assessed to remain on the downside.",
        "Among the factors that continued to contribute to this uncertainty were the scope and timing of the future policy choices of the new US Administration, the economic impact of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, the rebalancing of demand and the transition towards lower growth rates in China, and developments in other emerging market economies.",
        "In particular, reference was made in the discussion to the high degree of uncertainty surrounding short-term developments in the US economy, which reflected a significant divergence between hard and soft data for the United States.",
        "Moreover, financial market participants and investors were reassessing the outlook for US growth and inflation, as it appeared that US data were no longer exceeding market expectations, and there was still considerable uncertainty surrounding the new US Administration’s policies, including the prospects for fiscal stimulus, and their likely expansionary effects.",
        "Turning to the euro area, members generally agreed that the assessment of the growth situation had improved, with the latest data providing confirmation that the cyclical recovery of the euro area economy was progressing broadly in line with the baseline in the March 2017 ECB staff projections and possibly more favourably in the first half of the year.",
        "It was noted that survey data covering several months, which had become available since the Governing Council’s meeting in early March, suggested that euro area growth in 2017 could be stronger than had been expected at the start of the year, while the labour market had also continued to improve, providing support for consumer spending.",
        "It was also remarked that developments in the Citigroup economic surprise index for the euro area had continued to come out on the upside.",
        "In the latest SPF the outlook for growth in 2017 and 2018 had been revised upwards and was now more in line with the March projections.",
        "All in all, the medium-term growth outlook in the ECB staff projections, including the expected closing of the output gap, appeared to remain broadly valid.",
        "In addition, the firming and broadening of the economic expansion across countries and sectors should make the euro area economy more robust to any negative shocks.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that caution was still warranted, as the positive signals given by the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator and the purchasing managers’ surveys had yet to be confirmed by hard data.",
        "Commenting on the components of demand, it was underlined that the expansion in the euro area economy was primarily underpinned by domestic demand, with the contribution to growth from the external sector being much smaller.",
        "Improving corporate profitability and very favourable financing conditions should support a recovery in investment looking ahead.",
        "As Mr Praet had highlighted in his introduction, however, investment dynamics had been subdued for a number of quarters, which was seen as a source of concern.",
        "In this context, it was underlined that, when assessing euro area investment dynamics, it was important to take account of statistical factors which had strongly influenced investment in one small euro area economy last year.",
        "As regards consumption, it was noted that the nominal disposable income of households had been rising more strongly than in the previous recovery in 2011, and even more so in real terms.",
        "In particular, employment growth, which had also been benefiting from past structural reforms, was having a lasting positive impact on the real labour income of households and on private consumption.",
        "However, it was highlighted that, looking ahead, disposable income growth depended on nominal wage growth and that the strong pick-up in wage growth assumed in the March 2017 projection baseline was uncertain.",
        "Therefore, also the outlook for activity contained in the projections could turn out to be overly optimistic unless consumption was supported by a lower saving ratio, compensating for the impact of higher energy prices on real disposable income.",
        "Turning to the risk assessment, there was general agreement among members that downside risks to the growth outlook had further diminished since the Governing Council’s meeting in early March, while a range of views was expressed on the characterisation of the balance of risks.",
        "It was broadly agreed that risks to the euro area economy stemming from the external environment remained on the downside.",
        "However, there were differing perceptions of domestic risks to the euro area economy and, hence, of the overall balance of risks to economic activity in the euro area.",
        "With regard to domestic risks, it was argued that the reliance of the ECB staff projections on stronger wage growth and a lower household saving ratio pointed to some downside risks to domestic demand looking ahead.",
        "It was also considered that there could be a downside risk to activity arising from the weaker than expected recent developments in private sector business investment.",
        "However, overall, there was wide agreement that downside risks to activity were diminishing, with the latest data and surveys supporting the assessment that the euro area economic recovery was becoming increasingly solid and suggesting that, at least in the short term, growth in the euro area could turn out to be stronger than previously expected.",
        "There was also some discussion about the evolution of political uncertainty in the euro area and the extent to which this could have implications for the medium-term outlook for growth and inflation.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that, while the Governing Council should factor into its assessment any implications of political uncertainty for the outlook for price stability over the medium term, there was only limited evidence that political uncertainty had a significant negative effect on economic activity, as, for example, illustrated by the muted economic impact to date following the outcome of the UK referendum on EU membership.",
        "On this basis, no significant rebound in growth was to be expected if and when political uncertainty receded.",
        "Against this background, while there was broad agreement that the configuration of risks to euro area activity had improved overall, some members considered that the risks to real GDP could now be characterised as broadly balanced, in particular given the improvement in recent data and indicators and the decline in political uncertainty.",
        "Other members maintained that downside risks to growth still prevailed and that a change in the risk assessment was premature in view of continued risks and uncertainties, even if diminishing, both globally and in the euro area.",
        "It was recalled that the recent trends and the outlook of a cyclical recovery becoming more solid and broad-based benefited from exceptionally favourable financing conditions and relied on continued support from the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "In order to reap the full benefits from these measures, however, other policy areas had to contribute much more decisively to strengthening economic growth.",
        "The implementation of structural reforms needed to be substantially stepped up to increase the resilience of the euro area economy, to reduce structural unemployment and to boost productivity and potential output growth.",
        "As regards fiscal policies, it was essential that all countries intensified their efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances.",
        "The full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and the macroeconomic imbalances procedure over time and across countries remained crucial.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment of the outlook presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "According to Eurostat, annual euro area headline inflation had declined to 1.5% in March 2017, compared with 2.0% in the previous month.",
        "It was underlined that this setback followed several months of upward surprises in headline inflation and was mainly related to the volatile components of the HICP, reflecting lower energy and unprocessed food price inflation, although there had also been a fall in services price inflation.",
        "Annual HICP inflation excluding food and energy had been 0.7% in March, after 0.9% in February and January 2017.",
        "Looking more closely at the factors behind the lower rate of underlying inflation, the decline was viewed as being related to significant calendar effects in several countries, reflecting the deceleration in volatile travel-related components, in particular package holidays, associated with the timing of the Easter holidays.",
        "Looking ahead, it could therefore be argued that there would only be a minimal negative effect on the near-term outlook for headline and core inflation, while the medium-term outlook for inflation remained intact.",
        "However, it was also remarked that a downward revision to the inflation outlook in the June 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections could not be ruled out.",
        "On the basis of current oil futures prices, headline inflation was likely to increase again in April and, thereafter, to hover around somewhat lower levels until the end of 2017.",
        "It was highlighted that measures of underlying inflation remained subdued, with unutilised resources still weighing on domestic wage and price formation.",
        "Disappointment was expressed that so far there had been no rebound in underlying inflation and indications of a build-up of inflation pressures were still limited.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation were expected to rise only gradually over the medium term, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the expected continuing economic recovery and the corresponding gradual absorption of slack.",
        "However, there was broad agreement that there were, as yet, no clear signs of a sustained increase in underlying inflation.",
        "With regard to the outlook for wage developments, it was recalled that the March 2017 ECB staff projections foresaw a relatively steep pick-up in wages.",
        "So far, however, there had not been any significant increase in wage growth, despite the declining output gap and lower unemployment rates.",
        "It was considered that the role of wider measures of slack could be explored further, while, more generally, it was felt that a more in-depth investigation of wage behaviour was needed, including wage settlements and bargaining processes, as well as changes in income distribution.",
        "It was conjectured that structural changes in wage dynamics in Europe might be at play, with possible implications for long-term changes in the dynamics of underlying inflation.",
        "Members also reviewed recent developments in inflation expectations.",
        "While survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, such as the SPF, were broadly unchanged, market-based measures of inflation expectations for the euro area had declined somewhat.",
        "For example, the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead currently stood at 1.6%.",
        "However, inflation expectations were well above the low levels seen in the summer of 2016, and it was reiterated that the risk of deflation and of an unanchoring of inflation expectations had almost completely disappeared.",
        "As regards risks to medium-term price stability, there was broad agreement that, while the news on growth was more positive, there had been no significant change in the assessment of the inflation outlook.",
        "At the Governing Council’s June monetary policy meeting further important information would be available, including the quarterly projections, GDP data for the first quarter of 2017 and two further months of inflation data.",
        "This would facilitate a better assessment of the momentum and sustainability of the recovery and the prospects for a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "M3 had continued to expand at a robust pace in February 2017, mainly supported by its most liquid components.",
        "The recovery in loan growth to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 had been proceeding.",
        "The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 had continued to support borrowing conditions for firms and households and credit flows across the euro area.",
        "Reference was made to the continued decline in lending rates and the evidence from the latest euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2017, which indicated that net loan demand had increased and bank lending conditions had further eased across all loan categories.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that, while continuing to recover, the level of credit growth to the private sector remained weak.",
        "The growth rate had not risen much above 2% since the summer of 2016, notwithstanding Eurosystem asset purchases, which, in the meantime, amounted to €1.8 trillion.",
        "Remaining fragilities in the banking sector in a number of countries, notably related to the outstanding stock of non-performing loans on banks’ balance sheets, were seen to be holding back a stronger pass-through of the very accommodative monetary conditions and more robust credit dynamics.",
        "Caution was expressed with respect to interpreting the qualitative balance of replies compiled in the bank lending survey and questions were raised regarding the reported cross-country heterogeneity of the impact of the negative deposit facility rate on bank profits and lending volumes.",
        "In this context, it was noted that the pass-through to bank deposit rates had so far been limited and that the ability to adjust margins was seen to depend on the degree of competitive pressures and the size of margins, as well as on institutional features, such as the prevalence of variable rate contracts and indexation, which differed across euro area jurisdictions.",
        "It was highlighted that, for the euro area overall, the evidence continued to point to positive effects on lending volumes from the negative rate on the deposit facility, as well as an easing impact on lending rates.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that, while the cyclical recovery of the euro area was becoming increasingly solid and downside risks had further diminished, underlying inflation pressures had remained subdued and had yet to show a convincing upward trend.",
        "There was also broad agreement with the assessment provided by Mr Praet that the ECB’s monetary policy measures were making a crucial contribution to preserving very favourable financing conditions, which were seen as a key factor behind the ongoing cyclical recovery, supporting its resilience to adverse shocks and, over time, a rise in inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "In their assessment of the outlook for price stability, members generally agreed that overall growth prospects had further improved.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that, given continued uncertainty, the outlook for inflation remained fragile.",
        "While deflation risks had virtually disappeared, underlying inflation remained subdued.",
        "Moreover, euro area HICP inflation had been volatile recently, largely on account of energy price developments.",
        "This underscored the need to look through transient changes in headline inflation, which had no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "Against this background, the view was widely shared that signs for a sustained adjustment in inflation had not strengthened and progress in inflation convergence to levels consistent with the Governing Council’s inflation aim in a durable and self-sustaining manner remained, as yet, insufficient.",
        "In particular, the dynamism of the cyclical recovery and the baseline scenario of inflation rising towards the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim remained conditional on a substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "Hence, from today’s perspective, there was broad agreement among members that the current monetary policy stance remained appropriate.",
        "This entailed keeping the ECB’s policy rates unchanged, as well as confirming both the intended pace and horizon of APP purchases and the Governing Council’s forward guidance on policy rates and the asset purchase programme, including the associated “easing biases”.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that it could be acknowledged that recourse to these options for providing further accommodation was becoming less likely, in line with the Governing Council’s evolving assessment.",
        "In this context, it was also again recalled that the Governing Council’s decision in December 2016 to continue APP purchases as of April 2017 at a reduced monthly pace of €60 billion, as well as to carry out the last targeted longer-term refinancing operation (TLTRO) at the end of March, had already reflected the Governing Council’s more nuanced assessment of overall growing confidence in the economic performance of the euro area economy and vanishing deflation risks.",
        "Looking ahead, it was suggested that, if the euro area recovery kept up its momentum and progress was made in attaining a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, due consideration would need to be given to adjusting the present formulation of the Governing Council’s forward guidance.",
        "It was highlighted that, ultimately, the future path of monetary policy in all its elements depended crucially on the Governing Council’s forward-looking in-depth assessment of the outlook for price stability.",
        "There needed to be a continuous assessment of whether inflation was converging in a durable and self-sustaining manner towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term and whether it would remain there even under less supportive monetary policy conditions.",
        "At the forthcoming policy meeting in June, new staff projections, alongside further data and analyses, would become available, putting the Governing Council in a better position to take stock and reassess the sustainability of the recovery and the outlook for inflation.",
        "As inflation proceeded further on its path towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim in a self-sustaining manner, a more encompassing discussion on devising an appropriate strategy for policy normalisation would become warranted further in the future.",
        "As regards communication, members broadly agreed with the proposals made by Mr Praet in his introduction to keep the communication on the Governing Council’s monetary policy stance and its forward guidance unchanged, while conveying a more positive tone on the state of the euro area economy and highlighting the increasing solidity of the cyclical recovery and that downside risks had further diminished.",
        "Similarly, the Governing Council needed to reiterate its confidence in the effectiveness of its monetary policy measures in supporting growth and inflation.",
        "At the same time, it was felt that the Governing Council’s communication should be adjusted in a very gradual and cautious manner as, at the current juncture, monetary and financial conditions were particularly sensitive to changes in communication.",
        "After a long period of very accommodative monetary conditions, even small and incremental changes in communication could have strong signalling effects when interpreted as heralding a change in the monetary policy stance.",
        "A premature and unwarranted tightening of financial conditions could put the prospects of a sustained adjustment in inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim at risk, particularly in an environment of persisting uncertainty.",
        "It was, however, also highlighted that a gradual adjustment in communication, in step with the evolution of the Governing Council’s assessment of the economic outlook and the balance of risks, would underpin the consistency and credibility of the Governing Council’s guidance.",
        "Considering the earlier exchange of views on the balance of risks to euro area activity, there was agreement among all members to emphasise in the communication that the risks to the euro area growth outlook were moving towards a more balanced configuration, while still remaining tilted to the downside.",
        "Prevailing uncertainties, notably related to the external environment, continued to call for caution.",
        "It was also agreed that the communication regarding the inflation outlook should be left unchanged.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided to keep the interest rates on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council continued to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.",
        "Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirmed that the net asset purchases, at the new monthly pace of €60 billion, were intended to run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "The net purchases would be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme.",
        "If the outlook became less favourable, or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stood ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 7-8 December 2016, the volatility of global long-term bond yields had declined from the levels seen earlier in the fourth quarter.",
        "In the euro area, developments in the secured money markets around the turn of the year had attracted attention, owing to a sharp increase in the price of high quality collateral in the repo market.",
        "Following the strong repricing in the US Treasury market observed immediately after the US presidential election, market participants had recently seemed to be adopting a more cautious attitude towards the US policy outlook for 2017, reflecting, inter alia, investors’ US Treasury positioning and a possible moderation in US economic growth.",
        "Against this background, a pause in the upward trend in US Treasury yields was observed.",
        "Market-based expectations of further changes in the federal funds rate had been broadly stable since December.",
        "The improvement in global manufacturing confidence in December 2016, led by the United States and China, had contributed to a benign environment for global financial markets at the turn of the year.",
        "Supported by positive economic data and a stabilisation in oil prices above USD 50 per barrel, global stock markets had continued to rise overall, with US equities trading near all-time high levels.",
        "In addition, flows into global equity funds had picked up in the fourth quarter of 2016.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting some downward adjustments in the EUR/USD exchange rate had been observed.",
        "Market participants’ forecasts for the EUR/USD exchange rate by the end of 2017 currently stood at USD 1.05.",
        "In euro area government bond markets, the steepening in yield curves that had taken place immediately after the Governing Council’s December monetary policy meeting had been largely reversed by the year-end.",
        "December traditionally saw a seasonal reduction in liquidity.",
        "Eurosystem net bond purchases had totalled €232 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, with holdings under the expanded asset purchase programme (APP) reaching €1.5 trillion at the end of December.",
        "The implementation of the APP had continued to be smooth and was viewed as having exerted a continued downward effect on the overall term structure of interest rates in the euro area.",
        "The Eurosystem balance sheet had continued to expand, reaching an all-time high of €3.7 trillion at the year-end, with excess liquidity rising to €1.2 trillion.",
        "Market feedback on the Eurosystem’s recent measures regarding the securities lending arrangements, which had taken effect on 15 December 2016, had been broadly positive.",
        "APP purchases had resumed smoothly in 2017, with a particularly healthy pace for the third covered bond purchase programme, on the back of strong primary market activity.",
        "The other APP programmes also appeared to be well on track.",
        "The unsecured euro money markets had seen no funding tensions at the year-end, although there had been very strong movements in the repo and foreign exchange swap markets.",
        "In the repo market, the search for high quality collateral in a market environment of reduced liquidity had driven rates to record low levels in some jurisdictions.",
        "Furthermore, market participants had shown a clear preference for trading repos via central counterparties, rather than bilaterally, over the year-end.",
        "Since then repo rates and volumes had normalised and had gradually returned to previous levels.",
        "As regards APP securities lending, use of the new option for securities lending against cash collateral under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) had increased swiftly after its introduction on 15 December 2016, as market participants had borrowed securities from the Eurosystem amid the decline in repo rates.",
        "The year-end effect on US dollar funding had also been pronounced, as reflected in the very elevated levels of US dollar implied rates in the foreign exchange swap market over the turn of the year, but the impact had been short-lived and had dissipated in January.",
        "The Eurosystem’s three-week US dollar liquidity-providing operation covering the year-end had attracted moderate demand of USD 4.3 billion.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the global economy, activity indicators pointed to a rebound in the second half of 2016.",
        "In December the global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had risen slightly to 53.4.",
        "Trade had been expanding at a modest pace.",
        "Global inflation was gradually picking up, standing at 1.4% in November for the OECD area, from 1.3% in October, while inflation excluding food and energy remained unchanged at 1.7%.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had increased by 3.8% in US dollar terms since the December monetary policy meeting and non-oil commodity prices had risen by 2.5%, while the euro had depreciated by 0.5% in nominal effective terms vis-à-vis the currencies of 38 of the euro area’s major trading partners.",
        "Turning to the euro area, the economic recovery was firming, mainly driven by private consumption and investment, including construction investment, on the back of sustained employment gains, higher labour income and low interest rates.",
        "Real GDP had grown by 0.3% in both the second and third quarters of 2016.",
        "The unemployment rate had been 9.8% in November, unchanged from the previous month.",
        "For the fourth quarter, survey results pointed to slightly stronger real GDP growth, with higher readings for the composite output and employment PMIs, the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator and consumer confidence.",
        "There were also increasing signs of a broadening of the recovery across countries and sectors.",
        "As regards the financial situation of non-financial corporations (NFCs) in the euro area, the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy stance had continued to facilitate the necessary deleveraging process, as reflected, for instance, in the significant decline in debt-to-assets ratios over the past few years.",
        "By contrast, indebtedness remained elevated relative to income or value added.",
        "At the same time, the net lending position of NFCs had eased marginally in the third quarter of 2016, while remaining at a high level, and the household saving ratio remained largely unchanged, consistent with a continued strong euro area net lending position overall.",
        "The December 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for euro area economic activity remained broadly in line with the latest forecasts from the private sector and other international institutions.",
        "Turning to prices, annual euro area HICP inflation had risen to 1.1% in December, up from 0.6% in November, mainly reflecting substantially stronger energy inflation.",
        "Excluding food and energy, inflation had reached 0.9% in December, after remaining unchanged at 0.8% from August to November.",
        "Wage growth in the euro area had also remained subdued, with annual growth in compensation per employee increasing to 1.3% in the third quarter of 2016, up from 1.1% in the second quarter.",
        "Overall, there were as yet no convincing signs of a more dynamic upward trend in underlying inflation.",
        "The December Eurosystem staff projections for euro area HICP inflation remained broadly in line with the latest forecasts from the private sector and other international institutions.",
        "The Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the first quarter of 2017 showed slight upward revisions compared with the October round, with average inflation expectations at 1.4% for 2017 and 1.5% for 2018, while expectations five years ahead had remained unchanged at 1.8%.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation expectations had risen since the previous policy meeting in December.",
        "Inflation swap rates had increased across all maturities.",
        "With regard to financial and financing conditions, the EONIA forward curve had remained broadly unchanged and the overall nominal cost of external financing for euro area NFCs had remained at very low levels.",
        "In particular, favourable bank lending conditions continued to contribute to the gradual recovery of the euro area economy.",
        "Banks had increasingly been passing on the decline in their funding costs to the economy through lower lending rates.",
        "As a consequence, the cost of bank borrowing both for NFCs and for households for house purchase had remained broadly stable at historically low levels in November.",
        "External financing flows to euro area NFCs had strengthened overall in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by robust developments in bank lending and market-based financing in October and November.",
        "Turning to money and credit, the annual growth rate of M3 had increased to 4.8% in November, having hovered around 5% since April 2015, with M1 as the main driver.",
        "Regarding loan dynamics, the annual growth of loans to NFCs had increased slightly to 2.2% in November, up from 2.1% in October, and loans to households had risen to 1.9%, after 1.8% in October.",
        "The January 2017 bank lending survey for the euro area indicated that the gradual recovery in loan growth continued to be supported by increasing demand across all loan categories and by broadly stabilising credit standards for loans to enterprises and housing loans.",
        "The low general level of interest rates, as well as merger and acquisition activity and loan restructuring, were important positive contributors to NFC loan demand.",
        "Finally, the fiscal stance in the euro area, as measured by the change in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance, was expected to have remained expansionary in 2016 and to turn broadly neutral over the Eurosystem staff projection horizon.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet concluded that the Governing Council’s decisions in December 2016 had succeeded in preserving the very favourable financing conditions that were necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "The continued pass-through of the ECB’s measures to the financing conditions of firms and households remained a key factor behind the firming of the economic recovery.",
        "Incoming information pointed to somewhat stronger economic growth at the end of 2016, with the recovery increasingly broadening across sectors.",
        "As expected, headline inflation had increased recently, mainly owing to developments in energy prices.",
        "While euro area HICP inflation was expected to rise further in 2017, underlying inflation dynamics remained subdued.",
        "At the same time, the impact of oil price increases on the medium-term outlook for inflation would have to be further assessed over the coming months.",
        "Overall, a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation was needed for domestic inflation pressures to build up and durably support headline inflation.",
        "Turning to communication aspects, Mr Praet, recalling the Governing Council’s monetary policy strategy and past communication, proposed to emphasise that changes in HICP inflation would be looked through, if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "It was also important to confirm the intended pace and horizon of APP purchases, as well as the forward guidance on the ECB’s key policy rates as communicated in December.",
        "Likewise, it was important to reiterate that the Governing Council remained prepared to adjust its purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration should the outlook become less favourable, or should financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment of the path of inflation.",
        "Complementing Mr Praet’s introduction on operational issues pertaining to the implementation of APP purchases of assets with yields below the ECB’s deposit facility rate (DFR) “to the extent necessary”, Mr Cœuré recalled that purchases of bonds at yields below the DFR had started on 16 January 2017.",
        "Mr Cœuré outlined essentially two dimensions to consider: minimising purchases below the DFR and giving priority to capital key considerations across jurisdictions.",
        "There were different pros and cons for each dimension, relating to the impact at the short end of the yield curve, the programme’s impact on the maturity structure and possible communication challenges vis-à-vis markets and the general public.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet of the outlook and risks for euro area economic activity.",
        "Recent data and survey results pointed to a continued firming of the euro area economic recovery, broadly confirming short-term growth prospects as assessed at the previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "Looking ahead, demand growth was expected to continue to be supported by private consumption growth, as well as the continued cyclical recovery of business investment.",
        "The balance of risks to the euro area outlook was considered to remain tilted to the downside, owing mainly to uncertainties surrounding the prospects for foreign demand growth.",
        "Recent data and survey indicators suggested that euro area real GDP growth was firming and would increase between the third and the fourth quarter of 2016.",
        "Developments in survey data, in particular, had been positive overall.",
        "The point was made that recent improvements in economic activity remained broadly in line with the assessment of the near-term outlook at the previous monetary policy meeting and with the December 2016 Eurosystem staff projections, while it was also underlined that some recent data had been slightly better than expected, in particular in terms of survey and labour market indicators, pointing to the resilience of the euro area economy in the face of the prevailing high level of uncertainty.",
        "As regards foreign demand, recent indicators pointed to improving global growth momentum.",
        "Risks to the global economic outlook were assessed to remain tilted to the downside and were related to geopolitical developments, uncertainties regarding the future policy choices of the incoming US administration, questions related to the path towards the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, risks of growing protectionist pressures, and the potential for renewed volatility and downward corrections in global financial markets.",
        "Turning to domestic demand developments, continued support for private consumption was seen to come from growth in real disposable income, underpinned mainly by employment gains, while very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability should continue to foster the recovery in investment.",
        "It was noted that the euro area economy had now been growing at a relatively steady pace for some time, with quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth rates ranging between 0.3% and 0.6% since the third quarter of 2014.",
        "Rather than being seen as a source of fragility for the world economy, as in the past, the euro area was showing robustness in the face of external shocks.",
        "A question was raised regarding the extent to which euro area economic growth could accelerate further from the current pace on a sustained basis.",
        "On the one hand, it was remarked that potential output estimates were currently at the lower end of the range of growth over recent quarters.",
        "This suggested that the euro area economy could hit a “speed limit” relatively soon, also in view of the lack of momentum in structural reform implementation in recent years.",
        "On the other hand, it was noted that estimates of the output gap remained subject to uncertainty and could well underestimate the degree of slack in the economy.",
        "The economic recovery was continuing to broaden gradually across sectors and countries, as highlighted by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "While some comfort was drawn from indications of increasing convergence within the euro area, it was also recalled that higher growth would be needed in countries with a large degree of slack.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that a process of rebalancing across sectors and countries should be expected to entail corresponding growth differentials during the adjustment period.",
        "Balance sheet adjustment in a number of sectors was seen as continuing to dampen economic growth prospects.",
        "In the financial sector, continued progress was needed in addressing non-performing loans and ensuring adequate capital positions.",
        "In the non-financial sectors, some further balance sheet adjustment was also likely to be still warranted although it was seen as difficult to identify relevant benchmarks against which to measure corporate indebtedness.",
        "It was also highlighted that developments in income and wealth distribution were gaining prominence in the global policy debate, including in relation to the impact of monetary policy measures.",
        "In this regard, it was likely that the positive effects of recent monetary policy measures on income and wealth in the euro area, in particular through job creation, overall outweighed any negative effects on distribution, such as those stemming from equity price increases.",
        "Members underlined that the recent trends and the outlook of a firming and broadening economic recovery largely benefited from exceptionally favourable financing conditions and relied on continued support from the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "However, more decisive contributions were needed from other policy areas to ensure a self-sustaining recovery.",
        "In particular, structural reforms were essential to ensure sustainable growth and were judged to be particularly desirable in the present context of a firming recovery and favourable financing conditions, as it was politically and economically easier to implement reforms during an economic upturn.",
        "With regard to the global economic policy environment, it was seen as important to preserve a continued commitment to open markets and free trade.",
        "The balance of risks to the economic outlook was seen as remaining on the downside, with risks related mainly to the global environment, political uncertainties and continued balance sheet weaknesses in some sectors.",
        "It was nevertheless also noted that downside risks had receded somewhat, and the case was made that overall the risks surrounding the scenario of a gradually firming recovery were starting to become more balanced.",
        "With regard to the prevailing high levels of uncertainty, caution was called for in estimating their impact on consumption and investment as there were other countervailing factors, such as favourable financing conditions, and the impact depended on the type of uncertainty at play.",
        "With regard to price developments, members broadly shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Annual euro area HICP inflation had increased from 0.6% in November 2016 to 1.1% in December, driven mainly by a combination of base effects and a recent uptick in energy price inflation, while underlying price pressures remained subdued.",
        "The near-term outlook for headline inflation would continue to be shaped by energy prices – with a scenario of a reversal in energy price developments also a possibility – as well as by developments in the euro exchange rate.",
        "Looking ahead, headline inflation was expected to pick up further, initially largely on account of base effects and later on supported by the expected gradual economic recovery and the accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation had remained broadly stable at low levels since the previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "One such measure, annual HICP inflation excluding food and energy, had increased slightly, from 0.8% in November 2016 to 0.9% in December, mainly on account of higher services price inflation.",
        "Taking a somewhat longer perspective, it was noted that annual HICP inflation excluding food and energy had been around 0.8% since April 2016.",
        "Other measures, in particular producer prices of non-food consumer goods and survey-based selling price expectations, had increased only slightly and remained at low levels.",
        "Wage increases had overall remained subdued throughout the euro area and the muted wage dynamics had played an important role in the still broadly stable indicators of services price inflation.",
        "Survey-based indicators of inflation expectations, as captured in particular by the SPF, had increased somewhat for the short term compared with the information available at the December monetary policy meeting, while they had remained unchanged at the long-term horizon.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation expectations had also recovered, while remaining below survey-based measures.",
        "In this regard, measurement uncertainties were recalled, stemming from the impact of risk premia, which could not be readily disentangled from the expectations component.",
        "Global financial market developments, especially spillovers from US bond markets, had also played a large role in recent developments.",
        "In addition, reference was made to the price of deflation protection, which had continued to fall and now suggested that a scenario of deflation was no longer on the radar of market participants, while the price of inflation protection had increased slightly, remaining at very low levels.",
        "With regard to possible downside or upside risks to the medium-term price outlook, members noted that recent increases in energy prices had thus far not translated into indirect or second-round effects on broader inflation, while it was also argued that, based on past evidence, such effects might materialise with a considerable lag.",
        "Looking ahead, indirect and second-round effects of headline inflation on underlying inflation would need to be monitored carefully.",
        "Indirect effects could arise for those sectors that depended heavily on energy, such as those subject to increases in transportation costs.",
        "As for possible second-round effects, a number of factors shaping wage dynamics merited continued monitoring and further analysis.",
        "First, it was recalled that the wage formation process was to a large extent backward-looking in a number of euro area countries.",
        "Second, the wage-setting calendar could have a significant impact on wage dynamics looking ahead.",
        "However, it was also pointed out that wage agreements were staggered over time and often had a multi-year horizon.",
        "This suggested that any second-round effects would unfold rather slowly.",
        "Third, labour market reforms and changes in wage-setting processes, including a move towards more decentralised wage bargaining in some countries, could affect the shape of the Phillips curve.",
        "Fourth, future wage dynamics would depend on the degree of labour market slack, which was difficult to measure.",
        "Fifth, it was seen as worthwhile to examine in more detail wage developments across euro area countries, including unit labour costs, where some divergence in wage growth was to be expected and was necessary for a further rebalancing of competitiveness within the euro area.",
        "Over the medium term headline and underlying inflation were expected to rise gradually, supported by the Governing Council’s monetary policy measures and the continued economic recovery.",
        "Overall, both downside and upside risks to the inflation outlook were seen to warrant close monitoring.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) had again expanded at a robust pace in November 2016, supported by its most liquid components as in previous months.",
        "Loan dynamics had proceeded on the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014, with loan growth to both NFCs and households increasing in November.",
        "Members observed that the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014, reinforced by the December 2016 decisions, were continuing to pass through effectively to borrowing conditions for firms and households and to credit creation.",
        "The continued improvements in credit markets, notably in bank loan provision and corporate debt markets, were visible in a broad range of indicators, including the results of the euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2016.",
        "More generally, it was underlined that the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission to credit developments depended crucially on the underlying strength of balance sheets in the financial and non-financial sectors and the adjustment progress made.",
        "In particular, adequate capital buffers and the resolution of non-performing loans in the banking sector were seen as prerequisites to further support credit creation.",
        "Likewise, continued progress in deleveraging by NFCs could further support loan demand looking ahead.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that, while inflation had increased lately, largely owing to base effects in energy prices, underlying inflation pressures had remained subdued and signs of a convincing upward trend were still lacking.",
        "It was broadly agreed that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation continued to be needed for euro area inflation pressures to build up and to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Members expressed satisfaction about how financial markets had received the December 2016 policy announcements, demonstrating that the underlying rationale of the APP’s recalibration and the guidance provided in the Governing Council’s communication had been well understood by market participants.",
        "The decisions taken in December had succeeded in preserving the very favourable financing conditions that were necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Financial conditions had overall recorded some broad-based improvement since the December monetary policy meeting and borrowing conditions for firms and households were continuing to benefit from the pass-through of the policy measures.",
        "While more time was needed for the policy measures to fully unfold their effects on the euro area economy and ultimately on inflation outcomes – also considering that in the presence of ongoing balance sheet adjustments transmission lags were likely to be longer than usual – it was stressed that the measures were increasingly bearing fruit in terms of rising confidence, employment gains and a broadening of the recovery.",
        "Moreover, the accommodative monetary policy stance appeared to be increasingly visible in developments in inflation expectations, which had shown signs of a reversal from previous flat or negative trends, while also reflecting changes in the global environment.",
        "Members agreed on the appropriateness of the current monetary policy stance and recent developments were generally seen to vindicate the decisions taken by the Governing Council at its meeting in early December 2016.",
        "While there had been some positive news since that meeting, the fundamental picture remained largely unaltered and there was no room for complacency, as risks and uncertainties had not receded substantially, notably those related to the political environment at the global level and within the euro area.",
        "Moreover, the recent pick-up in inflation had been mainly driven by an increase in energy prices and, hence, it was premature to draw conclusions as to the possible implications of these recent developments for the medium-term outlook for inflation.",
        "The view was widely shared that there was, as yet, insufficient progress towards a durable and self-sustaining convergence in the path of inflation consistent with the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Underlying inflation dynamics had remained subdued and the scenario of an upward trend in inflation still depended crucially on the prevailing very favourable financing conditions, which to a large extent reflected the current accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that, in line with the Governing Council’s monetary policy strategy and past communication, monetary policy had to be forward-looking and oriented to the medium term, meaning that the Governing Council would look through the volatility in short-term data if judged transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "Therefore, there was broad agreement to look through recent upturns in headline inflation driven by energy prices, while carefully monitoring potential indirect and second-round effects.",
        "This was seen to be fully consistent with the Governing Council’s past decisions and established approach to treating temporary changes in inflation on the upside and on the downside.",
        "Against this background, it was widely agreed that it was imperative to maintain a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation for inflation pressures to build up and durably support headline inflation.",
        "Otherwise, recent encouraging developments in inflation expectations and the prospects for a sustained adjustment in inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim could be put at risk.",
        "Therefore, the Governing Council was seen as well advised to remain patient and maintain a “steady hand” to provide stability and predictability in an environment that was still characterised by a high level of uncertainty.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that the window of opportunity provided by a prolonged period of favourable monetary and financial conditions needed to be used by other policy areas to bolster sustained growth, namely by speeding up structural reforms.",
        "Looking ahead, incoming information had to be monitored carefully, while more time was needed to better assess the recent uptick in inflation and the extent to which energy price developments were passing through to underlying inflation and affecting the medium-term outlook for price developments.",
        "Members considered the implementation of the APP to be proceeding smoothly following the decisions taken in December to expand the universe of eligible assets.",
        "It was, however, noted that repo rates had recorded a rather pronounced decline over the year-end, especially in some jurisdictions, despite the enhancements made to the Eurosystem’s securities lending facilities.",
        "This suggested that these developments were driven by a number of special factors.",
        "Moreover, in addition to the impact of the APP, there were also several structural factors boosting the demand for high-quality collateral, including market trends and regulatory changes.",
        "It was highlighted that the enhancements to the securities lending programme had been welcomed by market participants as overall use of the programme, and especially of the cash collateral option, had increased, mitigating collateral scarcity around the end of the year.",
        "Against that background, the Governing Council should carefully monitor market developments and the use of the securities lending facilities, and stand ready to make further adaptations, if needed.",
        "Regarding the implementation details on the Governing Council’s December decision to permit asset purchases below the DFR “to the extent necessary”, the choices outlined by Mr Cœuré were seen to primarily hinge on the relative weights to be given to the different criteria and restrictions attached to the APP.",
        "It was recalled that sticking to the issue and issuer limits had been assessed as most important in this regard.",
        "While significant weight was also placed on limiting deviations from the ECB’s capital key, it was also underlined that limited and temporary deviations were possible and inevitable.",
        "Thus, there was some room for a trade-off between relative deviations from the capital key across jurisdictions and limiting the extent of purchases below the DFR.",
        "All in all, broad support was expressed by members for the way forward indicated by Mr Cœuré, whereby PSPP purchases below the DFR should, in the first instance, be guided by the application of the capital key across jurisdictions, subject to purchasability constraints.",
        "This baseline approach could be reconsidered by the Governing Council should undue market effects materialise.",
        "At the same time, it was agreed that, under the PSPP, priority should be given to purchases of assets with yields above the DFR, thereby limiting the amount of purchases below the DFR if not required to achieve the envisaged amounts for each jurisdiction.",
        "As regards communication, members widely agreed to maintain the communication adopted at the December monetary policy meeting and, hence, to confirm the intended pace and horizon of APP purchases and the forward guidance on the key policy rates, as had been suggested by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "This implied reiterating that asset purchases under the APP would continue at the current monthly pace of €80 billion until the end of March 2017 and were intended to continue at a monthly pace of €60 billion from April 2017 until the end of the year and, in any case, until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "While it had to be acknowledged that both inflation and growth developments were moving in the right direction, uncertainties had not receded.",
        "Therefore, the Governing Council should also continue to signal its willingness and readiness to act, if warranted, to achieve its price stability objective.",
        "This included, in particular, its preparedness to adjust the purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration should the outlook become less favourable, or should financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.",
        "Finally, it was felt that a strong call should be made for other policymakers to step up their efforts in support of the euro area recovery and the prospects for sustained growth in the euro area.",
        "The presence of an accommodative monetary policy stance and the firming recovery provided euro area governments with a favourable environment to engage decisively in structural reforms to boost investment, reduce structural unemployment and increase potential output.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided to keep the interest rates on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council continued to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.",
        "Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirmed that it would continue to make purchases under the APP at the current monthly pace of €80 billion until the end of March 2017 and that, from April 2017, the net asset purchases were intended to continue at a monthly pace of €60 billion until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "The Governing Council reiterated its preparedness to increase the purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration should the outlook become less favourable, or should financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.",
        "Regarding further details on how the Eurosystem would buy assets with yields below the DFR under the APP, the Governing Council decided that purchases below the DFR would be conducted only under the PSPP, and, for each jurisdiction, priority would be given to purchases of assets with yields above the DFR.",
        "This implied that the amount of purchases that had to be made at yields below the DFR would vary among jurisdictions.",
        "This amount might also change over time, reflecting changes in market interest rates relative to the DFR.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the draft introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Global developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 19-20 October 2016 had been characterised by sizeable market movements with a general repricing, an increase in volatility across asset classes and an upward move in global inflation expectations.",
        "In most international markets, a strong move away from bonds and towards equity had been observed.",
        "In particular regarding US equity markets, data on flows into investment funds showed significant portfolio reallocation with strong outflows from US bond funds into US equity funds.",
        "Sizeable outflows from emerging markets into the United States for both equities and bonds were also observed.",
        "US Treasury yields had increased across the curve by up to 60 basis points since the second week of November 2016, led by the five to ten-year segment of the yield curve.",
        "Regarding inflation expectations, US market-based indicators for inflation protection had increased to the highest level in two years.",
        "The ten-year break-even inflation rate had risen to close to 2% for the five-year maturity and to above 2% for longer maturities.",
        "The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had displayed a similar move and exceeded 2.5%, its highest level since November 2014, and this repricing of inflation expectations in the United States had spilled over to Europe.",
        "The repricing of inflation expectations had been further supported by the repricing affecting commodity markets.",
        "Outflows from emerging markets, towards the United States in particular, were also reflected in a general repricing observed on foreign exchange markets.",
        "Such a repricing was witnessed beyond emerging market currencies: the US dollar had appreciated by 9% against the Japanese yen and by 3% against the euro and the Swiss franc.",
        "Moving to European markets, the ten-year spread between the US Treasury and the Bund currently stood above 200 basis points, its highest level since 1989.",
        "This decoupling was justified by market participants in the light of diverging fundamentals, including the divergence between monetary policies on either side of the Atlantic, as well as the structurally high demand for German collateral.",
        "Concerns relating to the scarcity of German sovereign bonds had gained traction in recent weeks and months.",
        "The yield on the two-year German Schatz had reached an all-time low of -0.75% on 28 November 2016, driven by structural demand for high-quality liquid assets in both the cash bond and the repo market against the background of a continuously reduced supply.",
        "The premium for holding collateral had started to extend beyond Germany, as shown by the evolution of the distribution of repo rates in the French, Italian and Spanish government bond repo markets.",
        "The bulk of the repo collateral across different jurisdictions was increasingly trading below the deposit facility rate with a growing skewness of the distribution towards more negative rates, a development which the ECB would continue to monitor.",
        "In the cash bond markets, both German government bond yields and intra-euro area sovereign bond yield spreads versus Germany had displayed high volatility since the US election.",
        "These developments in the euro sovereign debt markets were unfolding in an environment where cash trading volumes were reported to be very low and diminishing further, in contrast to the sustained high turnover in the futures market.",
        "This declining liquidity had nevertheless not hampered the implementation of the asset purchase programme (APP), which had remained smooth in November 2016.",
        "Finally, with regard to market expectations of policy action at the current Governing Council meeting, the most frequently mentioned expectations related to changes to the purchase programmes, whereas the market was not expecting a change in the monetary policy rates.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Global activity and trade were expanding at a modest pace, with some positive momentum during the second half of 2016.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) stood at 53.3 in November, unchanged from October and up from 51.7 in September, pointing to solid growth in the fourth quarter of the year.",
        "The pick-up in activity was driven by the recovery of advanced economies from the soft patch in the first half of 2016.",
        "Activity in emerging market commodity-exporting economies had been bottoming out.",
        "As regards trade, following two quarters of negative growth, the volume of world imports of goods had increased by 0.7% in the third quarter.",
        "Global inflation, while still moderate, was picking up slightly.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area had increased in October to 1.4%, from 1.2% in September.",
        "Excluding food and energy, OECD annual inflation had declined slightly to 1.7%.",
        "The price of Brent crude oil had increased by 5.2% since the Governing Council meeting on 19-20 October and by 16% since 11 August 2016, the cut-off date for the September ECB staff projections, to stand at USD 53 per barrel on 6 December 2016.",
        "Non-oil commodity prices denominated in US dollars had increased by about 10% since the previous monetary policy meeting, while the euro had remained broadly unchanged in nominal effective terms vis-à-vis the currencies of the euro area’s 38 major trading partners (NEER-38).",
        "Turning to the euro area, available information suggested that the recovery was continuing at a moderate but firming pace.",
        "Real GDP had grown by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2016, following similar growth in the second quarter.",
        "Available data pointed to a continued broadening of the economic expansion and slightly stronger growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, as also reflected in the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator.",
        "The unemployment rate had further declined to 9.8% in October 2016, from 9.9% in September.",
        "Private consumption had been growing mainly on the back of higher household income from employment growth and low interest rates.",
        "Business investment had continued its cyclical recovery in line with GDP growth and was supported by favourable demand and financing conditions, while real investment of non-financial corporations still remained below its pre-crisis peak.",
        "Improvements in corporate profitability and very favourable financing conditions continued to support business investment.",
        "As regards residential investment, both housing investment and building production had shown positive momentum, with building production increasing by 1.4% in the third quarter of 2016.",
        "In the December 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, real GDP growth was foreseen at 1.7% in both 2016 and 2017 and at 1.6% in both 2018 and 2019.",
        "Compared with the September 2016 ECB staff projections, the outlook for real GDP growth was broadly unchanged.",
        "The December projections were broadly in line with the forecasts of other institutions, with a slightly more optimistic view on real GDP growth in 2017.",
        "Turning to euro area price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation had continued to rise in November 2016, to 0.6%, after 0.5% in October and 0.4% in September.",
        "The increase in November reflected stronger food prices, while in previous months the upward momentum had mainly come from energy inflation.",
        "HICP inflation excluding food and energy had remained unchanged since August 2016 at 0.8%.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation continued to provide no clear signals of a strengthening in dynamics.",
        "Pipeline pressures continued to be subdued, reflecting the impact of past lower oil prices and global disinflationary pressures.",
        "Wage growth also remained at low levels.",
        "In the December 2016 Eurosystem staff projections, euro area HICP inflation was foreseen at 0.2% in 2016, 1.3% in 2017, 1.5% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019.",
        "This outlook had remained broadly unchanged from that entailed in the September 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "The December projections for HICP inflation were broadly in line with those of other institutions.",
        "Market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had increased recently, had become less skewed towards low inflation, and were now largely pricing out deflation.",
        "As regards financial conditions, a sizeable upward shift had taken place in the EONIA forward curve.",
        "The downward slope in the short and medium-term segments of the curve had disappeared, suggesting reduced expectations of further monetary policy accommodation, in particular with respect to further deposit facility rate cuts.",
        "As in other major jurisdictions, longer-term yields in the euro area had increased since the Governing Council meeting on 19-20 October.",
        "A decomposition of the change in these yields into inflation and real components suggested that this increase could be attributed mainly to increases in the inflation component, in particular the inflation risk premium, rather than real rates.",
        "Financial conditions indices suggested that financial market conditions had overall remained broadly unchanged.",
        "As far as financing conditions were concerned, the overall nominal cost of external financing for euro area non-financial corporations remained close to historical lows.",
        "In particular, favourable bank lending conditions continued to contribute to the gradual recovery of the euro area economy and bank lending rates had converged further across the euro area.",
        "Furthermore, the cost of bank borrowing for both non-financial corporations and households for house purchase had declined in October 2016, standing at very low levels.",
        "In the same vein, the latest results of the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE), covering the period from April to September 2016, showed that small and medium-sized enterprises had continued to signal an improvement in the availability of external sources of finance and in the willingness of banks to provide credit at lower interest rates.",
        "Turning to money and credit, after having remained broadly stable since the second quarter of 2015, broad money (M3) growth had moderated in October 2016 to 4.4%, after 5.1% in September 2016.",
        "The recovery of loan growth had regained some momentum in October 2016, although loan growth remained at low levels.",
        "The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations had increased to 2.1% in October 2016, from 2.0% in September.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households had remained unchanged at 1.8%.",
        "Euro area banks’ profitability had remained low in the second quarter of 2016, while non-performing loans had continued to decline gradually, contributing to lower costs for provisions and impairments.",
        "With regard to fiscal policies, the fiscal stance in the euro area, as measured by the change in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance, was expected to be expansionary in 2016 and to turn broadly neutral over the projection horizon.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet concluded that the euro area economic recovery was continuing at a moderate pace, but was firming, and that financing conditions remained supportive, facilitating deleveraging.",
        "Headline inflation had picked up and, owing to base effects, was expected to rise further in the near term.",
        "Underlying inflation, however, continued to lack a convincing upward trend.",
        "While Eurosystem staff projected that inflation would recover gradually, the outlook for underlying inflation had been revised down.",
        "The pick-up in inflation over the coming years remained highly dependent on monetary policy accommodation.",
        "Overall, there was insufficient progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.",
        "In the light of this, an extension of the asset purchase programme beyond March 2017 seemed warranted.",
        "In this regard, the set of options could be narrowed down to two broadly equivalent options in terms of their capacity to preserve the current degree of monetary accommodation: either to continue purchases at the current monthly pace of €80 billion for an additional six months, or to extend the programme by nine months to the end of December 2017 at a monthly pace of €60 billion.",
        "In both cases, purchases would be made alongside the forthcoming reinvestments starting in March 2017.",
        "The first option had the merit of continuity and was in line with market expectations.",
        "The second option allowed for a more sustained market presence and, therefore, a more lasting transmission of the Governing Council’s stimulus measures.",
        "Returning to the original pace of €60 billion per month would be consistent with the gradually firming pace of the recovery.",
        "At the same time, if the outlook became less favourable, or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment of the inflation path, the Governing Council could return to a pace of €80 billion per month.",
        "All in all, Mr Praet was leaning towards the second option.",
        "As regards APP parameters, he reiterated that implications for monetary policy transmission also needed to be taken into account in the discussion.",
        "As regards public communication, Mr Praet recommended maintaining the previous line of reasoning.",
        "It was important to emphasise that the Eurosystem’s continued asset purchases would ensure that financial conditions in the euro area would remain very favourable and secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Complementing the above introduction of the options for an extension of the APP, Mr Cœuré remarked that both options raised a number of issues from an implementation perspective.",
        "If purchases of bonds with maturities of between one year and two years were permitted and the deposit facility rate floor was also lifted, the first option was assessed to be feasible, but required additional changes to the design of the public sector purchase programme (PSPP).",
        "For the second option the two parameter changes would be sufficient and could offer more room for manoeuvre, while minimising departures from the capital key.",
        "On the basis of these considerations, Mr Cœuré expressed a preference for the second option.",
        "In conjunction with a decision to lift the deposit facility rate floor, he suggested that the Eurosystem committees should be asked to reflect on how best to draw on the universe of bonds with yields below the deposit facility rate floor, to the extent needed.",
        "Turning to the proposal to enhance securities lending facilities, Mr Cœuré recalled that recent repo market tensions as well as counterparty feedback showed that the Eurosystem needed to play a more active role in the supply of securities in the repo market.",
        "The Executive Board therefore put forward several suggestions to address the generalised and increasing scarcity of bonds and this had to be seen in the light of the Governing Council’s general decision of 1 April 2015 to make all PSPP holdings available for lending.",
        "The proposal covered three aspects: first, the acceptance of cash as collateral against securities; second, the pricing of the securities lending facilities; and third, the size of the limits applied to the securities lending programmes.",
        "Mr Cœuré emphasised that these changes would form an integral part of the ECB’s communication following the meeting and would underline that the Governing Council was mindful of the impact of Eurosystem action on market functioning and stood ready to react to it.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, there was broad agreement among the members of the Governing Council with the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area, as provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "According to recent data and survey results, the recovery in the euro area was continuing at a moderate pace, while firming somewhat.",
        "Looking ahead, domestic demand in the euro area was expected to remain resilient, supported by real disposable income growth and sustained employment creation as well as very favourable financing conditions, underpinned by the continued pass-through of the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "At the same time, growth prospects were dampened by political and economic uncertainty, as well as a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms and remaining balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors.",
        "This assessment was also reflected in the outlook for growth in the December 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "Compared with the September 2016 ECB staff projections, the growth outlook was broadly unchanged.",
        "In discussing the outlook and risks to the external environment, it was noted that the latest staff projections also contained a broadly unchanged outlook for global activity.",
        "However, while global economic growth was expected to pick up gradually, the external outlook was perceived to be rather uncertain, given the still unclear economic impact of the result of the UK referendum on leaving the European Union, the unexpected outcome of the US presidential election and developments in emerging market economies.",
        "Attention was drawn to the recent sizeable movements in US bond yields and to the potential for larger corrections in global bond and foreign exchange markets.",
        "Such movements were considered particularly relevant for emerging market economies, also in view of large exposures to dollar-denominated debt in these economies.",
        "This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on global growth and euro area external demand.",
        "Turning to the euro area, there was broad agreement with the growth outlook in the December 2016 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "These projections confirmed that the moderate recovery in the euro area economy was continuing, while firming somewhat, with small upward revisions to the outlook for 2016 and 2017.",
        "This was seen to confirm that the recovery remained on track and was becoming more robust and more broadly based.",
        "In this context, a number of positive economic developments were referred to, including the ongoing improvements in the labour market, even if labour market conditions overall were still far from satisfactory, and the latest economic sentiment indicators, which were positive and had surprised on the upside.",
        "Finally, it was observed that risks to the baseline which had been identified previously had not materialised.",
        "Overall, therefore, the broadly unchanged forecast for growth in 2016 could be considered to confirm the resilience of the recovery during the past year, with the euro area maintaining its modest path of recovery despite the various shocks that had occurred.",
        "In exchanging views on the risks to the euro area growth outlook, members highlighted that a number of further shocks could materialise in the future and that the overall situation remained one of considerable uncertainty, which could adversely affect corporate and household savings and investment.",
        "In particular, it had to be acknowledged that political uncertainty remained high.",
        "However, a number of upside risks to euro area growth were also considered, notably the prospect of positive spillovers from stronger US growth, related to the incoming administration’s fiscal stimulus plans, and the possibility of a more expansionary fiscal stance in the euro area.",
        "It was also suggested that labour market developments in the euro area might continue to be more dynamic than expected, given recurrent positive surprises.",
        "As regards elevated political uncertainty, it was argued that available analysis, based on various uncertainty measures, suggested this should have a limited effect on economic activity, although it would affect forecast uncertainty.",
        "Against this background, risks to the euro area growth outlook were, overall, judged to remain tilted to the downside, though some members assessed the balance of risks to be more positive.",
        "It was recalled that the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy stance supported economic activity, but that other policy areas needed to contribute much more decisively.",
        "In particular, structural reforms were necessary in all euro area countries.",
        "This was vital to increase investment and boost job creation.",
        "The enhancement of current investment initiatives, progress with the capital markets union and reforms that would improve the resolution of non-performing loans would also contribute positively to this objective.",
        "It was highlighted that fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union.",
        "Concerns were expressed regarding decisions at the European level that cast doubt on the functioning of the Stability and Growth Pact, and it was stressed that full and consistent implementation of the Pact over time and across countries remained crucial to ensure confidence in the fiscal framework.",
        "At the same time, it was essential that all countries intensified their efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies.",
        "With regard to price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the outlook presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Annual euro area headline inflation had been 0.6% in November 2016, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 0.5% in October and 0.4% in September.",
        "To a large extent, the recent increases in headline inflation reflected developments in annual energy price inflation, while the increase in the rate of inflation in November was mainly related to an increase in food prices.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to rise significantly in the coming months, mainly as a result of strong upward base effects in the annual rate of change of energy prices, and inflation was expected to increase further in 2018 and 2019, supported by the projected economic recovery and the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "This assessment was reflected in the December 2016 Eurosystem staff projections, where the outlook for headline HICP inflation was broadly unchanged in comparison with the September 2016 ECB staff projections.",
        "In discussing the latest staff projections, members underlined that headline inflation was moving in the right direction and that, in the absence of further adverse shocks, inflation could be expected to move much closer to the ECB’s inflation aim over the projection horizon.",
        "However, while they acknowledged that progress had been made, it was not yet deemed sufficient, as inflation was not projected to return to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term on a sustained basis.",
        "Moreover, the annual rate of HICP inflation excluding food and energy had remained unchanged in November, at 0.8%, and had been revised down over the projection horizon in the December staff projections.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation seemed very slow to increase and needed to be monitored closely, given that there was, as yet, no convincing upward trend visible.",
        "Reference was made to some positive indications regarding recent developments in inflation expectations for the euro area.",
        "While survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, such as the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, remained broadly unchanged for the period five years ahead, at around 1.8%, there had been an increase in market-based inflation expectations since the last monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council.",
        "Notably, the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had risen to around 1.7%.",
        "It was also considered to be a positive sign that the probability of deflation had decreased further.",
        "Deflation risks were, at present, seen to be much lower than when the APP had been increased to €80 billion per month in March 2016.",
        "Members exchanged views on the risks surrounding the increase in inflation expected in the December Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Caution was expressed, in particular, about the inflation profile towards the end of the horizon, on the grounds that the standard forecasting models were typically subject to some mean reversion.",
        "Considering inflation over the next one to two years, it was underlined that inflation was projected to reach only around 1.5%.",
        "Comparing inflation projections two years ahead with outcomes since 2012, there had been significant over-prediction.",
        "It was highlighted that the largest forecast errors had been on wages and that, despite the positive developments observed in employment, there were still no clear signs of labour market pressures.",
        "The point was made that the degree of slack in euro area labour markets might be greater than assumed in the staff projections, which would imply a slower path for wages than that expected in the projections.",
        "In addition, it was recalled that there were still downside risks associated with developments in the external environment, notably as regards emerging market economies, which could lead to weaker foreign demand resulting in lower inflation pressures.",
        "At the same time, there were also some indications of a stronger increase in inflation than that foreseen in the staff projections.",
        "In particular, the impact of the recent OPEC agreement on oil production, which was likely to lead to a stronger profile for energy price inflation in the short term, had not been included in the December 2016 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Higher headline inflation could, in turn, be expected to have an influence on future wage dynamics.",
        "The wage bargaining process had been quite subdued so far, but this might change once workers realised that real wages were not increasing, or were even decreasing.",
        "In some countries, indexation could strengthen upward pressures on wages.",
        "It was also suggested that the fiscal measures foreseen by the incoming US administration could have an upward impact on euro area price developments, which were not reflected in the projections.",
        "Overall, both downside and upside risks to the inflation outlook were seen to warrant close monitoring.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) had moderated in October 2016, with its annual rate of growth decreasing to 4.4%, after 5.1% in September.",
        "As in previous months, annual growth in M3 had been mainly supported by its most liquid components.",
        "Loan dynamics had followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014, with growth in loans to non-financial corporations increasing in October, while the growth of loans to households had remained unchanged.",
        "It was stressed that credit conditions remained overall very supportive, also reflecting the continued effective transmission of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014.",
        "Borrowing costs for firms had continued to decline, bank lending growth had further strengthened and market funding for corporations, despite the recent uptick in bond yields, remained generally very favourable.",
        "Positive developments were also visible for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).",
        "Reference was made to the results of the latest SAFE, in which SMEs had reported an overall improvement in their financial situation and in the availability of external sources of finance, as the increased willingness of banks to provide credit at lower interest rates had further facilitated SMEs’ access to bank financing.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that an environment of increased uncertainty, including global factors such as risks pertaining to emerging markets, could slow investment and credit dynamics looking ahead.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that, while inflation was set to pick up over the coming years, supported by the firming recovery, there was as yet insufficient progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Therefore, there was broad agreement that an extension of asset purchases beyond March 2017 was warranted to preserve the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "It was underlined that, despite some repricing in global bond markets since the previous monetary policy meeting, overall financial conditions, aided by the monetary policy stimulus in place, remained very supportive to the euro area recovery.",
        "In particular, the ECB’s monetary policy measures were continuing to pass through to borrowing conditions for households and firms and to strengthen credit creation, underpinning consumption and investment spending.",
        "Nonetheless, it was noted that, as uncertainty was high, further volatility in financial market prices, notably in bond markets, could not be ruled out.",
        "In their assessment of the overall monetary policy stance, members broadly agreed that the inflation outlook and the risks surrounding it warranted keeping a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation in place and extending the APP beyond March 2017.",
        "While the recovery was firming and some progress was visible in the inflation trajectory, the scenario of a gradual uptrend in inflation still relied, to a considerable degree, on accommodative monetary policy support.",
        "Taken together with the protracted weakness in underlying inflation, a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term would not be achieved with sufficient confidence.",
        "Therefore, preserving a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation beyond March 2017 was seen as necessary to secure the sustained return of inflation towards levels consistent with the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Against this background, members exchanged views on the options presented by Mr Praet in his introduction: either to continue APP purchases from April 2017 at the current pace of €80 billion for an additional six months or to extend the programme by nine months until the end of December 2017 at a monthly pace of €60 billion.",
        "In this context, great appreciation was expressed for the preparatory technical work conducted by the Eurosystem committees, including on options that had not been tabled for the present meeting.",
        "A few members voiced an initial preference for the first option presented by Mr Praet, whereby purchases would be continued at a monthly pace of €80 billion for an intended horizon of six months, while expressing readiness to join a consensus forming on the second option.",
        "It was highlighted that the first option had the merit of continuity with established policy and was more in line with market expectations.",
        "In addition, its higher monthly pace compared with the second option provided potential for more powerful monetary stimulus in the short term.",
        "At the same time, maintaining the monthly pace of €80 billion in an environment of declining market liquidity could put increasing pressure on market yields.",
        "Very broad support emerged among members for the second option presented by Mr Praet, namely to continue purchases beyond March 2017 at a monthly pace of €60 billion for an intended horizon of nine months.",
        "Overall, this option was seen as striking the right balance between providing a signal of confidence and the need to preserve stability in an uncertain environment, while having clear merits in terms of flexibility to respond to adverse circumstances and safeguarding operational feasibility.",
        "The reduction in the monthly pace, together with the envisaged adjustments of APP parameters, was seen as easing the pressure on market liquidity and ensuring a more robust implementation, while leaving sufficient room for manoeuvre to upscale the programme if needed and allowing for a prolonged presence of the Eurosystem in the market.",
        "The view was widely shared that the recalibration of the programme under this option, including reverting to the initial monthly pace of APP purchases of €60 billion decided in January 2015, was in line with the Governing Council’s reassessment of the balance of risks, reflecting the growing confidence in the overall economic performance of the euro area economy.",
        "In particular, the recovery was firming and becoming more broad-based, and the deflation risks identified earlier in the year, at the time of the increase in the monthly purchases to €80 billion in March, had largely disappeared.",
        "In this regard, the recalibration reflected the state contingency of the APP.",
        "Nonetheless, the extension of the programme in terms of size and duration also reflected a baseline outlook that, as yet, lacked sufficient progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "It was emphasised that the extension of the purchases over a longer horizon, which also entailed a sizeable increase in the APP purchase volume exceeding half a trillion euro over the period from March to December 2017, provided more persistent support for financial conditions and, thereby, a more lasting transmission of the stimulus measures to underpin the ongoing moderate, but firming, recovery.",
        "Moreover, the more sustained market presence of the Eurosystem provided a source of stability in an environment that was likely to remain subject to a high degree of uncertainty, in which volatility could easily emerge, relating in particular to shocks emanating from the political environment at the global level and within the euro area.",
        "In this context, reference was made to the latest volatility in global bond markets, where the substantial repricing from recent record valuations over the previous few weeks was seen, in part, to reflect higher uncertainty but possibly also to herald a more fundamental reassessment in the markets.",
        "Against this background it was emphasised that, in such an uncertain and volatile environment, monetary policy was best advised to follow a “steady-hand” approach that protected financial conditions in the euro area over the period ahead and allowed the recovery to mature and strengthen.",
        "The differences in the monetary policy cycles of major global central banks were also underlined, and it was stressed that, so far, spillovers to the euro area from the incipient normalisation of US monetary policy and the related increase of medium and long-term yields had been rather contained.",
        "There was hence broad agreement that, as an integral part of the second option, the Governing Council needed to retain the necessary flexibility to again upscale APP purchases, if needed.",
        "Should the economic outlook deteriorate or financial conditions tighten unduly, the Governing Council could again increase the size and/or duration of the programme, possibly re-scaling purchases to a pace of €80 billion, and the Governing Council needed to remain strongly committed to securing the sustained convergence of inflation towards its inflation aim.",
        "Very broad support emerged among members for the option to continue purchases beyond March 2017 at a monthly pace of €60 billion for an intended horizon of nine months, while some members had initially expressed a preference for a shorter or longer horizon for the purchases.",
        "The argument was put forward that a longer horizon for the purchases, beyond the proposed intended horizon of December 2017, could reinforce a sustained market presence of the Eurosystem to shield the euro area recovery for longer from possible adverse influences.",
        "Arguments were also put forward in support of a shorter purchase horizon, namely limited to six months, at a rescaled pace of purchases of €60 billion.",
        "It was noted that greater flexibility with regard to the intended time horizon of the purchases might be warranted given the improved state of the euro area economy, the more balanced risk assessment and the possible emergence of upside risks to the outlook for growth and inflation.",
        "Against this backdrop, the point was made that the preservation of the current degree of monetary policy accommodation with respect to the APP could be given different interpretations, relating to the stock or the monthly flow of purchases.",
        "A few members could not support either of the two options that had been proposed, while welcoming the scaling-down of purchases and other elements of the proposals, in view of their well-known general scepticism regarding the APP and public debt purchases in particular.",
        "According to this view, the latter should remain a contingency instrument to be employed only as a last resort in an adverse scenario, such as a situation of imminent deflation, which was not applicable at present, as deflation risks had largely dissipated.",
        "Moreover, possible adverse side effects from further sovereign asset purchases, particularly in the medium to long term and related to the interaction with the fiscal domain, needed to be taken into account.",
        "As regards implementation aspects, members assessed that some parameters of the APP needed to be changed in order to facilitate a continued smooth implementation of the programme, thereby ensuring the fulfilment of the Governing Council’s price stability objective.",
        "The assessment benefited from the technical work that had been conducted by the Eurosystem committees in the preceding months.",
        "Overall, members saw merit in broadening the maturity range of the PSPP by decreasing the minimum remaining maturity for eligible securities from two years to one year and by permitting and making use of, to the extent necessary, purchases of securities under the APP with a yield to maturity below the interest rate on the deposit facility.",
        "These measures were seen as supporting the effective implementation of the APP and serving to enlarge the eligible purchasable universe to ensure continued purchases at the envisaged pace over the intended horizon to December 2017, or beyond, if necessary.",
        "While the economic benefit of directing a greater share of purchases at shorter maturities was seen to be limited in terms of extracting duration from the market, a slight reduction in the average maturity in the Eurosystem’s APP portfolio could be seen to be better in line with the principle of market neutrality, as well as more in tune with the maturity spectrum typically most relevant for the financing of the private sector.",
        "Moreover, the implied somewhat steeper yield curve could possibly also benefit maturity transformation and the profitability of the banking sector.",
        "The legal implications, communication challenges and reputational risks of alternative parameter changes, namely an increase in issue and issuer limits, made them unsuitable to be included among the options put forward to the Governing Council.",
        "With respect to the proposed measures to further enhance the effectiveness of the Eurosystem’s PSPP securities lending facilities, as presented by Mr Cœuré in his introduction, members generally acknowledged the importance of these measures in supporting the smooth implementation of public sector purchases under the APP.",
        "The proposed measures would render the securities lending facilities more attractive and would support the liquidity and functioning of the euro area repo market.",
        "In particular, accepting cash as collateral in the PSPP securities lending facilities was widely supported.",
        "It was highlighted that the rationale for the acceptance of cash collateral was to alleviate collateral scarcity in the market rather than to create a new monetary policy instrument.",
        "As regards communication, members widely agreed on the need to emphasise that, in view of the prevailing outlook for price stability and the surrounding risks, the extension of the APP was warranted to fulfil the Governing Council’s price stability objective.",
        "While the outlook for growth had improved and risks of deflation had receded further, which allowed a recalibration of the programme’s pace back to the initial monthly volume of €60 billion, underlying price pressures still remained muted and failed to show any clear signs of a convincing upturn.",
        "Accordingly, the APP extension was calibrated in terms of pace and horizon, together with the sizeable volumes of forthcoming reinvestments, to preserve the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "As emphasised in previous Governing Council communication, it needed to be reiterated that, given prevailing uncertainties, the Governing Council would continue to monitor closely the evolution of the outlook for price stability and, if warranted to achieve its objective, would act by using all the instruments available within its mandate.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided to keep the interest rates on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council continued to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.",
        "Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council decided to continue its purchases under the APP at the current monthly pace of €80 billion until the end of March 2017.",
        "From April 2017, the net asset purchases were intended to continue at a monthly pace of €60 billion until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "If, in the meantime, the outlook became less favourable or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment of the path of inflation, the Governing Council intended to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration.",
        "The net purchases would be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP.",
        "In addition to the extension of the programme, the following parameters would be adjusted on 2 January 2017: the maturity range of the PSPP would be broadened by decreasing the minimum remaining maturity for eligible securities from two years to one year; and purchases of securities under the APP with a yield to maturity below the interest rate on the ECB’s deposit facility would be permitted to the extent necessary.",
        "The implementation details would be worked out by the relevant committees.",
        "Furthermore, the Governing Council decided that Eurosystem central banks would have the possibility also to accept cash as collateral in their PSPP securities lending facilities without having to reinvest it in a cash-neutral manner.",
        "The overall limit for securities lending against cash collateral was set at €50 billion for the Eurosystem.",
        "To avoid unduly curtailing normal repo market activity, the cash collateral option would be offered at a rate equal to the lower of the rate on the deposit facility minus 30 basis points (i.e.",
        "currently -70 basis points) and the prevailing market repo rate.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the draft introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Yield curves in the US and German bond markets had flattened quite materially, by around 40 basis points and 30 basis points respectively, since about mid-March.",
        "Interestingly, this period of flattening on both sides of the Atlantic had coincided with a general strengthening of global growth momentum.",
        "In the United States, the market was seen as correcting what appeared to have been excessive market optimism in the wake of the US presidential election and a revision of the expected US economic policy impulses.",
        "Accordingly, markets might no longer be assessing the medium to long-run US macroeconomic outlook in the same light as a few months before.",
        "It was also interesting to observe that long-term bond yields in the United States had fallen despite growing market expectations of a reduction in the Federal Reserve balance sheet, which had also been supported by official communication.",
        "According to the last Federal Open Market Committee minutes, nearly all policymakers deemed it appropriate to start reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings this year.",
        "They had also clarified the likely modus operandi for reducing the balance sheet by announcing “caps” on US Treasuries and agency securities that would be allowed to run off each month.",
        "Only the part of the overall bond repayments that exceeded the month’s cap would be reinvested.",
        "This, in combination with other factors, implied that the net supply of US Treasuries was widely expected to increase, which, ceteris paribus, should cause long-term yields to rise and not to fall.",
        "Changes in the expected future path of short-term interest rates might have helped to offset this upward pressure on bond yields over previous weeks, as market participants had been backtracking on their interest rate expectations both in the United States and in the euro area.",
        "In particular, following the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 26-27 April 2017, expectations of a 10-basis point rise in the deposit facility rate had gradually increased, fully pricing in a rate hike by mid-2018.",
        "However, towards the end of May, market expectations had fallen back to the levels prevailing at the time of the previous Governing Council meeting.",
        "Long-term bond yields of the safest euro area sovereign issuers had also fallen, on the whole, since the previous Governing Council monetary policy meeting, despite the continued string of positive economic news and evidence from surveys that a growing number of market participants were expecting a reduction in the monthly pace of APP purchases, starting early next year.",
        "Yet, immediately after the French Presidential election and well into mid-May, sovereign bond yields increased in jurisdictions considered safe havens and declined in other euro area jurisdictions.",
        "The spread between French and German ten-year government bond yields stabilised slightly above 40 basis points in mid-May, marking a sharp decline from the levels around 75 basis points that had prevailed shortly before the election.",
        "Another case in point was the strong performance of Portuguese government bonds, which was underpinned by broad-based international investor demand.",
        "Moving to the equity markets, the decline in US long-term yields and the continued low level of yields in the euro area had remained generally supportive of stock market developments.",
        "Moreover, equity valuations in both the United States and the euro area remained supported by solid corporate earnings and favourable data.",
        "Gains in stock prices had been relatively broad-based, covering both financial and non-financial firms.",
        "The improved economic outlook was thus much more visible in global equity markets than appeared to be the case in bond markets.",
        "Implied market volatility was also at historic lows, suggesting no concern about a sharp adjustment.",
        "Indeed, the rally in the stock markets appeared to be fairly robust to variations in political uncertainty, which no longer seemed to be factored in.",
        "Positive cyclical and political developments had also been driving market developments in the euro area corporate bond markets, where credit spreads had fallen to their lowest level since the start of the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP).",
        "In addition to stocks and peripheral government bonds, investors had been investing in corporate bonds, as seen from the yields on A+ and BBB-rated instruments.",
        "Primary market activity had also surged.",
        "Mr Cœuré stated that the composition of CSPP holdings mirrored that of the eligible bond universe quite closely.",
        "Turning to the foreign exchange market, the euro had appreciated by 3% against the US dollar since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting and by 8% since the start of the year.",
        "In nominal effective terms against the currencies of 38 of the euro area’s major trading partners, the euro had appreciated by 2% since the meeting.",
        "The appreciation had been accompanied by a reversal of investors’ euro positioning, as shown by data published by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, from the short to the long side in May, and for the first time in many years the sign in net positions had changed.",
        "Moreover, in the foreign exchange options market, the volatility priced into put and call option premia had become more balanced compared with end-March and with one year before.",
        "Political developments were likely to have also contributed to a strengthening of the euro in effective terms, in particular against the pound sterling, as uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the UK general election on 8 June 2017 had picked up noticeably.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Global activity and trade had maintained their momentum, as reflected in survey-based indicators such as the global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for May, with the recovery of trade growth mainly driven by developments in emerging markets.",
        "Global inflation for the OECD area had increased slightly to 2.4% in April, after 2.3% in March.",
        "Excluding food and energy, it had edged up to 1.9%, after 1.8% in the previous month.",
        "Commodity prices had declined since the 26-27 April Governing Council meeting, Brent crude oil by 4.6% and non-oil prices by 2.5%, both in US dollar terms, while the euro had appreciated by 2% in nominal effective terms over the same horizon.",
        "For the euro area, growth in real GDP was solid and broad-based.",
        "According to Eurostat’s latest estimate, real GDP had increased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2017, following 0.5% in the previous quarter.",
        "The broad-based economic expansion had been mainly driven by domestic demand on the back of sustained employment gains, higher real disposable income and favourable financing conditions.",
        "The unemployment rate had declined to 9.3% in April, down from 9.4% in March and averaging 9.5% in the first quarter of 2017.",
        "Looking ahead, survey-based indicators pointed to continued robust growth in the second quarter.",
        "The composite output PMI had stood at 56.8 in April and May, compared with 55.6, on average, for the first quarter of 2017.",
        "The European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) had recorded 109.7 in April and 109.2 in May, after a first-quarter average of 108.0.",
        "The improved sentiment had been broad-based across sectors and both the PMI and the ESI currently stood above their respective historical averages.",
        "Moreover, trade and euro area exports were increasingly benefiting from the global recovery.",
        "The outlook for investment in the euro area was improving, as confirmed by the European Commission’s latest biannual industrial investment survey, released on 27 April 2017.",
        "Real business investment continued its cyclical recovery broadly in line with GDP growth.",
        "At the same time, from a longer-term perspective, business investment in the fourth quarter of 2016 was still 3% below its pre-crisis peak of the first quarter of 2008.",
        "Compared with the March ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth in the June Eurosystem staff projections had been revised upwards over the projection horizon, to 1.9% for 2017, 1.8% for 2018 and 1.7% for 2019.",
        "With regard to euro area price developments, HICP inflation had been volatile over the previous few months, standing at 1.4% in May, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, after 1.9% in April and 1.5% in March.",
        "The decrease in headline inflation in May had been mainly due to a decline in services price inflation, after the strong pick-up in April due to the Easter effect, and a fall in energy inflation, while food inflation had remained stable.",
        "Looking through the recent volatility underlying inflation remained subdued, mainly reflecting still subdued domestic cost pressures, notably from wages.",
        "The pass-through of the strong pick-up in intermediate goods producer prices to non-food consumer goods producer prices still appeared to be weak.",
        "Thus far, there had been no convincing signs of an upward adjustment in underlying inflation.",
        "Compared with the March ECB staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation in the June Eurosystem staff projections had been revised downwards, mainly reflecting lower oil prices, to 1.5% for 2017, 1.3% for 2018 and 1.6% for 2019.",
        "This was slightly lower than the forecasts of other institutions for 2017 and at the lower end of the range for 2018 and 2019.",
        "Longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remained broadly unchanged from the 26-27 April Governing Council meeting, with the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead having declined by 3 basis points to 1.58%.",
        "There were hardly any signs of remaining deflationary risks in the market, while option-implied measures pointed to low, but positive, inflation as the most likely scenario over the next few years.",
        "Turning to monetary and financing conditions, the EONIA forward curve had also stood close to levels observed around the 26-27 April meeting, suggesting no material change in monetary policy expectations overall.",
        "At the same time, the nominal cost of borrowing for both non-financial corporations (NFCs) and households for house purchase had remained broadly stable in April, at historical lows.",
        "Since the introduction of credit easing measures in mid-2014 and the introduction of the asset purchase programme (APP), banks had been passing on the decline in their funding costs in the form of lower bank lending rates.",
        "However, recent developments pointed to a flattening of the decline.",
        "The annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 had moderated to 4.9% in April, after 5.3% in March, with robust M1 growth as the main driver.",
        "Loans had continued to recover gradually.",
        "According to the April 2017 euro area bank lending survey, credit standards had eased slightly in net terms in the first quarter of 2017, while net demand had continued to increase.",
        "The net issuance of debt securities by NFCs had remained robust.",
        "Overall, bank lending volumes seemed to be broadly in line with historical patterns at the euro area level.",
        "According to the latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises, covering the period from October 2016 to March 2017, euro area small and medium-sized enterprises had continued to signal improvements in the availability of bank loans.",
        "Euro area bank profitability, as measured by return on equity, had declined in 2016 following one-off costs associated with provisions in some large banks.",
        "Preliminary information pointed to an improvement in profitability in the first quarter of 2017.",
        "With regard to fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was expected to remain broadly neutral over the projection horizon.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet noted that financial conditions remained very supportive of continued economic expansion in the euro area.",
        "The pass-through of the ECB’s monetary policy measures to credit conditions remained powerful.",
        "Financial conditions had also been increasingly reflecting the improved euro area macroeconomic environment.",
        "Incoming information since the late-April meeting of the Governing Council confirmed that the economic upturn had gathered some further momentum.",
        "The latest Eurosystem staff projections also pointed to a solid and broad-based economic expansion, at a somewhat faster pace than previously expected.",
        "Risks to the growth outlook could now be considered to be broadly balanced, supporting confidence that the economic expansion was on a stronger footing.",
        "Yet, despite the strengthening of the economic expansion, inflation remained subdued.",
        "In the June Eurosystem staff projections, euro area HICP inflation had been revised down over the projection horizon, mainly owing to energy price developments.",
        "Indicators of underlying inflation had continued to show no clear upward trend, as unutilised resources were still weighing on domestic price and wage formation.",
        "Overall, evidence continued to indicate that progress on a durable and self-sustaining convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim remained conditional on the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "As risks to the growth outlook could be judged to be broadly balanced and the likelihood of very adverse contingencies to have diminished, the Governing Council had to consider aligning its forward guidance with this changed risk assessment by removing the reference to further rate cuts from its forward guidance on the expected path of the key ECB interest rates, which had been signalling a policy response to very severe contingencies.",
        "At the same time, the Governing Council could keep the other elements of its forward guidance in place, as progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation had not fundamentally improved.",
        "Therefore, the Governing Council could continue to signal its policy direction in case sustained convergence of inflation towards its aim was at risk.",
        "Finally, Mr Praet recommended that, in its communication, the Governing Council should stress the improvement in the growth outlook and that risks surrounding this outlook could be considered broadly balanced.",
        "Furthermore, the Governing Council could reflect the improved risk assessment in its forward guidance by dropping the easing bias on the key ECB interest rates and reiterate, in view of persistently subdued underlying inflation, that a substantial degree of accommodation was still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation in the medium term.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members widely agreed with the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Incoming data and survey results confirmed that the euro area economic recovery had continued to firm and broaden, supported by very favourable financing conditions, which in turn were supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "Looking ahead, economic activity in the euro area was expected to expand at a somewhat faster pace than previously expected.",
        "This assessment was broadly reflected in the June 2017 Eurosystem staff projections, in which the outlook for real GDP growth had been revised up slightly across the projection horizon.",
        "The risks to the euro area growth outlook were viewed as broadly balanced.",
        "Concerning the external environment, the global economic recovery was seen to have extended into 2017 and to be increasingly supporting trade and euro area exports, while the medium-term outlook for global growth was largely unchanged, as reflected in the June projections.",
        "The balance of risks to global economic activity was assessed to remain on the downside, reflecting mainly geopolitical risks, uncertainty regarding future policies, in particular in the United States, and fragilities and balance sheet weaknesses in some emerging market economies, such as Brazil, Turkey and China.",
        "Turning to the euro area, recent data and survey indicators pointed to a further firming of the economic recovery.",
        "Moreover, euro area capacity utilisation was rising and unemployment had continued to decline, in line with the Governing Council’s earlier expectations.",
        "In some large euro area economies, recent data had surprised on the upside.",
        "It was also noted that, after the cut-off date for the Eurosystem staff projection exercise, data in two large euro area economies had been stronger than expected and euro area real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017 had been revised up from 0.5% to 0.6% quarter on quarter.",
        "Looking ahead, the economic expansion in the euro area was expected to continue to firm and broaden, as reflected in the June 2017 Eurosystem staff projections, which embodied upward revisions for 2018 and 2019.",
        "These upward revisions to the more medium-term outlook were, however, less pronounced than for the near term.",
        "The outlook for euro area domestic demand was seen to be supported mainly by a continued expansion of private consumption and a firming of private investment, which made the euro area recovery relatively robust and less susceptible to external vulnerabilities.",
        "These developments pointed to a possibly stronger than expected economic upswing and an increasingly self-sustaining recovery over the medium term.",
        "Consumption was benefiting from a continued increase in disposable income, fuelled by employment gains and low energy prices, as well as increased household wealth in an environment of rising asset prices.",
        "Private investment was seen to be firming, supported by accommodative financing conditions, improvements in corporate profitability and rising confidence in medium-term growth prospects.",
        "A positive signal in that context was that access to finance was improving, as recorded in the latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises.",
        "This was supported not only by favourable financing conditions but also by more positive credit risk assessments by credit institutions, including for smaller companies.",
        "In addition, several indicators pointed to progress in deleveraging among NFCs.",
        "Taking a broader perspective, euro area real GDP growth projections for 2017 and beyond had now been revised upwards in a number of staff projection rounds.",
        "It was noted that the projected expansion of economic activity implied a prolonged period of growth above potential and that a significant further acceleration beyond the presently projected growth path appeared unlikely, given remaining rigidities in euro area goods and labour markets which had not been sufficiently addressed by structural reforms.",
        "Concerning risks to the euro area growth outlook, members agreed that risks to activity had become broadly balanced, in line with the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The view was expressed that downside risks identified in previous monetary policy meetings had remained broadly unchanged, or had decreased slightly, while upside risks had become more prevalent.",
        "At the same time, it was also argued that downside risks related to the euro area domestic economy and political risks had diminished markedly.",
        "Downside risks were seen to stem in particular from the global environment, related to geopolitical factors and vulnerabilities in some emerging market economies.",
        "Political risks inside and outside the euro area also remained relevant, even though they had diminished somewhat.",
        "In this context, a call was made not to overestimate the impact of normal electoral cycles on economic confidence or on financial market developments.",
        "A further downside risk related to sentiment in the financial markets, which had continued to improve but could at some point be reversed.",
        "Balance sheet risks in the non-financial corporate sector had become less pronounced since deleveraging appeared to be well advanced, as shown in declining indebtedness ratios.",
        "In the financial sector, fragilities had decreased but some risks remained, including those related to non-performing loans.",
        "Upside risks were generally seen to have become somewhat more pronounced, particularly with respect to the near term, as had been highlighted by the recent positive surprises in hard data and survey indicators.",
        "These developments supported a continued firming of activity and a possibly stronger than expected economic upswing, while they were also seen as raising the prospect of an increasingly self-sustained recovery over the medium term.",
        "Notably, accelerator effects could be expected to set in and lead to a higher growth path over time.",
        "In addition, looking ahead, it was possible that some countries would engage more forcefully in addressing product and labour market rigidities, which could further bolster growth over the medium term.",
        "Members recalled that the outlook for a continued firming of the economic recovery was conditional on very favourable financing conditions, supported also by the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "At the same time, it was seen as crucial for other policy actors to contribute more decisively to ensure a sustained and durable recovery.",
        "With regard to price developments, members broadly shared the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Annual euro area HICP inflation was 1.4% in May 2017, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 1.9% in April and 1.5% in March.",
        "Over the coming months, headline inflation was expected to remain around current levels.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation remained low and were expected to rise only gradually over the medium term, in line with the continued economic expansion.",
        "The June 2017 Eurosystem staff projections for HICP inflation had been revised downwards across the projection horizon, mainly on account of a fall in energy prices between the cut-off points used in the March and June projections.",
        "Commenting on recent inflation developments, it was pointed out that the decline in HICP inflation to 1.4% in May 2017 mainly reflected volatility in energy and food prices, as well as declining services price inflation owing largely to Easter effects.",
        "This was seen as broadly in line with the Governing Council’s assessment at earlier meetings, where it had been highlighted that energy price volatility, coupled with seasonal and base effects, could trigger some volatility in headline inflation in the near term.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation had remained broadly unchanged and had not shown convincing signs of a sustained upward adjustment.",
        "Looking ahead, the outlook for headline inflation was expected to be more subdued than previously anticipated.",
        "This assessment was broadly reflected in the June 2017 Eurosystem staff projections, which saw annual HICP inflation at 1.5% in 2017, 1.3% in 2018 and 1.6% in 2019, implying a downward revision from the March ECB staff projections across the projection horizon.",
        "It was highlighted that this downward revision was largely driven by changes in energy prices and oil futures prices, since the March ECB staff projections had been strongly influenced by the high level of energy prices prevailing at that time.",
        "It was also noted that the path for headline inflation would be determined, to a large extent, by base effects over the coming year.",
        "Assuming unchanged oil prices and other commodity prices, in conjunction with a revised profile for food price projections, headline inflation was currently projected to follow a V-shaped pattern, which required careful explanation and communication.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that the ECB’s medium-term oriented strategy suggested looking through such temporary developments and called for a symmetric approach.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation were, overall, expected to remain subdued in the near term, picking up gradually thereafter, in line with the continuing economic expansion and reduction in economic slack.",
        "This was seen in the June 2017 Eurosystem staff projections, which foresaw HICP inflation excluding energy and food picking up only gradually, reaching 1.4% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019, which implied a slight downward revision from the March 2017 ECB staff projections.",
        "A number of comments were made about the combination of a downward revision to the outlook for underlying inflation and an upward revision to the outlook for economic activity in the staff projections.",
        "This was seen as puzzling, all the more so as the output gap was expected to close over the projection horizon, which should translate into higher upward wage and price pressures over time.",
        "In that context, caution was also expressed regarding measures of economic slack, which were surrounded by large uncertainties.",
        "Some measures of slack, such as official unemployment data, were likely to underestimate the real degree of unutilised resources and broader measures of unemployment could be more relevant.",
        "Yet, it was also remarked that the downward revisions in the June 2017 Eurosystem staff projections for underlying inflation should not be overstated and it was underlined that the projected profile of HICP inflation excluding energy and food was unchanged when comparing the June 2017 projections with the December 2016 projections.",
        "A number of comments were also made on the limited responsiveness of wages and prices to the gradual reduction in economic slack in the June projections.",
        "Wage dynamics had been subdued so far and were expected to remain moderate over the projection horizon, picking up only gradually as the economic recovery gained traction.",
        "This assessment was corroborated by Phillips curve estimates for the euro area, which had been relatively flat in recent years, with wages hardly responding to declining unemployment.",
        "This could be explained, inter alia, by structural factors such as past labour market reforms, which were needed to increase the robustness and flexibility of euro area labour markets but implied a moderation in wage dynamics.",
        "Hence, the point was made that, to the extent that it was driven by structural changes, low inflation could prove to be rather protracted.",
        "Against this background, it was felt that, overall, the downward revisions in the June projections had resulted in a more plausible scenario for underlying inflation than had been the case in the March projections.",
        "At the same time, the downward revisions in the baseline for headline and underlying inflation were seen to imply that the potential for upward surprises to the lower path of inflation was now higher.",
        "Hence, the argument was made that the changes in the baseline had to be seen in conjunction with associated changes in the risk assessment, which suggested a broadly unchanged inflation outlook overall.",
        "It was furthermore remarked that the prospects for wage dynamics could be influenced by a number of factors that required close monitoring and further analysis.",
        "On the one hand, it could be expected that some euro area governments would proceed with further labour market reforms, thereby fostering continued wage moderation over the medium term.",
        "In addition, as wage-setting appeared, to some extent, to be still driven by backward-looking components, it was possible that past low levels of inflation would contribute to continued wage moderation.",
        "On the other hand, it was noted that the projection for wage developments seemed to be on the cautious side, as a model-based decomposition of projected wage developments pointed to persistent negative unexplained residuals over the projection horizon.",
        "In addition, it was remarked that wage dynamics could become more buoyant beyond some threshold and thus contribute to a faster than expected pick-up in inflation.",
        "For instance, it was observed that, while employment gains had so far included a considerable share of part-time and temporary workers, new employment creation could shift towards more full-time and permanent jobs as labour markets consolidated, making more pronounced upward wage pressures possible.",
        "In view of these considerations, it was argued that conditions were in place for a gradual pick-up in inflation over the medium term, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures and the continued, firming recovery.",
        "However, it was also underlined that some time and patience would be needed to reach the ECB’s medium-term price stability objective in a self-sustaining and durable manner.",
        "Against this background, both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook were seen to prevail.",
        "Upside risks related, inter alia, to stronger than expected growth and more buoyant wage dynamics in the future.",
        "Downside risks related mainly to a weaker than expected recovery, as well as a protracted and unexplained weakness of wages and underlying inflation pressures, as evidenced by past forecast errors.",
        "At the same time, tail risks related to a deflation scenario were seen as having largely dissipated, also in view of the increasingly solid economic recovery.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) had continued to expand at a robust pace.",
        "As in previous months, annual growth in M3 had been mainly supported by its most liquid components, and the recovery in loan growth to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 was proceeding.",
        "The pass-through of the monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 continued to support favourable borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing – notably for small and medium-sized enterprises – and, hence, credit flows across the euro area.",
        "Reference was made to the latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises, which signalled further improvements in external financing conditions and better access to finance, continuing a trend that had already been observed in previous rounds of the survey.",
        "Moreover, the overall improvements in credit markets appeared to be increasingly associated with stronger underlying fundamentals, with the improved macroeconomic environment contributing to the strengthening of firms’ balance sheets and earnings expectations, and thus supporting banks’ more favourable assessments of the credit risk of their customers.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that the level of credit growth to the private sector, while continuing on its recovery path, remained still modest.",
        "Remaining fragilities in parts of the banking sector, notably related to the still significant outstanding stock of non-performing loans on banks’ balance sheets, were seen to be holding back a stronger pass-through of the very accommodative monetary conditions and more robust credit dynamics.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that the euro area economy was expanding at a somewhat faster pace than previously expected and that risks to the growth outlook were now broadly balanced.",
        "However, the economic expansion had still to translate into stronger inflation dynamics and, in particular, underlying inflation pressures had yet to show a convincing upward trend.",
        "Accordingly, members widely agreed that, while the growth outlook had become more favourable, the overall picture of the outlook for price stability had not fundamentally changed.",
        "The volatility observed in inflation data over the past few months, together with the latest downward revision to the inflation outlook, indicated that inflation would remain some way below the Governing Council’s inflation aim for some time to come.",
        "At the same time, risks to the growth outlook had become balanced and deflation risks had largely dissipated, with confidence in the inflation outlook gradually increasing.",
        "Against this background, it was felt that the Governing Council’s communication, including its forward guidance, needed to reflect the changed risk assessment regarding the medium-term outlook for price stability, namely a configuration of increased confidence in the baseline scenario combined with further diminished tail risks.",
        "There was also general agreement among members with the assessment provided by Mr Praet that euro area financial conditions and broader financing conditions remained overall very supportive of the continued economic expansion.",
        "While indicators of financial conditions had remained broadly unchanged overall, they increasingly reflected improved macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "At the same time, the ECB’s monetary policy measures continued to play a key role in preserving the very favourable financing conditions that supported the rebound in the euro area economy and that were necessary for inflation to rise towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "However, it was remarked that, as the economic conditions and fundamentals in the euro area improved further, also compared with other regions in the world, some tightening in financial conditions, notably with respect to bond and foreign exchange markets, was to be expected.",
        "Against this background, members generally agreed that, from the present point of view, the evidence available continued to indicate that convincing progress towards a durable and self-sustaining convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim had yet to be ensured.",
        "Although inflation was gradually moving towards this aim, convincing signs of a more dynamic pick-up in measures of underlying inflation were not yet visible and the baseline inflation scenario remained crucially conditional on very easy financing conditions that, to a large extent, depended on the current accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "This was confirmed by cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis.",
        "While monetary indicators showed robust rates of growth, this also remained conditional, in part, on the accommodative monetary policy measures in place.",
        "Moreover, credit growth, while remaining on its recovery path, was still at moderate levels.",
        "In this context, reference was made to the information value of indicators of money and credit for the Governing Council’s assessment of the prospects for a sustained adjustment in inflation, with indicators from the monetary analysis forming an integral part of the Governing Council’s assessment of the outlook for, and risks to, price stability over the medium term.",
        "Against this background, there was broad agreement among members that the current monetary policy stance remained appropriate.",
        "Accordingly, the view was widely shared that maintaining a steady hand with respect to the monetary policy stance was warranted at the current juncture, while gradual adjustments in the Governing Council’s communication, including the elements of forward guidance, would be in line with the evolving risk assessment.",
        "The broadly unchanged assessment of the medium-term outlook for price stability, together with the associated criteria for defining a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, was generally seen to confirm the need to preserve the present monetary policy stance.",
        "This included the main elements of the Governing Council’s forward guidance pertaining to the ECB’s policy rates and the pace and horizon of purchases under the APP, as well as the sequencing of policy instruments implied in the Governing Council’s forward guidance and the Governing Council’s announcement to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for as long as necessary.",
        "At the same time, against the background of a stronger than anticipated cyclical upswing and balanced risks to the growth outlook, also contributing to diminishing downside tail risks to price stability, members broadly agreed that an alignment of some elements of the stance, pertaining to the Governing Council’s forward guidance, was warranted.",
        "It was recalled that specifically the easing bias on policy rates had been introduced to signal the direction of the Governing Council’s policy response in the event of very severe contingencies that would put the achievement of the inflation objective at risk.",
        "At this juncture, the probability of very adverse scenarios, such as those related to deflationary risks, had largely vanished.",
        "Moreover, while patience was still required for inflation to return to levels consistent with the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim, more solid and broad-based economic growth prospects supported increased confidence in a strengthened resilience of the inflation path to possible adverse developments.",
        "Hence, while continued monetary accommodation was still necessary, the likelihood of contingencies calling for further policy accommodation in the unconventional policy domain, most notably lowering the deposit facility rate further into negative territory, had clearly diminished.",
        "Similarly, it was argued that the improved economic environment with vanishing tail risks, in principle, suggested also revisiting the easing bias with respect to the APP purchases, whereby the Governing Council signalled its readiness to increase the pace and/or duration of the asset purchases if necessary.",
        "However, it was cautioned that prudence remained warranted, as the economic expansion had yet to translate into stronger inflation dynamics, and a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim could not yet be confirmed.",
        "The assessment of the prospects for a sustained adjustment argued for patience, as the inflation outlook remained vulnerable to a premature tightening of the monetary policy stance.",
        "Therefore, in the light of the prevailing uncertainties, predominantly related to global factors, the Governing Council was well advised to adapt its forward guidance to the changing economic environment only very gradually.",
        "In this context, it was also argued that the APP easing bias differed in nature from the easing bias on policy rates.",
        "While the latter was formulated as an expectation of the Governing Council about the future direction of policy interest rates, the APP bias could be interpreted as a description of the Governing Council’s reaction function, indicating its readiness to respond to contingencies by changing the pace and/or horizon of APP purchases.",
        "While such changes had become less likely, leaving this part of the Governing Council’s forward guidance in place for now was considered, on the whole, preferable.",
        "Therefore, broad agreement was expressed among members with the proposal made by Mr Praet in his introduction to remove the reference to further rate cuts from the Governing Council’s forward guidance on the expected path of its key interest rates, while maintaining the other elements of the forward guidance in place.",
        "The gradual adjustment of the Governing Council’s communication, in step with the evolution of its assessment of the economic outlook and the balance of risks, underpinned the consistency and credibility of the Governing Council’s guidance.",
        "Moreover, removing the policy rate bias could support confidence in the strength of the euro area recovery.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that even small and incremental changes in the communication could be misperceived as signalling a more fundamental change in policy direction.",
        "This could trigger unwarranted movements in financial conditions, which could put the prospects of a sustained adjustment of inflation at risk.",
        "Moreover, it was highlighted that dropping the policy rate bias should not be misunderstood as ruling out the use of the interest rate instrument irrespective of the circumstances.",
        "Its removal only signalled that, given the current outlook and risk assessment, from the present perspective a further rate reduction had become unlikely.",
        "Overall, while vanishing tail risks justified the removal of the policy rate bias, the Governing Council needed to continue to signal its readiness to change the size and/or duration of the APP in order to address any contingencies that could endanger a sustainable convergence of inflation towards its inflation aim.",
        "It was also noted that, given the importance of the stock of purchases for the overall effect of the asset purchases on financial conditions, reinvestments should make an important contribution to the overall monetary policy stance.",
        "While there were valid reasons at this juncture to retain the APP easing bias, it was noted that, as the economic expansion proceeded and if confidence in the inflation outlook improved further, the case for retaining this bias could be reviewed.",
        "More generally, it was highlighted that the overall degree of policy accommodation was determined by the combination of all the ECB’s monetary policy measures in place and not just the sum of individual policy measures.",
        "In this regard, remarks were made that the degree of monetary policy accommodation needed to achieve a sustained adjustment in inflation was not determined by net asset purchases in isolation, but by the overall design and direction of the ECB’s monetary policy stance comprising all its elements.",
        "At the same time, it was also underlined that the APP remained a key instrument in case the Governing Council saw the sustained adjustment in the path of inflation at risk, while the use of other instruments within the ECB’s mandate could not be excluded.",
        "As regards communication, members widely agreed with the proposals put forward by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "In particular, it was viewed as important to stress the stronger and broader momentum of the recovery in the euro area economy and the upgrade in the outlook for economic growth, while emphasising that the risks to the growth outlook could now be considered as broadly balanced.",
        "It needed to be highlighted that, against the background of the improved growth environment, very adverse scenarios for the inflation outlook had become less likely, in particular as deflation risks had largely vanished.",
        "This changed risk assessment had to be reflected in the Governing Council’s communication by dropping the reference to the expectation of further rate cuts in its forward guidance on policy rates.",
        "At the same time it had to be stressed that, despite the stronger economic expansion, inflation remained subdued as indicators of underlying inflation continued to remain flat and had yet to show a convincing upward trend.",
        "Therefore, it should be emphasised that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation continued to be necessary to accompany the recovery of the euro area economy and to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "While patience was still needed, confidence should be expressed in the effectiveness of the ECB’s monetary policy measures in supporting the economic upturn, the absorption of economic slack and, ultimately, the sustained convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Therefore, continued caution in communication remained warranted.",
        "In particular, it was necessary to avoid signals that could trigger a premature tightening of financial conditions, which in turn could put the progress made towards a sustained convergence towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim at risk, thereby prolonging the need for extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy.",
        "Therefore, the Governing Council had to remain fully committed to bringing inflation back into line with its medium-term aim.",
        "This included reiterating its continued readiness to change the size and/or duration of its asset purchases should the outlook become less favourable, or if financial conditions were to become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.",
        "At the same time, reflecting the Governing Council’s assessment of changes in the configuration of risks to activity and medium-term price stability, a change in its forward guidance on policy rates was warranted, notably the removal of the reference to “lower policy rates”.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided to keep the interest rates on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.",
        "Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirmed that the net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of €60 billion, were intended to run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "The net purchases would be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP.",
        "If the outlook became less favourable, or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stood ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "At its previous monetary policy meeting on 7-8 June the Governing Council had been facing a financial market landscape characterised by rising stock prices and falling bond yields.",
        "Since then there had been a correction in relative cross-asset valuations, which seemed to have converged in a benign manner, signalling increased confidence in the economic outlook across market segments.",
        "In euro area sovereign bond markets, quasi-risk-free government bond yields had increased measurably after the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra on 26-28 June.",
        "This adjustment took place from very low yield levels.",
        "For example, before 26 June ten-year German government bond yields had been trading at around 25 basis points – somewhat below the average yield observed in 2017 thus far and significantly below levels seen earlier in the year.",
        "Moreover, despite the recent upward movement at the long end of the German government bond yield curve, the curve had remained flatter than at the peak observed in March 2017, as an upward move in short-term yields had also been recorded.",
        "In early March 2017 two-year yields had temporarily reached levels close to ‑100 basis points, and were presently trading near ‑60 basis points.",
        "This development likely reflected receding political uncertainty and the associated unwinding of safe-haven flows into the German government bond market.",
        "The overall shape and location of the quasi-risk-free yield curve for the euro area had therefore moved in a direction that appeared more closely aligned with the markets’ assessment of the economic outlook.",
        "Medium to longer-term inflation expectations, meanwhile, had remained stable over the previous few weeks, despite a fall in oil prices.",
        "This implied that the changes in nominal bond yields largely reflected changes in real yields, which could also be seen as consistent with improved growth and, ultimately, inflation prospects.",
        "Euro area sovereign credit spreads had remained resilient to the recent change in German government bond yields.",
        "Spreads for non-financial corporations (NFCs) and banks had reached their lowest levels in more than two years and were down by around 60 to 70 basis points since the announcement of the corporate sector purchase programme in March 2016.",
        "The observed developments in sovereign bond and credit markets implied that markets had mainly revised their views on long-term risk-free rates.",
        "Equity markets had remained buoyant since the beginning of the year and also more recently despite the rise in risk-free rates.",
        "The FTSE Global All-Cap Index had risen by nearly 2% since the end of June.",
        "Bank stocks had outperformed other sectors in recent weeks, as a steeper yield curve was seen as positive for bank profits.",
        "In the foreign exchange markets, developments over the previous few weeks had continued a trend that had started at the beginning of the year and had now resulted in a reversal of two external factors that had previously put downward pressure on the euro.",
        "The first was political uncertainty, which had started with the UK referendum on EU membership last summer.",
        "The second was related to market expectations that interest rates in the United States would need to be higher than elsewhere, given the US Administration’s economic policy agenda.",
        "These two factors were now largely priced out, leaving the euro back around the levels prevailing before the UK referendum.",
        "Investors were presently net long on the euro.",
        "Implied volatility across market segments had steadily fallen over recent years and was currently at, or close to, historical lows.",
        "Broadly speaking, there were two possible explanations for this.",
        "One was that low volatility was supported by fundamentals and low macroeconomic volatility.",
        "The other was that it was a sign of market complacency, in conjunction with central bank presence in markets and structural changes, such as new regulations.",
        "The low volatility regime posed risks of abrupt and unpredictable price movements.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Global activity and trade had maintained their momentum, as suggested by survey indicators, while global inflation had slowed on the back of waning contributions from energy prices.",
        "In the OECD area, annual consumer price inflation had declined from 2.4% in April to 2.1% in May, and inflation excluding food and energy had fallen from 1.9% to 1.8% over the same period.",
        "Since the Governing Council meeting on 7-8 June Brent crude oil prices had declined by 2.2%, while non-oil commodity prices had increased by 4.5%.",
        "Over the same period the euro had appreciated by 1.7% in nominal effective terms vis-à-vis the currencies of 38 of the euro area’s major trading partners.",
        "In the euro area, the economic expansion continued to be solid and broad based, mainly driven by domestic demand.",
        "According to Eurostat’s second estimate, real GDP had increased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2017, after 0.5% in the final quarter of 2016.",
        "Employment had continued to grow and the unemployment rate had declined further, falling from 9.5% in the first quarter of 2017 to 9.3% in the first two months of the second quarter.",
        "Private consumption was benefiting from steady income growth and low interest rates, while business investment was supported by improving corporate profitability.",
        "The global recovery was supporting trade and exports.",
        "Looking ahead, survey indicators pointed to continuing robust economic growth in the second quarter of 2017, as reflected in higher readings of both the composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index and the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator.",
        "In the same vein, capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector had risen, while firms were increasingly reporting shortages of labour and equipment as a constraint on production.",
        "Turning to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation had declined to 1.3% in June 2017, from 1.4% in May, mainly owing to a decline in energy inflation.",
        "Excluding food and energy, inflation had been 1.1% in June, after 0.9% in May and 1.2% in April.",
        "As yet there were no convincing signs of a sustained upward adjustment in underlying inflation.",
        "Price pressures in the early stages of the supply chain remained strong but had still not been transmitted to producer prices at later stages.",
        "In addition, domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, remained subdued.",
        "Compared with forecasts from other public and private institutions, the June 2017 Eurosystem staff inflation projections were at the lower end of the range for the period from 2017 to 2019.",
        "As regards inflation expectations, the July Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the third quarter of 2017 indicated a slight downward revision to headline inflation for 2017, 2018 and 2019.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation expectations had remained broadly unchanged since the 7-8 June meeting of the Governing Council.",
        "Financial conditions had remained broadly favourable, despite some repricing across financial markets.",
        "The EONIA forward curve had shifted upwards, reflecting an improving macroeconomic outlook and an adjustment in monetary policy expectations.",
        "Likewise, long-term overnight index swap rates were now near the levels that had prevailed around early 2016.",
        "The recent uptick had added to the overall trend increase observed since the autumn of last year.",
        "The economic expansion had kept corporate and sovereign credit spreads contained and continued to support equity markets via solid earnings expectations.",
        "At the same time, increasing bond yields had weighed on equities across most sectors, but the new yield curve constellation had given a positive impetus to bank equity prices.",
        "The overall nominal cost of external financing for NFCs was estimated to have increased somewhat to around 35 basis points above the historical low recorded in July 2016.",
        "The recent rise was explained by a modest increase in the cost of equity, while the cost of debt had remained broadly unchanged near historical lows since August 2016.",
        "Bank lending rates for both NFCs and households had remained low, showing that banks had been passing on their favourable funding cost to lower lending rates.",
        "The annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 had remained broadly unchanged at 5.0% in May, after 4.9% in April, with robust M1 growth as the main driver.",
        "Lending to the non-financial private sector had continued its gradual recovery in May, while remaining modest.",
        "Credit developments continued to be supported by low bank lending rates for NFCs and households.",
        "According to the July bank lending survey for the euro area, credit standards had eased for loans to enterprises and for loans to households for house purchase.",
        "In addition, loan demand had increased further across all categories in the second quarter.",
        "Finally, the fiscal stance, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was expected to stay broadly neutral over the projection horizon from 2017 to 2019.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet noted that since the early June meeting of the Governing Council financial conditions had remained at levels that were still supportive, despite a repricing across financial markets.",
        "Borrowing conditions had remained very favourable.",
        "The economic upturn had gathered some further momentum.",
        "Risks to the growth outlook were broadly balanced, with some upside risks to the short-term outlook.",
        "Downside risks mainly related to global factors.",
        "At the same time, euro area HICP inflation was still subdued.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation had remained low and were yet to demonstrate convincing signs of a pick-up, as domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, remained muted.",
        "Further progress towards a durable and self-sustaining convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s inflation aim would only come gradually and remained conditional on a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "The ongoing economic expansion increased confidence that inflation dynamics would strengthen over time.",
        "At this stage, the present degree of monetary policy accommodation was still necessary for inflation to converge to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Therefore, Mr Praet proposed to keep the ECB monetary policy stance unchanged, maintaining all the elements of the Governing Council’s forward guidance on the expected path of the key ECB interest rates and on its monthly purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP).",
        "Overall, Mr Praet recommended that in the public communication the Governing Council: (i) acknowledged the strengthening of the economic expansion and confirmed that the risks to the growth outlook were broadly balanced; (ii) indicated that the ongoing economic expansion increased confidence that inflation would gradually converge to its aim; and (iii) stressed that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation was still needed for underlying inflation pressures to gradually build up.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Recent data and survey indicators had pointed to a continued strengthening and broadening of the economic expansion, supported by very favourable financing conditions.",
        "Looking ahead, economic growth was expected to remain robust, largely following the path outlined in the June 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "The risks to the growth outlook were assessed to have remained broadly balanced.",
        "As regards the outlook for external demand, the global economic recovery had continued to strengthen.",
        "While there had recently been some downside surprises in a few economies, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, they appeared to have been generally offset by better than expected economic developments in emerging market economies, as well as in a number of countries neighbouring the euro area.",
        "Accordingly, the assessment that external demand would continue to support the economic expansion in the euro area was seen to remain broadly unchanged.",
        "The balance of risks to the global economic recovery remained tilted to the downside.",
        "While the risk of a substantial deceleration in global activity and trade growth, which had been identified some time ago, had receded, downside risks were still present in several economies, related, inter alia, to uncertainties about the macroeconomic policy choices in the United States and surrounding the negotiations with the United Kingdom on its withdrawal from the EU, as well as possible balance sheet adjustments in a number of emerging market economies.",
        "Turning to the euro area, recent indicators had pointed to continued robust growth.",
        "Quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth had been 0.6% in the first quarter of 2017 according to Eurostat’s second estimate, slightly higher than projected in the June 2017 Eurosystem macroeconomic projection exercise.",
        "Consumer confidence indicators had continued to improve, and were approaching or had exceeded pre-crisis peaks in a number of euro area countries.",
        "Labour markets had shown further gradual improvement.",
        "The unemployment rate, although still high and with significant cross-country differences, had reached its lowest point since March 2009.",
        "This decline in the unemployment rate was all the more remarkable as it had been accompanied by a rise in the labour force participation rate.",
        "In terms of the main components of domestic demand, private consumption remained strong, supported by further employment gains.",
        "The recovery in investment was increasingly self-sustaining and was benefiting from accelerator effects, unlike a year earlier when the investment climate had still been judged to be fragile.",
        "Favourable credit terms and conditions, and improved bank credit standards for both households and NFCs, as documented in the July 2017 bank lending survey, were seen to provide continued support to both private consumption and investment.",
        "Overall, financial conditions remained supportive of the economic expansion, although the repricing in some financial market segments, in particular in foreign exchange markets and the bond markets, had led to some deterioration since the previous meeting.",
        "Regarding exchange rates, while it was remarked that the appreciation of the euro to date could be seen in part as reflecting changes in relative fundamentals in the euro area vis-à-vis the rest of the world, concerns were expressed about the risk of the exchange rate overshooting in the future.",
        "On euro area bond markets, it was observed that while a general repricing had occurred across jurisdictions, spreads had remained contained, suggesting that the euro area had become more resilient, including the more vulnerable economies.",
        "In global bond markets, the recent flattening of the US yield curve had contributed to an easing of global financial conditions.",
        "Taking a longer-term perspective, positive economic growth had been recorded since the second quarter of 2013.",
        "Members generally agreed that the ECB’s monetary policy measures had contributed significantly to the ongoing economic expansion and that a sustained momentum in economic growth was still contingent on continued favourable financing conditions.",
        "Yet, a remark was also made that the expansion was increasingly self-sustaining and hence had become less dependent on the current degree of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "Risks to the outlook for economic activity were seen to be broadly balanced, in line with the assessment made at the previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "Positive surprises could come from the strong cyclical momentum, especially in the short run, and from reduced political risks in a number of euro area countries.",
        "In addition, structural reform momentum was seen to be growing in a few countries.",
        "Downside risks related mainly to remaining uncertainties and vulnerabilities in the external environment.",
        "Some concerns were expressed that these downside risks had increased, in particular related to policy uncertainty in the United States and growing balance sheet risks in some emerging market economies.",
        "With regard to price developments, members generally agreed with the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Euro area annual HICP inflation had been 1.3% in June 2017, down from 1.4% in May and 1.9% in April.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation remained low and had not yet shown convincing signs of a pick-up.",
        "Looking ahead, the ongoing economic expansion was expected to contribute to a gradual convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "In reviewing developments in headline inflation, it was pointed out that the decline in annual HICP inflation between April and June 2017 had been largely driven by developments in energy prices and, to a lesser extent, food prices.",
        "In the near term headline inflation was expected to remain around current levels, although slightly lower than previously expected, mainly owing to recent developments in oil prices and exchange rates.",
        "Inflation expectations had remained broadly unchanged since the previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "This was the case for both longer-term market-based measures and survey-based measures.",
        "Reference was made to the SPF measure of longer-term inflation expectations five years ahead, which continued to stand at 1.8%.",
        "Overall, recent developments indicated that inflation expectations remained broadly anchored, notwithstanding renewed weakness in spot energy prices.",
        "Turning to measures of underlying inflation pressures, convincing evidence of a sustained convergence towards levels compatible with the ECB’s inflation aim was still seen to be lacking.",
        "HICP inflation excluding food and energy had remained low.",
        "Wage developments had remained subdued, with annual growth in compensation per employee declining from 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 1.2% in the first quarter of 2017.",
        "At the same time, a number of measures of underlying inflation had increased slightly compared with the second half of 2016.",
        "This pointed to tentative signs of reflationary forces slowly taking hold as the economic expansion gathered pace.",
        "Several comments were made on the continued discrepancy between strengthening economic activity and subdued inflation dynamics, which was not unique to the euro area but observed also in other major economies.",
        "Reference was made to the speech by the President at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, in which he outlined a number of explanatory factors, such as external price shocks, more slack in the labour market, and lags in the process of wage and price formation.",
        "Looking ahead, it was considered important to monitor the extent to which such factors would be transient or more permanent.",
        "A number of factors were likely to be of a more structural nature.",
        "These included changes in labour markets, work contracts and wage-setting processes, benefiting from the reforms introduced in previous years, which could imply a structural break in the Phillips curve.",
        "At the same time, labour market slack was still considerable when assessed on the basis of broader unemployment measures, and a large supply of low-skilled labour could continue to dampen wage dynamics in the near term.",
        "The reaction of wages to improving economic conditions could also come with some delay, owing to the backward-looking component of wage and price formation and staggered wage-setting.",
        "In goods and services markets, digitisation might put downward pressure on prices over a protracted period.",
        "Finally, the relatively slow pace of deleveraging in the euro area could contribute to a delayed adjustment in prices.",
        "Various arguments nevertheless suggested that cost pressures could gradually increase as the economic expansion continued.",
        "While labour market slack was still significant, it was following a clear downward path, which should ultimately translate into higher wage growth, and firms were signalling an emerging labour shortage in a number of skill categories.",
        "Furthermore, non-wage components of labour costs could increase owing to a shift in focus in wage negotiations in a number of countries.",
        "Overall, while members considered that the ongoing economic expansion gave reason for confidence that inflation dynamics would strengthen over time, they emphasised that patience, persistence and prudence were needed, as this process was expected to take time and remained contingent on a very substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) had continued to expand at a robust pace.",
        "As in previous months, annual growth in M3 had reflected growth mainly in its most liquid components, while the gradual recovery in loan growth to the private sector, visible since the start of 2014, was proceeding.",
        "Market financing and bank borrowing costs for firms and households had remained very favourable and supportive of euro area credit flows, and credit conditions had loosened further.",
        "Reference was made to the latest bank lending survey, which indicated that banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding had improved in the second quarter of 2017.",
        "Moreover, loan growth had continued to be supported by increased demand across all categories and by easing credit standards on loans to enterprises and loans to households for house purchase.",
        "Looking ahead, banks were expecting a further net easing of credit standards for all loan categories in the third quarter of 2017.",
        "All of this suggested that the pass-through of the policy measures was continuing, including from the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, which banks continued to report as contributing to an easing of credit terms and conditions.",
        "Overall, credit conditions continued to be assessed as being favourable and supporting the economic expansion, thereby contributing to the return of inflation to the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "Nonetheless, as on previous occasions, the observation was made that despite the recovery in credit to the private sector, credit dynamics remained modest overall.",
        "In this regard, it was noted that M3 growth continued to depend to a considerable extent on the ECB’s monetary policy measures, although monetary dynamics were becoming more self-sustaining over time, with the contribution of credit to the private sector gradually increasing.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that the growth outlook had become more favourable, increasing confidence that inflation would gradually converge to levels in line with the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "The ECB’s monetary policy measures had substantially reduced financing costs to historically low levels across the euro area.",
        "The pass-through of the measures was continuing and a prolonged period of growth above potential implied a progressive closing of the output gap and the reabsorption of labour market slack, supporting a gradual rise in inflation over time.",
        "The Governing Council could thus be confident in the continued effectiveness of the monetary policy measures.",
        "While positive supply shocks or the legacy of the financial crisis could delay the transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy to prices, these factors were ultimately of a temporary nature.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that inflation dynamics remained subdued and that there continued to be considerable uncertainty about the inflation outlook and the speed with which inflation was converging towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation, while showing some tentative signs of a pick-up, still needed to show conclusive evidence of a sustained upward trend.",
        "Therefore, a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation was still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up gradually and support headline inflation developments in the medium term.",
        "Patience was still warranted for reflationary forces to translate into stronger inflation dynamics.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that the recent volatility in euro area HICP inflation, which had been largely due to energy price developments, underlined the need to look through changes in headline inflation that were transient and carried no implication for the outlook for price stability over the medium term.",
        "To this end, it was important to ensure that inflation expectations remained well anchored.",
        "There was also broad agreement with the assessment provided by Mr Praet that euro area financial conditions had, despite a repricing across financial markets, remained broadly supportive of the continued economic expansion.",
        "Despite the flattening of the yield curve in the United States, financial conditions had tightened since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting in early June, mainly owing to an appreciation of the euro and an upward shift in bond market yields, which had also been reflected in a rise in real interest rates.",
        "The point was made that the prevailing financial conditions mostly reflected the improved macroeconomic conditions and fundamentals in the euro area.",
        "Moreover, it was underlined that the broader financing conditions relevant for households and firms, including bank lending rates and credit conditions, remained very favourable across the euro area.",
        "In addition, sovereign and corporate bond spreads had been notably resilient to the repricing of the risk-free curve and had in fact tightened somewhat, which also suggested that the repricing had been largely related to positive macroeconomic news.",
        "At the same time, concerns were expressed about a possible overshooting in the repricing by financial markets, notably the foreign exchange markets, in the future.",
        "It was underlined that the still favourable financing conditions could not be taken for granted and relied to a considerable extent on a continued high degree of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "Such favourable financing conditions were providing significant support to the upturn in the euro area economy and continued to be seen as necessary for inflation to rise towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Taking all these considerations into account, members generally agreed that, from the present perspective, the available evidence continued to indicate that convincing progress on a durable and self-sustaining convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim had still to be secured.",
        "Although inflation was gradually moving towards this aim and confidence in this movement was increasing overall, convincing signs of a more dynamic pick-up in measures of underlying inflation were yet to appear.",
        "Moreover, the baseline scenario for inflation remained crucially conditional on the very easy financing conditions that largely depended on the current accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "Against this background, there was broad agreement among members that there was presently a continuing need for steady-handed and persistent monetary policy.",
        "The current monetary policy stance remained appropriate.",
        "This included keeping in place all elements of the Governing Council’s forward guidance on its key interest rates and the intended pace of monthly net asset purchases.",
        "More generally, the point was again made that the overall degree of accommodation was determined by the combination of all the monetary policy measures implemented by the ECB and that the Governing Council’s assessment of progress regarding a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation should apply to the overall design and direction of the ECB’s monetary policy stance as a whole, and not with reference to any particular instrument in isolation, such as the duration and pace of APP asset purchases.",
        "At the same time, it was underscored that the asset purchase programme would continue to be a key instrument if the Governing Council assessed the sustained adjustment of inflation to be at risk, while the use of other instruments, within the ECB’s mandate, could not be ruled out.",
        "In this context, it was also suggested that the stock versus flow effects of asset purchases be considered.",
        "The case was made for proceeding gradually and prudently when approaching adjustments in the monetary policy stance and communication in line with the Governing Council’s evolving assessment.",
        "Caution was expressed that, in the present financial market environment, markets were particularly sensitive to incoming information.",
        "On the one hand, the improving economic environment could be expected to have an impact on forward-looking financial variables.",
        "On the other hand, there was a risk that financial conditions could tighten to a degree that was not warranted by the improvement in economic conditions and the outlook for inflation.",
        "In this context, the point was made that, looking ahead, the Governing Council needed to gain more policy space and flexibility to adjust policy and the degree of monetary policy accommodation, if and when needed, in either direction.",
        "A suggestion was made that some consideration be given to an incremental adjustment in the language on forward guidance, because postponing an adjustment for too long could give rise to a misalignment between the Governing Council’s communication and its assessment of the state of the economy, which could trigger more pronounced volatility in financial markets when communication eventually had to shift.",
        "However, it was generally judged paramount at this stage to avoid sending signals that could be prone to over-interpretation and might prove premature.",
        "Accordingly, there was agreement among all members to retain all elements of forward guidance, as proposed by Mr Praet.",
        "The Governing Council would, in the autumn, consider the future course of its monetary policy and, in particular, its strategy for asset purchases beyond the currently communicated horizon.",
        "As regards communication, all members agreed with the proposals put forward by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "It was thus seen as important to stress that the economic expansion had strengthened and that risks to the growth outlook were broadly balanced.",
        "Moreover, it was seen as appropriate to emphasise that the Governing Council’s confidence that inflation would gradually converge towards its aim had been strengthened by the ongoing economic expansion.",
        "However, while reflationary forces, which referred to the recovery of inflation from levels below its long-term trend, had replaced risks of deflation, the economic expansion had yet to translate into stronger inflation dynamics.",
        "In the light of the heightened sensitivity of financial markets to news, a steady approach to communication was seen as key.",
        "The Governing Council needed to strike a fine balance between, on the one hand, expressing justified confidence in the economic expansion and, on the other hand, underlining the need for monetary policy to remain persistent and patient.",
        "It was thus important to stress that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation was still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up gradually, supporting headline inflation in the medium term, and for inflation dynamics to become more durable and self-sustaining.",
        "Against this background, the Governing Council should also reiterate its continued readiness to adjust the size and/or duration of the asset purchases, if necessary.",
        "The view was widely shared that prudence was warranted with regard to the Governing Council’s communication on the possible timing of its deliberations on the future course of its monetary policy.",
        "Overall, members agreed that communication on the timing of the decision should refer to the autumn.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided to keep the interest rates on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and ‑0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.",
        "With regard to non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirmed that the net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of €60 billion, were intended to run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "The net purchases would be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme.",
        "If the outlook became less favourable, or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stood ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting."
    ],
    "2019": [
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 24-25 July 2019.",
        "Global financial markets had undergone a strong correction over the summer, which bore a close resemblance to the episode observed during the spring.",
        "The principal catalyst on both occasions was an intensification of global trade tensions.",
        "The yield on the ten-year German government bond had declined by around 35 basis points, compared with the day before the July meeting, to -71 basis points.",
        "The ten-year US Treasury yield had fallen by around 50 basis points.",
        "Mr Cœuré highlighted three key aspects to help interpret these developments.",
        "The first related to the response of real interest rates, which was different from the spring episode.",
        "The large decline in real rates in August could be interpreted as a sign that market participants were becoming increasingly concerned about the cumulative impact of the sequence of trade shocks on the global economy.",
        "The second point was whether there were signs of an effective lower bound gradually inducing non-linearity in the market reaction to shocks.",
        "Although the starting level of the ten-year German government bond yield prior to the August correction had been much lower than in the spring, and was already in deep negative territory, the order of magnitude of the decline had been similar in both episodes.",
        "There were no signs in this regard of downward rigidities in long-term rates that could relate to the effective lower bound.",
        "The EONIA forward curve had also continued to shift lower during August, pricing in a cumulative cut of almost 40 basis points in the rate on the ECB’s deposit facility by early 2021.",
        "However, lower money market trading volumes for longer tenors suggested that the conviction about cuts significantly deeper into negative territory was not broad-based and uncertainty over the future path of short-term policy rates remained elevated.",
        "The third aspect related to possible changes in portfolio rebalancing in response to the increase in the share of bonds that were trading at negative levels.",
        "A first development related to recent movements in the spread between the ten-year German Bund and the overnight index swap (OIS) rate, which until recently had been a reliable gauge of scarcity effects in the Bund cash market.",
        "However, since mid-July, there had been a notable reversal in the spread, despite growing scarcity in the cash market, to levels last seen towards the end of 2016.",
        "Market intelligence suggested that the reversal might primarily be related to hedging activities that were increasingly being conducted in the swap market rather than in the cash bond market.",
        "The second novelty in asset price responses was a flattening of the very long end of the yield curve, as evidenced by the narrower yield spread between 10-year and 30-year German government bonds.",
        "In August, for the first time, the entire German sovereign yield curve had moved into negative territory.",
        "The third novelty related to the marked and persistent rise in the price of gold, which coincided with the sharp increase in the share of bonds that were trading at negative levels.",
        "Moving to the equity markets, the impact of the renewed trade tensions in August had been visible particularly in emerging markets.",
        "In the euro area and in the United States, the impact had been much more muted, with the decline in bond yields partly offsetting the rise in the equity risk premium.",
        "As regards foreign exchange markets, the weakening of emerging market currencies contributed to a mild appreciation of the euro in nominal effective terms.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, survey data pointed to subdued activity in the third quarter.",
        "Services, although weakening, had continued to support growth, while manufacturing activity had decelerated further.",
        "Trade tensions had sparked a risk-off sentiment, especially in emerging market economies.",
        "In the United States, economic activity was slowing – most clearly evidenced in investment – but remained solid.",
        "In China, the slowdown in economic activity was accentuated by new tariffs, while in Japan the growth momentum was set to decelerate and inflation remained subdued.",
        "In the United Kingdom, the risk of a no-deal Brexit was increasing, while economic activity had stalled.",
        "Overall, risks to global activity and trade remained on the downside.",
        "Oil prices had dropped by 8% in August.",
        "As regards exchange rates, since the Governing Council’s July monetary policy meeting the euro had been essentially flat, depreciating by -1.2% in bilateral terms against the US dollar but appreciating by 0.7% in nominal effective terms.",
        "Turning to the euro area, information available since the July monetary policy meeting signalled a more protracted weakness in euro area growth dynamics, mainly driven by the external sector.",
        "Eurostat’s second release of 6 September put real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2019 at 0.2% in quarter-on-quarter terms.",
        "With regard to developments in the third quarter so far, while the Economic Sentiment Indicator and the Purchasing Managers’ Index had edged up in August, taking July and August together they had, on average, been lower than in the second quarter, suggesting a continuation of subdued growth.",
        "As regards sectoral developments, the exceptional divergence between manufacturing and services had persisted, reflecting the trade shock that the euro area currently faced, which predominantly affected the manufacturing sector.",
        "Domestic demand had, on the whole, remained resilient and continued to be underpinned by a solid labour market, household confidence, improving balance sheets and policy stimulus.",
        "Real private consumption had expanded by 0.2% in the second quarter of 2019, following an exceptionally strong increase of 0.4% in the first quarter.",
        "Households continued to signal optimism about their future financial situation.",
        "In line with this, retail trade had continued to grow at an overall robust pace.",
        "Regarding housing investment, growth was expected to remain supported both from a demand and a supply-side perspective.",
        "Business investment had been slowing since early 2018 and the latest indicators suggested a continuation of subdued business investment in the short term.",
        "As regards the labour market, employment had grown by 0.2% in quarter-on-quarter terms in the second quarter of 2019, down from 0.4% in the first quarter.",
        "Looking ahead, the PMI employment component pointed to a further moderation in employment growth.",
        "These developments were also reflected in the September 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which projected real GDP growth at 1.1% in 2019, 1.2% in 2020 and 1.4% in 2021.",
        "Compared with the June 2019 Eurosystem staff projections, real GDP growth had been revised down by 0.1 percentage points for 2019 and by 0.2 percentage points for 2020, while it was unrevised for 2021.",
        "The revisions were mainly on account of weaker external demand, which was somewhat cushioned by the impact of lower energy prices and the easing of financial conditions.",
        "Over the medium term, the baseline assumed a gradual dissipation of global headwinds, allowing fundamental factors supporting the euro area expansion to regain traction.",
        "The outlook was supported by the ECB’s very accommodative monetary policy stance, improving labour markets and relatively robust wage growth and net worth, as well as by declining unemployment, rising profits, a loosening fiscal stance and a recovery in foreign demand.",
        "Nevertheless, GDP growth was expected to slow towards the end of the projection horizon, as declining capacity utilisation, a prolonged period of low business confidence and the expiration of tax incentives adversely affected investment.",
        "Moreover, labour supply constraints restricted employment growth.",
        "Projections from other institutions and the private sector were in line with the September 2019 ECB staff projections.",
        "Turning to euro area price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate of 30 August, both annual headline HICP inflation and HICP inflation excluding food and energy had moved sideways in July, at 1.0% and 0.9% respectively.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation remained muted and indicators of inflation expectations were stagnating.",
        "Wage growth remained solid, increasing at rates around long-term averages.",
        "Compensation per employee had increased by 2.1% in annual terms in the second quarter of 2019, while compensation per hour had increased by 2.2%.",
        "Negotiated wage growth continued to stand above its 2018 level in the first half of 2019.",
        "Since the first quarter of 2018, unit labour cost growth had risen strongly.",
        "Between the first quarter of 2018 and the second quarter of 2019 it had more than doubled, increasing from 1.0% to 2.1%.",
        "This reflected the decline in labour productivity growth over the same period, in turn a reflection of the resilience of the labour market in the face of slowing GDP growth.",
        "Strengthening unit labour cost pressures had so far been largely absorbed by profit margins.",
        "In the September ECB staff projections, HICP inflation had been revised down over the whole projection horizon and was projected to reach 1.5% in 2021.",
        "The downward revision of inflation was due to lower energy prices, but also reflected the subdued nature of inflation dynamics.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s July monetary policy meeting, medium to longer-term euro area market-based measures of inflation expectations had largely stabilised at low levels.",
        "Despite the fall, recent developments constituted a moderation in a downward trend that had started in the autumn of 2018.",
        "In terms of euro area financial conditions, a further notable decline in euro area risk-free rates across maturities had taken place since the Governing Council’s July monetary policy meeting.",
        "The EONIA forward curve had inverted further at short horizons.",
        "In addition, both the euro area ten-year OIS rate and the ten-year US Treasury yield had fallen.",
        "Since the July meeting, euro area equity prices had also declined somewhat, mainly on account of risk premia, but their fall had been cushioned by lower discount rates.",
        "Taken together, the easing trend in financial conditions had come to a halt, while financing conditions for non-financial corporations (NFCs) had remained very favourable.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, the annual growth rate of broad money (M3) had risen to 5.2% in July, after 4.5% in June and 4.8% in May, despite a fading annual contribution from the asset purchase programme (APP) and a slowdown in economic activity.",
        "This resilience continued to reflect portfolio considerations, driven by declines in the yields of non-monetary assets, which decreased the opportunity cost of holding M3 and led money holders to increase the share of M3 holdings in their financial portfolios.",
        "From a counterpart perspective, this was mirrored in further monetary inflows from outside the euro area, which reflected a recovery in foreign investor demand for euro area assets.",
        "Bank funding costs continued to be favourable, mainly driven by the decline in bank bond yields.",
        "The cost of borrowing from banks for firms and households had fallen to new record lows.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to NFCs remained stable at 3.9% in July, only somewhat below its September 2018 peak of 4.3%.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households had continued its gradual increase, rising to 3.4% in July.",
        "As regards fiscal policy, the euro area fiscal stance – as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance – was projected to be mildly expansionary over the period 2019-21.",
        "The negative impact of the stance on the headline budget balance over 2019-21 was largely offset by savings in interest payments.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane remarked that, since the Governing Council’s July monetary policy meeting, risk-free interest rates had declined notably, a partial reversal in the last week notwithstanding.",
        "At the same time, the easing potential from rates declining due to a deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook and to revised calculations of the equilibrium real interest rate might be limited.",
        "Equities had only declined moderately, as the lower discount rates had cushioned the impact of higher equity risk premia.",
        "Bank lending conditions for firms and households continued to be very favourable.",
        "The most recent data indicated a more extended slowdown in the euro area economy than previously expected.",
        "In particular, the weakness of international trade and prolonged global uncertainties continued to weigh, especially on the manufacturing sector.",
        "The September 2019 ECB staff projections had further marked down the real GDP growth outlook in 2019 and 2020, mainly owing to the weaker global environment.",
        "The balance of risks remained tilted to the downside, largely on account of the prolonged presence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.",
        "HICP inflation dynamics and developments in measures of underlying inflation remained muted, despite robust wage dynamics.",
        "The September projections entailed a downward revision of inflation over the projection horizon, with projected inflation reaching only 1.5% in 2021.",
        "This was, in part, related to lower energy prices, but also to the weaker growth environment.",
        "Both market and survey-based indicators of inflation expectations had stagnated at historical lows.",
        "Overall, the Governing Council was confronted with a protracted slowdown in the euro area economy, persistent downside risks and an inflation outlook that continued to fall short of its medium-term inflation aim.",
        "Taking a longer perspective, since December 2018 successive and significant downward revisions to the inflation outlook had been observed, bringing the 2021 inflation projection down from 1.8% to 1.5%.",
        "The further downgrade of the inflation outlook – despite the fact that the financial conditions embedded in the forecast already reflected substantial expectations for additional policy easing – meant that inflation was moving further away from levels that the Governing Council deemed consistent with its inflation aim and implied a further delay in inflation convergence.",
        "Against this background, a comprehensive policy response was warranted to support the return to a sustained convergence path towards the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "Mr Lane therefore proposed taking the following decisions at the current meeting.",
        "First, to lower the deposit facility rate by 10 basis points to -0.50%.",
        "Second, to adjust the forward guidance by stipulating that the key ECB interest rates would now be expected to remain at their present or lower levels until projected inflation was seen to converge to and stabilise around a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within the projection horizon, and such convergence had been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.",
        "Third, to restart net purchases under the APP at a monthly pace of €20 billion as from 1 November 2019.",
        "Moreover, net asset purchases should be expected to run for as long as necessary, to reinforce the accommodative impact of the ECB’s policy rates, and to end shortly before the Governing Council started raising interest rates.",
        "Fourth, to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when the Governing Council started raising key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Fifth, to change the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) to preserve favourable bank lending conditions, ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy and further support the accommodative stance of monetary policy.",
        "The interest rate in each operation would be set at the level of the average rate for the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations (MROs) over the life of the respective TLTRO.",
        "For banks whose eligible net lending exceeded a benchmark, the applied rate in TLTRO III operations would be lower, and could be as low as the average deposit facility rate prevailing over the life of the operation.",
        "Moreover, the maturity of the operations would be prolonged from two to three years.",
        "Sixth, in order to safeguard the bank-based transmission of monetary policy, to introduce a two-tier system for reserve remuneration in which part of banks’ holdings of excess liquidity would be exempt from the negative deposit facility rate.",
        "This set of measures would provide monetary support through a range of mechanisms.",
        "Lowering the deposit facility rate – together with the reinforced forward guidance – would operate throughout the yield curve, especially in the short to medium-term segments.",
        "The strengthened state-dependent forward guidance would provide a clear signpost for rate expectations by linking the Governing Council’s monetary policy to more stringent conditions for the inflation outlook.",
        "Moreover, forward guidance was especially effective under conditions of elevated uncertainty by facilitating smooth adjustment to the evolution of macroeconomic and financial conditions in both directions, with expectations about the future policy path responding in a stabilising manner to positive or negative news.",
        "According to the strengthened forward guidance, over the projection horizon projected inflation would not only need to converge to, but also stabilise around, levels “sufficiently close to, but below, 2%”.",
        "The reference to such levels would signal that the Governing Council wanted to see projected inflation increase significantly from the current realised and projected inflation figures, which were well below levels considered to be in line with its aim.",
        "The Governing Council’s guidance would remain forward-looking, in line with its strategy oriented towards the medium term.",
        "At the same time, the proposed guidance would contain safeguards against the risk of overreacting to transitory shocks to inflation, as well as against forecast and measurement errors, as it would be emphasised that convergence should be robust and that underlying inflation would have to increase to ensure that the pick-up in inflation was backed by a sustained build-up of domestic price pressures.",
        "Furthermore, by maintaining the easing bias on rates, the Governing Council would indicate that it still had room to cut rates further, if needed.",
        "Resuming net purchases was an important complement to interest rate policy.",
        "In particular, the APP had a greater impact on longer-term rates, providing further support to the funding costs that mattered to businesses and households.",
        "Under the proposed formulation, the net purchase horizon dynamically adjusted to changes in the forward guidance on interest rates and thereby worked in the background to keep a lid on medium to longer-term interest rates.",
        "By adding to the stock of assets and reinvesting for longer, the Governing Council could postpone an undue tightening in term premia, which mechanically occurred as the APP’s portfolio lost average duration.",
        "In addition, APP net purchases had strong signalling effects and wealth effects on the balance sheets of banks and other entities, and the APP tended to have a more powerful effect on the formation of inflation expectations by demonstrating the Governing Council’s commitment to use all instruments in pursuit of its aim.",
        "More generally, a two-track approach, whereby the Governing Council actively deployed both the short-term policy rate and net asset purchases, struck a balance by ensuring that it deployed mutually-reinforcing instruments in the most efficient manner, rather than relying excessively on any one instrument.",
        "In relation to the reinvestment policy, the chained nature of the forward guidance meant that the revised forward guidance on policy rates would pass through to the horizon for maintaining the stock of purchased assets.",
        "Turning to the other elements of the proposal, a more attractive TLTRO III pricing would support bank funding conditions in an environment of weak growth.",
        "This would ensure that banks would continue to offer favourable lending conditions to firms and households, which would ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy and further support the accommodative stance of monetary policy.",
        "Prolonging the maturity to three years would better align the operations with the typical maturity of bank-based financing of investment projects, thereby enhancing the support that TLTRO III provided to the financing of the real economy.",
        "Finally, a two-tier system for reserve remuneration would help preserve the positive effects of the Governing Council’s negative rate policy on the economy by mitigating the direct cost for banks of holding excess reserves, thereby contributing to the safeguarding of the bank-based transmission mechanism of the monetary policy.",
        "In summary, the proposed range of measures complemented and reinforced one another and constituted a powerful package to provide substantial monetary stimulus that would ensure that financial conditions remained very favourable and would support euro area growth, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and the sustained convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "At the same time, the Governing Council should reiterate the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time and its readiness to adjust all its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards levels close to, but below, 2% in a sustained manner, in line with the Governing Council’s commitment to symmetry in its inflation aim.",
        "Mr Cœuré elaborated on the details of a possible two-tier system for the remuneration of excess liquidity and the proposed modifications to the TLTRO III parameters.",
        "An “exempt tier” would be introduced, with a multiplier of 6 to be applied to the level of credit institutions’ minimum reserve requirements, to be remunerated at 0% and applicable to reserve holdings in excess of minimum reserve requirements held on current accounts with the Eurosystem.",
        "Turning to the proposed modifications to the price and maturity conditions of TLTRO III, the Governing Council was invited to decide to set the interest rate at the level of the average rate applied in the Eurosystem’s MROs over the life of the respective TLTRO III operation, to prolong the maturity of operations from two to three years from their respective settlement dates and to provide an option for counterparties to repay the amounts borrowed voluntarily before maturity, at a quarterly frequency starting two years after the settlement of each operation.",
        "Furthermore, Mr Cœuré indicated that the prolongation of the maturity of the TLTRO III operations implied that the additional credit claims frameworks were automatically extended until the end of March 2024.",
        "In addition, Mr Cœuré recalled that, in October 2017, it had been decided that the interest rate in three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) would remain at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective operations covering the period until the last maintenance period of 2019, which should now be extended at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period starting in March 2021.",
        "Separately, a proposal was also made to allow purchases of assets with yields below the deposit facility rate under the private sector programmes of the APP, to the extent necessary, with the decision reflecting changes in market interest rates relative to the deposit facility rate.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Incoming information since the Governing Council’s July monetary policy meeting indicated a more protracted weakness in the euro area economy than previously expected.",
        "The slowdown in growth mainly reflected the prevailing weakness of international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties, which were particularly affecting the manufacturing sector.",
        "At the same time, the services and construction sectors showed ongoing resilience and a number of factors continued to support the euro area economic expansion, including favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wage growth, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the continued – albeit somewhat slower – growth in global activity.",
        "This assessment was broadly reflected in the September ECB staff projections.",
        "In the discussion on the outlook and risks for the external environment, it was noted that, while global activity and trade were projected to recover gradually over the medium term, there had been a further downward revision to the outlook for both global growth and trade in the latest ECB staff projections.",
        "Members assessed the risks to the external environment to have remained on the downside on account of the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.",
        "In particular, reference was made to prevailing uncertainties related to trade tensions and Brexit.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, members generally concurred that the recent data had been weaker than expected and that the euro area slowdown was now expected to be more protracted.",
        "Real GDP was confirmed to have increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2019, following growth of 0.4% in the first quarter, while incoming economic data and survey information pointed to moderate, but positive, growth in the third quarter of the year.",
        "The downward revisions to the growth projections in the September ECB staff projections were generally considered to have been warranted, as they largely reflected disappointing data.",
        "The point was made that the revised baseline for growth and inflation should continue to be considered the most likely scenario, while significant downside risks remained.",
        "Perceptions about the outlook differed somewhat, with several members arguing that, despite the revisions, the baseline scenario in the latest ECB staff projections was still too optimistic in the light of the prevailing uncertainties.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that, while the rebound in euro area growth was delayed, growth was still expected to recover from its current weakness over the projection horizon.",
        "The observation was also made that the euro area economy was operating at close to full capacity, in line with the projections.",
        "It was argued that the current slowdown in the euro area was the consequence of asymmetric shocks related to the external environment or to domestic factors, whose impact was largely concentrated in two of the largest euro area countries, primarily owing to weakness in the manufacturing sector.",
        "Reference was also made to the possibility of upside, as well as downside, risks; for example, if the ongoing trade tensions were to be resolved more quickly than expected.",
        "However, a number of considerations were also advanced to suggest that the revised growth outlook might be too optimistic.",
        "The argument was made that the export weakness could over time be expected to spill over to domestic demand and to the services sector of the economy, and there were already some indications of the slowdown in exports affecting labour market developments.",
        "The slowdown could also be considered rather general and of a global nature, affecting a number of large economies, as opposed to reflecting specific asymmetric shocks.",
        "Moreover, the assumptions underlying the September ECB staff projections were seen as relatively favourable because the projections were based on an orderly Brexit – while the probability of a disorderly Brexit had recently increased – and assumed a resolution of trade tensions over time.",
        "Both of these assumptions could be considered optimistic.",
        "In addition, it was noted that the baseline did not contain some trade measures that had been announced since the finalisation of the projection exercise.",
        "The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook were generally assessed by members to be still tilted to the downside on account of the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.",
        "In an exchange of views about fiscal policy, members considered that the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance was providing some support to economic activity.",
        "However, in view of the weaker economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks, it was emphasised that governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely manner.",
        "In countries where public debt was high, governments needed to pursue prudent policies that would create conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely, while all countries should reinforce their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.0% in August 2019, unchanged from July, with lower energy price inflation being offset by higher food price inflation.",
        "The rate of HICP inflation excluding food and energy was also unchanged.",
        "On the basis of current futures prices for oil and owing to base effects, annual headline inflation was likely to decline before rising again towards the end of the year.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted and indicators of inflation expectations stood at low levels.",
        "While labour cost pressures had strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, their pass-through to inflation was taking longer than previously anticipated.",
        "Over the medium term, underlying inflation was expected to increase, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and robust wage growth.",
        "This assessment was also broadly reflected in the September ECB staff projections, which had been revised down over the whole horizon, reflecting lower energy prices and the weaker growth environment.",
        "It was noted that both headline and underlying inflation were currently being dampened by a change in the statistical treatment of package holidays in the euro area’s largest economy, a factor which would fade in coming months.",
        "Looking ahead, members acknowledged the implications for the medium-term inflation outlook arising from the downward revisions to the growth outlook.",
        "Underlying inflation, as measured by the HICP excluding food and energy, was still expected by staff to pick up over the projection horizon but had been revised down compared with the June 2019 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that the revised growth outlook implied less upward pressure on domestic inflation dynamics.",
        "Looking through the volatility of energy prices, there had been a downward revision to the inflation outlook at the end of the horizon, with the projected measures of underlying inflation and headline inflation only expected to reach 1.5% in 2021, at the end of the projection horizon.",
        "Members underlined that wage growth continued to be solid and in line with long-term averages.",
        "However, the transmission of higher wages to consumer price inflation in the medium term might have become more uncertain given the revised growth outlook, with some doubts being expressed about whether profit margins would increase – as assumed in the projections – as economic activity recovered.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, members noted that, since the Governing Council’s July monetary policy meeting, market-based measures of longer-term expectations had stabilised, albeit at historically low levels and well below the ECB’s inflation aim.",
        "Concern was expressed about the longer-term downward trend observed in inflation expectations, which was evident in both market-based and survey-based measures.",
        "Market-based inflation expectations, as measured by the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, currently stood at 1.23%, while longer-term survey-based inflation expectations stood at 1.7% in the Survey of Professional Forecasters for the third quarter of 2019.",
        "Concerns were also expressed about the increased probability of inflation outcomes between zero and 1%, as derived from option prices.",
        "Caution was urged, however, against placing too much emphasis on developments in longer-term, market-based measures of inflation, which were subject to liquidity and risk premia.",
        "In particular, the gap between survey-based measures and market-based measures could also be explained by a negative risk premium, although it was remarked that the negative risk premium could itself be a concern if it reflected hedging by market participants against outcomes of very low inflation or deflation.",
        "Moreover, a remark was made that financial market participants were not responsible for setting relevant prices in the real economy, and that there was not a full understanding of how actual price-setting behaviour at the firm level would be affected by expectations of general aggregate price developments, as opposed to microeconomic determinants.",
        "It was suggested that a deeper analysis of inflation expectations be undertaken, amid increased concerns about the risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "Regarding the monetary analysis, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Sustained rates of broad money growth reflected ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3.",
        "The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side.",
        "Members also agreed that the ECB’s monetary policy measures continued to support loan growth and, ultimately, activity and inflation.",
        "Overall, loan growth was still benefiting from historically low bank lending rates.",
        "Bank lending conditions for firms and households continued to be very favourable.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting in July, risk-free interest rates had declined, partly in anticipation of additional monetary policy stimulus but also in response to a worsening macroeconomic outlook.",
        "It was noted that substantial anticipation effects of future policy measures seemed to be embodied in market expectations of the path of interest rates and thus, to some extent, were already reflected in the projections.",
        "However, despite the fact that financial conditions embedded in the projections already reflected substantial expectations of further policy easing, projected inflation was moving further away from levels deemed consistent with the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "At the same time, it was also cautioned that the Governing Council should not try to accommodate market expectations but should base its decisions on its own assessment.",
        "In addition, an argument was put forward that, in an environment of high uncertainty, to exceed market expectations might be counterproductive, as this might be viewed as signalling a worse outlook than embedded in the forecasts.",
        "All members agreed that a further easing of the monetary policy stance was warranted to support the return to sustained convergence to the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "The September staff projections had further revised down the real GDP growth outlook for 2019 and 2020, mainly owing to the weaker global environment, and inflationary pressures had remained muted.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that the monetary policy response should be proportional to the contingency faced.",
        "In this respect, it was noted that, despite the downward revision in the projections, some of the fundamental driving forces for a pick-up as foreseen in the baseline scenario were still in place and deflation risks were absent at the current juncture.",
        "Monetary transmission was functioning well, with long-term yields at historical lows both for the euro area and across countries.",
        "Members expressed broad agreement with most of the monetary policy proposals made by Mr Lane in his introduction as part of a comprehensive package.",
        "Most members saw a package, i.e.",
        "a combination of instruments with significant complementarities and synergies, on the whole as the appropriate approach in a situation where individual policy measures were facing some limitations and the impact of each measure on its own was uncertain and difficult to assess.",
        "In the light of the continued shortfall of realised and projected inflation from the Governing Council’s medium-term aim and the risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations, it was seen as important for the Governing Council to demonstrate its determination and capacity to act, in line with its reaction function, by adjusting all of its instruments, as appropriate, to achieve its inflation aim.",
        "In this context, all measures – including restarting net asset purchases and introducing a two-tier system for the remuneration of reserves – were seen as having important signalling effects that would be further enhanced by the proposed changes to the Governing Council’s forward guidance.",
        "At the same time, a number of reservations were expressed about individual elements of the proposed policy package.",
        "Although the rationale for a comprehensive package was widely shared, members assessed the case for specific elements differently, with some measures seen as substitutes rather than complements, giving rise to trade-offs between elements of the package, for instance between the liquidity-providing measures and the proposed two-tier system.",
        "A large majority of members agreed to change the modalities of the new series of quarterly TLTROs (TLTRO III), as proposed by Mr Lane and Mr Cœuré.",
        "Removing the spread of 10 basis points vis-à-vis the key ECB interest rates and extending the maturity from two to three years was seen as effective to preserve favourable bank lending conditions, ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy and further support the accommodative stance of monetary policy.",
        "In this context, the Governing Council also took note of the proposed extension of the additional credit claims framework until the end of March 2024 and agreed to fix the interest rate in the three-month LTROs at the average rate of the main refinancing operations over the life of the respective LTRO, at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period starting in March 2021.",
        "Regarding forward guidance on APP reinvestment, all members concurred with Mr Lane’s proposal to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when the Governing Council started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Members generally agreed with the proposal to enhance the state-based component of the Governing Council’s forward guidance on interest rates, although a few members saw value in keeping the date-based element of forward guidance and shifting it further out into the future.",
        "The enhanced state-contingent forward guidance was considered a core element of the package, conveying the Governing Council’s intention with respect to its main policy instrument – the key policy rates – to which its other measures were tied, such as the proposed guidance on the net asset purchases and the reinvestments of principal payments.",
        "The proposed forward guidance was seen as crucial to providing adequate monetary accommodation, by anchoring inflation expectations at the ECB’s medium-term inflation aim, to making the “lift-off” date for interest rates state-dependent and to anchoring expectations sufficiently far out in the future, as warranted in the present circumstances.",
        "It was widely felt that the forward guidance needed to be formulated carefully so as to be sufficiently stringent, while not being unduly precise or complex, in order to be credible and to avoid introducing uncertainty into the expectations of markets and the general public.",
        "Accordingly, it was seen as natural to build on, and remain broadly consistent with, previous communication on a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, namely related to convergence, confidence and resilience in attaining the Governing Council’s aim of inflation below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Merit was seen in underlining the symmetry of the Governing Council’s inflation aim in qualitative terms, without pre-empting a future review of the ECB’s strategy.",
        "Some initial support was expressed for basing the forward guidance on a quantitative benchmark of both projected and realised inflation in order to provide greater clarity on the inflation aim.",
        "On the other hand, it was questioned whether more clarity in numerical terms would actually enhance the effectiveness of the forward guidance, in view of the subdued inflation record in recent years.",
        "Linking the Governing Council’s forward guidance to the ECB staff projections was seen as prone to circularity, although the point was also made that inflation-targeting central banks typically conditioned their policy on their own projections.",
        "All in all, a reference to robust convergence and a broad qualitative formulation in terms of the overall inflation outlook were considered preferable.",
        "Making forward guidance conditional on inflation convergence being reflected consistently in the observed underlying inflation dynamics, as well as in the inflation outlook, was seen as helping to clarify that some momentum should be visible and verifiable in the data on actual inflation, while not implying a departure from the forward-looking nature and medium-term orientation of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy.",
        "In addition, the notion of robust convergence was seen to underline the message that the Governing Council’s inflation aim should not be regarded as a cap for inflation, thereby confirming the symmetry of the inflation aim.",
        "In this context, it was argued that the proposed formulation could move market expectations of the “lift-off” date too far into the future.",
        "All in all, the adopted formulation on state-dependent forward guidance was viewed as remaining consistent with the ECB’s current monetary policy strategy, as it neither redefined the policy aim nor pre-empted a strategy review that might take place later.",
        "A clear majority of members agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to restart net purchases under the APP at a monthly pace of €20 billion as from 1 November, to continue them for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of policy rates and to end them shortly before the key ECB interest rates were to be raised.",
        "The APP was seen as a necessary component of the policy package, as it had been shown by ECB staff analysis to be effective in supporting activity and inflation.",
        "The mere reinvestment of principal payments from maturing securities was seen as insufficient to prevent a loss of duration on the ECB’s balance sheet or to underpin the low yields currently observed, or even to engender a further compression of term premia.",
        "Concern was expressed that not delivering sufficient stimulus, including through the APP, might trigger a reversal of the current favourable financial conditions.",
        "By contrast, restarting net purchases would provide a strong signal of the Governing Council’s determination and willingness to act in the light of the current subdued inflation outlook and the potential risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "Moreover, an argument was made that the room for further compression of term premia had not necessarily been completely used up.",
        "In this context, forceful and pre-emptive monetary policy action was considered important, which called for a comprehensive package that included a resumption of net asset purchases.",
        "A number of members assessed the case for renewed net asset purchases as not sufficiently strong, either because they deemed them to be a less efficient instrument, given the prevailing compression of term premia, or because they deemed them to be an instrument of last resort which should only be deployed in the event of more severe contingencies and which was not warranted in the light of the current outlook, where a package not including net purchases could be considered adequate.",
        "Current financial conditions were seen as already being very favourable, in particular with bonds of very long maturities trading at negative yields.",
        "The point was also made that the Governing Council’s decisions should be based on the effectiveness of the measures rather than on signalling effects vis-à-vis markets.",
        "Some concerns were voiced about a potential decline in the efficiency of the portfolio rebalancing channel and potential adverse side effects on financial intermediation – including by banks and by insurance companies and pension funds – related to a flattening at the long end of the yield curve and heightened financial stability risks.",
        "A remark was made that an open-ended announcement of renewed net asset purchases could give rise to demands by market participants for higher monthly purchase amounts, at least in the absence of convincing evidence of an improving inflation outlook.",
        "This would exhaust the purchasable universe and call into question the programme limits, which were considered important to ensure that the boundary between monetary policy and fiscal policy was not blurred.",
        "Effects from any potential limit changes on market functioning and bond scarcity would also need to be considered.",
        "However, it was noted that, at €20 billion per month, the pace of purchases was far less than in earlier phases of the programme, while the current expansionary stance of fiscal policy would allow the Governing Council to continue purchases under the current limits for a significant period of time.",
        "Hence, it was felt that a discussion of the limits could wait until the issue became more pressing.",
        "A very large majority of members agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to lower the rate on the deposit facility by 10 basis points to -0.50%, which – together with the reinforced forward guidance – would act on the whole yield curve, especially in the short to medium-term segments, complementing the effects of net asset purchases on the long end of the curve.",
        "In this way, the measure would address the high level of short-term uncertainties that currently prevailed and help preserve very favourable financial conditions.",
        "While a few members expressed a readiness to consider lowering the rate on the deposit facility by 20 basis points at the current meeting, in particular as part of a package that would exclude net asset purchases, other members felt unable to support a cut of 10 basis points, as they were concerned about the possibility of increasingly adverse side effects from additional rate cuts.",
        "A majority of members went along with the proposed introduction of a two-tier system for reserve remuneration as part of the overall policy package.",
        "With an exempt tier of six times the level of the minimum reserve requirements of institutions subject to such requirements, a two-tier system would help to preserve the positive effects of the negative rate policy on the economy by mitigating the direct cost for banks of holding excess reserves, thereby contributing to the safeguarding of the bank-based transmission mechanism of the Governing Council’s monetary policy.",
        "The two-tier system would support the ability of banks to extend loans to their customers on favourable terms and help to preserve the incentives for banks to pass through the stimulus provided by negative rates on their reserves.",
        "Furthermore, it would corroborate the Governing Council’s forward guidance that interest rates could be lower than the current levels.",
        "A number of reservations were expressed about the monetary policy justification for a two-tier system.",
        "It was argued that, at the current juncture, monetary policy transmission channels seemed to be functioning well.",
        "In addition, banks would benefit from TLTRO III, which offered them very favourable lending conditions, and from a significant decline in bank bond yields.",
        "A remark was made that providing partial relief only to banks for the costs of negative rates raised potential distributional and communication challenges.",
        "Moreover, if a two-tier system were not calibrated properly, it could give rise to side effects and put upward pressure on market rates.",
        "It was argued, however, that other jurisdictions with negative interest rates had long since introduced exemption schemes.",
        "With regard to the design of the two-tier system, the proposed value of six times the minimum reserve requirements was generally supported, although a case was also made for having a smaller or a larger multiplier.",
        "In this context, it was argued that tying the exemption amount more directly to minimum reserve requirements by increasing the remuneration rate on these reserve holdings would be better targeted at transmission channels that were more fragile, would better alleviate potential upward pressure on market rates and would create less interaction with TLTRO III.",
        "Deviating from the established frameworks of other central banks would, however, be more challenging to communicate, particularly since such remuneration on minimum reserves would be akin to the introduction of another policy rate.",
        "In summary, the President concluded that all members agreed on the need to act in response to the continued shortfall of inflation with respect to the Governing Council’s aim and that a clear majority of members supported the proposed measures, which complemented and reinforced one another, as a powerful package to provide substantial monetary stimulus, ensuring very favourable financial conditions and supporting the euro area economic expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and the sustained convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "Accordingly, the Governing Council reiterated the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time and that it continued to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "Finally, all members agreed that, in view of the weakening economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks, governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely manner.",
        "In response to the significant risks related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, policies other than monetary policy would be more effective and were better suited to address country-specific shocks.",
        "In this context, the Governing Council should communicate carefully so as not to create unrealistic expectations about the contingencies that monetary policy was able to address.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council took the following monetary policy decisions: Separate press releases with further details of the measures taken by the Governing Council would be published after the press conference.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "As regards bond market developments, the fall in euro area ten-year overnight index swap (OIS) yields from early October 2018 to mid-February 2019 had recently reversed slightly.",
        "Notwithstanding the recent recovery, yields remained compressed compared with the levels observed in early October 2018.",
        "Mr Cœuré recalled that the dominant driver of lower yields in recent months had been a fall in the inflation component, as reflected in revisions to market-based inflation expectations.",
        "The pronounced decrease in inflation-linked swap rates, across all maturities, in the fourth quarter of 2018 had likely been related, at least in part, to the sharp parallel fall in oil prices.",
        "However, since the end of December 2018 oil prices had gone up by more than 25%, both in US dollar and in euro terms, but the euro area and US medium-term inflation expectations seemed to have responded differently.",
        "The US five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had risen by around 20 basis points since early January 2019.",
        "In contrast, the equivalent swap rate for the euro area had continued to decline until last week.",
        "As had been indicated on previous occasions, the prevalence of risk premia adjustments in recent months implied that caution was warranted when interpreting monetary policy expectations purely derived from market prices.",
        "For the euro area, the latest forward one-month OIS curve indicated that policy expectations in the euro area had remained broadly stable since mid-January 2019.",
        "Survey-based expectations of a first hike in the deposit facility rate, however, had continued to shift further out in time.",
        "In the United States, the federal funds futures curve had shifted upward in recent days and had returned to levels observed in the second half of January 2019.",
        "Surveys had backtracked somewhat, but mostly in terms of timing, and still pointed to expectations of one more hike in 2019.",
        "Moving to equity markets, risky assets had continued to rally.",
        "Both the S&P 500 and the EURO STOXX had gained about 6% since the Governing Council’s January monetary policy meeting and were up by around 11% year-to-date.",
        "All in all, stock markets had by now almost fully recovered the sharp losses seen in the fourth quarter of 2018.",
        "However, at least in the euro area, the gains in share prices did not reflect an improvement in earnings prospects.",
        "Rather, higher share prices mainly reflected a fall in the equity risk premium.",
        "Emerging markets had also benefited from the improved risk sentiment.",
        "The MSCI Emerging Markets Index was already above its pre-October 2018 level and capital inflows into emerging markets had accelerated again.",
        "Credit spreads, too, had continued to narrow on improved risk sentiment.",
        "Euro area high yield spreads were down nearly 80 basis points since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 12‑13 December 2018.",
        "Investment grade spreads had also come down, both in the United States and in the euro area.",
        "Similarly, the spreads of most euro area sovereign bond yields over equivalent German government bond yields had fallen since the start of the year.",
        "Corporate bond issuance volumes in Europe had also been strong.",
        "The premium that firms had to pay for issuing new bonds had declined measurably in recent weeks, which suggested that the end of net purchases under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) had not had a meaningful impact on the corporate bond market.",
        "In foreign exchange markets, the euro exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar had remained relatively stable and had continued to trade close to the USD/EUR 1.13-1.14 level observed since early October 2018.",
        "The euro and the US dollar had depreciated notably against the British pound in recent weeks, which likely reflected the financial markets’ view that the risks of a “no-deal” Brexit had diminished lately.",
        "Finally, Mr Cœuré mentioned developments in the EURIBOR term structure, which had seen a gradual and persistent rise in rates, in particular over the longer horizons, and which had become largely disconnected from changes in policy rate expectations.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, global growth and trade momentum had slowed further.",
        "Global composite output had decreased again in January, pointing to further deceleration in global growth momentum.",
        "The weakness had been concentrated in the manufacturing sector, whereas services had remained considerably more resilient.",
        "Global trade had slowed significantly around the turn of the year.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area had slowed to 2.1% in January from 2.4% in December, largely driven by decelerating energy prices.",
        "Inflation, excluding food and energy, had remained broadly unchanged at 2.2%, suggesting that underlying inflation pressures had remained subdued.",
        "After a period of stability, Brent crude oil prices had increased in mid-February, ending 6% higher than at the time of the Governing Council’s January monetary policy meeting.",
        "The euro exchange rate had depreciated slightly against the US dollar since the January meeting in bilateral terms (-0.2%) as well as in nominal effective terms (-0.5%).",
        "Turning to the euro area, the latest incoming information pointed to continued subdued growth.",
        "Indicators related to the manufacturing sector had weakened further, whereas those related to services had showed signs of stabilisation.",
        "Eurostat’s second release had put euro area real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 at 0.2%.",
        "In terms of the composition of growth in the fourth quarter of 2018, domestic demand and net exports had provided positive contributions, while inventories had contributed negatively.",
        "Concerning GDP components, private consumption had increased by 0.2% in quarter-on-quarter terms in the fourth quarter of 2018, up from 0.1% in the third quarter.",
        "The weakness in consumption growth in recent quarters had been largely driven by non-durable goods, which appeared to be the component of household spending most sensitive to changes in energy prices.",
        "Gross fixed capital formation had grown by 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2018, the same rate as in the previous quarter.",
        "Looking ahead, investment growth dynamics were expected to remain subdued, in line with the slowdown in foreign and domestic demand.",
        "Incoming data since the January monetary policy meeting had shown a continuation of solid employment growth in the fourth quarter of 2018, at 0.3%.",
        "The PMI for employment had remained in expansionary territory, but had moderated further across most countries and sectors.",
        "Growth of euro area trade in goods had weakened further year-on-year in the final quarter of 2018, driven mainly by intra-euro area trade.",
        "Growth of extra-euro area goods exports had also remained subdued, reflecting in particular the contraction of exports to Turkey and the United Kingdom, while export growth to China and the United States had also weakened.",
        "These developments were also reflected in the March 2019 ECB staff projections, which projected real GDP growth at 1.1% in 2019, 1.6% in 2020 and 1.5% in 2021.",
        "Real GDP growth had been revised down by 0.6 percentage points in 2019 and by 0.1 percentage points in 2020, reflecting both a more lasting adverse impact of country-specific factors and heightened global uncertainties.",
        "The projections for 2021 were unchanged.",
        "Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual euro area HICP inflation had been 1.5% in February, up from 1.4% in January, while the HICP excluding food and energy inflation had decreased somewhat, to 1.0%, from 1.1% in January.",
        "Meanwhile, measures of underlying inflation had continued to move sideways.",
        "Domestic cost pressures had been increasing, but had yet to translate into higher underlying inflation.",
        "Incoming data pointed to building wage pressures, which were expected to support the upward adjustment in underlying inflation.",
        "Annual negotiated wage growth had risen to 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018, up from 2.1% in the third quarter, while overall compensation per employee had grown by 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018.",
        "ECB staff projected HICP inflation decreasing until the fourth quarter of 2019 and then picking up over the remainder of the projection horizon, to reach 1.6% in 2021.",
        "This V-shaped pattern reflected, first, a significant decrease in HICP energy inflation linked to the recent strong drop in oil prices and downward base effects related to their previous increase in 2018 and, second, gradually rising underlying inflation, supported by rising supply constraints and tightening labour markets.",
        "In the March 2019 ECB staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised down significantly by 0.3 percentage points in 2019 and by 0.2 percentage points in both 2020 and 2021.",
        "HICP excluding energy and food had been revised down by 0.2 percentage points in each year of the projection horizon.",
        "Longer-term market-based inflation expectations, as derived from the five-year inflation-linked swap rates five years forward, had declined to 1.5% compared with around 1.7% one year ago.",
        "Longer-term inflation expectations, five years ahead, in the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) stood at 1.8% in the first quarter of 2019.",
        "Financial conditions had eased.",
        "This reflected market expectations about future monetary policy and some easing of trade tensions.",
        "The impact of these factors on financing conditions had more than offset the impact of the deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook as priced in by financial markets.",
        "Equity prices had increased, despite a worsening in earnings expectations, while corporate bond spreads had tightened.",
        "The market-implied expected timing of the policy rate “lift-off” was largely unchanged.",
        "Credit conditions had remained accommodative.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, the annual growth rate of broad money (M3) had continued to hover around the rates observed since early 2018, while decreasing to 3.8% in January 2019, from 4.1% in December 2018.",
        "Money creation continued to be supported by credit to the private sector.",
        "At the same time, loan growth had been lower in January, increasing by 3.0% compared with one year ago.",
        "The recent deceleration reflected developments in loans to non-financial corporations (NFCs), in part due to base effects, while loans to households had recently stabilised.",
        "Bank profitability remained subdued, while banks were faced with a somewhat higher cost of market funding.",
        "At the same time, market concerns had risen about pressures on banks’ funding costs due to the forthcoming phasing-out of the TLTRO-II.",
        "As regards fiscal policy, the euro area deficit ratio was projected to worsen in 2019-21, mainly due to a loosening of the fiscal stance.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet remarked that since the January monetary policy meeting financial conditions had eased, mainly on account of a reappraisal of monetary policies at the global level and abating trade tensions.",
        "Moreover, credit conditions for households and firms remained accommodative.",
        "Incoming data had continued to be weak, in particular in the manufacturing sector.",
        "The growth outlook in the March 2019 ECB staff projections had been revised down substantially for 2019 and, to a lesser extent, for 2020.",
        "The euro area expansion would continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains, rising wages, and the ongoing – albeit somewhat slower – expansion in global activity.",
        "At the same time, the persistence of uncertainties was weighing on the growth outlook.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation remained muted.",
        "Domestic cost pressures, in particular wages, had been strengthening, but had yet to translate into higher underlying inflation.",
        "The March 2019 ECB staff projections entailed a marked downward revision in both headline and core inflation across the projection horizon with weaker economic momentum slowing the adjustment of inflation towards the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "Market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had weakened in recent months.",
        "In this light, to ensure that inflation remained on a sustained path to levels that were below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, Mr Praet proposed: (a) to adjust the calendar-based leg of the ECB’s forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates to indicate the Governing Council’s expectation that rates would “remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary”, as recalibrating the calendar-based leg of forward guidance would signal the Governing Council’s determination to provide the monetary accommodation needed for a sustained convergence of inflation; (b) to reiterate the Governing Council’s forward guidance on reinvestments; and (c) to launch a new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III) starting in September 2019 and ending in March 2021, each with a maturity of two years.",
        "Counterparties would be entitled to borrow up to 30% of the stock of eligible loans as at 28 February 2019, at a rate indexed to the interest rate on the ECB’s main refinancing operations over the life of each TLTRO.",
        "These new operations would help to preserve the favourable bank lending conditions and support the smooth transmission of monetary policy.",
        "The precise terms of the operations would be communicated in due course.",
        "Finally, the ECB’s lending operations would continue to be conducted as fixed-rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period starting in March 2021.",
        "As regards external communication, the Governing Council needed to: (a) stress that the weakening in economic data pointed to a sizeable moderation in the pace of the economic expansion that would extend into the current year; (b) emphasise that the weaker economic momentum was slowing the adjustment of inflation towards the Governing Council’s aim; (c) adjust the forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, namely that the Governing Council expected them to “remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary”, while reiterating the forward guidance on reinvestments; (d) announce a new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III), starting in September 2019 and ending in March 2021, and stress that the new TLTROs would help to preserve bank lending conditions and support the smooth transmission of monetary policy; (e) announce the extension of the fixed-rate tender procedures with full allotment for the ECB’s lending operations for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period starting in March 2021; (f) explain that these decisions would support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term; (g) indicate that the risks to the euro area growth outlook were still tilted to the downside because of the persistence of geopolitical uncertainties; (h) stress that significant monetary policy stimulus remained essential for a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, and would continue to be provided by the forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of TLTROs; and (i) reiterate that, in any event, the Governing Council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure a sustained convergence of inflation.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Recent data and survey results had continued to be weak, in particular in the manufacturing sector, reflecting the slowdown in external demand compounded by some country and sector-specific factors.",
        "While there were signs that some of these domestic factors dampening growth were starting to fade, the weakening in economic data pointed to a sizeable moderation in the pace of the economic expansion that would extend into the current year, with the persistence of uncertainties appearing to weigh on economic sentiment and the growth outlook.",
        "This assessment was broadly reflected in the March 2019 ECB staff projections, in which the outlook for real GDP growth had been revised down substantially for 2019 and slightly for 2020 compared with the December 2018 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "In considering the outlook and risks for the external environment, members took note of the further slowdown in global growth and trade momentum.",
        "In particular, there were concerns about the potential impact of trade protectionism on the global outlook and the ongoing risk of an escalation of trade conflicts.",
        "Reference was made in the discussion to a number of factors, including the impact of trade tensions between the United States and China, the threat posed by a trade dispute between the European Union and the United States, and the risks surrounding a disorderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the slowdown in growth in China, as well as developments in the US economy, which was expected to slow as a result of the waning effect of the fiscal package.",
        "Against this background, the risks to the external environment were assessed to be on the downside, on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, members concurred that the recent data had continued to be weaker than expected.",
        "It was noted that the carry-over effect from weaker growth in the second half of 2018 implied a lower projection for growth in 2019.",
        "Recent economic indicators had also been disappointing, with the latest surveys and data releases confirming the need to revise the short-term growth outlook downwards, as partly reflected in the March staff projections.",
        "The downside risks to growth identified in earlier discussions had thus, to some extent, materialised.",
        "The weakness in growth was seen as being longer-lasting than had previously been expected, with the result that growth was now likely to be below potential for a number of quarters.",
        "Members considered that the downward revisions to the growth projections in the March staff projections were warranted and expressed confidence in the baseline as the central scenario.",
        "In this context, it was observed that the updated outlook for euro area growth just released by the OECD in its Interim Economic Outlook, although slightly lower than the ECB staff projections – with 1.0% for 2019 and 1.2% for 2020 – also incorporated a substantial downward revision to euro area growth.",
        "Members acknowledged that, while the baseline scenario of a more protracted “soft patch” followed by a return to more solid growth was the most likely scenario, uncertainty remained elevated and it was unclear how persistent the current soft patch would turn out to be.",
        "It was noted that, while some indicators pointed to growth rates in the first and second quarters of this year that were lower than in the March staff projections, there were some positive factors to be taken into account, such as those relating to the impact of fiscal measures and the unwinding of some temporary country and sector-specific factors, notably in the German car industry.",
        "Moreover, it was recalled that, beyond the near term, a number of factors continued to support the euro area economic expansion, including favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wage growth, as well as the ongoing, albeit somewhat slower, expansion in global activity.",
        "It was also emphasised that, while the growth momentum was weaker, it remained positive.",
        "Neither the euro area, nor the global economy, was currently in recession and the probability of a recession remained relatively low.",
        "At the same time, the view was widely shared that downside risks to the growth outlook continued to prevail despite the downward revisions incorporated in the March projections.",
        "It was stressed that the revisions to the growth projections were mainly to the short term and that a rebound in activity was expected in the second half of the year, reflecting the fading of temporary factors, an improvement in external trade and an easing of trade conflicts.",
        "Following the downward revisions to growth in the first half of the year, growth was expected to return to potential, with quarter-on-quarter growth rates of around 0.4% throughout the projection horizon, which might be considered optimistic.",
        "It was highlighted that the growth projections had been revised down in a number of consecutive projection exercises and that growth might not be mean-reverting, as typically assumed in projections.",
        "The remark was made that some of the factors behind the slowdown, such as developments in China, were unlikely to fade away in a few months.",
        "Uncertainty might also turn out to be more persistent than expected and concern was expressed that, if the current high level of uncertainty persisted, there could be a stronger adverse impact looking ahead, in particular on investment.",
        "As regards the balance of risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook, these were generally assessed to be still tilted to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.",
        "Although a case could be made that the risks to growth were now somewhat more balanced, following the downward revision to the ECB staff projections, it was considered that overall the global risk factors, which were predominantly on the downside, had the potential to further affect confidence and global activity negatively, with adverse spillovers to activity in the euro area.",
        "In an exchange of views about the outlook for fiscal policy, members reiterated the need for rebuilding fiscal buffers in countries where government debt was high.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that, consistent with the country-specific recommendations from the European Commission, jurisdictions that had fiscal space should stand ready to use it, given the downside risks to growth.",
        "The mildly expansionary fiscal stance and the operation of automatic stabilisers were providing some support to economic activity.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation was likely to remain at around current levels, before declining towards the end of the year.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, but labour cost pressures had strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets.",
        "Looking ahead, underlying inflation was expected to increase over the medium term, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth.",
        "This assessment was also broadly reflected in the March staff projections, in which annual HICP inflation was projected to rise from 1.2% in 2019 to 1.5% in 2020 and to 1.6% in 2021.",
        "Compared with the December 2018 Eurosystem staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised down over the whole projection horizon, reflecting in particular the more subdued near-term growth outlook.",
        "Members took note of the implications for the medium-term inflation outlook arising from the downward revisions to the growth outlook and generally agreed that the weaker economic momentum in the March staff projections implied a slower adjustment of inflation to the ECB’s price stability objective.",
        "Underlying inflation, as measured by the HICP excluding energy and food, was still expected to pick up over the projection horizon but had also been revised down compared with the December 2018 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Confidence in the upward movement in inflation dynamics was expressed, even though the expected path for inflation was flatter than previously expected and thus the convergence of inflation would take longer than previously expected.",
        "Headline inflation was now only expected to reach 1.6% in 2021, at the end of the projection horizon.",
        "Members considered that recent developments in wage growth continued to provide positive support for the outlook for underlying inflation.",
        "Although compensation per employee in the euro area had been revised down slightly in the projections, nominal labour costs were expected to strengthen, supported by negotiated wage growth, which stood at 2.2% in December 2018.",
        "The transmission of higher wages to consumer price inflation was considered to remain a key issue for the medium-term outlook for inflation, with higher wage growth not yet having passed through to price inflation, as firms had absorbed increases by lowering profit margins.",
        "Some confidence was expressed, however, that as mark-ups could not be squeezed indefinitely, wage pressures would eventually pass through to underlying inflation.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that a smaller increase in unit labour costs was now projected and that the projected increase in profit margins was predicated on the rebound in economic activity taking place.",
        "More generally, it was recalled that the transmission to consumer price inflation was subject to time lags and it was noted that the slowdown in economic activity could weigh on the pass-through from wages to prices.",
        "Moreover, the mechanism whereby higher wage costs were transferred to prices might have changed structurally in recent years, as appeared to be the case in both the United States and Europe.",
        "As regards recent developments in longer-term inflation expectations, members noted that expectations had declined further since the Governing Council’s January 2019 monetary policy meeting.",
        "Market-based inflation expectations, as measured by the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, currently stood at 1.5%.",
        "Longer-term survey-based inflation expectations had been revised down as well, standing at 1.8% in the SPF for the first quarter of 2019.",
        "Hence, the gap between survey-based and market-based measures had widened somewhat.",
        "While some concern was expressed about the trend in longer-term inflation expectations, the risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations was assessed as very low.",
        "On the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "M3 continued to hover around the growth rates observed since early 2018.",
        "While private credit remained the main source of money creation from a counterpart perspective, the decline in the contribution of the asset purchase programme (APP) had recently been replaced by external monetary flows and credit to the general government.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to NFCs had decreased to 3.3% in January 2019, from 3.9% in December 2018, reflecting a base effect but also, in some countries, the typical lagged reaction to a slowdown in economic activity, while growth in loans to households had remained unchanged.",
        "It was underlined that bank lending conditions remained overall very supportive, even if the latest available bank lending survey had pointed to the prospect of some tightening looking ahead.",
        "Bank funding conditions had become somewhat less favourable, although banks were partly shielded from less benign conditions in bond markets owing to the increased share of deposits in their funding structures.",
        "Concerns were voiced that over time the effects of persistently low rates could depress banks’ interest margins and profitability with negative effects on bank intermediation and financial stability in the longer run.",
        "It was recalled that the consequences of low rates differed across the maturity spectrum and across banks, depending on their business models and the structure of their assets and liabilities.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that euro area financial conditions had eased, also on account of markets’ reassessment of global monetary policy, and remained, overall, very supportive.",
        "Borrowing conditions for firms and households were still favourable, as the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 were continuing to support access to financing.",
        "While the monetary policy stance was assessed as being very accommodative, also in the light of the large stock of assets on the ECB’s balance sheet, the downward revisions of growth and inflation across the forecast horizon in the March staff projections were sizeable and larger than market participants had expected, warranting some consideration.",
        "At the same time, confidence was expressed that the conditions for a rebound in activity and inflation remained in place to support a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Against this background, members expressed broad support for the package of measures proposed by Mr Praet.",
        "The proposed extension of the calendar-based leg of the Governing Council’s forward guidance was generally seen as underpinning the monetary accommodation needed to support inflation converging towards the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "Reference was made to the publication of the downward revision to the projections, which was in any case likely – by itself – to induce a further delay in the expected date of the first interest rate increase, in line with the state-contingent element of the forward guidance.",
        "It was emphasised that the Governing Council would be reacting to the projected decrease in the inflation projections in a data-driven manner in order to provide additional support in a situation that was characterised by various risks.",
        "A question was raised about how frequently forward guidance should be adjusted in response to new data.",
        "All in all, bringing the calendar-based leg of forward guidance more into line with market expectations of a later date for the first interest rate increase was widely seen as appropriately reflecting the Governing Council’s assessment of the inflation outlook.",
        "A number of members voiced an initial preference for extending the forward guidance through the end of the first quarter of 2020, while expressing their readiness to join a consensus forming on Mr Praet’s proposal, with the overall policy package seen as finely balanced.",
        "Shifting the forward guidance to March 2020 instead of December 2019 would provide additional accommodation and would be more in line with the markets’ pricing of a first interest rate increase, compared with survey-based expectations.",
        "It was argued that a clear easing signal would be important in view of the significant downward revisions to the ECB staff projections.",
        "Other members preferred to extend the forward guidance until the end of 2019 as this was considered to be more consistent with the baseline scenario underlying the projections that foresaw a rebound of the economy in the second half of 2019.",
        "Caution was expressed about committing to a longer horizon well into the following year in a situation of high uncertainty where incoming data could evolve in very different ways.",
        "In view of the high prevailing uncertainty, a data-driven gradualist approach was seen as most appropriate, while it was also argued that the Governing Council should avoid giving the impression that policy would be all but predetermined until the end of the year.",
        "The need for more analysis of the effects of the various unconventional measures on financial intermediation was mentioned.",
        "All in all, members agreed to extend the Governing Council’s forward guidance through the end of 2019 as part of the overall package, as proposed by Mr Praet.",
        "Recalibrating the calendar-based leg of the Governing Council’s forward guidance would signal the Governing Council’s determination to provide the monetary accommodation needed for a sustained convergence of inflation.",
        "At the same time, it would not pre-empt the Governing Council’s readjustment of its monetary policy, if needed, at one of its coming meetings should the outlook evolve less favourably than expected.",
        "Moreover, the state-based leg of forward guidance automatically implied a shift in rate expectations if the economic conditions for an interest rate increase were not yet in place.",
        "Satisfaction was expressed that the state-based element of the Governing Council’s forward guidance was working well, together with the calendar-based guidance.",
        "Members also expressed broad support for Mr Praet’s proposal to launch a new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III) starting in September 2019 and ending in March 2021, each with a maturity of two years.",
        "These new operations would help to ensure that bank lending conditions remained favourable and would support the smooth transmission of monetary policy via the banking sector.",
        "In the light of looming cliff effects related to maturing TLTRO-II operations, upcoming regulatory requirements and the risk of some deterioration in funding conditions for banks, TLTRO-III would help to avoid increasing funding pressures for banks.",
        "In the discussion, the mostly pre-emptive nature of TLTRO-III was stressed as in most jurisdictions a tightening of credit conditions had not yet been observed.",
        "TLTRO-III would act as a backstop to provide insurance to the economy at a time of high uncertainty with risks tilted to the downside.",
        "While it was recalled that TLTROs had been very successful measures for providing accommodation in the euro area’s bank-based financial system, their targeted nature was highlighted as well.",
        "With respect to the horizon of the new set of operations, a sufficiently long horizon was seen as helpful to ensure sufficient accommodation to bring inflation towards levels of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term and increase the impact on the real economy, also by broadly matching the typical maturity of loans to NFCs.",
        "Conversely, a shorter horizon would provide a stronger signal to banks that they needed to be prepared to secure funding on private markets and avoid becoming overly reliant on central bank funding.",
        "Members agreed that the design of the TLTRO-III operations should support the smooth transmission of monetary policy and favourable bank lending conditions, preserving sufficient accommodation to support the convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim, while not perpetuating the reliance of banks on unconventional policy measures.",
        "Modelling the conditions for the new operations on the design of TLTRO-II was seen as a way to ensure their pass-through to the real economy and limit the use of funds for carry trades in government bonds.",
        "Financial stability considerations had to be taken into account, but also needed to be addressed at the country level.",
        "With regard to the pricing of TLTRO-III, it was generally agreed that it should be indexed to the interest rate on the main refinancing operations.",
        "There was broad agreement that elaborating the details would need more reflection by the Governing Council and they should be communicated in due course.",
        "Members also agreed to continue conducting lending operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary and at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period starting in March 2021.",
        "In the light of the foregoing discussion, the President ascertained that all members supported the package of measures as proposed by Mr Praet.",
        "Turning to communication, members widely agreed that it needed to be emphasised that decisions to be taken by the Governing Council would support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term.",
        "Moreover, the measures would help to increase the resilience of the euro area economy to the risks resulting from geopolitical uncertainties.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that the decisions should be seen as an appropriate adjustment of the instruments at the Governing Council’s disposal in reaction to a weakening of economic data and the inflation outlook and should not be interpreted as a reversal of the policy stance.",
        "In the Governing Council’s communication, it was furthermore seen as warranted to reiterate that significant monetary policy stimulus remained essential for a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term and that it would continue to be provided by the forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of TLTROs.",
        "As emphasised in previous communication, it also needed to be reiterated that, in any event, the Governing Council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure a sustained convergence of inflation.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council took the following monetary policy decisions: The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "The Vice-President, standing in for Mr Cœuré, reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 6-7 March 2019, global risk sentiment had improved across various market segments.",
        "Equity market indices had continued to rise, recording one of the strongest first quarter performances since the global financial crisis, while government bond prices had also increased.",
        "At the same time, foreign exchange rates had mostly remained broadly stable.",
        "Expectations that monetary policy would remain supportive globally had been an important factor behind these developments.",
        "In the United States, at its meeting in March 2019 the Federal Open Market Committee had lowered its projections for the federal funds target rate for the period 2019 to 2021 and had also announced that it would reduce its holdings of US Treasuries at a slower pace from May 2019, concluding its balance sheet run-off by the end of September 2019.",
        "This, combined with revisions to the global economic outlook, had led to a decline in global government bond yields over the review period.",
        "The ten-year German Bund yield had moved into negative territory, although over the past few days it had risen slightly and was currently trading around zero.",
        "With regard to the euro area, market expectations for a first increase in ECB policy rates had been pushed further out in time since the Governing Council’s March 2019 monetary policy meeting.",
        "Market views regarding the medium-term outlook for euro short-term money market rates had shifted further to the downside, standing close to the low levels seen in late 2016.",
        "A decomposition of the euro area ten-year overnight index swap (OIS) rate highlighted that the decline in the rate seemed to have been driven mainly by the inflation component, although the real component had also decreased somewhat since the Governing Council’s March 2019 monetary policy meeting.",
        "In contrast, in the United States, the real component seemed to have been the main driver of a decline in the ten-year spot OIS rate, consistent with the softer US economic data releases in the first quarter of 2019.",
        "The inflation component had increased since the start of the year, supported by an increase in oil prices.",
        "Euro area government bond yields had declined to a similar degree across all jurisdictions.",
        "Market participants’ anticipation of “low rates for longer” had possibly spurred a renewed search for yield and a stronger risk appetite, as evidenced also in declining euro area corporate bond market yields and asset swap spreads.",
        "Overall, as a result of these global bond market movements 20% of worldwide investment-grade debt was trading at yields below zero, compared with the historical high of 25% seen in mid-2016.",
        "Nominal effective exchange rates of major currencies had remained broadly stable, with the exception of the pound sterling, which had strengthened by around 4% against its trading partners’ currencies during the first quarter of this year.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, there were signs that the moderation in global activity had continued in early 2019 and that the weakness in global trade was persisting.",
        "Global survey indicators pointed to a further slowdown in manufacturing activity, while services appeared more resilient.",
        "In three-month-on-three-month terms, global merchandise import growth had decelerated further in January.",
        "The slowdown had continued to be largely driven by emerging market economies and, in particular, emerging Asia.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area stood at 2.1% in February.",
        "Core inflation had fallen slightly from 2.2% in January to 2.1% in February.",
        "After the strong jump in mid-February, oil prices had increased again, rising by 9% since the Governing Council’s March 2019 monetary policy meeting, with the price of Brent crude oil standing at almost USD 71 per barrel.",
        "Food prices had declined by 2.5%, while metal prices had remained broadly stable.",
        "The euro had depreciated since the March meeting, both against the US dollar (by 0.7%) and in nominal effective terms (by 0.3%).",
        "Turning to the euro area economy, high frequency information that had become available since the Governing Council’s March 2019 monetary policy meeting continued to signal positive, albeit subdued, growth in the first quarter of 2019.",
        "Indicators related to the manufacturing sector had weakened further, whereas those related to services had shown signs of stabilisation.",
        "The European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) had dropped to 106.0 in the first quarter of 2019, from 108.9 in the previous quarter, and the composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index had stood at an average of 51.5, down from 52.3 in the previous quarter.",
        "Domestic demand was being supported by favourable financing conditions, employment growth and rising wages.",
        "Private consumption growth had stabilised at 1.0% in the fourth quarter of 2018.",
        "It was expected to gradually accelerate again, in line with developments in real disposable income, which were in turn largely driven by continued labour income growth.",
        "The four main factors behind the recent weakness in private consumption had been the higher oil prices in the first half of 2018, car delivery bottlenecks owing to the new emissions testing procedures, increased macroeconomic uncertainty, and some country-specific factors.",
        "Business investment had slowed in the fourth quarter of 2018.",
        "Looking ahead, business investment was expected to continue expanding, albeit at a lower rate, as had also been reflected in the March 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "This was consistent with lower corporate earnings expectations.",
        "Employment had continued to expand, albeit at a slower pace.",
        "Employment growth had slowed in manufacturing and market services, while it had remained resilient in the construction sector.",
        "Looking ahead, survey indicators for employment continued to indicate further employment growth, albeit at a more moderate pace.",
        "Growth in extra-euro area exports had remained subdued, while intra-euro area trade had contracted at the end of 2018.",
        "Based on leading indicators, no immediate recovery was in sight.",
        "Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation had stood at 1.4% in March, down from 1.5% in February, while HICP inflation excluding food and energy had decreased to 0.8%, from 1.0% in February.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation had remained generally muted.",
        "Domestic cost pressures had been increasing, but had yet to translate into higher underlying inflation.",
        "Growth in compensation per employee had remained above its long-term average (of 2.1%), although it had fallen from 2.5% in the third quarter of 2018 to 2.2% in the fourth quarter.",
        "The third quarter reading, however, had been driven in part by some one-off payments.",
        "At the same time, negotiated wages had continued to increase, rising from 2.1% in the third quarter of 2018 to 2.2% in the fourth quarter, and further to 2.5% in January 2019.",
        "The pick-up in January had been quite broad-based across euro area countries.",
        "Price pressures for non-energy industrial goods had increased in the later stages of the supply chain, while signals in the earlier stages were mixed.",
        "Inflationary pressures along the pricing chain for services had also strengthened slightly again.",
        "Services producer price inflation had continued the upward trend that had started at the beginning of 2016.",
        "This trend had been broad-based and was supported by all the main sub-categories.",
        "The results of the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the second quarter of 2019 had shown slight downward revisions of 0.1 percentage points for HICP inflation expectations for 2019, 2020 and 2021.",
        "At the same time, average longer-term inflation expectations had remained broadly unchanged at 1.8%.",
        "Expectations for inflation excluding food and energy had been revised down by 0.1 percentage points for 2019 and 2020, while remaining unchanged for 2021.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation expectations derived from the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had stood at 1.4%, which was 15 basis points lower than the level that had prevailed before the Governing Council’s March 2019 monetary policy meeting.",
        "Financial conditions had eased since the March monetary policy meeting against the backdrop of a further reappraisal of monetary policies at the global level as well as improved risk sentiment.",
        "Credit conditions had generally remained very accommodative.",
        "The overall cost of financing for euro area firms had declined by 9 basis points since the March meeting and stood at 4.5%.",
        "The expected timing of the ECB’s policy rate “lift-off” had shifted out substantially.",
        "At the same time, equity prices had increased amid large swings and corporate bond spreads had tightened somewhat.",
        "The annual growth rate of broad money (M3) had rebounded in February to 4.3%, from 3.8% in January.",
        "From a counterpart perspective, while private credit had remained the main source of money creation, since July 2018 the decline in the contribution of the asset purchase programme (APP) had been replaced by external monetary inflows and, to a lesser extent, by bank credit to the general government.",
        "The annual growth of bank loans to non-financial corporations (NFCs) had dropped to 3.4% in January, but had rebounded to 3.7% in February.",
        "The volatility in the first two months of 2019 had reflected base effects related to banks’ efforts to reach minimum threshold loan flows within the benchmark period for the second series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-II) in early 2018.",
        "Looking through this volatility, a weakening in NFC loan dynamics had been observed since September 2018, when the annual growth rate had peaked at 4.3%.",
        "This moderation was consistent with the observed weakening in economic growth during 2018.",
        "According to the bank lending survey results for the first quarter of 2019, both credit standards for loans to enterprises and demand for loans to enterprises had remained broadly unchanged.",
        "Overall, bank lending conditions remained favourable and continued to support credit provision.",
        "As regards fiscal developments, the euro area fiscal stance was projected to turn mildly expansionary in 2019.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet noted that financial conditions had eased since the Governing Council’s March 2019 monetary policy meeting.",
        "In line with the Governing Council’s forward guidance, the risk-free yield curve had flattened in response to the ECB’s monetary policy decisions and also to a stream of negative surprises about the euro area economy.",
        "Bank lending conditions remained favourable.",
        "Incoming data confirmed that the slower growth momentum was extending into the current year.",
        "Activity in the manufacturing sector had decelerated markedly, mainly on account of external headwinds, as global growth and trade dynamics remained weak.",
        "At the same time, domestic demand remained resilient and some of the idiosyncratic domestic factors dampening growth were fading.",
        "The balance of risks surrounding the growth outlook remained on the downside, as the persistence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, was weighing on confidence.",
        "HICP inflation had fallen in March, primarily reflecting a decline in inflation excluding food and energy.",
        "Market-based, longer-term inflation expectations had also declined, mainly in reaction to weak macroeconomic data releases, and measures of underlying inflation remained muted.",
        "Domestic cost pressures, in particular in wages, had been strengthening, but had yet to translate into higher underlying inflation.",
        "Against this background, Mr Praet proposed to reiterate the forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates and on reinvestments, and the readiness to act by employing all available monetary policy tools should inflation convergence require more support.",
        "It was essential to preserve the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy stance for as long as necessary for growth to regain a faster pace and thereby foster convergence of inflation to its aim.",
        "Concerning the parameters of the new targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III), set to be discussed at one of the Governing Council’s forthcoming meetings, Mr Praet suggested that their pricing would take into account a thorough assessment of the bank-based transmission channel as well as further developments in the economic outlook.",
        "In the context of its regular assessment, the Governing Council could also consider whether the preservation of the favourable implications of negative interest rates for the economy would require the mitigation of their possible side effects, if any, on bank intermediation.",
        "Accordingly, the public communication should: (a) stress that the incoming information confirmed slower growth momentum extending into the current year; (b) underline that further employment gains and rising wages continued to underpin the resilience of the domestic economy and gradually rising inflation pressures; (c) recognise that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remained tilted to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets; (d) emphasise that an ample degree of monetary policy accommodation remained necessary to safeguard favourable financing conditions and support the economic expansion, and thus to ensure that inflation remained on a sustained path towards levels that were below, but close to, 2% over the medium term; (e) reiterate that significant monetary policy stimulus was being provided by the forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of TLTROs; (f) announce that the details on the precise terms of the new TLTROs would be communicated at one of the Governing Council’s forthcoming meetings and that their pricing would take into account a thorough assessment of the bank-based transmission channel of monetary policy, as well as further developments in the economic outlook; (g) highlight that, in the context of its regular assessment, the Governing Council would consider whether the preservation of the favourable implications of negative interest rates for the economy would require the mitigation of their possible side effects, if any, on bank intermediation; and (h) finally, underscore that, in any event, the Governing Council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continued to move towards its aim in a sustained manner.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally shared the assessment of the outlook for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Incoming data confirmed that the slower growth momentum was extending into the current year.",
        "There were signs that some of the country and sector-specific domestic factors dampening growth were fading, but global headwinds continued to weigh on euro area activity and were leaving marks on economic sentiment.",
        "At the same time, further employment gains and rising wages continued to underpin the resilience of the domestic economy and gradually rising inflation pressures.",
        "The risks surrounding the growth outlook remained tilted to the downside.",
        "In discussing the outlook and risks for the external environment, members took note of the continued moderation of global activity and the ongoing weakness of global trade.",
        "Some comfort was drawn from recent signs that economic activity in China was stabilising.",
        "Concerns were reiterated that the global outlook remained subject to the continued risk of an escalation of trade conflicts and the uncertainty surrounding the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.",
        "It was also recalled that the complexity of global value chains made it difficult to gauge the precise implications of such risks for trade and activity over time.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, members agreed that the slower growth momentum observed in the second half of 2018 was extending into the current year.",
        "Incoming data had continued to be weak, especially for the manufacturing sector.",
        "The extension of the slower growth momentum had, in part, already been anticipated in the March 2019 ECB staff projections, but it was also acknowledged that some recent data had turned out even weaker than expected.",
        "Looking further ahead, members widely shared the view that the more protracted “soft patch” suggested by the latest data remained consistent with the baseline scenario of a return to more solid growth in the second half of the current year.",
        "At the same time, it was acknowledged that there was now somewhat less confidence in this baseline scenario and that the range of other possible outcomes had widened.",
        "More information would need to be gathered in the run-up to the Governing Council’s June monetary policy meeting, when new Eurosystem staff projections would become available.",
        "Members put forward a number of views on how to interpret and assess the more protracted “soft patch” and the baseline scenario.",
        "The important role of exports and manufacturing in driving the current outlook was emphasised.",
        "Given that the euro area was running a persistent current account surplus, it was naturally more exposed to the slowdown in global trade than the rest of the world.",
        "As this shock was transmitted mainly through manufacturing, some euro area countries were more exposed than others.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the role of inventories and whether they were indicating an unanticipated lack of demand or deferred demand.",
        "Concern was again expressed that the return to more solid growth rates expected in the baseline scenario was currently based on the assumption that the shocks behind the “soft patch” would be temporary and that there would be no new negative shocks.",
        "However, it was also remarked that “soft patches” in economic growth had been observed on numerous occasions and that historical data implied a low probability of them turning into recessions.",
        "Reference was made to a number of positive indicators and supportive factors.",
        "The service sector had remained more resilient than manufacturing.",
        "Financial market developments, which were typically more forward looking, were more upbeat.",
        "Favourable financing conditions, and the positive real income developments implied by further employment gains and rising wages, continued to underpin the resilience of domestic demand and to support the underlying strength of the euro area economy.",
        "Members generally concurred with the view that the balance of risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remained tilted to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.",
        "Downside risks, from Brexit and the threat of protectionism in particular, had the potential to further affect confidence and negatively spill over to activity.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that, insofar as uncertainties related to the Chinese economy and Brexit had been two main factors in previously shifting the risk balance from neutral to negative, a recovery in China and the avoidance of a “no-deal” Brexit should by the same token imply an improvement in the risk balance.",
        "Members took note of the outlook for fiscal policy, with the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the operation of automatic stabilisers providing support to economic activity.",
        "With regard to the role of other policy areas, it was underlined that structural reforms were important for ensuring that the economy could reap the full benefits of the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "It was seen as essential for other policy areas to contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.4% in March, after 1.5% in February 2019, reflecting declines in food, services and non-energy industrial goods price inflation.",
        "On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation was likely to decline over the coming months.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, but labour cost pressures had strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets.",
        "Looking ahead, underlying inflation was expected to increase over the medium term, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth.",
        "Members acknowledged the negative surprise in the March outcome for HICP inflation excluding energy and food.",
        "A need for caution was expressed, though, as the interpretation of this surprise was complicated by the impact of recent methodological changes in the compilation of the HICP and calendar effects related to the timing of Easter.",
        "Members underlined that the transmission of wage inflation to consumer price inflation remained a key issue for the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Although, according to the latest data, growth in compensation per employee in the euro area continued to stand above its long-term average, it was observed that the lack of pass-through of wages to underlying inflation so far implied that firms and retailers were compressing their profit margins rather than raising prices.",
        "All in all, however, it was generally considered that the observed wage growth should also lead to higher inflation in due course.",
        "Members took note of the latest developments in longer-term inflation expectations.",
        "While longer-term survey-based inflation expectations in the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the second quarter of 2019 had been unchanged at 1.8%, the market-based measure of the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had declined further since the Governing Council’s March 2019 monetary policy meeting, to stand at 1.4%.",
        "Some concern was expressed that market-based inflation expectations had shifted downwards in parallel with actual inflation and across all maturities.",
        "At the same time, the deterioration was seen to mainly reflect a response to the weaker economic outlook rather than an unanchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The annual growth rate of broad money M3 had rebounded somewhat in February.",
        "The narrow monetary aggregate M1 had remained the main contributor to broad money growth.",
        "The gradually declining contribution to the growth momentum of M3 from the APP continued to be replaced by a rising contribution from credit to the private sector, which had remained robust.",
        "At the same time, a remark was made that the gradual recovery in the growth of MFI loans to the private sector, which had been observed since the beginning of 2014, showed signs of stalling in a number of countries.",
        "Credit provision to the private sector continued to be supported by very favourable borrowing costs for firms and households across euro area jurisdictions, which remained close to their historical lows.",
        "Reference was made to the bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2019, which pointed to demand for loans to enterprises remaining robust, while demand for housing loans continued to increase.",
        "Credit terms and conditions remained broadly unchanged, following a protracted easing period.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that the implications of very easy credit conditions and low lending rates for banks’ capacity to appropriately price credit risk through the cycle warranted close monitoring.",
        "In this regard, concerns were expressed that banks’ profitability and market valuations remained weak.",
        "Structural factors, such as cost efficiency, excess capacity and the need for consolidation, were seen to be primarily responsible for this.",
        "It was reiterated that further analysis was warranted on the effects of persistently low and negative interest rates on banks’ interest rate margins and profitability, as well as on the potential implications for bank intermediation and financial stability over time.",
        "In this context, the point was made that, in the responses to the bank lending survey, banks had indicated that the negative deposit facility rate was still contributing to increased lending volumes across all loan categories.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members broadly agreed with the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The incoming information since the Governing Council’s March 2019 monetary policy meeting had confirmed that the slower growth momentum was extending into the current year and might delay convergence to the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "At the same time, further, albeit slowing, employment gains and rising wages continued to underpin the resilience of the domestic economy and gradually rising inflation pressures.",
        "Still, an ample degree of monetary accommodation remained necessary to safeguard favourable financing conditions and support the economic expansion as well as a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.",
        "Financial conditions had eased since the March monetary policy meeting.",
        "The risk-free yield curve had flattened in reaction to the decisions communicated at that meeting as well as to negative economic data surprises in the intervening period.",
        "Moreover, subsequent market developments had brought about a substantial additional easing of financial conditions.",
        "Policy rates were now expected to remain at current levels for almost a year longer than had been the case before the March meeting.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement that the response by financial markets showed that the Governing Council’s reaction function was well understood.",
        "Against this background, all members agreed to maintain the current monetary policy stance and to reconfirm all elements of the Governing Council’s forward guidance.",
        "Significant monetary policy stimulus would be provided by the forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of TLTROs.",
        "The present monetary policy stance was considered to be consistent with the Governing Council’s data-driven approach to monetary policy, oriented towards the medium term.",
        "The baseline outlook of the March 2019 ECB staff projections had remained broadly intact, notwithstanding evidence of greater uncertainty around the central projection, with risks remaining tilted to the downside.",
        "A wider information set would be available in June, including a fresh round of Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "While it was acknowledged that contingencies for the Governing Council to act again had not materialised, the point was made that inflation remained uncomfortably below the Governing Council’s inflation aim and market-based inflation expectations had receded, while the projected inflation convergence had been repeatedly delayed.",
        "Against this background, the Governing Council reiterated its determination to stand ready to adjust all of its monetary policy tools, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continued to move towards its aim in a sustained manner.",
        "It was emphasised that inflation was ultimately a monetary phenomenon, while structural factors and other policy areas were responsible for determining growth potential and reaping the full benefits of the Governing Council’s monetary policy.",
        "There was broad agreement among members that details on the precise terms of the new series of TLTROs should be considered at one of the Governing Council’s forthcoming meetings.",
        "The pricing of the new TLTRO-III operations should be data-dependent and take into account a thorough assessment of the bank-based transmission channel of monetary policy, as well as further developments in the economic outlook.",
        "Some arguments were put forward in favour of pricing the new operations so that they would primarily serve as a backstop, providing insurance in times of elevated uncertainty.",
        "Other arguments supported the view that the TLTRO-III operations should also be seen as a potential tool for adjusting the monetary policy stance.",
        "Members supported the proposal made by Mr Praet in his introduction that, in addition to assessing the pricing of the new TLTRO-III operations, the Governing Council should also consider in its regular assessment whether the preservation of the favourable implications of negative interest rates for the economy called for the mitigation of their possible side effects, if any, on bank intermediation.",
        "Turning to communication, members widely agreed with the elements proposed by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "It was appropriate for the Governing Council to acknowledge that the incoming information confirmed that the slower growth momentum was extending into the current year.",
        "The baseline scenario of a rebound in growth in the second half of the year remained broadly intact, while the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remained tilted to the downside.",
        "An ample degree of monetary policy accommodation remained necessary to safeguard favourable financing conditions and support the economic expansion, and thus to ensure that inflation remained on a sustained path towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "In this regard, it was important to reiterate that significant monetary policy stimulus was being provided by the Governing Council’s forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the announced new series of TLTROs.",
        "It was also worth reiterating that, on account of the stock effects of the sizeable APP portfolio, the end of net asset purchases did not represent a tightening of the monetary policy stance.",
        "There was, furthermore, wide agreement among members that the Governing Council should reiterate that all monetary policy tools remained available and that it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continued to move towards its inflation aim in a sustained manner.",
        "Members also widely agreed to communicate that the details on the precise terms of the new TLTROs would be announced following one of the Governing Council’s forthcoming meetings.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40%, respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that were below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "The Governing Council intended to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 9-10 April 2019, US trade negotiations with both China and Mexico had progressively deteriorated, negatively impacting global equity markets and pushing equity risk premia higher.",
        "Bond yields had declined to multi-year lows.",
        "In foreign exchange markets, the euro and the US dollar had appreciated in nominal effective terms, reflecting mainly the weakness in emerging market currencies and, in particular, the Chinese renminbi.",
        "At the same time, the euro had continued its gradual depreciation against the US dollar, a trend observed since the start of 2018 that likely related to changes in the relative growth outlook.",
        "In bond markets, the yield on the ten-year German government bond had declined by more than 70 basis points since October 2018, to a record low level of -22 basis points.",
        "The ten-year US Treasury yield had fallen even more – by around 100 basis points over the same period.",
        "Tentative evidence suggested that the recent decline in global bond yields signalled a broader reappraisal of the global growth and monetary policy outlook by markets rather than a temporary flight to safety.",
        "First, yield spreads of higher-yielding euro area sovereign bonds – with the exception of Italian government bonds – had declined in recent weeks, unlike in periods of broad risk aversion, when these yield spreads would tend to rise against German bonds.",
        "The yields on ten-year Spanish and Portuguese sovereign bonds were trading at their lowest levels on record.",
        "Also, euro area five-year forward inflation-linked swap rates five years ahead had continued their trend decline of recent months and were currently only marginally higher than the record low of 1.25% observed in the aftermath of the 2016 Brexit referendum.",
        "In the United States, marked-based inflation expectations had also declined more recently.",
        "A third factor that suggested increasing concerns over the growth outlook related to recent developments in the spread between the ten-year Bund and the overnight index swap (OIS) rate.",
        "This had been a good proxy for scarcity in bond markets.",
        "Since the start of the year, with Bund yields falling steadily, OIS rates had fallen even more rapidly.",
        "In turn, this suggested that the recent fall in Bund yields by and large reflected a revision of the medium-term outlook for monetary policy, concerning both the level of the key policy rates and the uncertainty around them.",
        "The EONIA forward curve also showed that there had been a reassessment of the monetary policy outlook in the euro area.",
        "Since October 2018 the curve had flattened notably and, more recently, a significant shift had been observed since the Governing Council’s April 2019 monetary policy meeting.",
        "There had also been notable changes in the shape of the US Treasury yield curve.",
        "In recent weeks the curve had become inverted in the belly of the curve, consistent with expectations of a rate cut.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, global manufacturing and trade remained weak.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had decreased in May, pointing to some deceleration in global activity in the second quarter of 2019.",
        "Reflecting the weakness in manufacturing, global trade had remained subdued in the first quarter of 2019.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area in April had increased to 2.5%, from 2.3% in March, driven by an increase in core and energy price inflation.",
        "Annual CPI inflation excluding food and energy had stood at 2.2% in April, up from 2.1% in March.",
        "Oil prices had declined by 11% since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting and now hovered around USD 62.3 per barrel.",
        "Over the same horizon, food prices had declined by almost 4% and metal prices had decreased by 2.7%, while the euro was broadly unchanged against the US dollar but had appreciated somewhat in nominal effective terms.",
        "Turning to the euro area economy, real GDP growth had rebounded unexpectedly in the first quarter of 2019, with Eurostat’s second release putting the increase at 0.4% quarter on quarter.",
        "This rebound had been supported by some temporary factors, especially in the manufacturing sector.",
        "However, survey indicators pointed to weaker growth ahead.",
        "Turning to the components of domestic demand, real private consumption had posted strong quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.5%.",
        "This had in part been driven by a recovery in car purchases following the weakness in the fourth quarter of 2018 stemming from the introduction of the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), as well as by some normalisation in France following weakness caused by the “yellow vest” protests.",
        "Real residential investment had grown strongly in the first quarter of 2019, at 1.5% quarter on quarter, supported by mild weather conditions.",
        "Machinery and equipment investment had increased by 1.2%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2019, remaining relatively resilient in the face of the recent growth slowdown.",
        "The prolonged persistence of uncertainties posed, however, a downside risk to the outlook for business investment.",
        "Regarding labour market developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area employment had increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2019, a rate similar to those recorded in the previous two quarters.",
        "Moreover, the composite PMI on employment stood at 52.7 in May, pointing towards continued positive overall growth.",
        "The indicator had held up in services, but in manufacturing it had declined below the no-change threshold of 50 for the first time since August 2014.",
        "Extra and intra-euro area exports both showed initial signs of stabilisation.",
        "At the same time, leading indicators continued to signal weak trade developments ahead.",
        "These developments were also reflected in the June 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which projected annual real GDP growth at 1.2% in 2019 and 1.4% in the subsequent two years.",
        "While recent hard data for the first quarter of 2019 had turned out better than expected, the subsequent quarters had been revised down mainly on account of weaker global trade.",
        "Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation had decreased to 1.2% in May, from 1.7% in April, mainly due to lower energy and services price inflation.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food had decreased to 0.8% in May, from 1.3% in April.",
        "Looking through the Easter-related volatility, measures of underlying inflation remained muted.",
        "At the same time, according to the latest information, wage pressures had continued to build up.",
        "Annual growth in negotiated wages in the euro area had been 2.2% in the first quarter of 2019, unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2018.",
        "In the June 2019 Eurosystem staff projections, annual HICP inflation was expected to increase from 1.3% in 2019 to 1.4% in 2020 and 1.6% in 2021.",
        "Compared with the March 2019 ECB staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised up by 0.1 percentage points for 2019 and down by 0.1 percentage points for 2020, but remained unchanged for 2021.",
        "The inflation projections were in line with the forecasts of other institutions.",
        "Market-based inflation expectations had declined at all horizons since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting.",
        "Despite these measures being close to historic lows, there had been no meaningful increase in deflation risk in comparison with the situation in 2015 or 2016.",
        "At the same time, survey-based measures of longer-term expected inflation had remained stable.",
        "The longer-term expectation in the latest (March) Survey of Professional Forecasters stood at 1.8%, 0.1 percentage points below the survey result recorded over the period from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018.",
        "Moreover, other surveys of long-term inflation expectations, namely by Consensus Economics and the Euro Zone Barometer, remained broadly in line with the ECB’s inflation aim.",
        "Euro area financial conditions had tightened marginally, but had remained looser relative to the start of the year.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting, the slight tightening in euro area financial conditions could mainly be ascribed to heightened trade tensions, which had caused the euro to appreciate in nominal effective terms and equity prices to decline.",
        "The decline in equity markets had occurred despite an improvement in corporate earnings expectations.",
        "Meanwhile, the expected timing of an ECB policy rate “lift-off” had shifted out substantially, with some market-perceived chance of rate cuts.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, the annual growth rate of broad money (M3) had picked up in April, to 4.7% in year-on-year terms, thereby remaining rather resilient to the declining mechanical contribution of APP purchases.",
        "From a counterpart perspective, while private credit continued to be the main source of money creation, since July 2018 the decline in the contribution of the APP had been replaced by external monetary inflows and, to a lesser extent, by bank credit to general government.",
        "At the euro area level, the composite lending rates for non-financial corporations and for households for house purchase stood at 1.62% and 1.75% respectively, falling to new historical lows.",
        "Deposit rates remained stable at very low levels.",
        "As regards fiscal policy, after 0.5% in 2018, the euro area general government deficit ratio was projected to increase this year to 0.9% of GDP and to remain constant thereafter, despite falling interest payments.",
        "This reflected a mildly expansionary fiscal stance.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane remarked that, while the most recent hard data for first quarter economic activity were better than expected, in part due to temporary factors, weak global trade and the prolonged presence of uncertainties continued to be a drag on euro area growth developments.",
        "This was reflected in another downward revision of the growth outlook in the June 2019 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Bank lending conditions for firms and households remained very favourable, even if overall financial conditions had tightened marginally since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting, largely on account of the re-escalation of trade tensions.",
        "The balance of risks remained tilted to the downside, despite the downward revision to the growth projections, largely on account of persistent sources of uncertainty relating to the international environment.",
        "These uncertainties could weaken or delay the recovery in external demand beyond what was already reflected in the June projections and further weigh on investment and consumption.",
        "Trade tensions had re-escalated, uncertainty about Brexit was extended in time and fragilities in emerging market economies remained, despite signs of stabilisation in some of them.",
        "HICP inflation had decreased in May, mainly on account of temporary factors.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation had continued to move sideways, even if labour cost pressures had continued to strengthen and broaden as labour markets had tightened further.",
        "The June 2019 Eurosystem staff projections broadly confirmed the March outlook for inflation, which would reach only 1.6% in 2021, some distance below the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation expectations had further declined.",
        "Mr Lane therefore saw the need to update the monetary policy stance to provide the monetary accommodation necessary for inflation to remain on a sustained path towards levels that were below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Accordingly, he proposed the following adjustments: first, to extend the calendar element of the ECB’s forward guidance on the path of interest rates to “at least through the first half of 2020”; second, to confirm the forward guidance on reinvestment; and third, based on the assessment of the bank-based transmission channel of monetary policy and the developments in the economic outlook, to set the interest rate of the upcoming series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) equal to the average rate on the main refinancing operations (MRO) plus 10 basis points over the life of the respective operation, and as low as the average deposit facility rate plus 10 basis points for those banks whose eligible net lending exceeded a benchmark.",
        "This struck a reasonable balance between acknowledging the sound developments in bank lending and the importance of preserving the accommodative stance.",
        "These measures were appropriate in the current economic environment and would provide the necessary monetary accommodation for inflation to move towards levels that were below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Looking ahead, the Governing Council needed to be determined to act in case of adverse contingencies.",
        "It should stand ready to ease the monetary policy stance further by adjusting all of its instruments, as appropriate, to achieve the ECB’s price stability objective.",
        "Possible measures could include extending forward guidance further, restarting net asset purchases and decreasing policy rates.",
        "In addition, following on from what had been communicated in April 2019, the Governing Council could indicate that, at the current point in time, the positive contribution of negative interest rates to the accommodative monetary policy stance and to the sustained convergence of inflation was not undermined by possible side effects on bank-based intermediation.",
        "However, the Governing Council should continue to monitor carefully the bank-based transmission channel of monetary policy and the case for mitigating measures.",
        "Complementing Mr Lane’s remarks, Mr Cœuré pointed out that, in its communication of 7 March 2019, the ECB had specified that further details on the precise terms of TLTRO III would be communicated in due course.",
        "The Executive Board was now putting forward proposals on the remaining details of the TLTRO III programme, taking into account a thorough assessment of the bank-based transmission channel of monetary policy, as well as further developments in the economic outlook, but also considering the experience gained with TLTRO I and TLTRO II.",
        "A technical press release, to be published after the Governing Council meeting, would set out details regarding TLTRO III pricing, the definition of the lending benchmark and the performance target, the definition of TLTRO III groups, the borrowing allowance and reference periods, as well as the concentration limits to be applied to every TLTRO III operation.",
        "The Eurosystem would provide further communication to counterparties in due course.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Despite the somewhat better than expected data for the first quarter of 2019, the most recent information indicated that global headwinds continued to weigh on the euro area outlook.",
        "The prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, was leaving its mark on economic sentiment.",
        "At the same time, further employment gains and increasing wages continued to underpin the resilience of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation.",
        "This assessment was broadly reflected in the June 2019 Eurosystem staff projections, which foresaw annual real GDP increasing by 1.2% in 2019, 1.4% in 2020 and 1.4% in 2021.",
        "Compared with the March 2019 ECB staff projections, the outlook for real GDP growth had been revised up for 2019 and down for 2020 and 2021.",
        "Considering the outlook and risks for the external environment, members highlighted the ongoing weakness in global trade, and concern was expressed about more pervasive and prolonged uncertainties in the external environment and their adverse impact on the global growth outlook for some time to come.",
        "Persistent uncertainty and trade tensions were negatively affecting international production and supply chains, with likely repercussions on investment plans.",
        "Risks to the external environment were generally seen to be increasing or to have already increased, notably related to the deteriorating trade relationship between the United States and China, and to the continuing uncertainty regarding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU.",
        "It was underlined that markets appeared to see heightened trade conflicts as a proxy for a more fundamental shift in the multilateral world order.",
        "Against this background, the risks to the external environment were assessed to remain on the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, members noted that recent data had been mixed, with real GDP having risen by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2019, following an increase of 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018.",
        "However, further economic data and survey information pointed to somewhat weaker growth in the second and third quarters.",
        "This reflected ongoing weakness in international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainty, which was weighing in particular on the euro area manufacturing sector.",
        "At the same time, the euro area services and construction sectors were showing resilience and the labour market was continuing to improve.",
        "In this context, it was argued that, in recent economic indicators, a gap had opened between hard data, notably on employment and wages, which remained supportive of domestic demand, and some of the confidence indicators and market perceptions, which seemed to be more negative.",
        "Attention was drawn to an apparent dichotomy between economic projections and prevailing market perceptions of the outlook, as reflected in market prices, both globally and for the euro area.",
        "A view was expressed that markets might be prone to overreaction and overshooting, while economic projections tended to be somewhat sluggish in revising the outlook and subject to mean reversion.",
        "The point was made that financial markets tended to give greater weight to tail risks than the baseline.",
        "Discussing the June 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections in greater detail, members underlined that the baseline remained broadly consistent with the March 2019 ECB staff projections and that changes were not very substantial, especially with regard to inflation, compared with the downward revisions that had been observed in the March exercise.",
        "It was highlighted that domestic demand had so far been rather resilient, underpinned by strong employment and wage growth, favourable lending conditions and support from a very accommodative monetary policy stance and a mildly expansionary fiscal stance.",
        "Emphasis was placed on the staff projections for employment, which had been continuously revised up.",
        "It was also noted that the risk of recession was low.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the dispersion of growth rates across countries, which pointed to the observed “soft patch” in activity being mainly due to two of the larger euro area economies, which had sizeable export-oriented manufacturing sectors, while activity elsewhere appeared to be more robust.",
        "However, it was also cautioned that the manufacturing slowdown observed in these two economies might yet spread further, in view of integrated intra-European value chains.",
        "The balance of risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook was assessed by members to remain tilted to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.",
        "With respect to the outlook for fiscal policy, members noted that the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance was providing support to economic activity.",
        "It was recalled that, in order to reap the full benefits from the ECB’s monetary policy measures, other policy areas had to contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.2% in May 2019, after 1.7% in April, mainly reflecting lower energy and services price inflation.",
        "On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation was likely to decline over the coming months before rising again towards the end of the year.",
        "Looking through the recent volatility owing to temporary factors, measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, but labour cost pressures continued to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets.",
        "Looking ahead, underlying inflation was expected to increase over the medium term, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth.",
        "This assessment was also broadly reflected in the June 2019 Eurosystem staff projections, which foresaw annual HICP inflation at 1.3% in 2019, 1.4% in 2020 and 1.6% in 2021.",
        "Compared with the March 2019 ECB staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised up by 0.1 percentage points for 2019 and revised down by 0.1 percentage points for 2020.",
        "Confidence in the upward movement in the path of inflation was expressed, and it was underlined that the recent pronounced volatility in inflation data should be temporary and had, in significant measure, been due to the timing of public holidays and to methodological changes regarding seasonal adjustment in the euro area’s largest economy.",
        "Reference was made to the downward shift in the option-implied distribution of inflation expectations.",
        "The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had fallen back to levels near the previous lows recorded in September 2016.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that while technical factors might affect the information content of market-based measures of inflation expectations and while no such strong deterioration could be detected in other measures, notably surveys, there should be no room for complacency.",
        "With unit labour costs expected to decelerate somewhat over the projection horizon, as productivity gains outpaced wage growth, increasing profit margins were seen as the main factor behind rising inflation in the projections.",
        "However, it was argued that stronger profit margins might not materialise in an environment of decelerating domestic demand and in the presence of substantial cash buffers held by companies, which could be used to accommodate shocks in uncertain conditions.",
        "Hence the pass-through from wages to prices might not be observed for some time.",
        "However, it was also underlined that, while the limited pass-through from wages to prices remained a puzzle and there were uncertainties and lags in the relationship, the fundamental economic forces remained in place for inflation to pick up over time.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The sustained rates of broad money growth were seen to reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3.",
        "The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side.",
        "On the counterparts side, lending to the non-financial private sector had remained robust overall and continued to be supported by very favourable borrowing costs for firms and households across the euro area, which remained close to their historical lows.",
        "Members also broadly shared the assessment that, at current levels, the ECB’s negative interest rate policy continued to support loan growth and, ultimately, economic growth and inflation.",
        "The immediate costs of the negative interest rate policy arising from banks paying a negative rate on their excess reserves and deposit facility holdings were considered to be overall limited in size.",
        "So far, these costs were outweighed by the overall benefits from the generation of larger lending volumes and the reduction of risks and loan loss provisions due to the more favourable macroeconomic developments fostered by negative interest rates.",
        "The point was made that such findings warranted further analysis and that this assessment might not hold for lower policy rates or for horizons longer than those currently envisaged in the Governing Council’s forward guidance.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Overall, financial conditions had tightened marginally since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting, largely on account of the renewed escalation of trade tensions.",
        "At the same time, bank lending conditions for firms and households remained very favourable.",
        "While further employment gains and rising wages still underpinned the resilience of the domestic economy and gradually rising inflation pressures, an ample degree of monetary accommodation remained necessary to support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, headline inflation developments over the medium term.",
        "There was also broad agreement with the assessment that an update of the monetary policy stance was called for in the light of the prolongation of uncertainties and their implications for the inflation outlook.",
        "Confidence in the baseline projection and a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation continued to be warranted, but inflation was still projected to reach only 1.6% in 2021, which was seen to remain some distance away from the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "It was hence considered important for the Governing Council to demonstrate its determination to act, in line with its reaction function, by adjusting its monetary policy stance at the current meeting, and to further prepare for adverse contingencies in the period ahead.",
        "Against this background, members expressed broad agreement with the overall package of monetary policy proposals put forward by Mr Lane in his introduction: first, to adjust the calendar-based component of the Governing Council’s forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates to indicate that the Governing Council now expected rates to remain at their present levels “at least through the first half of 2020”; second, to reiterate the Governing Council’s forward guidance on reinvestment; and, third, based on the assessment of the bank-based transmission channel of monetary policy and the developments in the economic outlook, to set the interest rate on the forthcoming TLTRO III operations equal to the average MRO rate plus 10 basis points over the life of the respective operation, and as low as the average deposit facility rate plus 10 basis points for those banks whose eligible net lending exceeded a benchmark.",
        "At the same time, some nuances were expressed about individual elements of the policy package.",
        "Responding to the further weakening of the economic outlook and the muted inflation developments, in the context of prolonged uncertainties, the extension of the calendar element of the forward guidance on interest rates was widely seen as appropriate.",
        "The point was made that, if the calendar-based component was progressively aligned with market expectations in response to changes in the macroeconomic environment, the independent value of the calendar element could be seen to be diminished.",
        "The forward guidance on the interest rate path nonetheless remained the principal instrument for adjusting the monetary policy stance and had proved effective.",
        "Moreover, the extension of the calendar-based component by six months was seen to be in line with a gradual approach to adjusting policy, which would allow monitoring in the period ahead to see whether the observed prolonged “soft patch” proved to be persistent.",
        "In addition, it was underlined that the state-contingent element embodied a powerful automatic stabiliser, as indicated by the very substantial downward shift in the entire interest rate swap curve since the beginning of the year.",
        "With regard to the pricing of the TLTRO III operations, members widely supported the proposal made by Mr Lane and agreed with his assessment that this struck a reasonable balance between acknowledging the solid developments in bank lending and the importance of preserving the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "The pricing of a minimum rate at the deposit facility rate plus 10 basis points was widely seen as very favourable and maximising the policy effectiveness of the forthcoming operations.",
        "Some arguments were made in favour of a pricing more in line with that of TLTRO II.",
        "This was seen as making the contribution of TLTRO III to the monetary policy stance even stronger.",
        "At the same time, it was acknowledged that bank lending was, overall, much stronger now than had been the case when TLTRO II was announced.",
        "In the context of their regular assessment, members also broadly shared Mr Lane’s assessment in his introduction that, at the current point in time, the positive contribution of negative interest rates to the accommodative monetary policy stance and to the sustained convergence of inflation was not undermined by possible side effects on bank-based intermediation.",
        "At the same time, there was also broad agreement that the Governing Council should continue to monitor carefully the bank-based transmission channel and the case for mitigating measures.",
        "In this context, it was underlined that the possible side effects of a low interest rate environment would also need to be addressed by adequate macroprudential policies.",
        "A call was therefore made to strengthen the effectiveness of macroprudential frameworks and prudential tools to address possible financial stability risks arising from rates remaining at very low levels over a prolonged horizon.",
        "Against this background, the President ascertained that all members agreed with the overall package of monetary policy proposals put forward by Mr Lane in his introduction, which was seen as appropriate in the current economic environment to provide the monetary accommodation necessary for inflation to remain on a sustained path towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "At the same time, there was broad agreement that, in the light of the heightened uncertainty, which was likely to extend further into the future, the Governing Council needed to be ready and prepared to ease the monetary policy stance further by adjusting all of its instruments, as appropriate, to achieve its price stability objective.",
        "Potential measures to be considered included the possibility of further extending and strengthening the Governing Council’s forward guidance, resuming net asset purchases and decreasing policy rates.",
        "In this context, it was also noted that, should the environment of too low inflation continue to prevail, considerations of a more strategic nature might be warranted in order to reinforce the credibility of the ECB’s monetary policy and support the achievement of a sustained adjustment in inflation to its inflation aim.",
        "The point was made that the Governing Council’s communication should put more emphasis on the symmetry of its medium-term aim by clarifying that deviations of inflation from the Governing Council’s inflation aim would be tolerated in a symmetrical fashion, in both directions, as long as this supported the achievement of the Governing Council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner over the medium term.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that care needed to be taken to ensure that any considerations of a strategic nature could not be seen as moving the goalposts at a time when it proved challenging to achieve the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40%, respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "The Governing Council intended to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Regarding the modalities of the new series of quarterly TLTROs, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate in each operation would be set at a level that is 10 basis points above the average rate applied in the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations over the life of the respective TLTRO.",
        "For banks whose eligible net lending were to exceed a benchmark, the rate applied in TLTRO III would be lower and could be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation plus 10 basis points.",
        "Further modalities would be set out in a technical press release to be published at the end of the press conference.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 24-25 October 2018, there were growing signs that investors were becoming more concerned about the global growth outlook, reflecting both the weakness in recent economic data in many jurisdictions and continuing geopolitical tensions.",
        "These concerns had added to market volatility and likely contributed to a marked drop in global stock prices.",
        "Corporate bond spreads, both in the United States and in the euro area, had widened too, in particular for bonds with lower credit quality.",
        "In euro area government bond markets, yields on bonds of the highest credit quality had declined to levels seen early in 2018, reflecting both a demand for safety and a fall in inflation expectations.",
        "Part of the fall in inflation expectations likely echoed a measurable drop in oil prices in recent weeks, which were down by 30% on early October.",
        "A model-based decomposition of oil price movements indicated that factors of both supply and demand had likely contributed to the decline in oil prices.",
        "Euro area sovereign bond spreads had eased somewhat from recent highs.",
        "However, yield spreads between the ten-year Italian government bond and its German equivalent remained at elevated levels of slightly below 300 basis points.",
        "Contagion from Italy to other euro area sovereign bond markets remained contained.",
        "Turning to euro area equity markets, two broad factors were seen to have accounted for the recent correction: a rise in the equity risk premium, which was consistent with the growing demand for safe-haven assets in global bond markets, and a downward revision in earnings expectations.",
        "In the United States, by contrast, earnings expectations were seen to have continued to push stock prices higher, while the increase in the equity risk premium had pulled US stocks lower.",
        "Finally, with regard to monetary policy expectations in the euro area, both survey results and market-based evidence were signalling a push-back in the expectations for the timing of a first rise in key ECB interest rates and in the subsequent expected future path of short-term interest rates.",
        "At longer tenors, market pricing had exhibited a more pronounced adjustment, which could have also reflected changes in risk premia.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, global growth momentum was moderating and global trade growth stabilising.",
        "Global survey indicators pointed to a deceleration in economic activity in the second half of 2018.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had increased somewhat in November, but overall still pointed to a weakening of growth relative to the first half of 2018.",
        "The latest indicators on trade gave mixed signals while pointing overall towards broad stabilisation.",
        "The volume of goods imports had increased in September.",
        "However, the global PMI for new export orders in the manufacturing sector remained slightly below 50 in November.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area had picked up in October.",
        "Excluding energy and food, inflation had remained largely stable.",
        "Wage dynamics appeared to have gained momentum since the turn of 2017-18, with annual growth in compensation per employee reaching 2.9% in the third quarter of 2018.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had declined markedly since the 24-25 October meeting, as oil production had increased and growth in oil demand was expected to slow.",
        "Over the same period, aggregate non-oil commodity prices had decreased by 3%, while the euro exchange rate was broadly unchanged both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms.",
        "Turning to the euro area, growth in economic activity had slowed further on account of weaker external demand and also sector and country-specific factors.",
        "Eurostat’s second release had put euro area real GDP growth in the third quarter of 2018 at 0.2% in quarter-on-quarter terms, down from 0.4% in each of the previous two quarters.",
        "Data that had become available since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting had been weaker than expected.",
        "At the same time, the fundamental factors supporting the economic expansion remained in place.",
        "In the medium term, private consumption was expected to remain resilient, reflecting mainly continued growth in compensation of employees, which – over time – was expected to be driven more by growth in compensation per employee and less by employment growth.",
        "Business investment was expected to continue growing at a solid pace, supported by favourable earnings expectations, resilient domestic demand and favourable financing conditions.",
        "However, the ongoing uncertainty surrounding global trade and tariffs was likely to be a factor weighing on business investment.",
        "This assessment was broadly reflected in the December 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area.",
        "These projections foresaw annual real GDP increasing by 1.9% in 2018, 1.7% in 2019, 1.7% in 2020 and 1.5% in 2021.",
        "Compared with the September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth had been revised slightly down for 2018 and 2019.",
        "Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation had declined to 2.0% in November 2018, from 2.2% in October, reflecting mainly a decline in energy inflation.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food was also lower, edging down to 1.0% in November from 1.1% in October, owing to a slowing in the services component.",
        "Meanwhile, a broader range of underlying inflation measures had continued to move sideways.",
        "Incoming data pointed to building wage pressures, which were expected to support an upward adjustment in underlying inflation.",
        "Annual growth in compensation per employee was 2.5% in the third quarter of 2018, up from 2.2% in the second quarter.",
        "The increase had continued to be broad-based, both across sectors and across countries.",
        "According to the December Eurosystem staff projections, HICP inflation was projected to decrease from 1.8% in 2018 to 1.6% in 2019, before gradually increasing to 1.7% in 2020 and 1.8% in 2021.",
        "This drawn-out V‑shaped pattern reflected two offsetting trends over time: a decline in the annual rate of growth of the energy component, as the impact of past increases in oil prices faded, and gradually rising underlying inflation, on account of an increasingly positive output gap in the context of rising supply constraints and tightening labour markets.",
        "Compared with the September 2018 ECB staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised up by 0.1 percentage point for 2018 and down by 0.1 percentage point for 2019, while it remained unchanged for 2020.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation expectations had fallen somewhat since the 24-25 October monetary policy meeting, mostly in response to the steep decline in the price of oil.",
        "The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead stood at 1.6%, slightly lower than the level prevailing at the time of the October meeting.",
        "Financial conditions continued to be accommodative, amid heightened market volatility.",
        "Meanwhile, the expected timing of “lift-off” in key ECB interest rates had shifted out to around the end of 2019.",
        "Euro area equity markets had declined due to lower earnings growth expectations and a higher equity risk premium.",
        "At the same time, the overall cost of financing for euro area firms had remained very favourable.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, the annual growth rate of broad money (M3) had continued on its slightly decelerating path, although the latest reading for October showed a rebound to 3.9%.",
        "Domestic sources of money creation had remained the main driver of M3 growth.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector had been broadly stable in October, standing at 3.3%, after 3.4% in September.",
        "At the euro area level, lending rates had remained very favourable and close to their historical lows.",
        "Euro area banks’ composite funding costs had remained accommodative, despite some limited increase in the yields on bank bonds.",
        "As regards fiscal policy, the euro area general government deficit ratio was projected to increase over the period 2019-21, on account of a loosening fiscal stance – measured as the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance – in both 2019 and 2020.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet observed that financial conditions had remained accommodative, in the context of heightened market volatility.",
        "Overall the ECB’s monetary policy had contributed to dampening the impact of prevailing uncertainties on financial conditions.",
        "Credit conditions for households and firms had remained very supportive.",
        "Incoming data on growth had been weaker than expected, reflecting softer external demand but also some country and sector-specific factors.",
        "While some of these factors were likely to unwind, the latest data could indicate a moderation in the growth momentum.",
        "At the same time, the fundamentals underpinning the euro area economic expansion remained in place.",
        "This was also consistent with the December 2018 Eurosystem staff projections, which pointed to a continued expansion at a pace closer to potential.",
        "The risks surrounding the growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced.",
        "However, the balance of risks was moving to the downside, owing to the persistent prominence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, but domestic cost pressures were continuing to strengthen amid high levels of capacity utilisation, tightening labour markets and rising wages.",
        "The December Eurosystem staff projections broadly confirmed the inflation outlook foreseen in both the June and September projection exercises.",
        "This overall assessment continued to support confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% would proceed and be maintained even after the end of net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP).",
        "At the same time, continued inflation convergence still required an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "On the basis of these considerations, Mr Praet proposed: (a) concluding APP net asset purchases at the end of December 2018, (b) keeping the ECB forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates unchanged, and (c) specifying the guidance on reinvestments by expressing the Governing Council’s intention to continue to reinvest, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when the Governing Council started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Linking the reinvestment horizon to the interest rate “lift-off” signalled that the forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates was the Governing Council’s primary tool for adjusting the monetary policy stance.",
        "This “chained guidance” would strengthen the impact of rate guidance on financial conditions because market expectations for the reinvestment horizon would evolve in line with expectations for the date of a first interest rate rise.",
        "It was furthermore important for communication to: (a) stress that the incoming information had been weaker than expected, but that the underlying strength of domestic demand continued to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures; (b) acknowledge that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced, but that the balance of risks was moving to the downside owing to the persistent prominence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility; (c) underline the Governing Council’s confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to its aim would continue in the period ahead, and would be maintained even after the end of net asset purchases under the APP; (d) reiterate that the forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets, continued to provide the necessary degree of monetary accommodation for the sustained convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim; (e) reconfirm that the Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term; and (f) announce that the Governing Council intended to reinvest, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Turning to monetary policy implementation issues, Mr Cœuré recalled that, even though the key principles guiding the net asset purchase phase would also prevail during the reinvestment phase, some technical adjustments were required to the way the Eurosystem would conduct its reinvestments.",
        "The first main element related to the operational target.",
        "During the reinvestment phase, the cumulative net asset purchases made under all four constituent APP programmes would be maintained at their end-December 2018 levels.",
        "Limited temporary deviations in the overall size and composition of the APP might occur for operational reasons.",
        "Within the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), the aim was also to keep the respective shares in the stock of purchases for EU supranational bonds, on the one hand, and for government and agency bonds, on the other hand, at their end-December 2018 levels.",
        "The second main element related to the allocation of reinvestments under the PSPP across jurisdictions.",
        "This would continue to be guided, on a stock basis, by the respective national central banks’ subscription to the ECB capital key, as amended over time.",
        "As a rule, therefore, redemptions would be reinvested in the jurisdiction in which principal repayments were made, but the portfolio allocation across jurisdictions would continue to be adjusted with a view to bringing the share of the PSPP portfolio into closer alignment with the respective national central banks’ subscriptions to the ECB capital key.",
        "Any adjustment to the portfolio allocation across jurisdictions would be gradual and would be calibrated as appropriate to safeguard orderly market conditions.",
        "During the reinvestment phase the Eurosystem would continue to adhere to the principle of market neutrality via smooth and flexible implementation.",
        "To this end, the reinvestment of principal redemptions would be distributed over the year to allow for a regular and balanced market presence.",
        "Within the PSPP, purchases of securities with a yield to maturity below the interest rate on the ECB’s deposit facility would continue to be undertaken to the extent necessary.",
        "The third main element related to the reinvestment modalities for the private sector programmes.",
        "Market capitalisation would continue to be the guiding principle for reinvestment purchases under these programmes, while an adequate degree of flexibility in implementation would be needed for a smooth implementation.",
        "Purchases of securities in primary markets would continue to be permitted as necessary.",
        "Finally, Mr Cœuré recalled that, at the start of the reinvestment phase, all covered bonds with a conditional pass-through structure would be excluded from further purchases under the third covered bond purchase programme.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction, and they discussed the balance of risks.",
        "Incoming data on growth had been weaker than expected, reflecting softer external demand but also some country and sector-specific factors.",
        "While some of these factors were likely to unwind, the latest data could indicate a moderation in the growth momentum.",
        "At the same time, the fundamental factors underpinning the euro area economic expansion remained in place.",
        "This outlook was broadly reflected in the December 2018 Eurosystem staff projections, which entailed a slight downward revision for real GDP growth in 2018 and 2019 compared with the September 2018 ECB staff projections and a gradual slowing of real GDP growth over the horizon, from 1.9% in 2018 to 1.5% in 2021, following downward revisions in the March and June exercises.",
        "In this context, it was underlined that, notwithstanding weaker data, the baseline could still be considered valid and that the economy was still expected to grow at a pace close to potential.",
        "The factors underpinning economic activity were reflected in developments in the main demand components.",
        "Ongoing employment gains and rising wages continued to support private consumption.",
        "Favourable financing conditions and improving balance sheets underpinned business investment, and residential investment remained robust.",
        "In addition, the expansion in global activity was still expected to continue, although at a slower pace, and thus to support euro area exports.",
        "The latest data, including the decline in real GDP growth from 0.4% to 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter, had been weaker than expected.",
        "While some of the country and sector-specific factors behind this slowdown were likely to unwind, the point was made that a number of indicators had, of late, declined substantially compared with their levels in 2017, conveying the picture of a slowing economy.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that 2017 had been a very positive year with upside surprises.",
        "The issue of whether the country and sector-specific factors in the recent weakening of growth would be transitory or longer-lasting had already been discussed at the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting and continued to warrant attention.",
        "Reference was again made to the impact of new emissions testing standards on car production and registration in the largest euro area economy.",
        "Members discussed in greater detail the risks to the euro area growth outlook.",
        "Uncertainties and risks related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial volatility had remained prominent.",
        "It was widely considered that uncertainty persisted or had increased, with risks to activity moving to the downside.",
        "It was also argued that, even though certain downside risks – regarding trade tensions, emerging markets, US monetary policy and developments in sovereign bond markets in the euro area – had receded, the continually changing nature of risks would sustain – or even increase – general uncertainty.",
        "In this context, it was underlined that the situation remained fragile and fluid, as risks could quickly regain prominence or new uncertainties could emerge.",
        "The situation in emerging markets was cited as an example, with vulnerability related to some countries becoming less of a concern (notably with Turkey and Argentina stabilising), while vulnerability related to others was already looming.",
        "Other examples were the frequently changing state of discussion on trade issues and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.",
        "Against this background, it was argued that the current environment could be described as one of “risk rotation” in a state of generally heightened uncertainty.",
        "As regards the balance of risks, on the one hand, the view was expressed that a case could be made for assessing risks to activity as tilted to the downside.",
        "Prevailing uncertainty appeared to have affected confidence, although the latter was coming down from high levels.",
        "Reference was made to a recent deterioration in business confidence, with PMI survey data related to production and exports again disappointing.",
        "This was seen as affecting business investment and cautioned against being complacent about downside risks to growth.",
        "Regarding the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, it was noted that there had now been three successive downward revisions to the short-term euro area baseline growth outlook over the past half-year.",
        "The latest revisions essentially reflected the incorporation of new data regarding the short term but had no bearing on the growth path for the remainder of the projection horizon.",
        "Therefore, it was argued that, unless all shocks affecting the latest figures were considered to be of a purely temporary nature, this should have moved the balance of risks to the downside.",
        "On the other hand it was argued that, while there had recently been somewhat more negative news than positive news, this had been incorporated in the downward revision to the baseline Eurosystem staff projection, such that the balance of risks pertaining to this new projection could be maintained as fairly balanced.",
        "It was also remarked that the assessment of still balanced risks to growth was supported by the emergence of new upside risks, namely a further decline in oil prices since the cut-off date for the projections and the likelihood of more stimulus coming from fiscal measures.",
        "Against this background, caution was expressed against moving the balance of risks to the downside.",
        "All in all, members concurred with the view that the risks to the euro area outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced, but that the balance of risks was moving to the downside owing to the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial volatility.",
        "This assessment struck the necessary balance between confidence in the medium-term outlook and acknowledgment of the recent weakness in data and indicators.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation had declined to 2.0% in November from 2.2% in October, reflecting mainly a decline in energy price inflation.",
        "On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation was likely to decrease over the coming months.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, but domestic cost pressures were continuing to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, which were pushing up wage growth.",
        "Looking ahead, underlying inflation was expected to increase over the medium term, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth.",
        "This assessment was also broadly reflected in the December 2018 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Compared with the September 2018 ECB staff projections, the outlook for inflation had been revised slightly up for 2018 and down for 2019.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food was projected to increase from 1.0% in 2018 to 1.8% in 2021.",
        "Compared with the September 2018 ECB staff projections, this implied a small downward revision of around 0.1 percentage point for each of the years between 2018 and 2020.",
        "As regards risks to the inflation outlook, it was observed that the link between possible downside risks to the outlook for growth and corresponding risks for the outlook for inflation generally depended on the nature of shocks.",
        "A major downside risk to the inflation projections – but a probable upside risk to growth – related to oil prices, which were presently lower than they had been when the projections were finalised.",
        "However, it was argued that changes in oil prices could normally be expected to imply a risk mainly to the shorter-term outlook that diminished over the relevant medium-term policy horizon, while it was also remarked that geopolitical tensions could make the drop in oil prices more protracted.",
        "Some reassurance regarding the outlook for underlying inflation was drawn from recent developments in wage growth.",
        "Growth in compensation per employee in the euro area as a whole had been 2.5% in the third quarter of 2018, continuing a steady increase seen since 2016.",
        "The pick-up in wage growth had also become broader-based across different euro area countries and sectors of the economy.",
        "Reference was made to the fact that wage developments were fairly dynamic in a number of euro area countries from a historical perspective.",
        "Members widely shared the view that the pass-through of wages to prices, in particular in the services sector, was a key factor underpinning confidence in the outlook for underlying inflation.",
        "It was argued that the extent of the pass-through depended on the source of the shocks that were driving rising wage growth.",
        "Evidence suggested that the pass-through could be expected to be stronger if the source was a demand shock, but more moderate in the case of other shocks.",
        "The transmission of higher wages to consumer price inflation was subject to time lags, and it appeared that more time and patience were needed.",
        "The argument was reiterated that the pass-through should eventually occur, as rising wage growth with unchanged price inflation implied a squeeze in profit margins and mark-ups that could not continue indefinitely.",
        "With regard to inflation expectations, market-based measures of longer-term expectations had fallen somewhat from their levels at the time of the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "It was remarked that this could be due to the recent fall in oil prices since, as also observed elsewhere, there appeared to be a correlation between these two variables when oil prices were declining that was not observed symmetrically when oil prices were increasing.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that the risk of negative inflation rates and deflation had long faded.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, the Governing Council reiterated the need for rebuilding fiscal buffers.",
        "This was particularly important in countries where government debt was high and for which full adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact was critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The annual growth rate of M3 had rebounded somewhat in October.",
        "The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth.",
        "The gradual shift in the driver of the growth momentum of M3, from the APP to a rising contribution from a sustained pick-up in private-sector credit, had continued.",
        "The gradual recovery in the growth of MFI loans to the private sector, which had been observed since the beginning of 2014, was still proceeding.",
        "Credit creation was seen to enjoy continued support from the overall improvement in banks’ balance sheets, which was also evidenced by the continued decline in the level of non-performing loans.",
        "Reference was made to the latest survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE).",
        "According to the survey results, small and medium-sized enterprises had continued to assess the availability of bank credit between April and September 2018 as ample.",
        "Euro area bank lending rates to households and non-financial corporations had remained very attractive and close to their historical lows.",
        "In this respect, reference was made to developments in one euro area jurisdiction, where sovereign bond yields remained at elevated levels.",
        "While lending rates had so far not increased to the same extent, if financial volatility continued, some upward pressure on bank lending rates could be expected in that jurisdiction over time.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "While incoming information had been weaker than expected, the underlying strength of domestic demand continued to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures.",
        "This was seen to still support confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim would proceed and be maintained even after the end of the net asset purchases.",
        "At the same time, significant monetary policy stimulus was still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term.",
        "Increased caution was warranted in the light of the persistent uncertainties – related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility – which had remained prominent.",
        "Monetary policy needed to remain prudent, patient and persistent and to continue to be data-driven in the period ahead.",
        "There was broad agreement that financial conditions remained accommodative and that credit conditions for households and firms were still very supportive.",
        "In this respect, the Governing Council’s forward guidance had contributed to dampening the impact of prevailing uncertainties on financial conditions.",
        "Both the expected time period before a first increase in the key ECB interest rates and the expected reinvestment horizon had increased in response to the recent weaker than expected data.",
        "This appeared to be in line with the state-contingent elements of the Governing Council’s forward guidance on both of these instruments and contributed to preserving the financial conditions necessary for sustained inflation convergence.",
        "Against this background, all members agreed with the overall package of monetary policy proposals made by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "This involved concluding net asset purchases under the APP at the end of December, keeping the forward guidance on the path of the key ECB interest rates unchanged, and enhancing the forward guidance on reinvestment.",
        "Accordingly, the Governing Council would state its intention to reinvest, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities for an extended period of time past the date of a first rise in interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "There was broad agreement among members that the overall monetary policy stance remained highly expansionary and would remain so even after net asset purchases ceased at the end of 2018.",
        "While the APP was transitioning into a phase of zero net asset purchases, the Eurosystem would continue to make purchases under the programme, in line with the Governing Council’s enhanced forward guidance on reinvestments.",
        "Owing to the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the reinvestment of maturing principal, as well as the Governing Council’s forward guidance on interest rates, ample monetary policy accommodation remained in place.",
        "The enhanced forward guidance on reinvestments would adequately convey the Governing Council’s intention to continue to fully reinvest maturing principal repayments over an extended period of time past the date of a first rise in the key ECB interest rates.",
        "There was broad agreement among members that expressing the time dimension of the reinvestment guidance in terms of an “extended period past the date when the Governing Council starts raising the key ECB interest rates” struck an appropriate balance between giving additional guidance on reinvestments and maintaining flexibility and optionality for the period ahead.",
        "Furthermore, linking the reinvestment horizon to the interest rate “lift-off” was seen as signalling that the Governing Council’s policy rate guidance was the primary tool for adjusting the monetary policy stance in the period ahead.",
        "Moreover, the “chained guidance” would reinforce the impact of the Governing Council’s interest rate guidance on financial conditions, by ensuring that market expectations for the reinvestment horizon would evolve in line with expectations for the date of the “lift-off”.",
        "As a result, term premium effects implied by reinvestments – operating primarily at the long end of the yield curve – would be consistent with changes in expectations regarding short-term interest rates.",
        "Members underlined that specifying the forward guidance on the Governing Council’s policy instruments in terms of both a time-based and a state-contingent leg had served it well.",
        "Hence, there was broad agreement that the state-contingent leg of the reinvestment guidance should be maintained.",
        "Accordingly, the Governing Council should continue to reinvest, in full, maturing principal payments “in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of accommodation”.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that liquidity conditions also depended on liquidity provision in credit operations, the fixed-rate full allotment policy and other factors.",
        "Concerning the composition of the APP, there was broad agreement that all its constituent programmes should remain active during the reinvestment phase.",
        "Moreover, their relative shares would be maintained at the levels prevailing at the end of the net purchase phase.",
        "Regarding the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP), a remark was made that the liquidity position of firms was comfortable and that the financial risks associated with the CSPP were somewhat more pronounced than those of the other programmes.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that the risk management framework in place had proven effective.",
        "Moreover, corporate bonds were inherently risky and it was recalled that the monetary policy objective of corporate bond purchases was paramount.",
        "As regards the technical parameters for the reinvestment phase, the overall approach adopted was widely seen as being finely balanced and all members supported the proposals set out by Mr Cœuré in his introduction.",
        "Accordingly, for the PSPP, the allocation across eligible jurisdictions would continue to be guided, on a stock basis, by the respective national central banks’ subscription to the ECB capital key, as amended over time.",
        "As a rule, therefore, redemptions would be reinvested in the jurisdiction in which principal repayments were made, but the portfolio allocation across jurisdictions would continue to be adjusted with a view to bringing the share of the PSPP portfolio into closer alignment with the respective national central banks’ subscription to the ECB capital key.",
        "Furthermore, it was emphasised that any adjustment to the portfolio allocation across jurisdictions would be gradual and calibrated as appropriate to safeguard orderly market conditions.",
        "Looking ahead, the suggestion was made to revisit the contribution of targeted longer-term refinancing operations to the monetary policy stance.",
        "On communication, members widely concurred with the elements proposed by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Accordingly, it was seen as appropriate to acknowledge that the incoming information had been weaker than expected but, at the same time, to stress that the underlying strength of domestic demand continued to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures.",
        "It was important to underline that the Governing Council continued to be confident that the sustained convergence of inflation towards its aim would continue in the period ahead and would be maintained even after the end of the net asset purchases.",
        "At the same time, it was deemed appropriate to convey that this confidence was accompanied by increased caution.",
        "While the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced, the balance of risks was moving to the downside.",
        "It was seen as important to highlight that, while the APP was transitioning into a phase of zero net asset purchases, the forthcoming reinvestments meant that asset purchases under the APP would continue, in line with the Governing Council’s enhanced forward guidance.",
        "It was hence seen as vital for communication to reiterate that the Governing Council’s forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets, would continue to provide the necessary degree of monetary accommodation for the sustained convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "In this respect, communication should confirm that the Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, and should specify that the Governing Council intended to continue to reinvest, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date of a first increase in the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Finally, it was considered prudent to restate the Governing Council’s readiness to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continued to move towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the net purchases under the APP would end in December 2018.",
        "At the same time, the Governing Council was enhancing its forward guidance on reinvestment.",
        "Accordingly, the Governing Council intended to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date of a first rise in the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "As regards the technical parameters for the APP reinvestment phase, the Governing Council adopted the decisions as proposed, which would be communicated in a technical press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "In the first few weeks of 2019 volatility had remained elevated across different market segments, in particular in equity and commodity markets.",
        "Brent oil prices had declined further after the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 12-13 December 2018 but had since recovered.",
        "The volatility in oil prices was evidence of the heightened geopolitical uncertainty and its impact on oil supply, as well as concerns about the global growth outlook and its impact on oil demand.",
        "Volatility had also increased recently in some foreign exchange markets.",
        "In particular, following the rejection by the British Parliament of the EU Withdrawal Agreement, the pound sterling had appreciated markedly against both the euro and the US dollar.",
        "By contrast, volatility in emerging market currencies had come down from the elevated levels observed in 2018.",
        "As regards global bond market developments, yields had fallen measurably.",
        "Since the beginning of October 2018 the yields on ten-year US Treasuries had fallen from around 3.2% to 2.75%, while ten-year German government bond yields had fallen from around 0.60% to around 0.25%.",
        "The spread between the two had thus narrowed, returning to the levels that had been observed over most of the summer of 2018.",
        "A decomposition of euro area and US ten-year overnight index swap rates into the inflation and the real components suggested that two countervailing factors had been driving yields over this period on both sides of the Atlantic.",
        "First, the rise in real yields that had emerged in late summer had persisted and likely reflected a rise in the real term premium.",
        "Second, there had been a fall in the inflation component, which had offset the impact from the rise in real yields.",
        "A comparison between survey and market-based expectations for long-term inflation suggested that the fall in the inflation component may have predominantly reflected a fall in the inflation risk premium.",
        "It would hence be premature to conclude that market participants had materially reappraised their medium-term inflation expectations.",
        "Spreads of higher-yielding euro area sovereign bonds versus German bonds had broadly stabilised in recent weeks.",
        "Ten-year sovereign bond spreads for Italy, Spain and Portugal against Germany had either been stable or had fallen since early October 2018.",
        "For the euro area, the forward money market curve was notably flatter than in October 2018, suggesting that expectations of a first ECB deposit facility rate increase had shifted from September 2019 to April 2020.",
        "Revisions to survey expectations had been more moderate and saw this occurring in the fourth quarter of 2019.",
        "Looking at equities, overall valuation losses in the euro area were of the same order as in the United States, amounting to some 8-9% since early October 2018.",
        "A model-based analysis showed that euro area equity price movements had also reflected lower earnings expectations, whereas in the United States they had, by and large, been due to an increase in the equity risk premium.",
        "Global corporate bond markets had experienced some broad-based repricing.",
        "Spreads of US high-yield bonds had increased by around 120 basis points since early October 2018.",
        "In the euro area, the repricing had been less pronounced, but spreads of high-yield bonds had nevertheless risen by around 90 basis points.",
        "Spreads of euro area investment-grade corporate bonds had also increased measurably over this period.",
        "Finally, turning to year-end developments in the euro area repo market, more orderly conditions had been observed than in previous years.",
        "The smooth year-end had likely reflected better preparations by market participants.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, the global growth and trade momentum was slowing further.",
        "In particular, the global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had decreased in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with the third quarter, on the back of a weaker manufacturing sector component, while the services sector component had remained broadly unchanged.",
        "Trade indicators had also weakened towards the end of 2018, possibly reflecting growth headwinds as well as elevated policy uncertainty regarding US-China trade relations.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area had slowed to 2.7% in November, largely driven by lower energy price inflation.",
        "Inflation excluding food and energy had decreased marginally, to 2.2%.",
        "At the same time, wage dynamics had showed some stabilisation, with compensation per employee growing at a rate close to 3% in the first three quarters of 2018.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had increased by around 3% since the December monetary policy meeting.",
        "Over the same period, food prices had increased by 4%, while metal prices had declined by 2%.",
        "The euro exchange rate had remained broadly stable, both in nominal effective terms and in bilateral terms against the US dollar.",
        "Turning to the euro area, incoming data had generally surprised on the downside and the near-term growth momentum would likely be weaker than previously anticipated.",
        "The headline manufacturing PMI for the euro area for December had stood at 51.1, down from 52.7 in November.",
        "The latest PMI survey data had pointed to a further slowing of the growth momentum, in particular in more cyclically sensitive industries, such as capital and intermediate goods.",
        "At the same time, domestic demand was being supported by favourable financing conditions and labour market dynamics, rising wages and lower energy prices.",
        "In particular, private consumption could be expected to remain resilient.",
        "Employment had increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2018, down from 0.4% in the previous two quarters.",
        "The unemployment rate had fallen further in November to 7.9%, thereby reaching its lowest level since October 2008.",
        "Survey indicators had signalled weaker but still positive employment growth in the coming quarters.",
        "In particular, the PMI employment indicator had weakened notably since the summer, but remained in expansionary territory, standing at 53.4 in December.",
        "Extra-euro area exports were expected to remain subdued on account of weakening foreign demand growth.",
        "Growth in euro area goods exports had declined in the third quarter of 2018, by 0.4% in quarter-on-quarter terms.",
        "The decline in the third quarter could be attributed to a drop in capital goods exports, and in particular in motor vehicles.",
        "The latest trade data for October and November, together with the latest survey indicators with leading properties, consistently pointed to a further deterioration in the euro area trade outlook in the fourth quarter of 2018.",
        "Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation had stood at 1.6% in December, down from 1.9% in November, while HICP inflation excluding food and energy had remained unchanged at 1.0%.",
        "The decrease in HICP inflation had mainly reflected lower energy price inflation.",
        "Overall, the December data had turned out weaker than expected, driven by energy and services price inflation.",
        "Meanwhile, measures of underlying inflation had continued to move sideways.",
        "Domestic cost pressures had increased, but had yet to translate into consumer price inflation.",
        "Along the supply chain, import and producer price inflation for both goods and services were rising.",
        "The upward cost pressure stemming from labour costs had intensified in the third quarter of 2018, with unit labour cost growth increasing to 2.2%, from 1.6% in the second quarter.",
        "The results from the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the first quarter of 2019 had pointed to average inflation expectations of 1.5% for 2019, 1.6% for 2020 and 1.7% for 2021.",
        "Compared with the previous survey for the fourth quarter of 2018, this represented downward revisions of 0.2 percentage point for 2019 and 0.1 percentage point for 2020.",
        "This implied a weaker profile than in the December 2018 Eurosystem staff projections, which could largely be accounted for by different oil price assumptions.",
        "Market-based inflation expectations had also been revised down somewhat, with the five-year forward break-even inflation rate five years ahead standing at 1.54%.",
        "Financial conditions had tightened somewhat in recent months in the context of heightened market volatility, while being broadly unchanged compared with the December meeting.",
        "Overall, credit conditions remained favourable.",
        "Compared with the situation at the time of the December meeting, euro area non-financial equities had rebounded somewhat, although earnings expectations had been revised down.",
        "The expected timing of a first ECB policy rate increase had shifted out further.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, broad money (M3) growth had moderated slightly further to 3.7% in November.",
        "Money creation was increasingly driven by credit to the private sector.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector had stabilised in recent months, standing at 3.3% in November 2018, after strengthening since early 2014.",
        "At the same time, euro area banks’ composite funding costs had been increasing somewhat in recent months, mainly owing to increases in bank bond yields, and bank equity prices had declined.",
        "Meanwhile, bank lending rates remained favourable, standing only marginally above their historical lows.",
        "As regards fiscal policy, the euro area fiscal stance – as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance – was expected to be mildly expansionary in 2019 and 2020.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet remarked that financial conditions had tightened somewhat in recent months in a context of heightened market volatility, but remained supportive.",
        "The ECB’s monetary policy had contributed to dampening the impact of prevailing uncertainties on financial conditions.",
        "Credit conditions for households and firms remained accommodative.",
        "Incoming data on growth had continued to be weaker than expected on account of softer external demand and country and sector-specific factors, with the near-term growth momentum likely to be weaker than previously anticipated.",
        "The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook had moved to the downside, as the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility was increasingly weighing on economic sentiment.",
        "HICP inflation had fallen in December, reflecting mainly lower energy price inflation, and was likely to decline further over the coming months.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation remained muted, but labour cost pressures were continuing to strengthen and were expected to pass through to underlying inflation in the period ahead.",
        "While the ongoing economic expansion continued to support confidence in the convergence of inflation to the ECB’s inflation aim, recent developments called for thorough analysis as regards their implications for the medium-term outlook.",
        "Against this background, Mr Praet proposed at this stage to confirm the Governing Council’s enhanced forward guidance, which – especially under the current circumstances – had contributed to more supportive market interest rates.",
        "External communication should: (a) stress that incoming information had continued to be weaker than expected, signalling a slower near-term growth momentum; (b) acknowledge that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook had moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility; (c) underline that the ongoing euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures continued to support confidence in the sustained convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim; (d) emphasise that significant monetary policy stimulus remained essential to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term, and that this stimulus would be provided by the Governing Council’s forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets; (e) reiterate that, in any event, the Governing Council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continued to move towards its aim in a sustained manner.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction, and they discussed the balance of risks.",
        "Recent data and survey results had continued to be weaker than expected, on account of softer external demand and some country and sector-specific factors affecting domestic activity.",
        "While the impact of some of these factors was expected to fade, incoming data suggested that the near-term growth momentum was likely to be weaker than previously anticipated.",
        "However, no clear-cut conclusions could be drawn regarding the implications of slower growth in the short term for the outlook for activity in the medium term, in the light of significant uncertainty about whether the country and sector-specific factors would be transitory or longer-lasting.",
        "In this context, it was underlined that the outlook for activity would be reassessed in more depth by the Governing Council at its meeting in early March, when the new ECB staff projections would be available.",
        "In considering the outlook and risks for the external environment, members noted that global growth and trade momentum had slowed further.",
        "In particular, there were concerns among members about an increasing impact of trade protectionism, and an escalation of trade conflicts, on the global outlook over time.",
        "It was noted that Chinese imports at the end of 2018 had been much lower than expected, which likely reflected the negative impact of trade tensions between the United States and China.",
        "In addition, acute risks remained surrounding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU.",
        "It was widely agreed that uncertainties and risks related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility had remained prominent and appeared to be exacting an increasing toll on the world economy.",
        "Against this background, the downside risks to global activity and trade were seen as having increased.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, members observed that the recent data had been weaker than expected.",
        "Real GDP growth had slowed from 0.4% to 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2018.",
        "Some other hard data had also disappointed, and more recent indicators based on the latest European Commission business surveys and purchasing managers’ surveys had declined further.",
        "Altogether, the evidence pointed to the likelihood of growth being at or even below potential for several quarters.",
        "It also had to be acknowledged that the carry-over effect from slower growth in the second half of 2018 would in itself entail a lower projection for growth in 2019.",
        "However, it was emphasised that growth remained positive, and that the probability of a recession remained low.",
        "Nonetheless, the perception was widely shared that there was elevated uncertainty at present regarding how persistent the current soft patch would be.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that the euro area economic expansion continued to be supported by fundamental factors, and in particular by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, lower energy prices and the ongoing – albeit somewhat slower – expansion in global activity.",
        "In their exchange of views about the interpretation of incoming data, members shared information on recent developments in their respective national economies and sought to provide an assessment of the likely persistence of the factors behind the recent weakening in activity.",
        "The impact of new emissions testing standards on car production and registrations was again mentioned as a dampening factor in the largest euro area economy.",
        "However, new car registrations were rising again.",
        "The slump had lasted longer than initially expected and, while there were signs that it might now be ending, there was uncertainty about how quickly activity in this sector would recover.",
        "It was also pointed out that, even in the absence of shocks, growth in the euro area would have been expected to slow – given the maturity of the business cycle – from rates above potential towards rates closer to potential.",
        "Members discussed in greater detail the risks to the euro area growth outlook.",
        "It was widely felt that it was not yet possible to judge with any confidence how persistent the present soft patch would be and to what extent slower growth in the short term could affect the medium-term growth outlook, as some factors were temporary or sector or country-specific.",
        "However, members concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Praet that a stronger case could now be made for assessing the risks as having moved to the downside.",
        "In large measure, downside risks could be attributed to risks in the external environment, such as those related to heightened protectionism and the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, which were increasingly weighing on sentiment in the euro area.",
        "The cumulative impact from the persistence of a wide range of risks, both external and domestic, was emphasised, with soft data in the euro area having declined more than hard data.",
        "Concern was expressed that the persistence of the prevailing high level of uncertainty was affecting confidence, as reflected in further falls in business surveys, which in turn could adversely affect domestic demand.",
        "Arguments were put forward that an assessment of risks to growth as still being broadly balanced could be supported by lower oil prices and the stimulus from fiscal measures.",
        "Moreover, the negative impact of a shock to global growth could also be partially offset by policy responses in various jurisdictions.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that the observed slowdown in euro area growth appeared to be deeper and more broad-based than previously anticipated, affecting not only the car sector, but also other manufacturing sectors.",
        "Negative developments had become more widespread across the euro area, and risked affecting several components of demand.",
        "Although the slowdown appeared to be mainly due to external factors, pass-through and spillovers in the euro area explained why domestic demand had also slowed.",
        "While the slowdown had previously been related primarily to trade, private consumption growth had been weaker in the third quarter of 2018 and employment growth had decelerated.",
        "It was suggested that if exports and consumption were both weaker, this was likely to be transmitted to investment in the period ahead.",
        "Furthermore, it was reiterated that past revisions to growth in the staff projections had essentially reflected the incorporation of new data regarding the short term, leaving the growth path for the remainder of the projection horizon practically unchanged.",
        "All in all, members concurred with the view that the risks to the euro area outlook had moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "According to Eurostat, euro area annual HICP inflation had declined to 1.6% in December from 1.9% in November, mainly reflecting a decline in energy price inflation.",
        "On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation was likely to decrease further over the coming months.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, but domestic cost pressures were continuing to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets.",
        "Looking ahead, underlying inflation was expected to increase over the medium term, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth.",
        "As regards the possible implications of weaker growth for the medium-term inflation outlook, it was argued that more information was needed for a thorough assessment.",
        "In this context, it was noted that the labour market had so far continued to improve, with labour shortages becoming more apparent in some Member States, although more broadly some deceleration in employment growth had been observed.",
        "Members considered that recent developments in wage growth continued to provide some reassurance regarding the outlook for underlying inflation.",
        "Compensation per employee in the euro area as a whole had risen by 2.5% in the third quarter of 2018, having increased steadily since 2016, while the pick-up in wage growth had become broader-based across countries and sectors.",
        "It was also argued that the relatively high level of headline inflation in 2018 would continue to affect wage negotiations, which often contained a backward-looking component.",
        "It was widely emphasised that the transmission of higher wages to consumer price inflation was a key issue for the medium-term outlook for inflation and an important source of uncertainty regarding the inflation outlook that was seen to require close monitoring.",
        "It was noted that while the relationship between wages and unemployment appeared to be intact, there had so far been little response in underlying inflation measures to improving labour market conditions.",
        "This was illustrated by the fact that over the previous five years underlying inflation had been stable at around 1%, while unemployment had fallen from around 12% to just below 8%.",
        "Underlying inflation had not risen even in the period when the economy was growing very quickly.",
        "Members also discussed the behaviour of profit margins and mark-ups.",
        "It was noted that higher wage growth had not been passed through to price inflation because firms had absorbed it by lowering profit margins, and attention was drawn to the drop in gross operating surplus growth to practically zero in the third quarter of 2018.",
        "However, it was argued that mark-ups could not be squeezed indefinitely, and that this effect would serve only to delay the pass-through of higher wages to consumer prices.",
        "More generally, it was underlined that the transmission to consumer price inflation was subject to time lags, and it appeared that more time and patience were needed.",
        "However, it was also argued that more structural or longer-lasting factors might still be at play, for example related to changes in the competitive environment and to pressures on margins from e-commerce.",
        "As regards recent developments in longer-term inflation expectations, members noted that both market-based and survey-based measures had fallen since the previous monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council.",
        "Expectations of inflation five years ahead in the Survey of Professional Forecasters for the first quarter of 2019 had been revised down to 1.8%, from 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2018.",
        "Market-based inflation expectations, as measured by the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, stood at 1.54%, slightly below the level prevailing at the time of the December 2018 Governing Council meeting and at their lowest level since June 2017.",
        "While the risk of deflation had been negligible for some time, the short-term outlook for inflation had weakened due to lower oil prices and weak developments in domestic services prices.",
        "Concern was expressed that there might be a risk that this renewed weakness could start to weigh on inflation expectations if it were to persist.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, the Governing Council reiterated the need to rebuild fiscal buffers.",
        "This was particularly important in countries where government debt was high and for which full adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact was critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The annual growth rate of broad money (M3), which had moderated somewhat in November 2018, continued to be underpinned by bank credit creation.",
        "The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth.",
        "Reference was made to the results of the euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2018, which showed that overall bank lending conditions had remained favourable in the euro area, following an extended period of net easing, while demand for bank credit had continued to rise.",
        "Credit standards on loans to enterprises and households had tightened slightly, mostly on account of developments in one large euro area economy that had been subject to financial market volatility, and bank funding costs had also edged up.",
        "Looking ahead, it was felt that some consideration should be given to the outlook for liquidity conditions in the banking sector, as the redemptions of outstanding targeted longer-term refinancing operations were approaching, which might give rise to “cliff effects”.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "There was broad agreement that the stance remained highly expansionary overall and that it had contributed to dampening the impact of prevailing uncertainties on financial conditions, which remained favourable.",
        "It was remarked that, alongside uncertainty about the external environment, uncertainty regarding the euro area economy had risen recently – pertaining to both the growth outlook and inflation – owing to not only lower oil prices but also the slow pass-through from wages to prices.",
        "There was broad agreement among members that supportive financing conditions, favourable labour market dynamics and rising wage growth continued to underpin the euro area expansion, thus supporting confidence in the convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "While measures of underlying inflation remained muted, labour cost pressures were strengthening further and were expected to pass through to underlying inflation in the period ahead.",
        "In this regard, it was underlined that the euro area was still experiencing growth momentum, with labour market conditions improving and lower oil prices supporting consumption.",
        "Looking ahead, a key question was seen to be the extent to which the weaker growth momentum might turn out to be more persistent than currently envisaged.",
        "More information, including the March projections, was needed to deepen the analysis and obtain greater clarity before conclusions could be drawn about the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Against this background, all members agreed with the monetary policy considerations put forward by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "This entailed confirming the enhanced forward guidance on the path of the key ECB interest rates and on the reinvestments of acquired assets while acknowledging that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook had moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism.",
        "Significant monetary policy stimulus would continue to be provided by the forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates and on the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets.",
        "At the same time, the Governing Council would reiterate that it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continued to move towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner.",
        "Members underlined that specifying the forward guidance on the Governing Council’s policy instruments in terms of both a time-based leg and a state-contingent leg had served it well.",
        "The observation was made that, in response to the recent weaker than expected data, some easing in financial conditions had taken place through an outward shift in market expectations for the timing of a first rise in key ECB interest rates.",
        "This endogenous response was viewed as being consistent with the state-based elements of the Governing Council’s forward guidance and contributed to preserving the financial conditions on which the projected inflation convergence remained contingent.",
        "The “chained” forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates and the reinvestments was seen as functioning as a kind of automatic stabiliser, particularly in situations when further easing was deemed desirable in reaction to weaker than expected data.",
        "There was wide agreement that the continued convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim in the period ahead still required an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "A number of remarks were made regarding available monetary policy tools in the domain of longer-term liquidity provision.",
        "Any potential new operations should reflect the monetary policy objectives to be achieved.",
        "While any decisions in this respect should not be taken too hastily, the technical analyses required to prepare policy options for future liquidity operations needed to proceed swiftly.",
        "On communication, members widely concurred with the elements proposed by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Accordingly, it was seen as appropriate to acknowledge that the incoming data had continued to be weaker than expected but that supportive financing conditions, favourable labour market dynamics and rising wage growth continued to underpin the expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures in the euro area.",
        "At the same time, it had to be recognised that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook had moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility.",
        "In this regard, the need to communicate cautiously was stressed, in order to strike the right balance between credibility in acknowledging the weaker than expected data and conveying confidence in the adjustment towards the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "Consequently, the Governing Council would reconfirm its forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates and on the reinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme.",
        "Members agreed that monetary policy needed to remain prudent, patient and persistent and to continue to follow a data-driven approach in the period ahead.",
        "At the current juncture, a steady hand was seen as warranted and discussions with regard to monetary policy operations or the forward guidance were deemed premature.",
        "At the same time, the Governing Council needed to reiterate that it was prepared to act if needed.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council reiterated that it expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "With regard to non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council intended to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 5-6 June 2019.",
        "Sovereign bond yields had temporarily fallen to multi-year lows in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan, and to new record lows in large parts of the euro area.",
        "Econometric evidence suggested that expectations of further global monetary policy easing had been the main driver behind the fall in euro area ten-year overnight index swap (OIS) rates since the start of 2019.",
        "Developments in the EONIA forward curve indicated that a 10 basis point cut in the ECB deposit facility rate was currently priced in for September 2019, and, at its trough, the curve had priced in a cumulative cut of almost 30 basis points by the end of 2020.",
        "There had also been a considerable downward shift in survey-based measures of interest rate expectations in the euro area.",
        "Furthermore, uncertainty around the near-term policy outlook had increased over the past few weeks, as evidenced by a wider dispersion of forward money market rates and a stronger bias towards more negative rates.",
        "Euro area ten-year sovereign spreads vis-à-vis the German Bund had narrowed further in lower-rated jurisdictions since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting and had hit multi-year lows in all countries, except Italy.",
        "Spreads in Spain, Portugal and Greece had narrowed to nearly half the levels observed at the start of 2019. Credit spreads of European financial and non-financial corporations (NFCs) had also fallen over recent weeks.",
        "These developments had essentially reversed the widening of spreads seen in May.",
        "Covered bond spreads, meanwhile, had remained more stable.",
        "Turning to the market for euro area inflation-linked financial instruments, a decomposition of long-term inflation expectations suggested that the bulk of the observed decline reflected a lower inflation risk premium rather than a change in expected inflation.",
        "However, the picture was different when looking at shorter-term inflation expectations, where most of the decline since the autumn of last year reflected a fall in “genuine” inflation expectations.",
        "With regard to equity markets, the Euro Stoxx 50 and the S&P 500 had risen by around 17% and 20% respectively since the start of 2019.",
        "According to a decomposition using the ECB’s dividend-discount model, the prospects of further monetary policy easing and lower earnings expectations had been the main factors affecting stock prices in the euro area and the United States since the start of the year.",
        "In both markets, the fall in discount rates had largely offset the deterioration in the earnings outlook.",
        "The role of the equity risk premium had differed across the two markets, however.",
        "In the euro area, the risk premium had had a broadly neutral effect on stock markets over the course of the year.",
        "In the United States, by contrast, the risk premium had fallen considerably and persistently, thereby supporting stock markets over and above the fall in yields, despite a more marked downward revision to earnings prospects.",
        "Finally, as regards exchange rate developments, the longer-term depreciation trend of the euro against the US dollar had attenuated in early June 2019, although volatility remained high.",
        "A decomposition of the main drivers of the EUR/USD exchange rate showed that since the start of 2019 relative monetary policy expectations had tended to put upward pressure on the euro, consistent with the extent of repricing in the euro area and US money markets that had been observed over this period.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, survey data had indicated a slowdown in global activity in the second quarter of 2019, particularly in manufacturing.",
        "Global trade had remained subdued on the back of a weakening of both global investment and durable goods consumption growth, as well as ongoing trade tensions.",
        "Oil prices had been volatile amid geopolitical tensions and had increased by 2.4% since the June monetary policy meeting, with Brent crude oil standing at around USD 63.8 per barrel.",
        "Over the same period the euro exchange rate had depreciated slightly, both in bilateral terms against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms.",
        "Turning to the euro area, according to Eurostat’s third release, real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2019 was confirmed at 0.4%.",
        "Incoming information since the June Governing Council meeting had remained broadly in line with the June 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "This pointed to subdued growth in the second and third quarters of the year and indicated that risks to the outlook remained tilted to the downside.",
        "Business surveys since mid-June suggested an ongoing slowdown in output growth, with the gap between weak manufacturing and generally stronger services activity widening somewhat further.",
        "Regarding the components of domestic demand, real private consumption had posted strong growth in the first quarter of 2019, increasing by 0.5% in quarter-on-quarter terms, from 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2018.",
        "Looking ahead, continued growth in private consumption was consistent with households’ view of their financial situation and their expectations for the next 12 months, which had remained robust.",
        "In part, this improvement had also reflected fiscal measures, which had boosted disposable income in 2019.",
        "In addition, private consumption had continued to be supported by rising labour income.",
        "Short-term indicators had so far confirmed a continuation of somewhat weaker business investment.",
        "Thus far, this had been broadly in line with the predictions based on an accelerator model.",
        "Labour markets had improved further, continuing the reduction in unemployment and creation of employment that had been under way in recent years.",
        "The unemployment rate had declined to 7.5% in May – 0.1 percentage points lower than in the previous month.",
        "At the same time, the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) on employment had declined to 52 in July, after being broadly stable in the first half of 2019.",
        "At current levels, the PMI on employment pointed to positive, albeit slowing, employment growth in the third quarter.",
        "The trade outlook had remained surrounded by uncertainty and there was no clear sign of stabilisation.",
        "In terms of types of good, car export volumes had remained significantly below those recorded last year, reflecting lower global demand for passenger cars.",
        "After a modest recovery around the turn of the year, the contribution of capital goods exports had continued to be subdued.",
        "Turning to price developments, current and projected inflation had remained muted.",
        "In June euro area annual HICP inflation had increased to 1.3%, from 1.2% in May, as a decline in energy price inflation had been more than offset by higher HICP inflation excluding food and energy, which had rebounded to 1.1% in June, from 0.8% in May.",
        "Looking through calendar effects related to the late timing of Easter this year, measures of underlying inflation had continued to move sideways.",
        "The incoming data had been broadly in line with the June projections, although a mechanical update of the short-term HICP outlook suggested a somewhat lower path.",
        "Growth in compensation per employee was 2.3% in the first quarter of 2019, up from 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018 and slightly above the long-term average of 2.1%.",
        "Unit labour costs had shown a notable upward trajectory since the beginning of 2018, but had stabilised more recently.",
        "The higher wage and labour cost growth in recent quarters was only partially reflected in developments in the GDP deflator, as the contribution of unit profits had been dampened.",
        "Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area had declined.",
        "The longer-term expectation reported in the July round of the Survey of Professional Forecasters stood at 1.7%, which was 0.2 percentage points below the survey result recorded over the period from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018.",
        "Since the June Governing Council meeting market-based measures of inflation expectations had been broadly unchanged amid some notable intra-period volatility.",
        "Euro area financial conditions had eased further, continuing the trend seen since the start of the year.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s June meeting the EONIA forward curve had shifted down further and now exhibited an even more pronounced inversion at the short end.",
        "At the longer end of the term structure, euro area risk free rates had declined since the June meeting.",
        "Most of the decline in recent months had been due to a decline in term premia.",
        "However, the expectations component had also been declining since the autumn of 2018.",
        "Euro area equity prices had continued to increase on the back of lower discount rates, as well as lower equity risk premia.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, the annual growth rate of broad money (M3) had continued to be rather resilient despite the declining contribution of purchases under the asset purchase programme.",
        "Credit to the private sector had remained the main source of broad money creation.",
        "However, its effect on M3 dynamics had been almost matched by the contribution of external monetary inflows in May.",
        "The strong increase in the contribution of these inflows to annual M3 growth since October 2018 had coincided with increased interest among foreign investors in euro area assets.",
        "However, external monetary flows had tended to be volatile.",
        "Euro area banks had experienced a broad-based improvement in their funding costs from a local peak in January 2019.",
        "The low bank funding costs were being transmitted to borrowing costs for NFCs.",
        "In May the composite bank lending rates for NFCs had reached new historical lows.",
        "At the same time, in the July 2019 bank lending survey, euro area banks had reported a net tightening of credit standards on loans to NFCs in the second quarter of 2019.",
        "As regards fiscal policy, the euro area fiscal stance, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was expected to be mildly expansionary in 2019-20.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane remarked that financial conditions had eased since the June Governing Council meeting, largely on account of market expectations of further monetary policy easing.",
        "Bank lending conditions for firms and households remained very favourable.",
        "Incoming data still pointed to somewhat weaker growth in the second and third quarters of this year, in line with the June 2019 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Softening global growth and weak international trade dynamics were weighing on the euro area outlook, while the prolonged presence of uncertainties continued to dampen business sentiment, especially in the manufacturing sector.",
        "At the same time, the services sector had been robust and favourable labour market dynamics were supporting consumption.",
        "The balance of risks remained tilted to the downside, reflecting the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism, and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.",
        "HICP inflation had increased in June, while measures of underlying inflation had continued to move sideways.",
        "Market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had stagnated at the historic lows reached after the June meeting, while surveys signalled a marked fall in longer-term expectations.",
        "Wage growth had been robust and was expected to support inflation in the future, although the softening in inflation expectations could slow the pass-through of cost pressures to inflation.",
        "Based on this assessment, Mr Lane proposed that at the current meeting the Governing Council underline the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time, as inflation rates, both realised and projected, had been persistently below levels that were in line with its aim.",
        "In this regard, the Governing Council needed to underscore its preparedness to act at its forthcoming meetings should the inflation outlook fail to improve, in line with its commitment to a symmetric inflation aim.",
        "Accordingly, Mr Lane proposed the following decisions: first, to adjust the forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates by reintroducing an easing bias; and, second, to task the relevant Eurosystem Committees with initiating preparatory work on policy options, including ways to strengthen the forward guidance on policy rates, mitigating measures, such as the design of a tiered system for reserve remuneration, and the modalities of potential new net asset purchases.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Incoming information indicated that softening global growth dynamics and weak international trade were still weighing on the euro area outlook.",
        "Moreover, the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism, and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, was dampening economic sentiment.",
        "At the same time, employment gains and increasing wages continued to underpin the resilience of the euro area economy.",
        "The impact of these global and domestic factors was visible in the differing developments in the euro area manufacturing sector and in the services and construction sectors.",
        "In considering the outlook and risks for the external environment, members referred to ongoing uncertainties related to trade tensions, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU and the rotation in the Chinese growth model from manufacturing investment towards consumption and services.",
        "In this context, it was underlined that the main causes of the slowdown in euro area activity lay outside the euro area.",
        "The prospects for global trade were assessed to remain poor, despite some recent signs of stabilisation.",
        "It was noted that the pervasive geopolitical and trade tensions had not led to more upward pressure on oil prices and on prices more generally, which could be seen as confirmation that currently the dominant factor in international markets was related to weak global demand.",
        "The risks to the external environment were assessed to remain on the downside.",
        "However, the back and forth in the intensity of some of the drivers of uncertainty also implied some volatility in these downside risks.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, members generally concurred that incoming information had remained broadly consistent with the June staff projections, with recent data mostly being on the soft side, confirming expectations that real GDP growth in the second and third quarters of 2019 would be weaker than the 0.4% quarter-on-quarter growth recorded in the first quarter.",
        "The latest PMI data were cited as an example of disappointing news.",
        "There was now an increased likelihood that the economic slowdown or “soft patch” that had emerged last year would be more protracted than had previously been anticipated.",
        "Moreover, in contrast to the pattern reported in the June Eurosystem staff projections, available “soft” indicators at present pointed to slower growth in the third quarter of 2019, raising more general doubts regarding the expected recovery in the second half of the year.",
        "While the absence thus far of signs of the expected recovery in the second half of the year was worrying, reference was made to unchanged positive fundamentals, such as those related to favourable financing conditions or to the income growth associated with further employment gains and rising wages.",
        "There was broad agreement that it was sensible to collect more information and await the September ECB staff projections for a thorough review of the outlook.",
        "In discussing the economic situation and outlook, members widely stressed the dichotomy between weak activity in the manufacturing sector and generally resilient activity in the services and construction sectors.",
        "This was broadly mirrored by a dichotomy between weaker export growth and more resilient consumption and residential investment growth.",
        "On the one hand, these dichotomies were considered natural given the exposure of the manufacturing sector to the weakening in global trade and the support for the more domestically oriented sectors, such as services and construction, from strong labour markets and real incomes.",
        "On the other hand, concern was expressed that such dichotomies could not last forever and that sooner or later there might be spillovers or contagion from the weakening in manufacturing.",
        "In this context, it was argued that manufacturing was typically a leading indicator of services.",
        "It was also pointed out that, while the weakness in the euro area manufacturing sector had thus far manifested itself mainly in a few larger euro area countries, interconnectedness via value chains implied a risk of wider propagation across the euro area.",
        "However, it was also remarked that there was a trend decline in the importance of manufacturing relative to services, suggesting that large spillovers were not inevitable.",
        "While the continued improvement in labour markets was acknowledged, reference was made to the latest worsening of PMI survey data for employment and the question was raised as to how long the job market would still be posting positive surprises.",
        "Members assessed the balance of risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook to remain tilted to the downside.",
        "It was also considered that these downside risks had become more pervasive and that their persistence could ultimately also necessitate a revision to the baseline growth scenario.",
        "With respect to the outlook for fiscal policy, members noted the support for economic activity coming from the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance.",
        "Reference was made to the increasing contribution of government consumption and investment in the context of the declining real GDP growth rates generally observed since last year.",
        "The contingency of a significant further deterioration in euro area economic activity would call for fiscal policy to assume a more prominent role in sustaining demand.",
        "In this respect, it was reiterated that governments should use fiscal space in countries where it was available and should continue to rebuild fiscal buffers in those where debt was high.",
        "Regarding price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Euro area annual HICP inflation had increased to 1.3% in June 2019, from 1.2% in May, as higher HICP inflation excluding food and energy had more than offset lower energy price inflation.",
        "On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation was likely to decline over the coming months, before rising again towards the end of the year.",
        "Looking through the recent volatility owing to temporary factors, measures of underlying inflation had continued to move sideways and remained generally muted.",
        "While labour cost pressures had strengthened and broadened further amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, the pass-through of cost pressures to inflation was taking longer than previously anticipated.",
        "Over the medium term underlying inflation was expected to increase, supported by monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and stronger wage growth.",
        "When discussing the inflation outlook, it was underlined that although wage growth had remained solid and some measures were above their longer-term averages, both market-derived and survey-based measures of inflation expectations had declined.",
        "Furthermore, the lag in the pass-through of cost pressures to prices implied a compression of profit margins and raised the questions of how long this could last and what it meant for price adjustments.",
        "Regarding longer-term inflation expectations, members widely shared the view that the recent declines were a matter of concern, which warranted close monitoring.",
        "It was stressed that declines were no longer visible only in the market-based indicators but were now also apparent in survey-based indicators, which had fallen to historical lows.",
        "The point was made that it mattered how influential inflation expectations from financial markets and professional forecasters were in shaping those of other economic agents.",
        "Available information suggested that the expectations of financial market participants or professional forecasters differed from those of households and firms.",
        "It was also noted that the difference between the low levels of market-based measures and the higher levels of survey-based measures could be explained by a negative risk premium, but it was also argued that the negative risk premium might itself be of concern if it reflected hedging against outcomes of very low inflation or deflation and therefore provided no grounds for complacency.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The annual growth rate of broad money (M3) had been 4.5% in June, down from 4.8% in May, reflecting a negative base effect.",
        "The sustained rates of broad money growth were supported by ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3.",
        "The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side.",
        "Lending to the non-financial private sector was expanding at a robust pace, with unchanged annual growth rates of 3.8% for loans to NFCs and 3.3% for loans to households in June.",
        "Overall, loan growth continued to benefit from historically low bank lending rates.",
        "Members also agreed that the ECB’s monetary policy measures continued to support loan growth and, ultimately, real activity and inflation.",
        "The euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2019 indicated that loan growth continued to be supported by increasing demand across all loan categories.",
        "At the same time, credit standards for loans to enterprises had tightened in the second quarter amid concerns about the economic outlook, while they had remained broadly unchanged for loans for house purchase.",
        "A remark was made that negative interest rates were increasing the pressure on the banking sector, particularly in countries where banks were not able to impose negative rates on deposits.",
        "Consequently, the longer-term effects of negative policy rates needed to be monitored carefully to ensure that they exerted their intended effect on bank lending.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Overall, financial conditions had eased since the Governing Council’s June monetary policy meeting, largely on account of market expectations of further monetary policy easing.",
        "Bank lending conditions for firms and households remained very favourable.",
        "An ample degree of monetary accommodation remained necessary for financial conditions to support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, headline inflation developments over the medium term.",
        "Members shared the assessment that information available since the early June Governing Council meeting indicated that, while further employment gains and increasing wages continued to underpin the resilience of the economy, softening global growth dynamics and weak international trade were still weighing on the euro area outlook.",
        "The prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism, and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, continued to dampen economic sentiment, notably in the manufacturing sector.",
        "It was noted that, while recent data were broadly in line with the baseline scenario and the forces underlying the baseline – such as solid wage growth and rising cost pressures – were still seen as intact, the uncertainty around the projected duration of the economic slowdown remained high, also affecting the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In this environment, inflationary pressures had remained muted and indicators of inflation expectations had declined.",
        "Despite the considerable divergence in the levels of different survey-based and market-based measures of medium-term inflation expectations and the observation that market-based measures may have been affected by special factors, broad agreement prevailed that the overall downward movement across indicators was a cause for concern from a monetary policy perspective.",
        "Against the background of inflation rates, both realised and projected, remaining persistently below levels that were in line with the Governing Council’s inflation aim, members widely agreed with the assessment that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was needed for a prolonged period of time.",
        "In this context, confirming the symmetry of the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim was seen as an important element to bolster the achievement of a sustained adjustment in inflation to its aim.",
        "A remark was made that so far the interaction between the inflation aim and the Governing Council’s definition of price stability as an inflation rate of below 2% introduced, de facto, an element of asymmetry.",
        "A view was put forward that a discussion of symmetry around the inflation aim could not be separated from a discussion about the level of this aim, while the point was made that any future change in the inflation aim should not be employed as an isolated policy measure but should be linked to a broader review of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy to ensure consistency of the strategy.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that a clarification of the symmetric nature of the Governing Council’s “reaction function” would not pre-empt a full review of the monetary policy strategy at a later point in time.",
        "Members expressed broad agreement with the monetary policy proposals made by Mr Lane in his introduction: first, to adjust the forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates by reintroducing an easing bias; and, second, to initiate preparatory work, including on ways to strengthen the Governing Council’s forward guidance on policy rates, mitigating measures, such as the design of a tiered system for reserve remuneration, and options for the size and composition of potential new net asset purchases.",
        "It was seen as important for the Governing Council to demonstrate its determination and capacity to act and to be prepared to ease the policy stance further by adjusting all of its instruments, as appropriate, to achieve its inflation aim.",
        "Looking ahead, more information would be available at the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting in September, when new projections, incorporating the effects of the measures taken at the Governing Council’s June meeting, would be presented.",
        "Members broadly supported the reintroduction of an easing bias to the Governing Council’s forward guidance on interest rates in the light of the weakness of the economic outlook and the muted inflation developments.",
        "The easing bias was considered appropriate for addressing the risk of an unwarranted tightening of monetary conditions related to the short end of the yield curve in view of the persistent uncertainty surrounding global developments.",
        "Members also broadly supported the proposal made by Mr Lane to task the relevant Eurosystem Committees with examining options for future policy measures.",
        "Some nuances were expressed about the design and the individual elements of a possible policy package, which was presented as a list of options.",
        "In particular, it was argued that the term premium on long-term euro area bonds had already been compressed for quite some time and that the risk of an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions was higher at the short end than at the long end of the yield curve.",
        "However, the view was expressed that the various options should be seen as a package, i.e.",
        "a combination of instruments with significant complementarities and synergies, since experience had shown that a policy package – such as the combination of rate cuts and asset purchases – was more effective than a sequence of selective actions.",
        "The point was made that the choice of instruments and the design of a possible package should reflect the relative effectiveness of different instruments in addressing future contingencies.",
        "Members saw value in examining ways to further strengthen the state-based component of the forward guidance on the path of policy rates, announcing preparatory work on the design of a tiered system or other options to mitigate the effects of negative interest rates on bank-based intermediation, and preparatory work on modalities for potential new net asset purchases.",
        "In this context, it was also argued that linking the state-contingent leg of the forward guidance to inflation would require attention being paid to consistency with the inflation aim.",
        "While members expressed broad agreement with initiating preparatory work on mitigating measures, some concerns were raised regarding possible unintended consequences of a tiered system and its ability to fully mitigate the potential effects of negative policy rates on bank intermediation.",
        "Against this background, communication needed to strike a careful balance between, on the one hand, giving unduly negative signals about the state of the economy and, on the other hand, effectively counteracting the concern among some observers that the Governing Council lacked the necessary instruments to secure the convergence of inflation to its inflation aim over the medium term.",
        "It was therefore seen as appropriate for the Governing Council to adjust its forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, namely that it now expected them to remain at their present or lower levels at least through the first half of 2020, and in any case for as long as necessary, while restating its forward guidance on reinvestments.",
        "Moreover, the Governing Council should underline the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time, as inflation rates, both realised and projected, had been persistently below levels that were in line with its aim.",
        "Accordingly, the Governing Council needed to convey its determination to act if the inflation outlook failed to improve, in line with its commitment to symmetry in the inflation aim.",
        "It therefore remained essential to underscore that the Governing Council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its inflation aim in a sustained manner.",
        "Furthermore, it should be announced that the relevant Eurosystem Committees were being tasked with examining options, including ways to reinforce the Governing Council’s forward guidance on policy rates, mitigating measures, such as the design of a tiered system for reserve remuneration, and options for the size and composition of potential new net asset purchases.",
        "In addition, as heightened uncertainty was likely to extend further into the future, it remained essential to stress that a significant degree of monetary stimulus continued to be necessary to ensure that financial conditions remained very favourable and supported the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, headline inflation developments over the medium term.",
        "Finally, it was recalled that in the current situation monetary policy would be more effective if other policy areas contributed to raising the longer-term growth potential.",
        "With fiscal policy using available space and accelerated structural reforms, monetary policy would be less at risk of being overburdened and would be able to deploy available instruments more effectively.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged.",
        "The Governing Council expected the rates to remain at their present or lower levels at least through the first half of 2020, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to its aim over the medium term.",
        "The Governing Council intended to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "The Governing Council also underlined the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time, as inflation rates, both realised and projected, had been persistently below levels that were in line with its aim.",
        "Accordingly, if the medium-term inflation outlook continued to fall short of its aim, the Governing Council was determined to act, in line with its commitment to symmetry in the inflation aim.",
        "It therefore stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner.",
        "In this context, the Governing Council was tasking the relevant Eurosystem Committees with examining options, including ways to reinforce its forward guidance on policy rates, mitigating measures, such as the design of a tiered system for reserve remuneration, and options for the size and composition of potential new net asset purchases.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting. '",
        "Members not holding a voting right in July 2019 under Article 10.2 of the Statute of the ESCB.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s last monetary policy meeting on 11-12 September 2019, the prospect of a breakthrough in the trade negotiations between the United States and China, as well as declining fears of a “no-deal” Brexit, had helped to underpin global market sentiment.",
        "In the euro area, the overnight index swap forward curve had shifted upwards at both the short and the long end, and it had also become notably steeper in 2021 compared with the situation in September 2019.",
        "In the United States, the effect of receding uncertainty surrounding Brexit and trade had been partially offset by changes in near-term monetary policy expectations in response to weaker economic data.",
        "The market-implied probability of a rate cut at the US Federal Reserve System’s meeting on 29-30 October 2019 had increased notably over the course of October.",
        "Overall, however, bond yields on both sides of the Atlantic remained at very low levels compared with earlier in 2019.",
        "Three developments in money markets were noteworthy.",
        "First, on 2 October 2019 the ECB had successfully started the daily publication of the new euro short-term rate (€STR), which was based on a broad set of granular data on money market transactions.",
        "The second development related to the Governing Council’s decision on 11-12 September 2019 to introduce a two-tier remuneration system for excess reserves.",
        "Some very tentative evidence of higher trading volumes in the euro money market had been observed as banks prepared for the introduction of the two-tier system in the next reserve maintenance period.",
        "The third development related to the recent volatility in short-term money market rates in the United States.",
        "The Federal Reserve System had conducted repurchase agreement operations to ease funding stress in this market segment.",
        "It had also resumed purchases of US Treasury bills at a pace of approximately USD 60 billion per month, initially until the second quarter of 2020.",
        "These liquidity-providing measures had proven successful in easing tensions in the US repurchase agreement market.",
        "Turning to stock market developments, the EURO STOXX 50 index had risen by about 2% since mid-September 2019 and by more than 10% relative to the mid-August lows.",
        "Unlike in the spring and summer of 2019, a fall in the equity risk premium on the back of receding uncertainty related to Brexit and trade had contributed to a rise in stock prices.",
        "Bank shares had seen a strong recovery in recent weeks and had outperformed the broader market.",
        "Finally, in foreign exchange markets, the euro had depreciated against the US dollar, falling to its lowest level in more than two years in the wake of the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting, but it had subsequently appreciated on the back of Brexit-related news as risk premia reversed.",
        "The pound sterling had meanwhile appreciated strongly against the euro, rising by 3.4% since the last Governing Council meeting, with a notable rise in trading volumes and option-implied volatility.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, the pace of global activity and trade growth remained weak.",
        "There were tentative signs of some stabilisation of global growth, both in global manufacturing and in some emerging market economies, in the third quarter of 2019.",
        "For that quarter as a whole, the global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) excluding the euro area had stood at 51.4, broadly unchanged from its second quarter average.",
        "Global trade had rebounded in the second quarter of 2019, when excluding the effects of UK-specific factors.",
        "Overall, however, global trade remained subdued, dampened by a high level of trade tensions and weak Asian demand.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting, oil prices had dropped by almost 7% and the euro had appreciated in bilateral terms against the US dollar, while it had marginally depreciated in nominal effective terms.",
        "Turning to the euro area, real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2019 had been confirmed at 0.2% in Eurostat’s third release.",
        "As regards developments in the third quarter, business indicators suggested a further slowdown in output growth.",
        "The flash composite output PMI had stood at 50.2 in October, up from 50.1 in September but down from 51.9 in August.",
        "The European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator had also declined in the third quarter.",
        "Regarding the components of domestic demand, private consumption had continued to be supported by higher labour income.",
        "A decomposition of real disposable income growth suggested that labour income remained the main driver.",
        "In addition, the decline in oil prices in the first half of 2019 was supporting real disposable income.",
        "Short-term indicators also pointed to resilient private consumption demand in the third quarter of 2019.",
        "Growth in business investment had been slowing down since early 2019.",
        "The latest sectoral indicators suggested a continuation of subdued business investment in the short term.",
        "Capital goods production in July had remained below the quarterly average recorded in the second quarter.",
        "Capacity utilisation in manufacturing had seen a continuous gradual decline since the first quarter of 2018, and currently stood close to its historical average.",
        "As regards the labour market, sectoral indicators showed a moderation in labour market conditions, driven by the manufacturing sector.",
        "According to national accounts data for the second quarter, employment growth in the manufacturing sector had declined from 0.4%, in quarter-on-quarter terms, in the first quarter of 2019, to 0.2% in the second quarter, whereas employment growth in market services had remained broadly unchanged at 0.3%.",
        "The resilience of the labour market in the face of the growth slowdown was also reflected in weak hourly productivity growth, which had stood at 0%, in quarter-on-quarter terms, in the second quarter.",
        "Hourly productivity growth had, however, remained in positive territory in the market services sector, while the manufacturing sector had seen a persistent reduction in hourly productivity since the first quarter of 2018.",
        "Euro area goods exports had contracted in the second quarter as the stockbuilding in the United Kingdom, which had lifted euro area goods exports in the first quarter, had reversed.",
        "Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat, annual headline HICP inflation had decreased from 1.0% in August to 0.8% in September and remained considerably below the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "The decline had reflected lower energy and food price inflation, which had more than offset a slight increase in HICP inflation excluding energy and food from 0.9% in August to 1.0% in September.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation had remained generally muted and continued to move sideways.",
        "Low inflation had continued to be broad-based.",
        "The share of items with low inflation rates in HICP inflation excluding energy and food had remained elevated.",
        "At the same time, the share of items with negative inflation rates had shown a downward trend from 2014-15 levels and stood in September only very slightly above its long-term average.",
        "Wages had continued to grow at a robust pace, with compensation per employee increasing by 2.2% in the second quarter of 2019 – slightly above the long-run average of 2.1%.",
        "Higher wage pressures had so far been largely absorbed by profit margins.",
        "According to the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the fourth quarter of 2019, HICP inflation expectations stood at 1.2%, 1.2% and 1.4% for 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively.",
        "This represented a downward revision of approximately 0.1 percentage points for each year.",
        "Expectations for inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco were also revised down by around 0.1 percentage points for each of these years.",
        "Euro area market-based indicators of medium to longer-term inflation expectations remained at low levels, with the five-year forward five years ahead measure standing slightly above 1.2% – broadly unchanged compared with the level at the time of the September monetary policy meeting.",
        "As regards euro area financial conditions, risk-free bond rates had increased across all maturities since the September meeting.",
        "The EONIA forward curve had overall shifted upwards and was no longer pricing in a further 10 basis point rate cut.",
        "Euro area equity prices of both non-financial corporations and financial corporations had overall slightly increased since the September meeting, but had been quite volatile.",
        "The slight overall increase in equity prices was mainly driven by declines in the equity risk premium, which compensated for the dampening pressures from lower longer-term earnings expectations and higher discount rates.",
        "Financing conditions for euro area non-financial corporations remained very favourable and were broadly unchanged since the September meeting.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, the annual growth rate of broad money (M3) had increased to 5.7% in August, from 5.1% in July.",
        "M3 growth continued to be almost entirely driven by annual M1 growth, which had also increased.",
        "From a counterpart perspective, credit to the private sector continued to be the main source of broad money creation, while the contribution of MFI net external assets to annual M3 growth remained broadly unchanged.",
        "According to the October 2019 euro area bank lending survey, net demand for loans to enterprises had remained broadly stable in the third quarter of 2019, while banks had expected a slight increase in the previous survey round.",
        "Reflecting the weakness in economic growth developments, the positive contribution of fixed investment had been smaller in the third quarter.",
        "Credit standards for loans to euro area enterprises had eased slightly in the third quarter following a tightening in the second quarter.",
        "As in previous quarters, competitive pressure had been the main factor contributing to the easing of credit standards for loans to enterprises.",
        "The euro area fiscal stance in 2020 was expected to be mildly expansionary in 2019-21, which would provide some support to demand conditions.",
        "Draft budgetary plans for 2020 envisaged a change of 0.4 percentage points in the euro area structural primary balance-to-GDP ratio, amounting to further loosening.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane remarked that the September policy package had delivered a large part of the easing in financial conditions that had occurred over the previous months in anticipation of a substantial policy easing.",
        "Bank lending conditions for firms and households continued to be favourable and easier market funding conditions exhibited an ongoing pass-through.",
        "The incoming data confirmed the Governing Council’s previous assessment that the weakness of the euro area economy was protracted.",
        "The PMI manufacturing output index was now at its lowest level since December 2012 and the services index had also deteriorated.",
        "Private consumption remained resilient overall amid rising wages and job growth, which, however, showed signs of moderation.",
        "The balance of risks surrounding the growth outlook remained tilted to the downside owing to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and continued vulnerabilities in emerging markets.",
        "HICP inflation and measures of underlying inflation remained subdued despite rising wages.",
        "Both market and survey-based measures of inflation expectations had stagnated at historical lows.",
        "Looking ahead, the Governing Council needed to monitor the pass-through of its monetary policy measures and incoming information on the economy.",
        "In any case, forward guidance on interest rates acted as an automatic stabiliser, as monetary policy expectations – and hence the entire spectrum of financial conditions – adjusted to changes in the inflation outlook.",
        "On the basis of this assessment, Mr Lane proposed keeping the monetary policy stance unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "It was suggested that the Governing Council, in its communication, first highlight that the monetary policy measures taken at the September meeting were providing substantial monetary stimulus, which would contribute to a further easing in borrowing conditions for firms and households.",
        "This would support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the sustained convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "Second, it should stress that its forward guidance would ensure that financial conditions would adjust in accordance with changes in the inflation outlook.",
        "In any event, the Governing Council continued to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "Third, it should recall that, all else being equal, the more that fiscal policy contributed to boosting long-term growth potential and providing cyclical stabilisation, the sooner the effects of monetary policy interventions on inflation and the economy would be seen.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally shared the assessment of the outlook for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Incoming information since the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting broadly confirmed the previous assessment of a protracted weakness in euro area growth dynamics, the persistence of prominent downside risks and muted inflationary pressures.",
        "At the same time, ongoing employment growth and increasing wages continued to underpin the resilience of the euro area economy.",
        "Regarding the outlook and risks for the external environment, it was noted that the pace of global activity and trade growth remained weak and that global trade could turn out to be weaker than had been anticipated in the September 2019 ECB staff projections.",
        "In the context of disentangling the sources of this weakness, the question was raised as to what extent the downturn in the tech cycle constituted a separate factor, independent of the weakness related to trade tensions.",
        "Members assessed the risks to global activity and trade to have remained on the downside.",
        "These risks pertained to the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.",
        "Reference was made in particular to continued uncertainties related to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.",
        "At the global level, trade tensions might have become less acute overall since the September monetary policy meeting, but doubts were expressed that they would be resolved soon.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, members generally concurred that recent data had confirmed the more protracted weakness anticipated at the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting.",
        "Real GDP was confirmed to have increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2019, following growth of 0.4% in the first quarter, and incoming economic data and survey information continued to point to moderate, but positive, growth in the second half of the year.",
        "The slowdown in growth mainly reflected the ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of persistent global uncertainties, which continued to weigh on the euro area manufacturing sector and were dampening investment growth.",
        "During the discussion on the protracted weakness and persistent downside risks to activity, it was pointed out that some key indicators, such as industrial production and the PMI manufacturing output index, had continued to deteriorate.",
        "It was observed that the PMI not only stood at its lowest level since 2012 but its overall decline was also the longest seen since the recession triggered by the financial crisis.",
        "Incoming data suggested that the weakness was likely to persist and raised the question as to whether it would continue for longer than had been anticipated in the September 2019 ECB staff projections.",
        "There were no signs as yet of the acceleration in growth anticipated in the projections.",
        "In this context, it was also remarked that little additional hard data had become available since the September monetary policy meeting and that more information was needed to reassess the economic outlook.",
        "It was recalled that euro area economic activity continued to be supported by a number of factors.",
        "The services and construction sectors had remained resilient, despite some moderation.",
        "Financing conditions were favourable, the labour market had posted further employment gains in conjunction with rising wages, the euro area fiscal stance was mildly expansionary and growth in global activity was ongoing, albeit at a somewhat slower pace.",
        "However, concerns were expressed that the recent deterioration in survey data for the services sector could reflect spillovers from the persistently negative developments in exports and manufacturing.",
        "There were initial signs of some contagion from manufacturing to services, although it was too early to speak of more generalised spillovers.",
        "At the same time, some comfort could be drawn from the resilience of domestically-oriented sectors and consumption, with consumer confidence also holding up.",
        "The economic downturn had thus far had only limited effects on labour markets, even in countries where the downturn had been sharpest.",
        "However, reference was made to signs that the labour market could worsen if the economic weakness were to persist, and to the latest survey data signalling a somewhat weaker employment outlook.",
        "All in all, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook were generally assessed by members to be still tilted to the downside, on account of the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.",
        "Regarding the outlook for fiscal policy, members noted that the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance was providing some support to economic activity.",
        "However, in view of the weaker economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks, it was reiterated that governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely manner.",
        "In countries where public debt was high, governments needed to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targets, which would create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely.",
        "All countries should reinforce their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances.",
        "It was stressed that compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact for some countries implied an increase in the structural balance and a tightening of fiscal policy that could offset an expansionary stance in countries with fiscal space.",
        "With regard to price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Euro area annual HICP inflation had decreased from 1.0% in August 2019 to 0.8% in September, reflecting lower food and energy price inflation.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation had remained generally muted and indicators of inflation expectations stood at low levels.",
        "While labour cost pressures had strengthened amid tighter labour markets, the weaker growth momentum was delaying their pass-through to inflation.",
        "Over the medium term inflation was expected to increase, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and robust wage growth.",
        "It was emphasised that headline inflation was currently being dampened by low energy price inflation.",
        "The latest inflation data had confirmed the expectations embedded in the September 2019 projections, and the absence of major forecast errors for core inflation in recent months supported the projection of an upward movement in underlying inflation dynamics.",
        "One element that had dampened core inflation, but was now starting to fade out, was a statistical downward impact on the annual rate of change of package holiday prices associated with a change in consumer expenditure weights in the largest euro area economy.",
        "Looking ahead, it was argued that an increase in underlying inflation might not readily materialise given the current weaker macroeconomic outlook.",
        "Members agreed with the assessment that wage growth continued to be solid and underlined its crucial role in the expected upward adjustment of inflation.",
        "In this context, it was remarked that the most recent SPF indicated a downward-sloping path for wage growth.",
        "At the same time, it was suggested that, while there might be a slight slowdown in wage dynamics, the expected inflation adjustment currently hinged more on the delayed pass-through of wage growth into prices and a recovery in profit mark-ups.",
        "It was pointed out that profit margins had not increased in previous years, despite a positive economic outlook, which raised doubts as to whether they would increase now in the context of a worsened outlook.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, members noted the further decline in survey-based measures.",
        "Concern was expressed, in particular, with respect to the consecutive downward revisions to longer-term inflation expectations in the ECB’s SPF.",
        "It was argued that survey and market-based indicators – when adjusted for estimates of liquidity and risk premia – showed a similar picture of a downward shift in longer-term expectations.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Overall, the signals provided by money and credit developments remained positive, as broad money (M3) growth and credit to the private sector were at their highest levels since 2009.",
        "Sustained rates of broad money growth reflected ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3.",
        "The growth of loans to firms and households had remained robust, benefiting from the continued pass-through of the accommodative monetary policy stance to bank lending rates, which remained at historical lows.",
        "Favourable bank lending conditions were also evidenced by the euro area bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2019.",
        "It was noted, however, that the financial stability implications needed to be monitored closely as declining bank lending rates could squeeze banks’ margins beyond adequate risk coverage.",
        "Moreover, the point was made that more attention needed to be paid to the non-bank financial sectors, where looser market-based financing conditions and the search for yield also posed risks.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The package of measures decided at the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting had to a large extent preserved the highly favourable financial conditions prevailing in the period before that meeting, in part owing to the anticipation of further monetary policy easing.",
        "This was seen as demonstrating that markets had well understood the “reaction function” of the Governing Council.",
        "Despite some upward movement at the front end of the yield curve since the September monetary policy meeting, taking a somewhat longer perspective, financial conditions had eased significantly since the Sintra conference in June this year.",
        "It was underlined that the incoming information since the September monetary policy meeting had confirmed the pronounced slowdown in euro area economic growth and a continued shortfall of inflation with respect to the inflation aim, thus vindicating the monetary policy decisions taken by the Governing Council at that meeting.",
        "There was wide agreement that more information would be needed to reassess the inflation outlook and the impact of the monetary policy measures, particularly given that some of the measures had yet to be implemented – notably the resumption of net asset purchases and the introduction of a two-tier system for reserve remuneration.",
        "Therefore, the measures should be allowed more time to fully unfold their effects on the euro area economy and ultimately on inflation outcomes, taking into account the usual transmission lags of monetary policy.",
        "Confidence was expressed that the comprehensive package of policy measures decided at the September meeting provided substantial monetary stimulus, which would contribute to a further easing in borrowing conditions for firms and households.",
        "This would support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the sustained convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "Against this background, the members agreed with the proposal made by Mr Lane in his introduction to keep the monetary policy stance unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "This entailed confirming the resumption of net asset purchases under the Governing Council’s asset purchase programme at a monthly pace of €20 billion as from 1 November 2019 and reiterating the forward guidance on policy interest rates, net asset purchases and reinvestments.",
        "There was broad agreement that monetary policy had to remain highly accommodative for an extended period of time in the face of a protracted weakness in the economy and subdued inflation developments.",
        "Accordingly, it was important to fully implement the September monetary policy decisions.",
        "In this context, it was highlighted that the Governing Council’s forward guidance provided an important stabilisation function, as Mr Lane had pointed out in his introduction.",
        "The strengthened state-based forward guidance decided at the September monetary policy meeting, which had more clearly tied the likely path of policy interest rates to inflation prospects, ensured that financial conditions would adjust in accordance with changes in the inflation outlook, thereby reinforcing the Governing Council’s commitment to achieving its inflation aim.",
        "It was argued that the state-based nature of the forward guidance, which depended on a forward-looking component, whereby the inflation outlook had to be seen to converge robustly to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within the projection horizon, as well as on a backward-looking component, whereby the convergence of inflation had to be consistently reflected in the observed dynamics of underlying inflation, provided a clear guide to the Governing Council’s “reaction function”.",
        "Strong commitment by the Governing Council to providing the necessary policy stimulus was seen as important to ensure the sustained convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "Accordingly, it was vital for the Governing Council to remain prepared to act by using its full set of instruments if the inflation outlook so required.",
        "It was, however, cautioned that due account also had to be taken of the assessment of the possible side effects of monetary policy measures.",
        "At the same time, a plea was made for patience to allow the measures taken in September to work through the economy, supporting a “wait and see” posture at the current juncture.",
        "As regards communication, members widely agreed with the proposals made by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "It needed to be stressed that the September monetary policy package supported the sustained convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s aim, while noting that the transmission of the individual measures would take time to work its way through to growth and inflation dynamics.",
        "At the same time, the Governing Council needed to forcefully reiterate its unwavering commitment to achieving its inflation aim and the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time to support underlying inflation pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term.",
        "In the light of the persistence of prominent downside risks surrounding the euro area outlook, it also needed to be emphasised that the Governing Council continued to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "Looking ahead, a strong call was made for unity of the Governing Council.",
        "While it was underlined that open and frank discussions in the Governing Council were absolutely necessary and legitimate, it was regarded as important to form a consensus and to unite behind the Governing Council’s commitment to pursuing its inflation aim.",
        "Furthermore, the call on other policymakers was reiterated, emphasising that they needed to contribute more decisively to supporting the euro area economy.",
        "In particular, fiscal policy, notably of governments with fiscal space, had to play a more prominent role to stabilise economic conditions in view of the weakening economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it saw the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence was consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.",
        "As decided at the Governing Council’s meeting on 11-12 September 2019, net purchases would be restarted under the Governing Council’s asset purchase programme at a monthly pace of €20 billion as from 1 November 2019.",
        "The Governing Council expected them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it started raising the key ECB interest rates.",
        "The Governing Council intended to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting."
    ],
    "2021": [
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 9-10 December 2020.",
        "New global coronavirus (COVID-19) infections had reached a record high in the previous week and the risk of more protracted containment measures was rising amid the emergence of more infectious mutations of the virus and a pace of vaccination that was proceeding more slowly than expected.",
        "Sentiment in financial markets, however, had improved noticeably at the start of the year, mainly reflecting expectations of additional fiscal stimulus in the United States, sparking reflation trades.",
        "The US Treasury yield curve had steepened significantly, led by the long end, reflecting an increase in both inflation expectations and real rates.",
        "The euro area overnight index swap (OIS) curve, by contrast, remained close to its flattest historical level and had steepened only marginally over the past two weeks.",
        "The euro area GDP-weighted yield curve had also remained very close to the level observed at the time of the Governing Council’s 9-10 December 2020 monetary policy meeting.",
        "However, stable nominal yields in the euro area masked opposing underlying developments.",
        "While medium to long-term inflation expectations had increased at the same pace as in the United States, real yields in the euro area had resisted upward pressure and had in fact declined to record low levels.",
        "There had also been a repricing at the short end of the curve.",
        "Both in the United States and in the euro area, OIS forward curves had continued to shift upwards since the start of 2021, broadly reflecting higher interest rate expectations.",
        "Cross-asset price correlations were consistent with the view that the market was becoming more sanguine about the economic outlook despite the risk of strict lockdowns being extended further in the near future.",
        "Price and flow data on global equity markets suggested that a further improvement in risk sentiment and a recovery in long-term earnings expectations had so far outweighed any impact from the rise in risk-free rates.",
        "Global stock markets had posted further gains and the EURO STOXX 50 index was now close to reaching pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.",
        "The recent price gains had also been backed by continued inflows into global equities.",
        "Assets under management in investment funds had increased by more than 10% since early November 2020.",
        "At the same time, stock prices could eventually become vulnerable to a rise in real yields globally.",
        "The “excess CAPE yield”, i.e.",
        "the inverse of the cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio minus the real ten-year bond yield, continued to be high at present, meaning that investors had not necessarily lowered the premium they demanded for holding riskier assets.",
        "Nonetheless, a more sustained rise in real rates could rapidly lower the relative attractiveness of equities and thereby pose the risk of a more broad-based repricing.",
        "Such risks of price corrections were not evenly distributed across the equity universe.",
        "The distribution of the price/earnings ratio across firms in the EURO STOXX 50 index was currently much wider than it had been on average over the past 20 years, also reflecting that the recovery remained highly uneven.",
        "Credit markets had shown a similar resilience to the risk of higher rates.",
        "Corporate credit spreads in the euro area had continued to narrow marginally over the past few weeks.",
        "The arrival of vaccines and the recalibration of measures decided upon by the Governing Council in December 2020 had fostered a further compression of risk premia in this market segment to levels close to those prevailing before the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "In foreign exchange markets, rising US government bond yields had interrupted the depreciation trend in the US dollar that had gained further momentum after the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "Since the Georgia run-off elections, the euro exchange rate versus the US dollar had dropped and had temporarily even fallen below the levels that had prevailed at the time of that monetary policy meeting.",
        "US real rates had been a key factor boosting global portfolio rebalancing and risk-taking.",
        "So to the extent that investors saw the risks surrounding these rates as increasingly skewed to the upside, an important driver behind recent exchange rate developments could lose steam.",
        "Taken together, the recent financial market developments had left a broad-based positive mark on financial conditions in the euro area.",
        "Sovereign real yields had dropped, spreads had remained resilient, stock prices and inflation expectations had risen, and the euro exchange rate versus the US dollar had reversed its appreciation trend.",
        "This was a strong vote of confidence in the Governing Council’s decision to focus on the duration of its policy support and on the preservation of favourable financing conditions to protect the current highly accommodative stance in an environment of continued high uncertainty.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "As regards the external environment, the global recovery continued towards the end of the year, although the slight fall in the global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) to 53.5 in December signalled weakening momentum.",
        "Despite a surge in new COVID-19 infections, recent data and forecasts indicated an overall more optimistic outlook for global activity than previously expected, based on stronger economic growth in the United States, but also on strong economic data from China and the EU-UK trade deal.",
        "While the medium-term outlook was improving, rising COVID-19 cases and the resulting containment measures posed near-term headwinds to growth until vaccinations contained the pandemic, which was expected towards mid-2021.",
        "Compared with the first wave of COVID-19 infections and containment measures in the spring of 2020, services had been affected less in November and December.",
        "Trade developments had also been more resilient during the new wave of the pandemic.",
        "Oil prices had continued the recovery that started in spring 2020 and had increased by 15% since the Governing Council’s December monetary policy meeting to above USD 55 per barrel, driven by higher demand as well as some factors limiting supply.",
        "At the same time, the euro had appreciated slightly, amid some volatility, against the US dollar (0.2%), but had depreciated slightly in effective terms (-0.2%), while commodity prices for metals and food had risen sharply, supported by a strong rebound in commodity demand in the second half of 2020.",
        "Turning to the euro area, the more restrictive and extended lockdowns were weighing on the short-term growth outlook.",
        "The economic impact of the pandemic continued to affect services in particular, while manufacturing had remained resilient.",
        "According to the latest PMI data for December, activity in the services sector had continued to shrink, while manufacturing activity had continued to increase on the back of robust developments in global trade.",
        "The economic impact of the lockdowns seemed to have moderated compared with the first wave of the pandemic in spring 2020.",
        "According to the European Commission survey, confidence in the services sector was less subdued in most countries in the recent wave, likely reflecting the fact that the economy had adapted better to the restrictions.",
        "Fiscal transfers had continued to buffer euro area households’ disposable income in the second half of 2020, compensating for weak labour income.",
        "With many services unavailable during the lockdowns, consumers were forced to save, pushing up the household savings rate.",
        "In terms of the distribution, younger households were drawing more on their savings as their financial situation deteriorated, while older households were more able to save.",
        "Whether and when these savings would be used for consumption in the future was likely to affect the outlook for the euro area economy over the coming quarters.",
        "With regard to labour market developments, the euro area unemployment rate had stood at 8.3% in November 2020, 0.1 percentage points lower than in October.",
        "Labour demand remained weak overall and the job market was providing only limited opportunities for those looking for new jobs.",
        "At the same time, job retention schemes (especially short-time work schemes) had contained unemployment and helped to stabilise household incomes.",
        "Turning to nominal developments, HICP inflation and HICP inflation excluding food and energy (HICPX) remained at -0.3% and 0.2% respectively in December 2020.",
        "Euro area inflation had fallen from pre-pandemic levels of above 1% and had remained persistently negative since August 2020, owing to developments not only in energy prices, but also in goods and services prices.",
        "A broad range of measures of underlying inflation had moved sideways, with measures excluding volatile items and indirect tax changes declining less since the beginning of the pandemic.",
        "Most of the decline in non-energy industrial goods inflation could be attributed to the weakness in clothing and footwear inflation, which could be expected to be corrected to some extent after the pandemic.",
        "Negotiated wages had continued their broad sideways movement despite the large amounts of slack in the economy and the labour market, as many wage agreements had been concluded before the pandemic.",
        "Looking ahead, headline inflation was likely to turn positive again in January 2021, and to increase further over the course of the year, with the phasing-out of the temporary cut in the German value-added tax (VAT) rate from January 2021 being one factor.",
        "HICP weights were expected to change substantially in 2021 as a result of the changes in consumption patterns during the pandemic, adding to the already elevated uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook.",
        "According to the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the first quarter of 2021, inflation expectations were broadly unchanged.",
        "HICP inflation was expected to stand at 0.9% in 2021, 1.3% in 2022 and 1.5% in 2023.",
        "Looking further ahead, the SPF continued to expect headline inflation five years ahead to reach 1.7%.",
        "Market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had increased and the odds of very low inflation had declined.",
        "Reviewing the latest developments in euro area financial conditions, the path of risk-free rates suggested that rate cut expectations were largely absent and long-term risk-free rates had increased.",
        "Risk assets had been stable and stood close to their pre-crisis levels.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, money growth had been buoyant, with the annual growth of M3 increasing from 10.5% in October 2020 to 11.0% in November.",
        "Eurosystem asset purchases remained the main source of money creation, while the contribution of bank credit to the private sector had continued to moderate.",
        "The annual growth of loans to euro area non-financial corporations was still affected by the strong expansion of loans in the spring of 2020 and was broadly unchanged at 6.9% in November, while short-term loan dynamics had continued to weaken, driven by both demand factors and supply factors.",
        "The annual growth of loans to euro area households had remained broadly unchanged at 3.1% in November.",
        "Based on the January 2021 bank lending survey (BLS) for the euro area, credit standards for loans to firms had tightened in the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by banks’ heightened risk perceptions and concerns about borrowers’ creditworthiness.",
        "Banks expected a further tightening of credit standards for firms in the first quarter of 2021, reflecting continued uncertainty about the development of the pandemic and its effects on the credit risk of borrowers.",
        "Credit standards for loans to households for house purchase had continued to tighten in the fourth quarter of 2020, but less so than in the previous two quarters.",
        "Nominal costs of debt financing for non-financial corporations had been broadly unchanged in December, at historically low levels.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, the fiscal support planned for 2021 was sizeable, but would possibly be extended depending on the development of the pandemic against the background of strengthened and extended COVID-19-related restrictions.",
        "From 2021 the Next Generation EU (NGEU) package was expected to provide a strong contribution, particularly to public investment, if ambitious government plans were fulfilled.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane remarked that the launch of vaccination campaigns across the euro area was an important milestone in the resolution of the ongoing health crisis.",
        "However, the near-term outlook was challenging on account of the renewed surge in infections, the emergence of virus mutations and the more restrictive containment measures imposed in many euro area countries over the past few months.",
        "The high-frequency data and incoming survey indicators for the fourth quarter of 2020 and the initial weeks of 2021 signalled a significant weakening in the services sector, albeit to a lesser degree than during the first wave of the pandemic in spring 2020.",
        "Activity in the manufacturing sector had continued its recovery, supported by foreign demand.",
        "Output was likely to have contracted in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the intensification of the pandemic posed some downside risks to output in the first quarter of 2021.",
        "Looking beyond the first quarter, there were reasons for cautious optimism about the prospect of a recovery in the course of 2021.",
        "In addition to the roll-out of vaccination campaigns, there were signs of an improvement in the global economic outlook.",
        "Furthermore, the EU-UK trade deal was a positive development compared with the December 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "At the same time, uncertainty remained high, especially relating to the dynamics of the pandemic and the timely implementation of vaccination campaigns.",
        "Inflation remained subdued amid weak demand and significant slack in labour and product markets, with HICP and HICPX inflation unchanged in December at -0.3% and 0.2% respectively.",
        "Although headline inflation was likely to increase in the coming months on the basis of current energy price dynamics and supported in part by the end of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany, underlying price pressures were expected to remain muted owing to weak demand – notably in the tourism and travel-related sectors – as well as to low wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro.",
        "Survey-based measures and market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remained at low levels, although there had been a slight pick-up in market-based indicators of inflation expectations.",
        "Financial market sentiment had remained positive, underpinned by ample fiscal and monetary policy support and amid global reflation hopes that had been fuelled by expectations of substantial US fiscal stimulus.",
        "In currency markets, developments in the euro exchange rate should continue to be monitored with regard to their possible implications for the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In broad terms, financing conditions in the euro area were generally supportive for both the bond market and bank lending.",
        "Nonetheless, it was important to monitor the recent increase in nominal risk-free rates, which could be attributed to the spillover from the more substantial increase in US yields.",
        "Looking ahead, assessing the impact of upward pressure on nominal yields on the favourability of financing conditions would be an important task in the context of future updates to the inflation outlook.",
        "In assessing the favourability of financing conditions, it would also be important to bear in mind the continued net tightening of credit standards that had been reported in the January BLS.",
        "Ample monetary policy support remained essential.",
        "The comprehensive policy package announced in December would contribute to preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period.",
        "This would help to reduce uncertainty and bolster confidence, encouraging consumer spending and business investment, underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability.",
        "Overall, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remained tilted to the downside but had become less pronounced.",
        "The news about the global economy, the agreement on future EU-UK relations and the launch of vaccination campaigns was encouraging.",
        "However, the ongoing pandemic and its implications for economic and financial conditions continued to be sources of downside risk.",
        "Against this background, Mr Lane proposed that the Governing Council should reconfirm its existing monetary policy measures.",
        "In its communication, the Governing Council needed to: (i) highlight that the incoming data confirmed the December baseline assessment of a pronounced near-term impact of the pandemic on the economy and a protracted weakness in inflation; (ii) emphasise that ample monetary stimulus remained essential to preserve favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period for all sectors of the economy; (iii) stress that this would help to reduce uncertainty and bolster confidence, which would encourage consumer spending and business investment, underpin economic activity and safeguard medium-term price stability; (iv) reiterate that it would purchase flexibly under the PEPP, according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that was inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation; and (v) reiterate that it continued to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with the commitment to symmetry.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks to activity provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Overall, the incoming data confirmed the previous baseline assessment of a pronounced near-term impact of the pandemic on the economy and a protracted weakness in inflation.",
        "As regards the external environment, members also broadly shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction, that there were signs of an improvement in the global economic outlook.",
        "In particular, attention was drawn to positive news on the evolution of trade and growth in China and other Asian economies; to the additional US fiscal stimulus package and the final results of the US elections, which could lead to substantial further fiscal stimulus; and to the successful conclusion of an EU-UK trade agreement.",
        "On the geopolitical front, it appeared that there was less uncertainty on the whole.",
        "At the same time, the pandemic and the ongoing public health crisis continued to pose serious risks to the global economy.",
        "Turning to euro area developments, following a sharp contraction in the first half of 2020 euro area real GDP had rebounded strongly, rising by 12.4%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter, although remaining well below pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Members considered that incoming economic data, surveys and high-frequency indicators suggested that the resurgence of the pandemic and the associated intensification of containment measures had likely led to a decline in activity in the fourth quarter of 2020, although this was less pronounced than had been envisaged in the December 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "Conversely, the recent intensification of the pandemic was expected to weigh more heavily on activity in the first quarter of 2021 than had been foreseen earlier.",
        "However, taking the two quarters together, developments remained broadly in line with the December baseline projection overall.",
        "It was also recalled that an extension of the containment measures beyond the fourth quarter of 2020 had been incorporated into the December staff projections.",
        "However, it was highlighted that in response to the increase in cases of infection further measures had been taken, or had been announced, in many euro area countries, which had led to tighter restrictions than had been anticipated in the December projections.",
        "Moreover, it was argued that the fast rebound in growth foreseen in the December staff projections might be too optimistic, with growth in the second quarter of 2021 possibly at risk from extended lockdowns.",
        "In addition, vaccination roll-outs were proving to be slow and concern was also expressed about the possible impact of the spread of new, more virulent, mutations of the virus, which had proliferated following the December holiday period.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that the economic costs of containment measures were now lower than in spring 2020, as the measures were more targeted and firms had learned to better adjust to the restrictions.",
        "In addition, it was emphasised that although containment measures were stricter, governments were also providing more fiscal support, which would cushion the short-term impact of tighter restrictions.",
        "While the delay in the vaccination roll-outs relative to earlier expectations was likely to contribute to longer-lasting restrictions, this could be attributed mainly to logistics and was seen as affecting the time frame, rather than changing the picture substantially.",
        "It was underlined that economic developments continued to be uneven across sectors, with the services sector being more adversely affected by the new restrictions on social interaction and mobility than the industrial sector.",
        "There was also heterogeneity across euro area countries.",
        "Although fiscal policy measures were continuing to support households and firms, consumers were seen as remaining cautious in the light of the pandemic and its impact on employment and earnings.",
        "However, reference was also made to the high level of accumulated household savings and the potential pent-up demand, which would contribute to a swift rebound in consumption once containment measures were eased.",
        "At the same time, weaker corporate balance sheets and uncertainty about the economic outlook were seen to be still weighing on business investment.",
        "Members highlighted the dichotomy between risks to the short-term outlook and more positive developments in the medium term.",
        "The roll-out of vaccines, which had started in late December, allowed for greater confidence in the resolution of the health crisis.",
        "However, it would take time until widespread immunity was achieved, and further setbacks related to the pandemic could not be ruled out.",
        "So far the improvement in the macroeconomic outlook appeared to be driven more by external factors than by domestic factors, which was beneficial for the euro area as an open economy, particularly for the manufacturing sector.",
        "Looking ahead, the recovery of the euro area economy should be supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a recovery in demand as containment measures were lifted and uncertainty receded.",
        "However, reference was also made in the discussion to the continued risk of a cliff-edge effect from a premature removal of fiscal stimulus as well as from weaker corporate and banking sector balance sheets, given the risk of a surge in corporate insolvencies and non-performing loans.",
        "Overall, members assessed that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remained tilted to the downside but had become less pronounced compared with the situation in the autumn prior to the news on vaccines.",
        "Improved prospects for the global economy, the agreement on future EU-UK relations and the start of vaccination campaigns were encouraging, but the ongoing pandemic and its implications for economic and financial conditions continued to be sources of downside risk.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance was seen as remaining critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy.",
        "To this end, continued support from national fiscal policies was warranted, given weak demand from firms and households related to the worsening of the pandemic and the intensification of containment measures.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should, as much as possible, remain targeted and temporary in nature.",
        "There was also concern that although European leaders had agreed to deliver the largest support package ever financed by the EU budget, progress on implementation was slow and challenging.",
        "The key role of the Next Generation EU package was underlined, as was the importance of it becoming operational without delay.",
        "Member States were called upon to accelerate the ratification process, to finalise their recovery and resilience plans promptly and to deploy the funds for productive public spending, accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural policies.",
        "This would allow the Next Generation EU programme to contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery and would increase economic resilience and the growth potential of Member States’ economies, thereby also supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area.",
        "Such structural policies were particularly important in addressing long-standing structural and institutional weaknesses and in accelerating the green and digital transitions.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Euro area annual inflation had remained unchanged at -0.3% in December.",
        "On the basis of current energy price dynamics, headline inflation was likely to increase in the coming months, in part supported by the end of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany.",
        "However, underlying price pressures were expected to remain subdued owing to weak demand, notably in the tourism and travel-related sectors, as well as to low wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro.",
        "Once the impact of the pandemic had faded, a recovery in demand, supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, would put upward pressure on inflation over the medium term.",
        "Survey-based measures and market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remained at low levels, although market-based indicators of inflation expectations had increased slightly.",
        "In discussing recent inflation developments, members agreed that, while broadly in line with the December 2020 staff projections, headline inflation was at a very low level and in December underlying inflation had reached a historical low.",
        "Although stronger global demand and higher commodity prices would help to push up inflation, price pressures generally remained subdued so that achieving a robust convergence to the ECB’s medium-term inflation aim remained a challenge, with favourable developments for the economy and inflation all being contingent on progress in curbing the spread of the pandemic.",
        "It was emphasised that the medium-term outlook for inflation was surrounded by a high level of uncertainty, given the unprecedented pandemic situation and long-standing questions about changes in the underlying determinants of inflation.",
        "This elevated uncertainty was related not only to the strength of the post-pandemic economic recovery, but also to the relative importance of demand versus supply factors in different sectors of the economy and to questions about the strength of pass-through from financing conditions to inflation.",
        "In addition, there continued to be acute measurement issues related to the relevant weights in the price indices during the pandemic period.",
        "The projected gradual recovery in inflation in the baseline scenario was seen to remain broadly valid, but it was highlighted that inflation was only projected to be 1.4% in 2023.",
        "At the same time, there appeared to be little risk of deflation at this juncture, with inflation expected to rise in the short term owing to higher energy prices and the reversal of a temporary tax reduction in one jurisdiction, together with the rapid recovery in activity expected after restrictions were lifted.",
        "It could also not be ruled out that in the course of 2021 inflation dynamics might be stronger than foreseen in the projections, at least temporarily, in the light of global developments and especially if there was a stronger than expected rebound in activity in the second half of the year.",
        "The point was made, however, that such a temporary boost to inflation should not be mistaken for a sustained increase, which was still likely to emerge only slowly.",
        "Members reviewed the latest exchange rate developments, noting that the recent persistent trend appreciation of the euro had reversed since the start of 2021.",
        "Possible adverse implications of a further appreciation of the euro for the inflation outlook were reiterated.",
        "It was noted that the nominal effective exchange rate was at a historically high level and had already had a negative impact on inflation, although it was also highlighted that the impact of exchange rate movements on inflation might be overestimated in standard models.",
        "Regarding recent developments in inflation expectations members noted that, according to the ECB’s latest SPF, longer-term inflation expectations were unchanged, at 1.7%, while market-based indicators of inflation expectations had increased.",
        "The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead now stood at 1.32%, i.e.",
        "back at pre-pandemic levels.",
        "It was regarded as positive that the pandemic had barely affected longer-term inflation expectations and, given the adaptive nature of inflation expectations, it was argued that an increase in inflation could have a positive impact on inflation expectations in the future.",
        "It was also noted, however, that the increase in market-based measures in the euro area was mainly due to global factors.",
        "Turning to the monetary analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The annual growth rates of broad money (M3) and narrow money (M1) had been high in November, at 11.0% and 14.5%, respectively.",
        "It was highlighted that recent money growth had been mainly due to the Eurosystem’s ongoing asset purchases, with monetary dynamics therefore driven more by developments on the asset side than on the liability side of the Eurosystem balance sheet.",
        "Attention was drawn to the recent developments in loans to the private sector, which had been characterised by moderate lending to non-financial corporations and resilient lending to households.",
        "It was noted that, at 6.9%, the annual growth rate of lending to non-financial corporations appeared robust.",
        "However, this was mainly reflecting the very strong increase in lending in the first half of the year while the monthly lending flows had moderated since the end of the summer, which could translate into weak investment dynamics over time.",
        "However, it was also argued that firms had built up sizeable precautionary buffers and the recent slowdown in credit should not be interpreted as the start of a financial amplification cycle.",
        "At the same time, concerns were expressed about a possible deterioration in firms’ financial positions looking ahead, as and when public support measures were phased out.",
        "Views were exchanged on the interpretation of the results of the bank lending survey (BLS) for the fourth quarter of 2020, which reported a continued net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms.",
        "This tightening was mainly driven by heightened risk perceptions among banks, in a context of continued uncertainty about the economic recovery and concerns about borrower creditworthiness.",
        "It was underlined that in the perception of banks the recession seemed to be harming the creditworthiness of non-financial companies, as crisis-related bankruptcies could trigger a surge in non-performing loans (NPLs) when payment holidays and moratoria expired.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that the results of the BLS warranted careful monitoring as they could signal a further tightening ahead with corresponding negative consequences for credit flows and economic activity.",
        "In addition, the results highlighted the role of structural weaknesses in the euro area banking sector, such as overcapacity, high NPLs, low profitability and slow progress on digitalisation.",
        "On the other hand, it was recalled that reported credit standards had tightened much less than in previous crisis episodes, while state-guaranteed loans had led to a significant relaxation of credit standards in the second quarter and the recent tightening thus could be interpreted as a return to more normal conditions.",
        "Members took note of the assessments of financial and financing conditions provided by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane in their introductions, which had remained favourable since the Governing Council’s meeting in December, also on account of the ECB’s recalibrated monetary policy package, which had been well received by financial markets.",
        "Financial markets had remained calm, with several standard indicators of financial conditions signalling a degree of accommodation comparable to, or higher than, that prevailing at the start of the pandemic.",
        "Although euro area risk-free rates had risen slightly since the December meeting, sovereign and credit spreads had been resilient, bond market conditions had remained favourable – also for corporate bonds – and bank lending rates were close to their historical lows for both households and firms.",
        "When taking the increase in market-based inflation expectations into account, real yields were at historical lows.",
        "It was observed that expectations of substantial US fiscal support had led to a steepening of the US Treasury yield curve, which had only affected yields in the euro area to a limited extent, as a significant “decoupling” of yields could be observed.",
        "Moreover, euro area stock prices had increased further since the December meeting, while the euro exchange rate was broadly stable amid some volatility.",
        "It was noted that staff analysis suggested that recent exchange rate developments had been driven less by policy shocks and more by global risk sentiment.",
        "Concerns were voiced, however, over developments in the exchange rate that might have negative implications for euro area financial conditions and, ultimately, consequences for the inflation outlook.",
        "Members agreed that ample monetary stimulus remained essential to preserve favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period.",
        "Overall, the monetary policy stance was assessed to have remained very accommodative and to have helped preserve the favourable financing conditions that were necessary to counter the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation.",
        "Recent financial market developments confirmed that the Governing Council’s decision to focus on the extended duration of the pandemic emergency measures, the preservation of favourable financing conditions and the flexibility of the PEPP had so far proven effective.",
        "The view was held that favourable financing conditions needed to prevail for some time in order to provide continued support to the flow of credit to all sectors of the economy and to counter possible macro-financial amplification effects.",
        "Against this background it was recalled that the projected path of inflation in the December Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections continued to be distant from the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "While the December package had been calibrated with the objective to counter the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation, the view was held that the Governing Council should allow real interest rates to decline if financing conditions eased on account of an increase in inflation expectations.",
        "As the inflation outlook was falling significantly short of the Governing Council’s aim, lower real yields would provide additional support for a faster return to price stability.",
        "At the same time, it was maintained that not every increase in nominal yields should be interpreted as an unwarranted tightening of financing conditions and trigger a corresponding policy response.",
        "It was noted that nominal yields were not an appropriate benchmark for assessing whether financing conditions remained favourable, as they could rise because of a better economic outlook and higher inflation expectations.",
        "What mattered from a monetary policy perspective was the evolution of real rates, which had declined to record low levels in recent weeks.",
        "Overall, it was widely felt that the recalibration of instruments decided on in December remained appropriate and well-balanced, while all instruments needed to remain on the table, with due consideration of benefits and possible unintended side effects.",
        "It was also emphasised that a holistic approach was needed when defining the relevant range of financing conditions to be targeted in a broad and flexible manner, for all sectors of the economy, private and public.",
        "It should also comprise bank lending rates, as well as credit volumes and conditions for households and firms, take into account economic and market developments, and ultimately be anchored in the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "All members agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to reconfirm the existing monetary policy measures.",
        "It was argued that monetary policy should keep a steady hand and that the measures that were put in place in December should be given time to take full effect.",
        "Moreover, the economic outlook was judged to be evolving broadly in line with the December Eurosystem staff projections, and the present configuration of monetary policy tools was deemed supportive and flexible enough to address the current situation.",
        "Overall, members also widely agreed that there was no room for complacency and that the Governing Council had to continue to stand ready and use all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure a robust convergence of inflation towards its aim.",
        "Members agreed that the monetary measures in place, including those adopted since the onset of the pandemic, were effective and proportionate in supporting growth and inflation, and that the balance of the benefits and costs remained positive.",
        "The purchases under the PEPP contributed to preserving favourable financing conditions for all sectors, while the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) remained an attractive source of funding for banks, supporting bank lending to firms and households.",
        "The continued reinvestments of principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP and the asset purchase programme (APP) were enhancing favourable financing conditions by signalling a continued presence of the Eurosystem in the markets over the pandemic period and beyond.",
        "The purchases under the PEPP would continue to be conducted flexibly according to market conditions to preserve favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period with a view to countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation.",
        "In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions would continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy.",
        "In this regard, the dual role of the PEPP was stressed.",
        "As regards communication, members broadly agreed with the elements proposed by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "On the one hand, it was deemed important to stress that the current inflation outlook remained disappointing with an inflation rate well below 2% in the baseline scenario.",
        "On the other hand, a balanced presentation of the outlook was called for, as some uncertainties regarding the international developments had been resolved in a more positive way than expected.",
        "In this context, it had to be emphasised that the measures put in place were appropriate in view of the current outlook but were also designed to react flexibly and equally to either potentially less favourable developments or upside surprises.",
        "It was seen as essential to convey that the Governing Council was committed to maintaining a steady presence in the markets to ensure favourable financing conditions.",
        "Moreover, the point was made that the Governing Council needed to stress that there was no room for complacency.",
        "It was also felt that the Governing Council should reiterate its vigilance with regard to developments in the exchange rate and their implications for the inflation outlook.",
        "In addition, the Governing Council needed to state that it continued to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, including the deposit facility rate (DFR), as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved toward its aim in a sustained manner.",
        "Finally, in view of the sharp contraction of the euro area economy it was deemed important for the Governing Council to emphasise the need for continued and ambitious fiscal policies to support the recovery.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council decided to reconfirm its very accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "First, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it had seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence had been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.",
        "Second, the Governing Council would continue the purchases under the PEPP with a total envelope of €1,850 billion.",
        "The Governing Council would conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until it judged that the coronavirus crisis phase was over.",
        "The purchases under the PEPP would be conducted to preserve favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period.",
        "If favourable financing conditions could be maintained with asset purchase flows that did not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full.",
        "Equally, the envelope could be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.",
        "The Governing Council would continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023.",
        "In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio would be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "Third, net purchases under the APP would continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion.",
        "The Governing Council continued to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it started raising the key ECB interest rates.",
        "The Governing Council also intended to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Finally, the Governing Council would continue to provide ample liquidity through its refinancing operations.",
        "In particular, the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) remained an attractive source of funding for banks, supporting bank lending to firms and households.",
        "The Governing Council continued to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 21-22 July 2021.",
        "The pronounced decline in ten-year US Treasury yields and euro area GDP-weighted sovereign yields observed just before the previous Governing Council meeting had proven persistent despite the ongoing recovery from the pandemic crisis.",
        "More recently, yields had been trending somewhat higher but, overall, they had not risen back to the levels seen during the last recovery in 2017-18, or even to the levels seen earlier in 2021.",
        "Very low interest rates also continued to prevail across the currency union.",
        "Sovereign bond spreads over German Bunds had remained resilient at levels below or close to post-2008 lows.",
        "The decomposition of nominal ten-year euro area overnight index swap (OIS) rates into their inflation and real rate components showed that market-based measures of inflation compensation had continued to increase over the summer.",
        "This had been putting upward pressure on nominal rates as was to be expected at this stage of the economic cycle.",
        "Based on the developments in inflation expectations alone, the nominal ten-year OIS yields would be 65 basis points above the level prevailing at the time of the monetary policy meeting on 9-10 December 2020, at which the Governing Council had pledged to preserve favourable financing conditions.",
        "But a significant parallel decline in real interest rates had offset a large part of the rise in nominal yields.",
        "The real ten-year risk-free rate in the euro area had reached yet another record low over the summer.",
        "At below -1.8 per cent, it currently stood at an exceptional distance from its average level since the outbreak of the global financial crisis.",
        "The factors that might help explain the current low real yields remained the subject of intense market speculation.",
        "Two factors were mentioned most frequently by analysts.",
        "The first related to the spread of the Delta virus variant, which had started to affect mobility in some regions.",
        "However, to the extent that lower real yields reflected concerns about growth, this pointed to a decoupling between bond markets on the one hand and stock markets on the other hand.",
        "Despite rising infection numbers, stock markets had continued their rally over the summer as earnings expectations continued to increase.",
        "The EURO STOXX was up by another 5.5 per cent since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "Indices across the euro area had made broad gains.",
        "Euro area corporate bond spreads, too, had remained resilient throughout the past few months, with spreads remaining close to the lows observed over the past decade, despite higher leverage.",
        "Corporate bond spreads had recently also been supported by favourable rating actions.",
        "Credit rating upgrades had outpaced downgrades by a substantial margin in the third quarter of 2021.",
        "The second factor that could help explain current low real yields related to the possibility that the market may have recently reappraised the way central banks would adjust policy rates.",
        "There were some indications that the relationship between expected inflation and expected future interest rates might have changed since the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, especially in the euro area.",
        "This suggested that the market may have started internalising a more patient reaction function of the ECB with respect to the conditions that the Governing Council needed to see in order to start raising policy rates.",
        "There was also evidence that, after the announcement of the ECB’s new forward guidance, the top of the risk distribution around the future evolution of the three-month EURIBOR had been truncated, meaning that investors had effectively priced out contingencies that foreshadowed a very steep increase in policy rates.",
        "The compression of the risk distribution in response to the ECB’s new strategy and the revised forward guidance had initially also further flattened the forward curve.",
        "The forward curve had shifted outwards visibly after the strategy announcement, but had retraced its path more recently.",
        "The most recent Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) suggested that the ECB’s new forward guidance was likely to have contributed to the initial outward shift.",
        "Model-based evidence corroborated the view that monetary policy had been putting downward pressure on yields in recent months.",
        "In particular, the model results suggested that since the announcement of the ECB’s new strategy, and again after the announcement of the ECB’s new forward guidance, monetary policy had consistently been putting downward pressure on long-term risk-free rates.",
        "However, this contribution had softened in recent weeks.",
        "The resistance of global sovereign bond yields to moving higher had occurred in an environment of investors pricing in risks of higher inflation in the future.",
        "Option prices suggested that, in the United States, the market currently attached a probability of around 80 per cent to inflation over the next five years being, on average, above the Federal Reserve System’s 2 per cent target.",
        "In the euro area, the market-implied probabilities were considerably smaller, but had also increased notably to above 30 per cent.",
        "In euro area bond markets, model-based analysis also suggested that the inflation risk premium had increased significantly since the start of the year, albeit from very depressed levels, implying that the compensation that investors currently required for this risk still remained small by historical standards.",
        "Finally, prospects of higher interest rates in the United States had caused sizeable shifts in foreign exchange markets, with investors having increased their US dollar net long positions since about June 2021 to levels similar in magnitude to those seen at the heights of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.",
        "In August the euro had temporarily reached the lowest level against the US dollar in almost a year, as expected short-term interest rate differentials between the United States and the euro area had widened.",
        "The euro had moderately appreciated since then.",
        "Overall, financial conditions had eased since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting in July and also since the last comprehensive joint assessment of the inflation outlook and financing conditions in June, as indicated by a range of financial condition indices.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and the recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "As regards the external environment, the persistence of supply bottlenecks and the spread of the Delta variant remained concerns.",
        "With respect to global activity, the global Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) were retreating after a period of strong increases, indicating a degree of normalisation, while remaining overall above the threshold of 50, indicating continued expansion.",
        "Looking at developments in PMIs for activity by region, a gap between developments in advanced and emerging economies was opening up.",
        "As regards developments in global trade, world merchandise imports were broadly stable in June after declining in the previous two months.",
        "Bottlenecks, which were also reflected by increases in suppliers’ delivery times, could be linked to losses in exports.",
        "Since the July Governing Council monetary policy meeting, the euro exchange rate had declined by 0.4 per cent in nominal effective terms, while increasing by 0.6 per cent against the US dollar.",
        "Oil prices were broadly unchanged (up by 0.7 per cent) amid still heightened uncertainty about the outlook for global oil demand and supply.",
        "Turning to the euro area, the rebound in demand was continuing, while supply bottlenecks were constraining the production of goods.",
        "GDP growth in the second quarter of 2021 was 2.2 per cent, which was substantially stronger than the 1.4 per cent foreseen in the June Eurosystem staff projections, showing that the European economy had already recovered far more than previously expected.",
        "This rebound was driven by an increase in domestic demand, which was in turn linked to the rapid reopening of high-contact services.",
        "Moreover, containment measures had had a less negative impact on economic growth than had been anticipated, which indicated stronger learning effects.",
        "The September 2021 ECB staff projections foresaw the swift economic rebound persisting during the second half of 2021, driven by a reopening of the economy, continued strong policy support and a global recovery.",
        "Growth was projected to remain very strong in 2022 before slowing down in 2023.",
        "Compared with the June 2021 Eurosystem staff projections, real GDP growth had been revised up for 2021 and was broadly unchanged for 2022 and 2023.",
        "The date by which real GDP was projected to reach pre-crisis levels again had been brought forward by one quarter to the end of 2021.",
        "The latest quarterly business survey from the European Commission confirmed that developments in activity in the industrial sector were heavily affected by shortages of materials, space and equipment, which were less important factors for services.",
        "A lack of demand was no longer seen to be an issue in both manufacturing and services.",
        "While labour shortages had not played an important role earlier in the pandemic, in manufacturing they had started to emerge and labour had also become scarcer in services.",
        "Consumer confidence had improved, but it remained unclear how this would map into consumer spending as households were not reporting an improvement in their personal economic situation to the same degree.",
        "Developments in household bank deposits as an up-to-date, high-frequency proxy for savings showed that households continued to save less than during the height of the pandemic.",
        "Looking at investment, strong demand was supported by a rapid recovery in spending on housing and on business investment, which had also led to an increase in demand for external financing for investment.",
        "On the trade front, growth in extra-euro area goods exports had flattened in the second quarter of 2021, partly owing to supply bottlenecks which had dampened trade dynamics.",
        "At the same time, indicators for services exports had signalled a further improvement driven by a steady recovery in tourism, which was an important component of cross-border trade for many countries.",
        "Overall, tourism was not yet back to pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Intra-EU flights had recovered significantly but extra-EU flights were still far below pre-pandemic levels, in part reflecting continued restrictions on extra-EU travel.",
        "Regarding the labour market, the rebound was continuing and some labour shortages had been emerging.",
        "The unemployment rate had declined in July to 7.6 per cent, which was 0.2 percentage points lower than in June and 0.2 percentage points higher than in February 2020 before the pandemic started.",
        "The importance of job retention schemes had continued to decrease in recent months, but they still provided a substantial degree of support to the labour market, covering around 3 per cent of the labour force in July.",
        "Employment surveys signalled a robust recovery in the labour market.",
        "The PMI composite employment index remained well above the threshold of 50.",
        "Many firms reported in the European Commission’s business survey for the third quarter of 2021 that they were finding it increasingly difficult to meet their demand for labour.",
        "Turning to nominal developments, headline inflation had increased to 3.0 per cent in August, from 2.2 per cent in July.",
        "The increase reflected higher inflation in all the components, in particular non-energy industrial goods (NEIG), while services inflation had remained more subdued.",
        "High NEIG inflation partly reflected pipeline pressures.",
        "However, the unusually high rates of inflation were assessed to be largely temporary.",
        "In the September ECB staff projections, headline inflation was projected to rise further until the end of this year and then to fall back in the first half of 2022 before gradually strengthening from mid-2022.",
        "Compared with the June 2021 Eurosystem staff projections, the September projections for inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had been revised up, mainly driven by higher energy inflation in the first half of the horizon.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food had also been revised up owing to pressures along the pricing chain amid mismatches in demand and supply, less slack and the weaker euro.",
        "Comparing the September ECB staff projections with forecasts from other international institutions and the private sector indicated that the ECB staff projections for both growth and inflation were above other forecasts for the early part of the horizon, but broadly in line with other forecasts for 2023.",
        "Temporary and special effects had continued to have a substantial impact on inflation dynamics in recent months, complicating the assessment of the inflation figures.",
        "These effects included shifts in seasonal sales, base effects and also the effects of the change in HICP weights at the beginning of 2021, which varied over time.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation, comprising a broad range of indicators, were by and large moving gradually upwards, which gave grounds for confidence that the negative pandemic shock of last year was being reversed and hope that upward pressure would continue.",
        "But underlying inflation remained at subdued levels and quite far away from 2 per cent.",
        "Services inflation had increased, driven mainly (according to data available up to July) by the reopening of the high-contact sector.",
        "Regarding wage developments, compensation per employee had increased in the second quarter of 2021, rising by 8 per cent in year-on-year terms, largely as a result of base effects owing to the extreme developments in the second quarter of last year, reflecting a normalisation of work patterns rather than an increase in negotiated wages.",
        "Overall, wage pressures remained low and quite heterogenous across countries.",
        "Growth in the GDP deflator for the euro area had moderated in the second quarter to 0.55 per cent, after reaching 1.57 per cent in the first quarter of 2021.",
        "Overall, the reduction in the growth rate of the GDP deflator reflected developments in the terms of trade and more precisely a sharp increase in import prices.",
        "PMI survey data on input and output price developments indicated that profit margins continued to be under pressure, mainly driven by increases in input costs.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation compensation in the euro area had increased since the July Governing Council meeting, but remained below 2 per cent.",
        "Regarding financial and monetary developments, market interest rates were somewhat higher than at the time of the July monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council.",
        "Risk asset markets had been largely resilient, with equity prices reaching record highs.",
        "Overall, financial conditions had eased and broad financing conditions for firms, households and the public sector remained favourable.",
        "With respect to monetary developments, firms’ borrowing costs continued to be accommodative, while balance sheet conditions remained fragile and heterogeneous.",
        "Euro area bank lending rates stood on average close to their early 2020 values, while they had decreased more in countries more affected by the pandemic.",
        "The annual growth of lending to firms had remained moderate in July, at broadly the same pace as in June, reflecting benign factors such as a recovery in earnings.",
        "Bank profitability had recovered partially compared with last year, which was in part linked to some reductions in risk provisions thanks to the better than expected macroeconomic outlook.",
        "In parallel, bank funding costs had decreased, reflecting low bank bond yields, substantial participation in the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III), and continuing downward pressure from ample deposits.",
        "Looking at sectoral deposit flows and broad money (M3), in recent months households’ and firms’ monthly flows into deposits had returned to their long-term averages for the first time since the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis, thus leading to a further moderation in overall monetary dynamics.",
        "This could be seen as a further sign of normalisation.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, it was important to recall that in the September ECB staff projections the fiscal stimulus for 2021 was expected to be around double the size of the stimulus included in the December 2020 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "After the record fiscal response to the COVID-19 crisis, the September baseline projections continued to show a strong improvement in the fiscal outlook over the projection horizon, especially over 2022-23 – reversing the fiscal impulse.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane remarked that the rebound phase in the recovery of the euro area economy was increasingly advanced.",
        "Output had risen in the second quarter by more than expected, and it was likely to exceed its pre-pandemic level by the end of the year.",
        "With more than 70 per cent of European adults fully vaccinated, there had been an extensive reopening of the economy and the services sector was recovering (if still unevenly).",
        "Manufacturing continued to perform solidly, even though materials shortages and supplier bottlenecks were holding back production.",
        "The pick-up in activity was fostering a rapid improvement in the labour market.",
        "While further normalisation of economic activity could be expected in the coming months, the global spread of the Delta virus variant and concerns about the longer-term effectiveness of vaccinations could yet delay the full restoration of global economic activity and the full reopening of the euro area economy.",
        "In line with this assessment, the September 2021 ECB staff projections foresaw growth of 5.0 per cent in 2021 (which was higher than previously anticipated) and broadly unchanged growth of 4.6 per cent in 2022 and 2.1 per cent in 2023.",
        "HICP inflation had increased to 3.0 per cent in August from 2.2 per cent in July.",
        "The increase reflected higher prices in all components but was especially strong in the NEIG category.",
        "This notable upswing in inflation was assessed as largely temporary.",
        "Higher energy inflation reflected a higher than usual month-on-month increase in energy prices in August and the strong rise in oil prices since around the middle of last year.",
        "The reversal of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany would affect year-on-year inflation rates until the end of this year.",
        "The increase in NEIG inflation had been partly due to a base effect caused by the postponement of seasonal sales last year from July to August in some countries.",
        "The higher cost pressures stemming from temporary shortages of materials and equipment could be expected to ease.",
        "As a result, while headline inflation was likely to rise further this year, these factors should ease or would fall out of the year-on-year inflation calculation by early 2022.",
        "The September projections foresaw HICP inflation at an average of 2.2 per cent in 2021, before returning to 1.7 per cent in 2022 and 1.5 per cent in 2023.",
        "Compared with the June 2021 projections, headline inflation had been revised up throughout the projection horizon.",
        "Inflation excluding food and energy prices was projected to average 1.3 per cent in 2021, 1.4 per cent in 2022 and 1.5 per cent in 2023, having also been revised up from the June 2021 projections.",
        "While the negative impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path had still not been fully reversed and inflation was still foreseen to remain far below the two per cent target over the projection horizon, the upward shift in the revised inflation projections reflected the better growth outlook and a faster reduction in the degree of slack in the economy.",
        "Risks to the economic outlook remained broadly balanced.",
        "A larger than expected decrease in the savings rate and a faster improvement in the pandemic situation could lead to a stronger expansion than currently envisaged.",
        "Inflation could be slightly higher than currently expected if supply bottlenecks were to last longer and feed through into higher than anticipated wage rises.",
        "At the same time, the economic outlook could deteriorate if the pandemic worsened, which could delay the further reopening of the economy, or if supply shortages turned out to be more persistent than currently expected.",
        "According to a broad spectrum of indicators, financing conditions had remained favourable since the Governing Council’s previous quarterly assessment in June.",
        "While there had been a decline over the summer, the recent repricing of debt securities meant that long-term market interest rates were now at similar levels to those prevailing at the time of the previous quarterly assessment in June.",
        "Preserving favourable financing conditions remained necessary to support the economy on its recovery path.",
        "A sustained pace of net purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), along with the other instruments and the recalibrated forward guidance, was an essential condition for preserving a monetary policy stance that would offset the negative impact of the pandemic on inflation and thereby support the re-anchoring of inflation solidly around the new target over the medium term.",
        "At the same time, in line with the PEPP framework adopted in December and the Governing Council’s commitment to pursuing a monetary policy stance that was always proportionate to its objective, persistently favourable financing conditions in a context of a somewhat improved medium-term outlook for inflation and increasing inflation expectations made it possible to scale down moderately the pace of purchases under the PEPP in the last few months of the year.",
        "While a substantially lower pace of purchases under the PEPP than had been implemented in recent months could risk an unwarranted tightening in market interest rates (with associated currency appreciation) that would be inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation, a pace of net purchases that was moderately lower was the proportionate measure that, at the current juncture, could “lock in” the amount of monetary accommodation that was still necessary.",
        "Based on the above, Mr Lane proposed for the fourth quarter that net purchases under the PEPP be calibrated at a moderately lower pace than in the previous two quarters.",
        "The monthly purchase pace would continue to be implemented flexibly according to market conditions, to react to short-term shocks exerting upward pressure on benchmark interest rates or, likewise, to allow the rate of purchases to be reduced if favourable conditions could be maintained with an even lower pace.",
        "Furthermore, Mr Lane emphasised that the Governing Council also needed to confirm all of its other monetary policy measures, namely the level of the key ECB interest rates, its forward guidance on their likely future evolution, its purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), its reinvestment policies and its longer-term refinancing operations.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks to the outlook provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The rebound phase in the recovery of the euro area economy was increasingly advanced.",
        "Output was expected to exceed its pre-pandemic level by the end of the year.",
        "With more than 70 per cent of European adults fully vaccinated, the economy had largely reopened, allowing consumers to spend more and companies to increase production.",
        "While rising immunity to the coronavirus meant that the impact of the pandemic was now less severe, the global spread of the Delta variant could yet delay the full reopening of the economy.",
        "The current increase in inflation was expected to be largely temporary and underlying price pressures were building up only slowly.",
        "The inflation outlook in the new staff projections had been revised slightly upwards, but in the medium term inflation was foreseen to remain well below the ECB’s two per cent target.",
        "As regards the external environment, members broadly shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction that the recovery in global economic activity and trade remained solid but was moderating, owing to the further spread of the Delta variant and to supply bottlenecks.",
        "Attention was drawn to the risks to the outlook arising from comparatively lower vaccination rates and the worsening of the pandemic in emerging market economies in recent months relative to advanced economies, which could lead to more persistent or more widespread disruptions to supply chains.",
        "Turning to euro area developments, real GDP had rebounded by 2.2 per cent in the second quarter of the year, which was more than had been expected, and was on track for strong growth in the third quarter.",
        "The recovery built on the success of the vaccination campaigns in Europe, which had allowed a significant reopening of the economy.",
        "Members broadly agreed with the improvement in the euro area growth outlook included in the new projections and expressed a greater degree of confidence in the baseline scenario, while acknowledging that uncertainty remained elevated.",
        "With the lifting of restrictions, the services sector was benefiting from people returning to shops and restaurants and from the rebound in travel and tourism.",
        "Manufacturing was performing strongly, even though production continued to be held back by shortages of materials and equipment.",
        "Overall, recent developments indicated that economic activity could be expected to return to its pre-crisis level in the fourth quarter of the year – a quarter earlier than had been expected in the June 2021 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "The output gap was also expected to close sooner than previously expected.",
        "However, there remained some way to go before the damage to the economy caused by the pandemic was overcome.",
        "There were still more than two million fewer people employed than before the pandemic, especially among the younger and lower skilled, and the number of workers in job retention schemes also remained substantial.",
        "Members assessed the risks to the economic outlook as broadly balanced.",
        "On the upside, economic activity could outperform expectations if consumers became more confident and saved less than currently expected.",
        "It was noted that consumer spending was increasing and savings appeared to be returning to normal more quickly than had been expected, although consumers remained somewhat cautious in the light of the pandemic developments.",
        "Households were benefiting not only from accumulated savings, but possibly also from positive wealth effects given the significant rise in prices for financial assets and real estate.",
        "The labour market was also improving rapidly, holding out the prospect of higher incomes and greater spending.",
        "Unemployment was declining and the number of people in job retention schemes had fallen significantly from the peak in 2020.",
        "The recovery in domestic and global demand was further boosting optimism among firms, which was supporting business investment.",
        "A faster improvement in the pandemic situation could also lead to a stronger expansion than currently envisaged.",
        "Regarding possible downside risks, it was underlined that the economic outlook could deteriorate if the pandemic worsened, which could delay the further reopening of the economy, or if supply shortages turned out to be more persistent than currently expected and held back production.",
        "It could not be excluded that the shortages and bottlenecks observed so far would not only last longer but might also affect more economies and further sectors.",
        "However, the point was made that some moderation in growth was naturally to be expected, in line with the experience of other reopening economies.",
        "The spread of the Delta variant had so far not required lockdown measures to be reimposed.",
        "Nevertheless, it could slow the recovery in global trade and the full reopening of the economy.",
        "Although the economy had shown more resilience to new waves of the virus in recent quarters, the recovery remained dependent on the evolution of the pandemic and on the progress made with vaccination campaigns.",
        "The assumed timing of a relaxation of containment measures had been pushed back in almost every projection round.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, members stressed that, to support the recovery, ambitious, targeted and coordinated fiscal policy should continue to complement monetary policy.",
        "In particular, the Next Generation EU programme would help ensure a stronger and uniform recovery across euro area countries.",
        "It would also accelerate the green and digital transitions, support structural reforms and lift long-term growth.",
        "While fiscal policy was expected to be expansionary in 2021 and 2022, members considered that the prospects for 2023 were more uncertain.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Inflation had increased to 3.0 per cent in August.",
        "It was expected to rise further during the autumn but to decline in 2022.",
        "This temporary upswing in inflation mainly reflected the strong increase in oil prices since the middle of 2020, the reversal of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany, delayed summer sales in 2020 and cost pressures that stemmed from temporary shortages of materials and equipment.",
        "In the course of 2022 these factors should ease or would fall out of the year-on-year inflation calculation.",
        "Underlying inflation pressures had edged up.",
        "As the economy recovered further, underlying inflation was expected to rise over the medium term.",
        "This increase was expected to be only gradual since it would take time for the economy to return to operating at full capacity.",
        "Wages were therefore expected to grow only moderately.",
        "However, if supply bottlenecks lasted longer and fed through into higher than anticipated wage rises, price pressures could be more persistent.",
        "Members agreed with the hump-shaped pattern of inflation in the September ECB staff projections and generally concurred that higher short-term inflation was largely temporary.",
        "At the same time, they considered that the degree of persistence of the inflation shock and, especially, the outlook for inflation in 2023 were more uncertain, with the risk that inflation in 2023 might turn out to be higher than projected.",
        "In this context, the view was also expressed that the baseline projection for inflation in 2023 was too low.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that both headline and core inflation had surprised to the upside relative to recent projections, with inflation being underestimated for some time.",
        "This raised doubts about how well the models relied on in the projections were able to capture what was currently happening in the economy, the structural changes implied by the pandemic and the impact of the ECB’s new monetary policy strategy.",
        "Closer attention needed to be paid to direct and granular evidence, such as data collected from businesses, unions and households.",
        "This was seen as essential around turning points and in periods of possible “regime shifts”.",
        "With respect to the September staff projections, it was argued that inflation could be higher if a different path materialised for oil prices, if the supply bottlenecks were more persistent or if the Phillips curve became steeper.",
        "Moreover, taking owner-occupied housing into account would lead to a higher expected path for inflation.",
        "It was also noted that, even if the current inflation shock was largely temporary, it would only require a relatively small percentage of the current shock to become permanent for inflation to be close to 2 per cent at the end of the projection horizon.",
        "The importance of taking climate change policies and the future development of carbon prices into account was emphasised.",
        "Their impact was likely to lead to sustained upward price pressures for a number of years.",
        "Carbon prices would inevitably have to increase substantially to ensure that the objectives of the Paris Agreement were reached, with the direct effects of climate policies on energy prices likely to affect price developments in the later years of the projection horizon.",
        "At the same time, there was little evidence so far of second-round effects on wage negotiations.",
        "Wage developments and unit labour costs, which were necessary components of durable underlying inflation, remained quite subdued, and wage negotiations so far had taken expectations of only rather moderate future price movements into account.",
        "However, it was also argued that “this time might be different” in the sense that the length and magnitude of the shock to inflation, combined with supply bottlenecks and excess savings, might lead to higher second-round effects than in the past.",
        "Hence, it was important to monitor closely current wage negotiations.",
        "Nevertheless, it was noted that the best-performing Phillips curves maintained by ECB staff indicated lower inflation at the end of the projection horizon than was foreseen in the ECB’s projections.",
        "Considering recent developments in inflation expectations, members noted that measures of longer-term inflation expectations had continued to increase but remained some distance from the ECB’s inflation target.",
        "Market-based indicators of inflation expectations had risen to their highest level in many years, with the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead now exceeding 1.7 per cent, which was some 50 basis points higher than before the pandemic.",
        "While it was positive news that market expectations of deflation were very low, inflation options markets continued to signal that investors did not see a risk of recent high euro area inflation rates extending into the medium term.",
        "However, it was recalled that the inflation expectations of households and businesses, which were different from those of financial market participants, also needed to be considered.",
        "Members thus broadly concurred that, despite further improvement, the inflation outlook remained some way from the ECB’s target level.",
        "At the same time, risks to the inflation outlook, as embodied in the September 2021 ECB staff projections, were widely regarded as being tilted to the upside.",
        "However, it was also cautioned that the recent underestimation of inflation had to be interpreted in the context of the previous prolonged period of overestimation and the continued shortfall of longer-term inflation expectations from the target.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members broadly concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Bank lending rates for firms and households were at historically low levels while lending to households was holding up, especially for house purchases.",
        "A remark was made about the extent to which the sharp rise in housing investment, house prices and mortgage volumes might have been fuelled by the ECB’s monetary policy in the wake of the pandemic and in view of ample forced savings, much of which was probably invested in real estate.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that lower equilibrium interest rates implied higher housing values, while leverage would not necessarily increase with real estate purchases if households drew on the savings they had accumulated during the pandemic.",
        "The growth of lending to firms had slowed, mainly because firms were still well funded after borrowing heavily in the first wave of the pandemic.",
        "It was noted that government support had transferred risks to the public sector and helped firms through the crisis, thereby avoiding a spike in non-performing loans and bankruptcies, which should mitigate the risk of financial amplification.",
        "As the economy opened up, firms were benefiting from the recovery.",
        "Large cash holdings and increasing retained earnings reduced firms’ need for external funding.",
        "Solid bank balance sheets continued to ensure that sufficient credit was available, while for larger firms bond issuance was an attractive alternative to bank loans.",
        "It had to be acknowledged, however, that many firms and households had taken on more debt during the pandemic, which made their financial health potentially vulnerable to a deterioration in the economic outlook and could worsen the quality of banks’ balance sheets.",
        "Even so, overall, risks of financial amplification were considered to be small.",
        "Members concurred with Mr Lane’s assessment that an accommodative monetary policy stance remained necessary to offset the negative impact of the pandemic on inflation and to support the re-anchoring of inflation expectations solidly around the Governing Council’s new target over the medium term.",
        "Hence, policy support from a sustained pace of net purchases under the PEPP, along with the other instruments and the recalibrated forward guidance, was deemed essential for preserving the necessary monetary policy accommodation and for reaffirming the Governing Council’s commitment to its new monetary policy strategy.",
        "At the same time, under the PEPP framework which the Governing Council had agreed upon at its December 2020 meeting, a calibration of the pace of purchases was required based on a joint assessment of financing condition and the inflation outlook.",
        "Regarding the assessment of financing conditions, it was noted that, overall, conditions had remained favourable or had loosened further since the Governing Council’s previous quarterly assessment in June.",
        "Moreover, they had improved notably since the Governing Council’s decision, earlier in the year, to significantly increase the pace of purchases under the PEPP.",
        "This improvement was visible across a broad spectrum of indicators.",
        "A rise in inflation expectations had brought euro area real short and long-term interest rates to historically low levels.",
        "Regarding financial conditions, stock prices had risen while the euro had depreciated broadly.",
        "Bank lending rates for firms and households, as well as corporate bond spreads, had remained near historical lows.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that the recent repricing had led to some volatility in long-term market interest rates.",
        "As for the assessment of the inflation outlook, a significant improvement over the course of the year was acknowledged.",
        "It was also observed that the staff inflation projection had been revised up in the previous projection rounds, thereby breaking the trend of the earlier successive downward revisions and pointing to the emergence of upside risks.",
        "However, it was noted that the near-term increase in inflation was largely driven by temporary factors that would fade in the medium term and not call for policy tightening.",
        "According to the September ECB staff projections, inflation was not expected to persistently reach levels that fully offset the pandemic impact on the inflation path at the relevant medium-term horizon, and it remained well below the ECB’s new inflation target.",
        "Based on the joint assessment, and in line with the PEPP framework adopted in December 2020, members agreed that persistently favourable financing conditions along with a somewhat improved medium-term outlook for inflation would allow the Governing Council to moderately scale down the pace of purchases under the PEPP while confirming all other monetary policy measures, namely the level of the key ECB interest rates, the Governing Council’s forward guidance on their likely future evolution, the purchases under the APP, the reinvestment policies and the longer-term refinancing operations.",
        "A number of comments were made in both directions on the recalibration of the pace of purchases under the PEPP, proposed by Mr Lane.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that a symmetric application of the PEPP framework would call for a more substantial reduction in the pace of purchases, also in the light of potential side effects of an elevated level of purchases.",
        "From this perspective, a pace of purchases similar to the level prevailing at the beginning of the year would be appropriate.",
        "Such a pace would still provide a greater degree of monetary accommodation than at the start of the year, as both financing conditions and the economic outlook had improved in the meantime.",
        "In addition, the embedded flexibility would allow for a meaningful increase in purchases to address market tensions, if needed.",
        "On the other hand, reference was made to the recent repricing in nominal bond yields, which called for a prudent reduction in the pace of purchases.",
        "A concern was expressed that a slower pace might induce market perceptions of a tighter than expected monetary policy, which could result in a tightening of financing conditions.",
        "In particular, there was a risk that a reduction in PEPP purchases in the next few months would be interpreted as tapering, which could affect other components of the monetary policy stance.",
        "This might drive euro area interest rates higher and thwart an incipient increase in inflation expectations.",
        "At the same time, the argument was made that markets were already expecting an end to net asset purchases under the PEPP by March 2022.",
        "This expectation was not showing a significant impact on financing conditions, which should generate confidence that the recalibration of the PEPP purchase pace to reflect the improvement in financing conditions and the inflation outlook would not lead to an unwarranted tightening in market interest rates.",
        "Attention was drawn to the substantial stock of assets that the Eurosystem had acquired since the beginning of the year, which would provide significant accommodation over the coming years by compressing the term premium, even if the pace of purchases was reduced.",
        "It was reiterated that the PEPP was designed as an emergency programme that had a clearly defined objective of countering the impact of the pandemic on the path of inflation and should be distinguished from the general monetary policy stance, for which other instruments were available.",
        "The point was made that, even without the PEPP, the overall monetary policy stance remained highly accommodative.",
        "The calibration of the PEPP purchase pace in line with the PEPP framework needed to be judged against the prevailing financial conditions and the inflation outlook.",
        "A view was expressed, however, that the perception of a premature removal of accommodation could raise questions on the Governing Council’s determination to deliver on its inflation target and its commitment to persistent and forceful policy action in the vicinity of the effective lower bound in order to avoid negative deviations from the inflation target becoming entrenched.",
        "Overall, balancing the various arguments, all members agreed that, in line with the framework adopted in December 2020, persistently favourable financing conditions along with a somewhat improved medium-term outlook for inflation would allow the Governing Council to moderately scale down the pace of purchases under the PEPP, in line with Mr Lane’s proposal.",
        "With regard to implementation, it was stressed that flexibility according to market conditions remained a key feature of the PEPP, allowing for a flexibility margin to react to short-term shocks exerting upward pressure on benchmark interest rates or, likewise, allowing the pace of purchases to be reduced if favourable conditions could be maintained with an even lower pace.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the Governing Council’s efforts to be more transparent and to communicate better with the general public, thereby fostering trust, as highlighted in the monetary policy strategy review.",
        "In particular, it was suggested that more information be provided in official communication about the reasoning behind the APP, the PEPP and related policy decisions.",
        "Regarding communication, members underlined that the improvement in the outlook had to be acknowledged and that the Governing Council’s policy measures were producing the intended effects.",
        "Although the temporary nature of the near-term rise in inflation had to be stressed, it was felt that upside risks to the longer-term outlook for inflation had to be monitored and communicated carefully.",
        "At the same time, it was deemed important to avoid creating the impression that the Governing Council was satisfied with the current outlook for inflation.",
        "With respect to the moderate reduction in the pace of net asset purchases under the PEPP, this was seen as proportionate, gradual and in line with the joint assessment of the improvement in financing conditions and the inflation outlook.",
        "It had to be made clear that the decision constituted a recalibration of the programme in response to current conditions and did not imply tapering or an end to asset purchases under the PEPP.",
        "Moreover, with a moderately lower pace of purchases, the ECB’s monetary policy remained highly accommodative overall.",
        "The Governing Council stressed its determination to act forcefully and persistently, in line with its revised monetary policy strategy, to anchor inflation expectations solidly at its two per cent target.",
        "Finally, it was underlined that the Governing Council would continue to purchase flexibly according to market conditions.",
        "If favourable financing conditions could be maintained with asset purchase flows that did not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope would not need to be used in full and, equally, the envelope could be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the following monetary policy decisions: Based on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council judged that favourable financing conditions could be maintained with a moderately lower pace of net asset purchases under the PEPP than in the previous two quarters.",
        "The monthly purchase pace would continue to be implemented flexibly according to market conditions.",
        "The Governing Council also confirmed its other measures, namely the level of the key ECB interest rates, its forward guidance on their likely future evolution, its purchases under the APP, its reinvestment policies and its longer-term refinancing operations, as set out in the press release to be published after the meeting.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 8-9 September 2021.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation compensation in the euro area had surged to their highest levels in over seven years, pushing long-term nominal sovereign bond yields back to levels seen earlier in the year.",
        "In the euro area, ten-year inflation swap rates were more than 30 basis points higher than in September 2021 and a full percentage point higher than in December 2020, when the Governing Council had pledged to preserve favourable financing conditions.",
        "The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had, for the first time in more than seven years, risen above the ECB’s target of 2%.",
        "By contrast, ten-year real rates had fallen further.",
        "They were now almost 50 basis points below their December 2020 levels.",
        "This pattern of yield changes suggested that rising long-term rates were not primarily the result of adverse spillovers, which would typically have manifested themselves in rising real rates.",
        "Rather they were seen as a reappraisal of the global inflation outlook, mainly reflecting the repercussions of the global energy shock and growing evidence of more persistent supply-side bottlenecks.",
        "While at short to medium-term horizons most of the increase in inflation compensation reflected higher genuine inflation expectations, at longer horizons the increase mostly reflected higher inflation risk premia.",
        "The fact that long-term inflation risk premia had increased so strongly in previous weeks suggested that market participants were increasingly worried about inflation outcomes above – rather than below – expected inflation, even once the prevailing shocks were expected to fade.",
        "Exceptionally high uncertainty surrounding the nature and structure of the post-pandemic global economy was likely to have contributed to rising risk premia.",
        "Although markets had significantly repriced both the baseline inflation outlook and the risks around it, there was no evidence that changes in expectations about asset purchases – either in the euro area or globally – had affected euro area sovereign bond yields.",
        "Contrary to developments in the spring, the spread between the ten-year German Bund and overnight index swaps (OIS) had remained highly resilient over recent weeks.",
        "Spreads between euro area sovereign bonds and the Bund had also remained resilient and, since the September monetary policy meeting, had even continued to fall to new post-2008 lows in most countries.",
        "Developments in euro area credit and stock markets suggested that higher nominal long-term yields and the prevailing supply shocks were not expected to derail the recovery.",
        "Investment grade corporate bond spreads remained close to record low levels.",
        "Even though higher yields had weighed on euro area equity markets in previous weeks, the downward pressure had been fully offset by further upgrades of firms’ longer-term earnings expectations and a diminishing equity risk premium.",
        "Short-term and money market rates had risen in the euro area but by significantly less than in other major economies.",
        "The time of a rate lift-off had been brought forward from mid-2024 to late 2022.",
        "Since a non-negligible part of the recent rise in short and long-term rates reflected term premia, the actual time of lift-off priced by investors was likely to be later.",
        "This was consistent with the reading of survey-based expectations.",
        "Although the latest survey of monetary analysts also pointed to respondents anticipating an earlier lift-off, a first rate hike was only expected in the second quarter of 2024.",
        "Option-implied probabilities for the expected path of short-term interest rates pointed to a significant widening of the distribution of possible future outcomes, which was now clearly skewed to the upside.",
        "Such an increase in uncertainty was to be expected when the market attached an increasing probability to expected inflation meeting the conditions for lift-off.",
        "Medium-term inflation expectations, as proxied by the one-year swap rate three years ahead, had stood at 1.99% the day before the Governing Council meeting – their highest level since early 2013.",
        "Over the next five years, inflation was expected to be visibly above the Governing Council’s target of 2% on average.",
        "The rise in measures of inflation compensation had been consistent with a marked shift in the distribution of expected inflation outcomes, as priced in by inflation options markets.",
        "The market was now putting the lowest weight on inflation being below 1% over the next five years within the available data sample, which started in 2010, and the highest weight on inflation being above 2% in more than a decade, i.e.",
        "a weight of more than 50%.",
        "Conditional on the future path of inflation as embedded at present in inflation swap rates, current market pricing could therefore be consistent with the ECB’s state-contingent forward guidance.",
        "That the forward guidance remained credible was also supported by the behaviour of forward OIS rates.",
        "These continued to react less sensitively to expected inflation than before the pandemic, even if the sensitivity had increased somewhat in previous weeks owing to the strong acceleration in measures of inflation compensation.",
        "With short-term nominal rates less sensitive to inflation, the real yield curve in the euro area had fallen to unprecedented levels, while the euro continued to depreciate against the US dollar as expected policy rate differentials widened further.",
        "For the first time since the start of the pandemic, investors were no longer holding net euro long positions, implying that they did not expect the euro to reverse recent losses in the near term.",
        "Thus, continued policy divergence remained the central scenario for investors, even as markets had brought forward lift-off expectations in response to growing expectations that prevailing inflationary pressures would ultimately prove more persistent than previously anticipated.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and the recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, global activity was still in a solid expansionary phase, with the global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) remaining above 50 in September.",
        "However, there was some natural deceleration compared with the most intense reopening phase a few months earlier.",
        "World trade had initially shown a strong recovery to well above pre-pandemic levels but had flatlined since March.",
        "The impact of bottlenecks – visible in suppliers’ delivery times and the ratio of new orders to inventories – on global exports and industrial production was estimated to have increased lately.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting, the euro had declined significantly in both nominal effective terms (-1%) and against the US dollar (-1.9%).",
        "Oil prices had increased sharply (+17% in US dollar terms), reflecting both demand and supply effects.",
        "The oil price futures curve stood at levels that were much higher than foreseen in the September ECB staff macroeconomic projections, also for 2022 and 2023.",
        "Gas prices had increased even more strongly than oil prices over previous months, reflecting both strong global demand related to the economic recovery and supply-side effects.",
        "As at the global level, the euro area outlook was clouded by supply bottlenecks and input price pressures.",
        "Industrial production had been fluctuating around the level of pre-pandemic activity, declining again to some extent in August.",
        "PMI indicators for manufacturing and services were standing firmly above 50.",
        "In particular, PMI data for accommodation and for food and beverages pointed to a significant recovery throughout the third quarter.",
        "Nevertheless, there was some variation across industrial sectors.",
        "The automotive sector, in particular, was severely affected by semiconductor shortages, also in the context of adjustments in production processes towards electric vehicles.",
        "Looking more closely at manufacturing, supply bottlenecks, together with the rapid recovery in demand, had led to a significant decline in inventories.",
        "At the same time, deliveries had slowed.",
        "The ECB’s Corporate Telephone Survey indicated that well over half the respondents expected supply constraints and high input price pressures to last for at least six more months.",
        "A large number of respondents expected the supply constraints and elevated input prices to last even for another full year or longer.",
        "As regards investment, housing investment growth likely moderated in the third quarter of 2021 owing mainly to tightening supply constraints, such as labour and material shortages, in an environment of strong demand.",
        "Business investment growth was expected to have remained in positive territory in the third quarter but not to have performed as strongly as previously envisaged on account of supply-side disruptions.",
        "Lately, also the PMI for new orders of capital goods, which was still at quite a high level, had been declining.",
        "Turning to trade, the recovery continued at two speeds, with goods exports subdued and services trade rebounding somewhat.",
        "The historically large discrepancy between buoyant export orders and weak export volumes illustrated the impact of supply bottlenecks on exports.",
        "This shortfall was higher for the euro area than for the rest of the world, as euro area exports required relatively complex supply chains.",
        "Services exports had started to recover in the summer and indicators continued to signal a slight rebound.",
        "Regarding labour market developments, the unemployment rate stood at 7.5% in August, similar to the pre-pandemic period.",
        "Nevertheless, a significant number of people were still in job retention schemes and the labour participation rate remained well below the pre-pandemic level.",
        "Thus, overall, the labour market continued to be weaker than before the pandemic.",
        "The PMI composite indicator for employment suggested further strong growth in the third quarter of 2021, with signs of stabilisation in September and October.",
        "The job vacancy rate for the total economy had risen in the second quarter of 2021 to the same level as in the corresponding quarter of 2019.",
        "Turning to nominal developments, headline inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had increased from 2.2% in July to 3.0% in August and to 3.4% in September.",
        "A longer-term perspective revealed that inflation was currently extraordinarily high, with large contributions from energy and goods inflation.",
        "Goods inflation was currently much higher than its long-term average of 0.6%, while services inflation could be seen as normalising.",
        "Oil price developments and their direct impact on fuel prices had been the main factor in the energy price surge.",
        "However, more recently, energy inflation had been driven also by strong upward movements in gas and electricity prices.",
        "Services inflation had increased to 1.7% in September with the reopening of the economy, while non-energy industrial goods inflation had eased to 2.1%.",
        "Most indicators of underlying inflation had increased.",
        "Prices in contact-intensive sectors continued to drive the current pick-up in the HICP excluding food and energy (HICPX), as demand was returning to those sectors most hit by the pandemic with an upward short-term effect on prices.",
        "The model-based Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI), which was less affected by temporary factors, stood at 1.6% in September, while Supercore, which included only the cyclically sensitive components of the HICPX, had increased from 1.3% in August to 1.6% in September.",
        "Turning to pipeline pressures, producer prices had continued to rise very dynamically.",
        "Increases in producer prices were expected to lead to continuing upward pressure on consumer prices for non-energy industrial goods.",
        "Growth in negotiated wages had remained low of late, and it remained uncertain whether the upward impact of recent increases in consumer price inflation would pass through to wages.",
        "Evidence from the latest Corporate Telephone Survey indicated that a majority of the respondent firms expected wages to rise somewhat more strongly in 2022 than they did in 2021.",
        "That wage growth had so far remained muted was a very important element of the overall inflation dynamics for the medium term.",
        "PMI input and output price developments indicated that profit margins continued to be under pressure, and increasingly so in services.",
        "Input prices were currently outpacing output prices, not only in intermediate goods industries but also in consumer goods industries and services.",
        "Turning to housing costs, the ECB’s residential property price index had increased strongly, by 7.3%, year on year, while the experimental owner-occupied housing price index had also increased strongly, by 4.5%, year on year in the second quarter of 2021.",
        "Overall, the costs of owning a house were growing considerably more strongly than the costs of renting a house, which had increased by around 1.3% in the second quarter of 2021.",
        "Longer-term survey-based indicators of inflation expectations and market-based measures of inflation compensation had ticked up, moving closer to 2%.",
        "In the latest ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters, five-year ahead inflation expectations had been revised up from 1.8% to 1.9%.",
        "Fewer respondents were expecting very low inflation and more respondents were expecting rates of between 1.8% and 2.0%.",
        "Turning to financial and monetary developments, nominal risk-free rates stood markedly higher than at the time of the September monetary policy meeting.",
        "Sovereign bond spreads were slightly narrower.",
        "Corporate bond spreads had narrowed in view of a positive credit outlook.",
        "With risk-free interest rates going up and spreads stable or slightly narrower, there was evidence of an overall tightening of nominal financing conditions.",
        "After some volatility, equity prices were at a level similar to at the time of the September meeting.",
        "With respect to monetary developments, lending to firms had remained moderate but had seen an uptick in September.",
        "This was consistent with the slight net increase in loan demand reported by banks in the October round of the bank lending survey.",
        "Fixed investment had made a positive contribution to loan demand for the second consecutive quarter, which was a positive sign for the economic recovery.",
        "Firms’ borrowing costs remained below the levels seen at the start of the pandemic and were still insulated from the upward trend in risk-free rates.",
        "Lending to households remained strong, with annual growth in loans much higher than in the period after the 2007-08 Great Financial Crisis, supported by dynamic lending for house purchase.",
        "The borrowing costs of households for house purchase remained substantially below their level at the start of the pandemic, as did borrowing costs for consumer lending.",
        "Following sharper net tightening earlier in the pandemic, the latest round of the bank lending survey showed that credit standards for loans to firms remained broadly unchanged in the third quarter of 2021, for the second consecutive quarter.",
        "Despite the supply bottlenecks, banks maintained a balanced view of their credit risks, in line with the economic recovery and continued support from the authorities.",
        "Focusing on developments in money creation, the annual growth rate of M3 had stood at 7.4% in September, after 7.9% in August.",
        "Monthly household deposit flows had returned to their pre-pandemic average, reflecting the recovery in consumer confidence and spending.",
        "By contrast, corporate deposit flows remained strong and above the pre-pandemic average, pointing to a further strengthening of liquidity buffers.",
        "On fiscal policies there was only limited news.",
        "The fiscal tightening in 2022 was likely to be less pronounced than had been assumed in the September ECB staff projections, as some new fiscal measures had already been announced and the latest draft budgetary plans indicated a more expansionary fiscal stance.",
        "Looking further ahead, budget balances in 2023 were expected to still be more negative than prior to the pandemic in most countries.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane remarked that the euro area economy continued to recover, although momentum had moderated to some extent.",
        "The impact of the pandemic on economic activity had declined, with the gradual lifting of restrictions supporting consumer spending, especially on those services most affected by lockdowns – such as tourism and hospitality.",
        "The manufacturing sector continued to expand, but at a slower pace owing to ongoing supply chain disruptions.",
        "This could be seen in the hard data: industrial production had fallen by 1.6% in August and was 1.2% lower than at the start of the pandemic.",
        "It was also visible in the PMI manufacturing output index, which had declined from 55.6 in September to 53.2 in October – a 16-month low.",
        "Shortages in the supply of labour, materials and equipment were clouding the outlook for the coming quarters.",
        "After the rapid rebound in the earlier stages of reopening, the rate of expansion in the PMI services component had moderated.",
        "Accordingly, while the composite PMI for the euro area remained firmly in expansionary territory it had slowed markedly, falling from 59.0 in August to 56.2 in September and subsequently to 54.3 in October – a six-month low.",
        "HICP inflation had increased from 3.0% in August to 3.4% in September.",
        "In September energy inflation accounted for about half of overall inflation.",
        "Inflation had continued to surprise to the upside, driven by three broad – and intertwined – factors associated with the current energy price shock and the reopening of the economy.",
        "First, the surge in energy prices reflected both supply-side and demand-side developments.",
        "Part of the increase in gas and electricity prices reflected spillovers from global developments.",
        "However, the rise in European gas prices had outpaced global price movements on account of Europe-specific factors, such as the substitution of gas for other fuels, low inventories and higher carbon prices.",
        "Second, the recovery in demand linked to the reopening of the economy, combined with pandemic-related factors and global supply-side impediments, was putting upward pressure on prices.",
        "These dynamics were especially visible in relation to consumer services and those goods most affected by global supply shortages.",
        "Higher demand for services and supply frictions were pushing up HICPX inflation, which had risen from 1.6% in August to 1.9% in September.",
        "Similarly, pipeline price pressures continued to build up for a wide range of goods and had become more visible at later stages of the pricing chain.",
        "Accordingly, non-energy industrial goods inflation had stood at 2.1% in September, well above its long-term average.",
        "Third, special factors associated with the pandemic – namely base effects related to the drop in oil prices last year and the end of the temporary VAT cut in Germany – were still contributing to higher inflation.",
        "Headline inflation appeared likely to rise further during the year and to peak in the fourth quarter.",
        "Although inflation would take longer to decline than previously expected, it was foreseen to diminish in the course of 2022 as the influence of these three factors driving near-term inflation developments eased or fell out of the year-on-year inflation calculation.",
        "Looking further ahead, a tightening in the labour market should push up wages, supporting a gradual increase in underlying inflation pressures.",
        "However, Mr Lane mentioned that inflation was still expected to fall below the ECB’s target in the medium term.",
        "That said, the duration of the supply shortages and higher energy prices remained uncertain, constituting a source of upside risk to the near-term inflation outlook.",
        "Measures of longer-term inflation expectations had moved closer to 2%, although these generally remained below the target, especially on a risk-adjusted basis.",
        "The recovery continued to depend on the course of the pandemic and further progress with vaccination campaigns.",
        "The risks to the economic outlook were still seen as broadly balanced.",
        "A faster than anticipated drawdown of accumulated savings for investment and consumption still constituted an upside risk.",
        "However, a prolongation of supply chain disruptions could slow down the recovery, while persistently high energy prices could hamper economic activity and dent disposable income, thereby weighing on consumption and investment.",
        "In particular, if these factors persisted for longer than expected, the upward shift in the price level could feed through into higher than anticipated wage increases.",
        "The latest data still pointed to extensive labour market slack, and wage dynamics remained subdued.",
        "Moreover, the negative terms-of-trade shock generated by the surge in energy prices was also denting profitability, reducing the scope for granting wage increases.",
        "In monitoring wage developments, it would be essential to differentiate between, on the one hand, wage adjustments that were simply a response to the unexpectedly high current inflation rate or a shift in the expected level of inflation towards the target and, on the other hand, a self-reinforcing process whereby employers accommodated demands for higher pay in expectation of persistent excess inflation in the future.",
        "While financing conditions for firms, households and the public sector remained supportive in broad terms, market interest rates had increased markedly since the September meeting.",
        "The increase in longer-term yields had outstripped the improvement in longer-term inflation expectations, as captured by the surveys of professional forecasters and monetary analysts, as well as by risk-adjusted market-based measures of inflation compensation.",
        "Similarly, the significant increase in term premia could be related to a shift in inflation risk premia.",
        "Over time, a persistent increase in market interest rates would feed into a tightening of financing conditions.",
        "Euro area sovereign spreads remained stable, with no indication of a weakening in the transmission from risk-free to sovereign debt markets.",
        "Market-based and bank-based financing conditions for firms and households currently remained at supportive levels, despite a slight increase in bank and corporate bond yields.",
        "The euro had depreciated noticeably against the US dollar, reflecting expectations of relatively tighter monetary policy in the United States.",
        "Overall, the latest developments broadly confirmed the previous assessment made at the September meeting, suggesting no change to the pace of purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).",
        "Accordingly, Mr Lane proposed continuing to conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP at a moderately lower pace during the final quarter of the year than the previous two quarters.",
        "Some indicators of market expectations for the future path of the short-term money market interest rate were difficult to reconcile with the ECB’s forward guidance on its policy rates.",
        "The increase in near-term rates likely reflected higher compensation for bearing a perceived increase in inflation risk, while some market participants might also put more weight on the likelihood of the lift-off conditions being met earlier than envisaged in the ECB staff’s assessment.",
        "However, current market pricing may have also reflected, in part, an incomplete understanding of the three conditions laid out in the Governing Council’s forward guidance that had to be satisfied before lifting the policy rates, especially in view of the ECB staff’s assessment that inflation would decline over the course of next year and that inflation was foreseen to settle below the target over the projection horizon.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks to the outlook provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The euro area economy continued to recover strongly, although momentum had moderated to some extent.",
        "Consumers continued to be confident and their spending remained strong.",
        "But shortages of materials, equipment and labour were holding back production in some sectors.",
        "Inflation was rising, primarily because of the surge in energy prices but also as the recovery in demand was outpacing constrained supply.",
        "Inflation was expected to rise further in the near term but to decline in the course of next year.",
        "As regards the external environment, members shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction: the bigger picture was still that of a solid global recovery although with some slowing of momentum.",
        "While some deceleration was natural, some was connected to the persistence of bottlenecks and supply constraints.",
        "Reference was made to increased congestion in ports.",
        "The outlook for global oil and gas markets remained surrounded by uncertainty.",
        "It was underlined that rising prices were reflecting a confluence of factors related to demand, supply and inventories.",
        "It was argued that capacity bottlenecks in energy supply might be longer lasting if the green energy agenda reduced incentives for exploring and maintaining oil extraction.",
        "Some concern was also expressed more generally about uncertainties related to the global economic outlook and the implications this would have for euro area foreign demand.",
        "Turning to euro area developments, the economy had continued to grow strongly in the third quarter of 2021.",
        "While momentum had moderated to some extent, output was still expected to exceed its pre-pandemic level by the end of the year.",
        "The lifting of pandemic restrictions was supporting consumer spending, although higher energy prices might reduce purchasing power in the months to come.",
        "At the same time, the labour market continued to improve, supporting the prospect of higher incomes and increased spending.",
        "The recovery in domestic and global demand was supporting production and business investment, although various shortages and cost pressures were clouding the outlook for the coming quarters.",
        "It was argued that the December 2021 Eurosystem staff projections were likely to see a downward revision to real GDP growth for 2021, given the latest evidence for some euro area countries.",
        "Yet this might just be part of a change in the profile over time, with lower growth in the second half of 2021 but higher growth in 2022.",
        "It was suggested that, looking beyond certain temporary setbacks, the losses caused by the pandemic had largely been reversed.",
        "Accordingly, the focus should shift towards more normal business cycle dynamics and a longer-term perspective.",
        "Members widely acknowledged that supply bottlenecks were lasting longer than initially thought.",
        "This was also the view emerging from contacts with firms in the ECB’s Corporate Telephone Survey.",
        "At the same time, it appeared that there were differences between countries concerning the degree to which bottlenecks were affecting the economy.",
        "Firms operating in integrated value chains were likely to be more affected than others.",
        "It was observed that this went hand in hand with a strong reliance on “just-in-time” delivery systems, raising the question of whether future systems would return to relying more on inventories and buffers.",
        "It was also suggested that, as a result of current experiences, there could be some reversal of the past globalisation of manufacturing.",
        "The point was made that the bottlenecks not only reflected the reopening of the economy but also structural forces, with the shift to electric vehicles in car manufacturing being an example.",
        "Overall, however, it was stressed that supply bottlenecks would gradually fade away as supply reconnected with demand, even though this was taking longer than expected.",
        "Members assessed the risks to the economic outlook as broadly balanced.",
        "Supply bottlenecks and rising energy prices were considered the main near-term risks to the pace of the recovery and the outlook for inflation.",
        "If supply shortages and higher energy prices lasted longer, these could slow down the recovery.",
        "At the same time, if persistent bottlenecks were to feed through into higher than anticipated wage rises, or if the economy returned more quickly to full capacity, price pressures could become stronger.",
        "However, economic activity could outperform expectations if consumers became more confident and saved less than currently expected.",
        "More generally, the recovery continued to depend on the course of the pandemic and further progress with vaccination campaigns.",
        "In their exchange of views, members discussed the notion of “stagflation” in relation to risks to the economic outlook.",
        "It was recalled that a terms-of-trade shock – as implied by the rise in energy prices – normally came with upward impacts on inflation but downward impacts on economic growth, via lower real disposable income and higher costs.",
        "With the economy just coming out of the pandemic crisis, the negative terms-of-trade shock was also seen as increasing the likelihood of “scarring effects” that could hamper future growth.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that temporary movements in prices and output in different directions should not be labelled as stagflation.",
        "It was quite normal for the latter stages of a recovery to be accompanied by lower growth, and most of the recent upward pressure on prices was coming from base effects.",
        "It was stressed that the current outlook clearly lacked the stagnation element.",
        "Growth momentum was declining, but within a still strong recovery and with robust rates of growth in activity – well above potential growth.",
        "Reference was made to the unprecedented wedge between industrial orders and industrial production, which suggested significant potential for a rebound once the supply problems receded, limiting the likelihood of stagflation.",
        "Stock markets pricing in higher and rising earnings was also seen as a factor that did not square with stagflation.",
        "The same held with regard to the support from fiscal and monetary policy and anchored inflation expectations.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that stagflation experiences in the 1970s occurred in a different environment, in which indexation allowed wages to react to energy prices and thus sustained both stagnation and inflation.",
        "With regard to price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Inflation had increased to 3.4% in September and was expected to rise further in 2021.",
        "While the current phase of higher inflation would last longer than originally anticipated, inflation was expected to decline in the course of 2022.",
        "The upswing in inflation largely reflected a combination of three factors: the sharp rise in energy prices, a reopening-driven recovery in demand outpacing supply and base effects related to the end of the VAT cut in Germany.",
        "The influence of all three factors was expected to ease or fall out of the year-on-year inflation calculation in the course of 2022.",
        "As the recovery continued, the gradual return of the economy to full capacity was expected to underpin a rise in wages over time.",
        "Market-based measures and survey-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations had moved closer to 2%.",
        "In addition, options markets had, by and large, priced out low inflation outcomes over the following five years.",
        "These factors were expected to support underlying inflation and the return of inflation to target over the medium term.",
        "Members widely agreed on the expected hump-shaped pattern in the shorter-term inflation outlook.",
        "Confidence was expressed that the effects of higher energy prices and of supply bottlenecks would be temporary, although the decline in inflation in 2022 would now take longer than previously expected.",
        "Reference was made to the recurrent underestimation of the latest outcomes for both headline and underlying inflation, corroborating earlier conjectures that the risks around the September 2021 ECB staff projections had been tilted to the upside.",
        "Against this background, it was seen as likely that in the December 2021 Eurosystem staff projections the shorter-term inflation outlook for the euro area would once again be revised upwards.",
        "There was broad agreement among members that the key question at the current juncture was what the latest developments implied for the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "It was pointed out that the medium-term inflation outlook remained surrounded by elevated uncertainty and it was suggested that this warranted an open mind with respect to different scenarios that might unfold.",
        "It was recalled that, while mechanical updates of projections pointed to upward revision for 2022, for 2023 these updates also implied a significant effect from downward-sloping oil price assumptions.",
        "At the same time, it was suggested that the current surge in market prices for gas would only be reflected in consumer price inflation with some delay, owing largely to administered price-setting.",
        "Looking beyond mechanical updates, it was stressed that more persistent bottlenecks and the increases in energy costs could have repercussions that would ultimately have a dampening effect on underlying inflation and therefore on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "This would be the case if, for instance, bottlenecks slowed the economic recovery.",
        "Similarly, the effect of higher energy prices on the terms of trade implied a “tax” that would need to be absorbed by workers and firms in the domestic economy.",
        "This could delay the return of economic activity to pre-pandemic levels, which was consistent with conjunctural indicators that suggested that economic momentum was weakening.",
        "It was argued that supply-side shocks would only lead to a self-sustained inflationary process if they hit when the resources in the economy were fully utilised, which was not yet the case in the euro area.",
        "Both the number of people in the labour force and the hours worked in the economy remained below their pre-pandemic levels, and those levels had led only to modest inflationary pressures before the pandemic.",
        "In addition, the unemployment rate was still being compressed by the impact of job retention schemes.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that the strong pent-up demand, together with a greater readiness to pay implied by the very high accumulated savings of households, could allow for a greater pass-through of the current supply-side shocks to inflation.",
        "Members considered that an increase in inflation in the medium term required higher wage growth and inflation expectations.",
        "It was argued that such wage growth needed to reflect a persistent shift in the growth rate rather than a one-off shift in the level.",
        "The view was widely shared that negotiated wage growth had remained subdued and there were no signs as yet of second-round effects on wages stemming from the higher energy prices.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that one could not take much reassurance from the few wage negotiations seen in the most recent past, as these had not taken place against the background of the prevailing very high inflation rates.",
        "Second-round effects might thus still be observed after some delay and it would only be possible to identify them once the next round of wage negotiations had been completed.",
        "The more protracted high inflation proved to be, the more pressure trade unions would face to push through higher wage demands.",
        "Reference was also made to the indications of potential second-round effects in the results of the Corporate Telephone Survey.",
        "At the same time, caution was counselled in the current situation so as not to associate any observed increases in wage growth with unwelcome second-round effects.",
        "Some catching-up was to be expected and, coming after a long period of low inflation, a pick-up in wage growth driven by tightening labour markets – even if sustained – should be considered a healthy development.",
        "Moreover, in terms of the consequences for labour costs, any rise in wage growth would have to be weighed against productivity growth.",
        "Generally, the materialisation of second-round effects in response to a terms-of-trade shock depended on the competitive situation and the relative bargaining power of workers and employers.",
        "It was argued that the mechanism whereby prices were raised to restore profitability in response to higher wage demands was unlikely to be in operation at this time, owing to the risk of losing market share.",
        "Moreover, in comparison with the 1970s and 1980s, there had been a shift in the relative importance of pay and job security in wage bargaining.",
        "In this respect, the labour market was seen still to contain a substantial amount of hidden slack, which was related to employees in job retention schemes and to restraints on mobility and migration.",
        "While the possibility of second-round effects was considered to be limited in the presence of labour market slack, it was argued that price effects could be greater than currently estimated if labour force participation did not return to pre-crisis levels.",
        "Moreover, with infection rates still high and subsidies still generous under job retention schemes, workers’ reservation wages might have increased, although this effect was likely to vanish as the labour market normalised after the pandemic.",
        "While there was agreement that the bargaining power of trade unions and the scope for wage indexation had decreased over time, it was pointed out that wage negotiations were now taking place against the background of high inflation rates well above the ECB’s target.",
        "In their discussion, members also recalled other factors that were relevant for the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "It was argued that, thus far, the projections did not include the rise in carbon prices that would be needed to reach the objectives set in the Paris Agreement.",
        "It was acknowledged that energy prices needed to rise in order to affect the behaviour of consumers and enterprises through relative price changes (vis-à-vis non-energy components), but the question was raised as to whether the ultimate effects of higher energy prices on economic activity and inflation would be positive or negative.",
        "Related to this, doubts were expressed about the use of typically downward-sloping oil price futures curves as projection assumptions, when fossil fuel prices were bound to remain elevated or rise further.",
        "Additionally, growth of owner-occupied housing costs, which at present were not included in the HICP, had accelerated to a rate of 4.5%, year on year, in the second quarter of 2021.",
        "This was a source of concern at a time when the latest estimates suggested that owner-occupied housing would have contributed 0.4-0.5 percentage points to inflation in the second quarter of the year according to an experimental HICP (while the difference between such an experimentally augmented HICP and the official HICP would have amounted to 0.2-0.3 percentage points).",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that this supplementary cost indicator should not always be expected to make a positive contribution to inflation, as it partly reflected developments in house prices that could be subject to strong mean reversion over time.",
        "Finally, it was recalled that some of the models used in the macroeconomic projections might not adequately capture prevailing inflation dynamics, as these were based on mean reversion to the low historical trend seen over the past few years.",
        "As regards inflation expectations, members took note of the further increase in longer-term survey-based indicators and market-based measures of inflation expectations that Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane had reported in their introductions.",
        "Expectations were now seen as being close to or having already reached the 2% target.",
        "It was pointed out that this was only a gradual move towards levels more in line with the new inflation target and that such re-anchoring should not be confused with an unanchoring on the upside.",
        "It was acknowledged that the individual expectations measures all had some methodological shortcomings, such as a risk premium component or outliers, but that it was useful to have a wide range of information, which qualitatively all pointed in the same direction.",
        "The view was expressed that the longer the inflation spike lasted, the more it would become entrenched in longer-term inflation expectations.",
        "It was also suggested that, as indicated by the results of household surveys, the way households and firms experienced inflation was quite different from the reading of macro data by market analysts and central banks.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members widely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Bank lending rates for firms and households remained at historically low levels.",
        "The growth of loans to non-financial corporations remained moderate, despite picking up in September.",
        "The most recent bank lending survey showed that credit conditions for firms had stabilised and were supported – for the first time since 2018 – by a reduction in banks’ risk perceptions.",
        "It was remarked that the growth rate of lending to households for house purchase stood above 5% – the highest level since 2008.",
        "At the same time, bank balance sheets continued to be supported by favourable funding conditions and remained solid.",
        "Members widely concurred with the view that, at the current juncture, the accommodative monetary policy stance had to be reconfirmed and remained appropriate to support the convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s symmetric 2% target over the medium term.",
        "In line with the Governing Council’s new strategy, monetary policy had to be patient in the light of the elevated uncertainty, in order to support a self-sustained re-anchoring of inflation expectations at the target.",
        "Since the monetary policy space was constrained by the effective lower bound on interest rates, the increase in the inflation rate was seen as an opportunity to re-anchor inflation expectations solidly at the Governing Council’s 2% target over the medium term.",
        "A continued accommodative monetary policy stance would also be in line with the Governing Council’s new monetary policy strategy, which called for policy to be persistent when interest rates were at the lower bound and explicitly allowed for inflation to moderately exceed the target for a transitory period.",
        "Moreover, it was conjectured that there had been no fundamental changes in the underlying causes of the low growth and low inflation environment prevailing prior to the pandemic.",
        "However, it was also noted that, despite the increase in nominal rates, short-term real interest rates had decreased.",
        "The remark was made that, at some point in the future, the very generous monetary policy support to the economy would need to be reassessed in view of the improved inflation outlook and be brought towards a more neutral configuration over time.",
        "Contrary to the situation in the past decade, the Governing Council was now increasingly facing a macroeconomic backdrop of deficient supply rather than deficient demand, in an environment of rising inflation expectations and a fast improving labour market.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that the current macroeconomic outlook depended heavily on the monetary policy support that was in place.",
        "With regard to financing conditions, it was noted that, overall, financial and financing conditions had remained favourable, although market interest rates such as the ten-year OIS rate and euro area sovereign bond yields had increased markedly since the Governing Council’s previous quarterly assessment in September.",
        "The increase in the ten-year OIS rate reflected exclusively an increase in measures of inflation compensation.",
        "A substantial part of the increase in inflation compensation, in turn, was attributed to an increase in the term premium related to spillovers from abroad.",
        "At the same time, real interest rates had fallen and government and corporate bond spreads had remained contained.",
        "Market-based and bank-based financing conditions for firms and households remained at, or close to, historically supportive levels, despite an increase in bank and corporate bond yields.",
        "Concerns were voiced that expectations regarding the future path of short-term money market interest rates were difficult to reconcile with the Governing Council’s forward guidance on interest rates, with market participants anticipating a much earlier date for the first rate increase than at the time of the Governing Council’s September meeting.",
        "The question was raised as to whether market participants might misunderstand the three conditions laid out in the Governing Council’s forward guidance that had to be satisfied before the first increase in policy rates.",
        "These conditions were that the Governing Council should see inflation reaching 2% (i) well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and (ii) durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and that (iii) in the Governing Council’s judgement realised progress in underlying inflation was sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term.",
        "It was recalled that – in contrast to survey-based indicators – market-based measures of inflation compensation and future interest rates contained term premia, which had to be disentangled from the pure expectations component.",
        "The increase in term premia on account of the elevated uncertainty could potentially offer one explanation for the discrepancy between market-based measures and survey-based indicators, although both metrics had shifted significantly since the September meeting.",
        "Two main reasons for this shift were discussed.",
        "On the one hand, the significant increase in market-based measures of inflation compensation across the maturity spectrum, including over the medium term, suggested that market participants judged that the interest rate lift-off conditions would be met earlier than the Governing Council anticipated.",
        "Consistent with the automatic stabiliser function inherent in the Governing Council’s forward guidance, it was reasonable to expect changes in the expected time to lift-off as inflation expectations rose.",
        "This suggested that the forward guidance remained credible and that it had contributed to a further easing of financing conditions by lowering real short and medium-term interest rates.",
        "In this context, it was noted that there was now a gap between the future path of inflation implied by inflation swap markets and the September 2021 ECB staff projections, and attention was drawn to the recent persistent underestimation of inflation in recent staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "On the other hand, market participants were possibly questioning the credibility of the Governing Council’s forward guidance.",
        "In this context, it was stressed that the Governing Council had to reaffirm all three conditions of its forward guidance and its determination to act forcefully and persistently, in line with its revised monetary policy strategy, in order to anchor inflation expectations solidly at its 2% target.",
        "Equally, the Governing Council had to reaffirm its assessment that inflation would decline in the course of next year and could still be expected to settle below the ECB’s 2% target over the projection horizon.",
        "It was underlined that, by explicitly stressing the need for durability of the underlying inflation developments, the Governing Council’s forward guidance was particularly well suited to looking through “cost-push” shocks such as the ones being experienced.",
        "Members concurred that the current and near-term increase in inflation was driven largely by temporary factors that would fade in the medium term.",
        "At the same time, members agreed that price pressures were more persistent than had been foreseen in the September ECB staff projections.",
        "Although it was judged that second-round effects were not visible so far, medium-term price pressures needed to be monitored closely.",
        "In this context, it was noted that medium-term inflation expectations – not just those of market participants but also those of economic agents in general – remained well anchored and generally below the 2% target.",
        "Overall, it was acknowledged that the medium-term inflation outlook had improved.",
        "Although the Governing Council’s focus on the medium-term inflation outlook suggested looking through the projected hump-shaped path for inflation that resulted from the temporary nature of the current factors affecting the inflation outlook, the uncertainty around the medium-term prospects was seen as elevated.",
        "While an increase in the upside risks to inflation had to be acknowledged, it was deemed important for the Governing Council to avoid an overreaction as well as unwarranted inaction, and to keep sufficient optionality in calibrating its monetary policy measures to address all inflation scenarios that might unfold.",
        "Based on the joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, all members agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to continue conducting net asset purchases under the PEPP at a moderately lower pace during the final quarter of the year compared with the previous two quarters, while confirming all other monetary policy measures, namely the level of the key ECB interest rates, the Governing Council’s forward guidance on their likely future evolution, the purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), the reinvestment policies and the longer-term refinancing operations.",
        "With regard to the upcoming Governing Council meeting in December, the view was held that, judging on the basis of the current developments, net purchases under the PEPP could be expected to come to an end by March 2022, in line with the date that the Governing Council had announced in its previous communication.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that monetary policy decisions needed to be data-driven and all incoming data during the coming months needed to be taken into account.",
        "While the Governing Council would benefit from new staff macroeconomic projections at its December meeting, it was cautioned that the data available in December would not resolve all the uncertainties around the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "It was seen as important that the Governing Council should keep sufficient optionality to allow for future monetary policy actions, including beyond its December meeting.",
        "Regarding communication, it was stressed that, in view of the significant shift in the path of short-term money market rates, the Governing Council had to reaffirm its forward guidance and its assessment that, while inflation would take longer to decline than previously expected, in the medium term it was foreseen as remaining below the 2% target.",
        "In this context, it was necessary to stress the medium-term inflation outlook and the Governing Council’s determination to act forcefully and persistently, in line with its revised monetary policy strategy, to anchor inflation expectations solidly at its 2% target.",
        "At the same time, it had to be acknowledged that some of the upside risks to the September 2021 staff projections had materialised and that the recent uptick in inflation was expected to be more persistent than previously anticipated.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the following monetary policy decisions, which are set out in more detail in the corresponding ECB press release.",
        "The Governing Council continued to judge that favourable financing conditions could be maintained with a moderately lower pace of net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) than in the second and third quarters of the year.",
        "The Governing Council also confirmed its other measures, namely the level of the key ECB interest rates, its forward guidance on their likely future evolution, its purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), its reinvestment policies and its longer-term refinancing operations.",
        "The Governing Council reiterated that it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation stabilised at its 2% target over the medium term.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 28-29 October 2020.",
        "Developments in global financial markets had been driven by a strong improvement in risk sentiment.",
        "The main catalyst had been the news on the effectiveness and imminent roll-out of multiple coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines.",
        "Two additional factors had reinforced and amplified the improvement in risk sentiment.",
        "First, there were growing signs of a forthcoming bipartisan fiscal stimulus programme in the United States in the wake of the formal commencement of the presidential transition process.",
        "Second, the communication by the ECB’s Governing Council that it would recalibrate its instruments at its December meeting had strengthened confidence in the ECB’s commitment to monetary policy remaining a reliable source of support.",
        "This commitment had supported a broad-based easing of financial conditions.",
        "In stock markets, those sectors and countries that had been hit hardest by the pandemic had benefited the most from hopes that a vaccine would restore economic and social activity more rapidly.",
        "This group included many large euro area countries.",
        "However, despite the recent strong rally, stock valuations of firms in many crisis-hit sectors in the euro area remained well below their pre-pandemic levels.",
        "In euro area government bond markets, improving risk sentiment had supported a further decline in spreads of lower-rated sovereigns in recent weeks.",
        "All euro area countries could now fund long-term borrowing at, or below, rates equivalent to the GDP-weighted average of the rates on bonds of non-euro area advanced economies.",
        "This highlighted the extent of the monetary stimulus that the ECB was currently providing, and was expected to provide in the future, to mitigate the social and economic costs of the pandemic.",
        "Monetary policy had likely also been a key factor mitigating the increase in euro area risk-free yields in response to positive macroeconomic shocks.",
        "Real long-term rates and inflation expectations had moved in opposite directions in recent weeks.",
        "Ten-year inflation swaps had increased by more than 25 basis points since the Governing Council’s meeting on hopes of a faster recovery than previously expected, while real rates had steadily moved lower.",
        "In addition, the spread of the ten-year German Bund over the corresponding overnight index swap (OIS) rate had started trending lower from mid-September 2020 as German Bund yields had fallen more sharply than the equivalent OIS rates.",
        "Such developments typically reflected expectations of a change in the net supply of bonds, which was consistent with investors anticipating a recalibration of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).",
        "As a result, the degree of monetary policy accommodation currently embedded in euro area sovereign bond markets was practically unprecedented in the period since the global financial crisis, both in its scale and in its breadth across countries.",
        "The entire euro area GDP-weighted sovereign yield curve was significantly below its pre-pandemic level and firmly in negative territory.",
        "The dispersion across euro area ten-year sovereign yields had reached a new post-2008 low.",
        "Benign conditions in sovereign bond markets and increased risk appetite had also left their mark on euro credit markets.",
        "Spreads of financial and non-financial issuers had fallen further and were now approaching their pre-COVID-19-crisis levels.",
        "As regards exchange rate developments, with the year-end approaching, risks of a no-deal Brexit had increased considerably over the past few days.",
        "While market participants both in the United Kingdom and in the euro area seemed to be prepared for a no-deal Brexit scenario, the implied volatility of the GBP/EUR exchange rate had increased sharply in recent days, especially for short-term maturities.",
        "In addition, optimism about medical breakthroughs and a faster global recovery had fuelled further US dollar weakness.",
        "The nominal effective US dollar exchange rate had depreciated by more than 3.5% over the course of November 2020.",
        "There was model-based evidence that the improvement in risk sentiment, reflecting prospects of a faster global recovery, had been the major factor driving the recent appreciation of the euro.",
        "A comparison of the stock market performance of export-oriented euro area firms with the performance of firms whose business models depended more on domestic demand suggested that there was no clear evidence, so far at least, that negative competitiveness effects were perceived by investors to significantly counteract the positive global demand effects implied by a weaker US dollar.",
        "Overall, financial conditions at the global level and in the euro area were highly accommodative.",
        "ECB staff analysis suggested that monetary policy had played an important part in restoring and easing financial conditions at the global level.",
        "It had added substantially to the positive effects stemming from receding risk aversion among market participants.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "As regards the global economy, growth momentum had weakened amid rising cases of infection and stricter containment policies, while the vaccine news had lifted prospects for the future.",
        "Global GDP and global trade had suffered a massive blow in 2020 and the deep contraction in world demand had had major effects on exports of euro area firms.",
        "Large fiscal support packages had preserved jobs and boosted disposable incomes, especially in advanced economies, and private consumption had recovered robustly in the third quarter.",
        "However, the outlook for the fourth quarter had weakened substantially owing to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections, coupled with the assumption of a no-deal Brexit and a faltering fiscal stimulus in many countries.",
        "The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had deteriorated markedly in November across major advanced economies with the exception of the United States.",
        "There had been a significant recovery in world trade in the third quarter.",
        "Based on forward-looking PMI data on new export orders, world trade was expected to continue to grow in the fourth quarter.",
        "Global financial conditions had loosened further, driven by higher equity prices and declining spreads.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had climbed above USD 48 per barrel on the back of the improving global risk sentiment, implying an increase of 20% since the October monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council.",
        "The euro had appreciated markedly against the US dollar (3.2%) but had remained broadly stable in nominal effective terms (0.3%).",
        "Turning to the euro area, the December 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections entailed a deterioration in the short-term outlook, followed by a robust rebound with real GDP expected to return to its pre-crisis level by mid-2022 in the baseline scenario, which was broadly within the range of forecasts by other institutions and the private sector.",
        "Regarding the latest developments, real GDP had expanded by 12.5%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2020, according to Eurostat.",
        "Manufacturing production had been broadly unchanged between July and September.",
        "Meanwhile, the recovery in services was lagging that in manufacturing, but was also slowing, and there was considerable divergence in activity levels across the services sector.",
        "The short-term outlook was dominated by the effect of the new containment measures introduced to stem the resurgence of coronavirus infections.",
        "Focusing on demand components, private consumption had rebounded strongly in the third quarter but remained well below its pre-pandemic level.",
        "A contributing factor to the rebound had been strong demand for durable goods, including some consumption that had been postponed from the second quarter, although it remained uncertain to what extent “lockdown-induced pent-up demand” had been satisfied.",
        "Regarding the fourth quarter, retail sales had been resilient in October, while data on credit card payments, by contrast, pointed to a notable drop in spending in the last week of October and during November, although this was much smaller than the reduction in footfall in retail outlets and recreational establishments.",
        "With spending in decline and incomes still supported by government short-term work schemes, the saving ratio was expected to rise again in the fourth quarter.",
        "Business investment, which was closely related to developments in output, had also rebounded in the third quarter.",
        "But the outlook for business investment remained subdued in the light of reduced revenues, low rates of capacity utilisation and fragile corporate balance sheets.",
        "Euro area trade had rebounded strongly in the third quarter of 2020 (driven by trade in goods) and had provided a positive contribution to GDP growth.",
        "However, renewed lockdown restrictions were likely to interrupt the pattern of the recovery in trade.",
        "Looking at the euro area labour market, the unemployment rate had increased by only around 1.2 percentage points since February 2020 and stood at 8.4% in October 2020, as a result of special government support measures, especially in the form of job retention schemes including short-time work schemes.",
        "In the third quarter labour force growth had been recovering after the sharp declines recorded during the first few months of the pandemic.",
        "At the same time, high-frequency indicators suggested that job creation was being particularly hard hit during the pandemic.",
        "Turning to nominal developments, the December 2020 Eurosystem staff projections included downward revisions to HICP inflation and HICP inflation excluding energy and food (HICPX).",
        "These projections, which foresaw HICP inflation rebounding from 0.2% in 2020 to 1.0% in 2021 and gradually increasing further, to stand at 1.4% in 2023, were at broadly similar levels to forecasts by other international institutions and the private sector over the medium-term horizon.",
        "Headline inflation had remained at -0.3% in November according to Eurostat’s flash estimate – unchanged for the third month in a row.",
        "HICPX inflation had also been broadly unchanged, at 0.2%, while energy and food inflation had declined marginally.",
        "Much of the observed decline in services inflation was related to travel and hence a lot of this decline could be expected to be reversed in the future.",
        "Headline inflation was likely to remain negative in December 2020, but was expected to return to positive rates at the beginning of 2021.",
        "Special factors, including temporary changes in indirect taxes, had continued to play an important role in recent developments in headline inflation and in the short-term inflation outlook.",
        "Negotiated wage growth had decreased to 1.6%, year on year, in the third quarter of 2020, continuing a slight downward trend from the level of 2.0% recorded in the first quarter of 2020.",
        "Nonetheless, the persistence in wage developments had given some support to inflation over the course of 2020.",
        "The growth rate of the GDP deflator had declined to 1.0% in the third quarter of 2020, from 2.4% in the second quarter, narrowing the gap vis-à-vis HICPX inflation.",
        "As activity had rebounded in the third quarter, profit margins had also improved, but remained below the pre-crisis level.",
        "An important stabilising factor for profit margins in the current crisis seemed to have been the more widespread use of public support schemes.",
        "As regards inflation expectations, market and survey-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remained subdued.",
        "Participants in the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) also continued to see higher risks of low inflation in the longer term.",
        "For example, the probability of HICP inflation of less than 1% had doubled from around 10% in 2013 to about 20% recently.",
        "In terms of financial conditions in the euro area, the inversion of the EONIA forward curve had receded and there were no expectations of a cut in the deposit facility rate.",
        "Monetary policy expectations had contributed to keeping long-term risk-free rates low.",
        "Equity prices had increased since the last Governing Council meeting, largely driven by positive sentiment, but were not yet underpinned by strengthening earnings growth expectations.",
        "Corporate bond spreads had declined.",
        "The easing in financial conditions reflected higher pricing of risky assets after vaccine news as well as expectations of additional policy support.",
        "As regards monetary developments, money growth was buoyant, as ample credit had been provided to non-financial firms since the start of 2020.",
        "There was evidence that bank credit had reached those parts of the economy where it was needed most.",
        "Following the introduction of the various policy support measures, bank lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) had been much stronger than lending to other firms in the second quarter of 2020, in terms of both annual growth rates and the absolute size of loan flows.",
        "While nominal lending rates were favourable, real bank lending rates stood significantly higher than their pre-pandemic levels, owing to the lower level of near-term inflation expectations.",
        "So far banks had maintained the robust capital position prevailing at the start of the crisis and the regulatory and government support measures had supported both the average risk weights and the size of banks’ capital base.",
        "The increase in banks’ provisioning costs for expected loan losses had thus far been absorbed by banks through lower profits.",
        "This suggested that there might be mounting pressure on banks to bring about a recovery in their margins by increasing lending rates and tightening financing conditions for firms and households.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance had been strongly expansionary in 2020 and the December 2020 Eurosystem staff projections included a significantly larger stimulus over the period 2021-22 than assumed previously.",
        "The Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme was projected to provide substantial support for growth, although uncertainty with respect to the actual use of the fund and its impact remained high.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane remarked that while the prospects for the roll-out of vaccines were encouraging, the pandemic continued to pose serious risks to public health and to the euro area and global economies.",
        "The December Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections indicated a more pronounced impact of the pandemic on the economy in the short term.",
        "Headline inflation had remained unchanged at -0.3% in November and measures of underlying inflation had generally stabilised after the downward trend seen previously, but they continued to point to a broad-based weakness in price pressures and wage dynamics, while the euro’s appreciation also constituted a headwind to inflation.",
        "Market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained at very subdued levels, after a slight improvement in response to the positive vaccine news.",
        "The December projections pointed to a more protracted weakness in inflation than previously envisaged.",
        "The economic disruptions associated with the second wave of the pandemic implied a further delay in the convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim, as reflected by the 0.2 percentage point downward revision to the headline inflation projection for 2022.",
        "Sentiment in financial markets had benefited from optimism about the prospect of vaccine roll-outs.",
        "However, the level of financial conditions was also predicated on expectations of further monetary policy easing.",
        "With respect to financing conditions for firms and households, the latest surveys pointed to potential fragility in the transmission of monetary policy via banks.",
        "According to the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises, the net percentage of firms reporting a positive assessment of their access to credit had declined over the past six months and a sharp deterioration in access to both bank loans and credit lines was expected over the next six months.",
        "Together with the October 2020 round of the bank lending survey, which had indicated a tightening of credit standards and terms and conditions, the incoming information confirmed that the potential amplification of adverse real-financial feedback loops remained a material risk and needed to be closely monitored.",
        "Overall, the incoming data and the Eurosystem staff projections suggested a more pronounced near-term impact of the pandemic on economic activity and inflation than previously envisaged.",
        "In turn, the protracted nature of the pandemic shock entailed another delay in the convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim, while further risks of an unanchoring of inflation expectations were salient.",
        "In response to the economic fallout from the resurgence of the pandemic, Mr Lane proposed to take additional monetary policy measures.",
        "These were aimed at preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period, thereby supporting the flow of credit to all sectors of the economy, underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability.",
        "Preserving favourable financing conditions for an extended period of time helped to support inflation developments via multiple channels.",
        "First, it reduced financing uncertainty for banks, corporations, households and governments alike, and bolstered confidence, thereby encouraging spending and investment, and ultimately underpinning the economic recovery and inflation.",
        "Second, the assurance that favourable financing conditions would be maintained helped to prevent an undue tightening of financing conditions in an improving macroeconomic landscape.",
        "Keeping favourable financing conditions in such an environment could even accelerate the dynamics of the recovery, since better economic prospects combined with attractive financing conditions could fast-track consumption and investment.",
        "Finally, an extended period of favourable financing conditions would underpin confidence in the recovery and in the eventual pick-up in inflation, which would support inflation expectations and thereby provide additional monetary stimulus through lower real rates.",
        "Overall, preserving favourable financing conditions helped to counter the negative pandemic shock to the inflation path and thereby supported the achievement of the price stability objective via a reduction in uncertainty (notably about funding costs in the economy), but also through stronger forward guidance about how the central bank might respond to a future tightening of financing conditions.",
        "With these aims in mind, Mr Lane proposed to take the following decisions: The expansion and extension of PEPP purchases was the most suitable tool for helping to ensure that the level of financing conditions remained favourable to absorb the current shock and it could provide greater certainty about the duration of favourable financing conditions.",
        "This would help to reduce uncertainty and bolster confidence, thereby encouraging higher spending and investment, ultimately underpinning the economic recovery and helping to offset the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation.",
        "This implied conducting purchases flexibly according to market conditions, with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that was inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation.",
        "In addition, the commitment under the PEPP to purchase flexibly over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions would continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy.",
        "The recalibration of the PEPP was proportionate to the risks facing the fulfilment of the Governing Council’s mandate.",
        "It continued to be more efficient than a rate cut in the current pandemic conditions characterised by high uncertainty.",
        "And the previous assessment that, on balance, the benefits of PEPP purchases outweighed the potential costs also continued to hold.",
        "The extension of the horizon to March 2022 would take into account the expected timeline for the roll-out of vaccines and the updated macroeconomic projections that saw the return to 2019 GDP levels only during the course of 2022.",
        "Second, to extend the reinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023.",
        "In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio would be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "Third, to recalibrate the conditions on operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) by extending the lower interest rate period by 12 months to June 2022, adding three additional operations and increasing the borrowing allowance to 60% of the eligible loan stock.",
        "In order to create an incentive for banks to sustain the current level of bank lending, the recalibrated TLTRO III borrowing conditions could be made available only to banks that achieved a new lending performance target.",
        "The extension of the pandemic-related low interest rate period, the addition of more operations and the increase in the amount that could potentially be borrowed under TLTRO III would preserve the very attractive funding conditions that in the past few months had supported the flow of credit to the real economy, even at a time of high stress.",
        "This would help banks to secure the liquidity required to extend loans to households and firms on very favourable terms.",
        "Fourth, to extend to June 2022 the duration of the set of collateral easing measures adopted by the Governing Council on 7 and 22 April 2020, in order to provide assurance that banks could make full use of the Eurosystem’s liquidity operations, most notably the recalibrated TLTROs.",
        "Fifth, to offer four additional pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) in 2021, which would continue to provide an effective liquidity backstop.",
        "Sixth, as concerns the asset purchase programme (APP), to continue to conduct purchases at a monthly pace of €20 billion.",
        "The Governing Council needed to reiterate that it continued to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it started to raise the key ECB interest rates.",
        "In addition, the Governing Council needed to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "As regards external communication, the Governing Council needed to: (a) confirm that, while acknowledging the good news about the roll-out of vaccines, the resurgence in COVID-19 infections and the associated containment measures implied a more pronounced near-term impact of the pandemic on the economy and a more protracted weakness in inflation than previously envisaged; (b) emphasise that a recalibration of monetary policy instruments was needed to ensure that financing conditions remained favourable to underpin the economic recovery and to counteract the negative impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation; (c) stress that the recalibrated PEPP would be deployed to preserve favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period across all sectors; (d) underline that purchases would be conducted flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that would be inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation; in particular, if favourable financing conditions could be maintained with asset purchase flows that did not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope would not need to be used in full; equally, the envelope could be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation; (e) explain that the recalibrated TLTROs would preserve the very attractive funding conditions for banks, which would help to ensure that they could continue to offer favourable lending conditions and had sufficient liquidity to extend loans to households and firms; and (f) reiterate that it would continue to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally agreed with the overall assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks for activity provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "While the rebound of economic activity in the third quarter had been stronger than expected and the prospects for the roll-out of vaccines were encouraging, the pandemic continued to pose serious risks to public health and to the euro area and global economies.",
        "The resurgence in COVID-19 cases and the associated containment measures were significantly restricting euro area economic activity, which was expected to contract in the fourth quarter of 2020.",
        "Inflation remained very low in the context of weak demand and significant slack in labour and product markets.",
        "Overall, the incoming data and the Eurosystem staff projections suggested a more pronounced near-term impact of the pandemic on the economy and a more protracted weakness in inflation than previously envisaged.",
        "The baseline scenario of the December 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area saw real GDP growth at -7.3% in 2020, 3.9% in 2021, 4.2% in 2022 and 2.1% in 2023.",
        "Compared with the September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for economic activity had been revised down in the short term, but was seen to broadly recover to the level projected in the September baseline scenario over the medium term.",
        "Compared with the September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for inflation had been revised down for 2020 and 2022.",
        "As regards the external environment, members broadly shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "In the third quarter of 2020 global activity had rebounded more strongly than previously expected, but weakening growth momentum was foreseen in the fourth quarter amid rising COVID-19 cases and stricter containment policies.",
        "The resurgence of COVID-19 infections, coupled with the assumption made in the December 2020 Eurosystem staff projections of a no-deal Brexit and a faltering fiscal stimulus in many countries, had led to a weaker outlook at the turn of the year 2020/2021.",
        "The projections implied a marginal downward revision to growth in global activity and trade for 2021.",
        "Members expressed the view that an EU-UK agreement avoiding a no-deal Brexit and an agreement in the United States on a renewal of the fiscal stimulus constituted upside risks to these projections, while downside risks remained, related to the further evolution of the pandemic and the possibility of more protracted scarring effects.",
        "Turning to euro area developments, members acknowledged that, following a sharp contraction in the first half of 2020, euro area real GDP had rebounded strongly in the third quarter.",
        "It was noted that this rebound had been stronger than expected in the September 2020 ECB staff projections and, together with a less pronounced decline in the second quarter than previously anticipated, constituted upside surprises for two consecutive quarters.",
        "Looking ahead, this experience suggested that rebounds could again be fairly dynamic once restrictions were lifted.",
        "Economic agents had apparently learned to adapt to such restrictions, for instance by adjusting their consumption patterns, and the economy had demonstrated a strong capacity to bounce back rather quickly.",
        "At the same time, the role of policy support, which remained critical in cushioning the impact of the pandemic, was underlined.",
        "Members widely agreed that the second wave of the pandemic and the associated intensification of containment measures observed since mid-October could be expected to result in a renewed significant decline in activity in the fourth quarter of 2020, although to a much lesser extent than observed in the second quarter of the year.",
        "It was highlighted that the carry-over effect from the decline in the fourth quarter was the main factor behind the downward revision to expected real GDP growth in 2021 in the staff projections.",
        "In their discussion of the outlook for economic activity, members welcomed the positive news about the prospective roll-out of vaccines and thus a gradual resolution of the health crisis.",
        "This represented a major difference compared with the situation at the time of the Governing Council’s last monetary policy meeting in October, as could be seen from the clear improvement in financial market sentiment.",
        "It was argued that the prospect of more effective and more quickly disseminated vaccines implied a more benign pandemic scenario than previously anticipated in the September ECB staff projections and thus had a substantial bearing on the medium-term economic outlook, which was predicated on the expected evolution of the pandemic.",
        "Members considered that the impact of positive news regarding the availability of vaccines on the medium-term outlook needed to be weighed against the impact of the more negative latest news on infection rates and containment measures in the short term.",
        "In this respect, a key question was how temporary the effects of the renewed downward shock would be and how long it would take the economy to recover from a double-dip of activity into negative territory.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that the expected shape of the recovery now looked very different from the V- and U-shapes expected earlier in the year.",
        "It was possible that given the more positive starting point, the second wave of the pandemic would not make the crisis deeper as a whole, but would make it more drawn out than previously anticipated.",
        "It was felt that a protracted curtailment of activity might inflict more lasting damage on a number of sectors, with heightened risks of rising insolvencies and unemployment affecting the medium-term outlook and more protracted scarring effects owing to the delay in the recovery.",
        "Against this background, there was broad agreement among members that pronounced uncertainty remained a key theme in the economic outlook and it was observed that this uncertainty could ultimately be resolved in different ways.",
        "Although fiscal policy measures were supporting households and firms, the uncertainty about the economic outlook was weighing on business investment and causing consumers to remain cautious.",
        "If health concerns rather than containment measures were behind this caution, consumer spending would only recover more fully once the pandemic faded away.",
        "The evolution of the elevated household saving ratio thus remained a critical element in the staff projections, as its expected renewed spike and subsequent gradual unwinding was an important factor determining the profile of consumption.",
        "As long as jobs were preserved, the experience of the third quarter of 2020 suggested that the significant amount of accumulated savings could lead to a stronger rebound in growth.",
        "However, it was also recalled that while there might be pent-up demand for durable goods, demand for services would possibly stay depressed for longer.",
        "Overall, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook were seen to remain tilted to the downside, although they were less pronounced.",
        "While the news about vaccine roll-outs in the near future was encouraging, downside risks remained, related to the implications of the pandemic for economic and financial conditions.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remained critical in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy.",
        "Fiscal measures in response to the pandemic emergency should, as far as possible, be targeted and temporary.",
        "At the same time, weak demand from firms and households and the heightened risk of a delayed recovery warranted continued support from fiscal policy at the national and European levels.",
        "The key role of the NGEU package and the importance of it becoming operational without delay were reiterated.",
        "Some comfort was drawn from recent signals that the package was now closer to being adopted.",
        "It was underlined that provided that the funds were deployed for productive public spending and accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural reforms, the NGEU would contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery.",
        "It would thereby enhance resilience and the growth potential of Member States’ economies, supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area.",
        "Such structural policies were particularly important for addressing long-standing structural and institutional weaknesses and accelerating the green and digital transitions.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was also broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual inflation had remained unchanged at -0.3% in November.",
        "On the basis of oil price dynamics and taking into account the temporary reduction in the German VAT rate, headline inflation was likely to remain negative until early 2021.",
        "It was then expected to increase owing to the end of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany and upward base effects in energy price inflation.",
        "At the same time, underlying price pressures were expected to remain subdued owing to weak demand, notably in the tourism and travel-related sectors, as well as to low wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro.",
        "Once the impact of the pandemic faded, a recovery in demand, supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, would put upward pressure on inflation over the medium term.",
        "Market-based indicators and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained at low levels.",
        "In their discussion of the outlook for inflation in the December Eurosystem staff projections, members noted that because of the pandemic there was exceptionally high uncertainty at present regarding the measurement of economic slack and of inflation, as well as the relationship between them over time.",
        "This was probably also affecting the range of plausible inflation projections and, in the light of past projection errors for inflation, suggested the need to include a degree of caution in the projection baseline.",
        "The expected inflation profile in the December Eurosystem staff projections was low when compared with past projections, and it remained well below the Governing Council’s inflation aim even at the end of the current projection horizon in 2023.",
        "The staff projections implied that by the end of the projection horizon, with the exception of the year 2018, euro area inflation would have remained below the inflation aim for around a decade.",
        "Given the repeated experience of subdued inflation outturns and protracted errors in inflation projections, the question was raised as to whether persistently subdued inflation could in part be ascribed to structural factors, such as digitalisation.",
        "A question was also raised about the extent to which recent projection errors could be due to developments in certain specific items, such as those related to travel, which likely had a very low actual weight in current consumption during the pandemic.",
        "Members also paid close attention to the role of the exchange rate in the inflation outlook.",
        "It was pointed out that the nominal effective exchange rate currently stood at an all-time high and that the recent appreciation could contribute significantly to the subdued inflation outlook.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that the impact of the exchange rate on inflation depended on the nature and persistence of the shock driving the exchange rate movement.",
        "As regards inflation expectations, members noted that since the end of 2019 longer-term inflation expectations in the SPF had remained relatively resilient and stood close to the longer-term downward trend in actual HICP inflation.",
        "The December 2020 Eurosystem staff projections did not imply a major reversal of this trend.",
        "Market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had increased to pre-pandemic levels on the news about the prospective roll-out of vaccines.",
        "However, they remained at very low levels.",
        "On the monetary analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction that strong broad money (M3) growth had been supported by the Eurosystem’s ongoing asset purchases, which had become the largest source of money creation.",
        "The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth, reflecting a still heightened preference for liquidity in the money-holding sector and a low opportunity cost.",
        "The annual growth of bank loans to the private sector had plateaued, although at higher rates than prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "Meanwhile, monthly lending volumes had receded, which indicated diminishing emergency liquidity needs, weak investment and tighter conditions on loans to firms, as signalled by the ECB’s bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2020.",
        "The TLTRO III operations were seen to be providing continuous support to bank lending.",
        "Together with the liquidity buffers that firms had accumulated, the improved resilience of bank balance sheets at the beginning of the crisis and the recent extension of fiscal and macroprudential policy measures, TLTRO III was considered to be mitigating the risks of adverse real-financial feedback loops.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that credit risks and the probability of default of non-financial corporations were increasing as the crisis endured.",
        "Views were exchanged on the role of loan supply versus loan demand factors, with reference being made to elevated corporate savings and a possible satiation of precautionary liquidity needs among companies.",
        "With regard to financial conditions, members widely shared the assessments provided by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane in their introductions.",
        "Namely, market sentiment had improved notably following the news of the successful development of vaccines and on account of expected monetary policy measures.",
        "Interest rate spreads of euro area sovereigns had fallen below their pre-crisis levels.",
        "It was cautioned, however, that uncertainty remained high and positive sentiment could erode quickly in the event of negative news.",
        "Concerns were voiced over risks related to developments in the exchange rate that might have negative consequences for the inflation outlook.",
        "All members agreed that, in view of the economic fallout from the resurgence of the pandemic, the downward revision to the projected inflation path, and the resulting risks of an unanchoring of inflation expectations, additional monetary policy measures were necessary to preserve favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period, thereby supporting the flow of credit to all sectors of the economy and underpinning the economic recovery.",
        "It was observed that the December Eurosystem staff inflation projections were far below the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Against this background, decisive action to ensure that financing conditions remained favourable was deemed necessary.",
        "It was recalled, however, that, although the medium-term inflation outlook was not in line with the Governing Council’s aim, the current circumstances differed in some respects from the emergency situation during which the PEPP had initially been decided upon.",
        "The current environment warranted a recalibration of policy instruments to safeguard favourable financing conditions, rather than the adoption of additional measures to combat the crisis.",
        "The remark was made that the Governing Council’s medium-term orientation called for patience and persistence on reaching its aim over time and that the PEPP horizon was therefore an important parameter.",
        "At the same time, the argument was made that a further lowering of yields from their already highly accommodative levels could be expected to have only marginal effects on growth and inflation, while increasing the risks of unintended side effects, in particular for financial stability.",
        "Overall, the Governing Council would need to monitor changes in the outlook for price stability carefully over the coming months.",
        "Members expressed broad agreement with the monetary policy package proposed by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "It aimed at maintaining favourable financing conditions for an extended period during the pandemic and ensuring that the flow of credit to all sectors of the economy continued to be supported, thereby underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability.",
        "The expansion and extension of PEPP purchases and the recalibration of the TLTRO III conditions were widely seen as the most suitable tools to ensure that financing conditions remained favourable throughout the pandemic.",
        "Given that the return to the Governing Council’s inflation aim was delayed by the pandemic, it was widely considered an appropriate and proportional response to the prevailing type of shock to increase the horizon of net purchases under the PEPP until March 2022, extend the reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until the end of 2023, and to add more TLTRO III operations, extending the pandemic-related low interest rate period to June 2022.",
        "Overall, it was agreed that the proposed longer horizon of the PEPP and TLTRO III was broadly in line with the expected duration of the pandemic crisis, the continued uncertainty about the roll-out of the vaccines, and the expected return of economic activity to its pre-pandemic level.",
        "It was also agreed that the assessment by Mr Lane that, on balance, the benefits of PEPP purchases and the TLTRO III outweighed the potential costs continued to hold.",
        "The PEPP was seen as the cornerstone of the Governing Council’s monetary policy package, as thanks to its flexibility it had proven particularly effective in ensuring the Eurosystem maintained a stabilising presence in the markets, providing a backstop against a disorderly repricing of risk.",
        "The PEPP also contributed to easing the monetary policy stance in response to the downward impact of the pandemic on the path of inflation.",
        "An expansion of the PEPP envelope by €500 billion, in addition to the €20 billion of monthly purchases under the APP, was generally seen as appropriate to underpin the Governing Council’s commitment to maintaining favourable financing conditions over the extended pandemic period.",
        "A more moderate increase in the PEPP envelope was advocated by a number of members based on the argument that significant space for purchases was still available from past decisions and that in an environment of high uncertainty it was worth “keeping some powder dry” by maintaining the option to further adjust the envelope in the future.",
        "However, some arguments were also made in favour of a larger envelope.",
        "While the already accommodative level of current financing conditions was acknowledged, it was argued that the proposed increase in the PEPP envelope was insufficient to ease financing conditions further and bring inflation closer to the Governing Council’s aim, also in the light of the fact that the additional envelope of €120 billion for the APP would run out by the end of 2020.",
        "Members highlighted the flexibility embodied in the PEPP.",
        "It was argued that the focus on preserving favourable financing conditions implied a move away from a constant monthly pace of purchases towards adjusting the pace according to market conditions, with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation.",
        "This approach, combined with forceful communication, could allow the Governing Council to reduce the pace of purchases while having an equivalent effect on financing conditions.",
        "This could result in greater efficiency and in using less than the entire envelope over the duration of the programme.",
        "The flexibility in the allocation of the PEPP purchases over time was seen as being well aligned with the principle of proportionality and the Governing Council’s monetary policy stance.",
        "At the same time, it was seen as essential for the Governing Council to state that it stood ready to increase the envelope further if needed.",
        "Attention was drawn to possible constraints on and side effects of additional purchases, such as the risks of moral hazard, fiscal dominance and distorted market functioning.",
        "Safeguards to guarantee a sufficient distance from monetary financing concerns – such as the guidance for the allocation of the stock of asset purchases according to the capital key – were seen as important to maintain legitimacy and independence.",
        "It was emphasised that in the present environment fiscal policy remained the most appropriate response to the pandemic-driven crisis and monetary policy should play a secondary role.",
        "Members also exchanged views on how to assess favourable financing conditions and felt that financing conditions should be considered in a holistic way, with their appropriate level also depending on the inflation outlook.",
        "It was deemed important to explain that maintaining favourable financing conditions allowed for some flexibility if the fundamentals changed or if conditions tightened endogenously in response to economic developments.",
        "In addition, the relevant financing conditions were seen to pertain to all private and public sectors of the economy, comprising interest rates as well as credit volumes and conditions.",
        "With regard to the recalibration of the TLTRO III conditions, the three proposed changes – the extension of the pandemic-related low interest rate period, the addition of more operations and the increase in the amount that could potentially be borrowed – were seen as appropriate ways to preserve attractive funding conditions and to help banks to secure the liquidity required to keep extending loans to households and firms on favourable lending terms.",
        "The new lending performance target was considered an important element -giving banks an incentive to provide additional credit, whereas the current attractive pricing of TLTRO III seemed sufficient to provide ongoing backing for bank-based monetary policy transmission.",
        "The proposed increase in the amount that could potentially be borrowed under TLTRO III was seen as supporting the flow of credit to the real economy, allowing banks to secure liquidity on very favourable terms.",
        "It was recalled that this amount was defined in relation to euro area banks’ stock of eligible loans, which amounted to just over half of their total loan book.",
        "A number of reservations were expressed with regard to the proposed increase in the borrowing allowance to 60%, related, in particular, to concerns that it would make banks increasingly dependent on the Eurosystem as their funding source and could induce banks to invest more in sovereign debt.",
        "Against this background, broad agreement was reached to raise the borrowing allowance to 55% of the stock of eligible loans.",
        "As regards communication, members widely agreed with the elements proposed by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Although uncertainty continued to be pronounced, it was deemed important to acknowledge the positive news that had emerged since the last meeting and its impact on the balance of risk.",
        "At the same time, it was felt that the Governing Council needed to stress that the medium-term inflation outlook was far from an inflation rate of below, but close to, 2%.",
        "The view was expressed that the Governing Council could not afford to be perceived as complacent about the inflation path embodied in the projections.",
        "In addition, it needed to be stressed that the recalibration of the Governing Council’s policy measures provided sizable and flexible support in order to maintain favourable financing conditions over the extended pandemic period.",
        "An important shift in implementing the PEPP was to be highlighted and it should be underlined that if favourable financing conditions could be maintained with asset purchase flows that did not exhaust the full amount available under the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full.",
        "At the same time, the Governing Council should also indicate its willingness to recalibrate the PEPP in the future, as needed, to ensure that overall financing conditions were sufficiently favourable to counteract the impact of the pandemic on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In this context, it was noted that the important role that the reinvestment of principal payments played for the monetary policy stance had to be underlined as well.",
        "Furthermore, the Governing Council needed to announce that it would carefully monitor whether its measures were sufficient to guarantee a return of inflation to its aim, and to reiterate that it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "This could also include possibly cutting the deposit facility rate.",
        "The Governing Council would also continue to monitor the effects of the exchange rate on the inflation outlook.",
        "Finally, the need for an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy was to be emphasised, underlining the key role of the NGEU package and the importance of it becoming operational without delay.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council decided to recalibrate its monetary policy instruments as follows: First, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it had seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence had been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.",
        "Second, the Governing Council decided to increase the envelope of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) by €500 billion to a total of €1,850 billion.",
        "It also extended the horizon for net purchases under the PEPP to at least the end of March 2022.",
        "In any case, the Governing Council would conduct net purchases until it judged that the coronavirus crisis phase was over.",
        "The Governing Council also decided to extend the reinvestment of principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023.",
        "In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio would be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "Third, the Governing Council decided to further recalibrate the conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III).",
        "Specifically, it decided to extend the period over which considerably more favourable terms would apply by twelve months, to June 2022.",
        "Three additional operations would also be conducted between June and December 2021.",
        "Moreover, the Governing Council decided to raise the total amount that counterparties would be entitled to borrow in TLTRO III operations from 50% to 55% of their stock of eligible loans.",
        "In order to provide an incentive for banks to sustain the current level of bank lending, the recalibrated TLTRO III borrowing conditions would be made available only to banks that achieved a new lending performance target.",
        "Fourth, the Governing Council decided to extend to June 2022 the duration of the set of collateral easing measures adopted by the Governing Council on 7 and 22 April 2020.",
        "The extension of these measures would continue to ensure that banks could make full use of the Eurosystem’s liquidity operations, most notably the recalibrated TLTROs.",
        "The Governing Council would reassess the collateral easing measures before June 2022, ensuring that Eurosystem counterparties’ participation in TLTRO III operations was not adversely affected.",
        "Fifth, the Governing Council also decided to offer four additional pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) in 2021, which would continue to provide an effective liquidity backstop.",
        "Sixth, net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) would continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion.",
        "The Governing Council continued to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it started raising the key ECB interest rates.",
        "The Governing Council also intended to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Seventh, the Eurosystem repo facility for central banks (EUREP) and all temporary swap and repo lines with non-euro area central banks would be extended until March 2022.",
        "Finally, the Governing Council decided to continue conducting its regular lending operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment at the prevailing conditions for as long as necessary.",
        "The monetary policy measures taken today would contribute to preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period, thereby supporting the flow of credit to all sectors of the economy, underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability.",
        "At the same time, uncertainty remained high, including with regard to the dynamics of the pandemic and the timing of vaccine roll-outs.",
        "The Governing Council would also continue to monitor developments in the exchange rate with regard to their possible implications for the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "The Council therefore continued to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 21-22 April 2021.",
        "The nominal euro area ten-year GDP-weighted sovereign bond yield had increased by around 5 basis points, while short to medium-term yields had remained broadly unchanged.",
        "Taking into account also broader developments since the Governing Council’s 10-11 March meeting, a mild steepening of the yield curve could be observed – a typical phenomenon of an economy on the verge of recovery.",
        "Long-term US Treasury yields, meanwhile, had remained largely unchanged over the same period.",
        "Market intelligence pointed to two key drivers behind the diverging yield developments in the euro area and the United States.",
        "The first factor related to the pace of vaccination, which had been accelerating in all major euro area countries.",
        "As a result, the euro area was now expected to close most of the vaccination gap with the United States by the start of the summer.",
        "A high proportion of vaccinations had also strengthened investor confidence in the resilience of the euro area recovery.",
        "The second, and related, factor concerned the dynamics of the reopening, which had been considerably faster and economically stronger than most analysts had expected.",
        "The data for the euro area in recent weeks had persistently surprised market analysts to the upside.",
        "Model-based evidence confirmed that positive macroeconomic shocks had been a key factor driving euro area risk-free yields since the Governing Council’s 10-11 March meeting.",
        "This stood in sharp contrast to the period before the March meeting, when spillovers from outside the euro area had been the main driving force.",
        "Firming expectations about a strong euro area recovery had led investors to materially upgrade their required inflation compensation across the entire maturity spectrum.",
        "Markets now expected annual inflation in two years’ time – once adjusted for the still negative inflation risk premium – to be at almost 1.7%, well above the level seen before the pandemic.",
        "Option prices suggested that markets were pricing almost a one-in-four chance that euro area inflation over the next five years would average more than 2%.",
        "Consequently, changes in inflation compensation had remained the sole driver of developments in nominal risk-free rates in recent weeks.",
        "Real long-term overnight index swap (OIS) rates, by contrast, had remained below the levels that prevailed when, in December 2020, the Governing Council had pledged to preserve favourable financing conditions.",
        "At the same time, there had been a notable and persistent increase in the spread of the ten-year GDP-weighted sovereign bond yield over the risk-free OIS rate.",
        "What distinguished the recent widening of the spread from many previous episodes was the fact that it had occurred across all euro area sovereigns, including the safest ones.",
        "Corporate bond spreads, by contrast, had remained resilient.",
        "It was likely that significant liquidity buffers, an improving growth and credit outlook, as well as expectations of continued fiscal policy support had jointly contributed to keeping spreads stable at, or close to, pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Recent developments had been accompanied by a marginal upward shift in the euro overnight index average (EONIA) forward OIS curve, which now indicated a slightly earlier time for policy rate lift-off.",
        "However, both the limited size of the shift and survey evidence suggested that genuine lift-off expectations had not changed significantly in recent months.",
        "The nominal effective exchange rate of the euro had also remained broadly unchanged in recent months, masking diverging bilateral exchange rate developments that mirrored, by and large, the different pace with which the recovery from the crisis was proceeding around the globe.",
        "Finally, recent stock market developments suggested that the renewed rise in long-term rates continued to be seen by investors as a harbinger of a robust and resilient expansion.",
        "The EURO STOXX 50 Index had risen by 8% since the Governing Council’s meeting on 10-11 March.",
        "Upward revisions to long-term earnings expectations had pushed equity valuations in the euro area higher.",
        "Countries that were expected to benefit more from the reopening of the economy and a faster pace of vaccination had recently outperformed others.",
        "At the sectoral level, euro area banking had been the best-performing sector for the year to date, benefiting from an improving domestic economy, rising bond yields and cheap funding costs through the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs).",
        "However, despite improved market sentiment, euro area bank valuations remained depressed in historical and international comparison.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and the recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "As regards the external environment, progress in overcoming the pandemic, especially in advanced economies, was reflected in developments in Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) as leading indicators of economic activity.",
        "Manufacturing PMIs had recovered quickly but had also stabilised more recently, partly on account of bottlenecks in production.",
        "At the same time, there had been a very significant and sharp increase in the global services output PMI.",
        "The recovery in global trade had so far been very strong, which reflected a close link between trade and manufacturing.",
        "Oil prices had risen since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting (+7.7%) and also relative to the assumptions embedded in the June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area at the cut-off date (+3.9%).",
        "In US dollar terms, oil prices were now broadly back at their pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Also since the April meeting, the euro had appreciated slightly against the US dollar but was broadly unchanged in nominal effective terms – although it was quite elevated when compared with its spring 2020 level.",
        "Turning to the euro area, in the first quarter of 2021 the economy had experienced a consumption-led drop in GDP growth.",
        "Looser restrictions were expected to enable a rebound in activity as of the second quarter.",
        "At the sectoral level, manufacturing had been held back by supply-side constraints related to semiconductors and shipping, which in turn had weighed on first quarter output.",
        "In addition, the services sector had continued to be adversely affected by distancing measures and by a lack of demand.",
        "The hardest hit high-contact services, such as travel, accommodation and food, were still lagging, though clearly improving.",
        "The improving pandemic situation was reflected in strongly rising levels of confidence, as seen, for instance, in the Economic Sentiment Indicator and PMI data to May.",
        "Regarding the components of GDP, consumer spending had decreased by 2.3% quarter on quarter in real terms in the first quarter of 2021.",
        "With households having gradually become more optimistic, consumption was expected to increase strongly in the second and third quarters of the year before levelling off.",
        "While the saving ratio was expected to fall, it was important to keep in mind that growth in household disposable income had been sustained by substantial public income support over recent quarters.",
        "As the economy recovered, labour income should again contribute more to growth in household income.",
        "Investment had continued to support the economic recovery.",
        "Housing investment in the first quarter of the year had continued to grow, by 0.5% quarter on quarter, while firms had also flagged significant shortages of labour and materials, as well as a near-record lengthening of supplier delivery times.",
        "For business investment, recent data indicated a rebound also in the second quarter of 2021, after a 0.4% quarter-on-quarter contraction in the first quarter.",
        "Turning to euro area trade, order-based indicators signalled strong momentum, while the recovery in extra-euro area goods exports had slowed during the first months of the year.",
        "Euro area manufacturers had struggled to source semiconductors as a consequence of input shortages and were affected by disruptions in shipping.",
        "Assessing labour market developments, hard indicators had continued to show weakness while soft indicators were signalling improvements.",
        "Employment was still about 2.2% below pre-pandemic levels and the latest employment figure for the first quarter of 2021 was -0.3% (quarter on quarter), on account of the contraction in real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021.",
        "While the unemployment rate reflected a slight improvement, broader measures of labour underutilisation had remained high.",
        "In line with the recovery in the economy, forward-looking employment indicators had turned positive.",
        "The June staff projections included upward revisions to the level of economic activity.",
        "Real GDP was projected to grow by 4.6% in 2021 and 4.7% in 2022 (revised up by 0.6 percentage points for both years), and by 2.1% in 2023 (unchanged).",
        "Overall, the faster pace of the recovery was broad-based across demand components.",
        "To address the continued uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and its influence on economic developments, alternative mild and severe scenarios had been prepared once again, as part of the June projection exercise.",
        "Turning to nominal developments, inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had increased from 1.3% in March to 1.6% in April and 2.0% in May 2021, according to Eurostat’s flash release.",
        "Positive energy-related base effects – linked to the strong fall in energy inflation in 2020 – had been dominating developments in headline inflation since February 2021.",
        "Meanwhile, the role of some temporary factors, such as seasonal sales or changes in HICP weights, had been waning in recent months.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food had broadly moved sideways between March and May 2021, at 0.9%, which was still somewhat below the level observed before the pandemic.",
        "Negotiated wage growth had decreased substantially to 1.4% in the first quarter of 2021, well below the 1.8% recorded, on average, in 2020.",
        "Compensation per employee and compensation per hour had continued to be strongly affected by job retention schemes.",
        "At the same time, the GDP deflator had increased from 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 1.5% in the first quarter of 2021.",
        "Pronounced rises in input costs (linked to surging commodity price inflation, substantial increases in shipping costs and supply shortages of some raw materials) had led to upward pressures at the early stages of the pricing chain.",
        "However, so far, higher pipeline pressures for intermediate goods had fed through to later stages of the pricing chain only to a very limited extent.",
        "Euro area producer price inflation for non-food consumer goods – a key measure of pipeline pressures for non-energy industrial goods – had stood at 1.0% in April, up from 0.9% in March and 0.6% in February.",
        "In the June staff projections, headline inflation was projected to average 1.9% in 2021 and to decline to 1.5% and 1.4% in 2022 and 2023 respectively.",
        "Compared with the March staff projections, the projection for HICP inflation had been revised up for 2021 and 2022 and was unchanged for 2023.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food was projected to increase from 1.1% in 2021 to 1.3% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2023, revised up throughout the projection horizon due to upward effects from rising global inflationary pressures and more positive developments in slack.",
        "Turning to market-based measures of inflation compensation, inflation-linked swap (ILS) rates had continued to recover, especially in shorter maturities.",
        "The one-year forward ILS rate one year ahead had increased by 23 basis points to 1.27% since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting, while the five-year forward ILS rate five years ahead had risen by 7 basis points to stand at 1.60%.",
        "As regards financial conditions in the euro area, asset prices across financial markets had mirrored improvements in the economic outlook.",
        "Equity and corporate bond markets were reflecting an improving outlook for growth and near-term credit risk.",
        "Long-term risk-free rates and GDP-weighted sovereign bond yields had increased somewhat further since the March Governing Council monetary policy meeting and stood above their pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Turning to monetary developments, annual M3 growth had declined to 9.2% in April from 10% in March.",
        "While the first four months of 2021 had seen a moderation in broad money growth, it had been driven by special factors.",
        "M3 growth had continued to be driven by Eurosystem purchases and, up to March, resilient lending to the private sector, which had supported the liquidity buffers of firms and the deposits of households.",
        "Bank lending to firms had seen net redemptions in April after the large positive inflow in March, which reflected the decision by some banks to frontload their lending to March to meet the lending benchmark for the TLTRO.",
        "The outflow in April might have also reflected decreased liquidity needs, as the sectors most affected by the pandemic showed signs of recovery.",
        "Bank lending rates to firms had increased in April, more than offsetting the decline observed in March.",
        "Fiscal support had been scaled up further, especially for 2021, with a substantial additional stimulus since the March staff projections.",
        "A higher stimulus funded by the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme was projected to provide significant growth support over the forecast horizon.",
        "According to the June fiscal projection, after the massive fiscal response to the pandemic crisis in 2020, the euro area budget deficit was projected to remain around 7% in 2021 and to decline to levels around 3% as of 2022.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane remarked that, while output had declined in the first quarter of 2021, forward-looking survey data indicated the start of a significant rebound in the second quarter.",
        "In particular, the services sector had started to reopen.",
        "The manufacturing sector remained strong, even if supply constraints and the uncertain prospects for some large emerging market economies were likely to pose headwinds.",
        "The pick-up in economic activity should accelerate in the third quarter, as a result of further progress in containing the pandemic and the associated easing of social distancing restrictions.",
        "Overall, based on the June staff projections, real GDP was expected to exceed its pre-pandemic level in the first quarter of 2022, one quarter earlier than envisaged in the March staff projections.",
        "Risks surrounding the growth outlook were balanced.",
        "An even stronger recovery could be predicated on better developments in the epidemiological situation, a more vigorous rebound in consumption and a stronger than projected rebound in foreign demand.",
        "In contrast, downside risks still mainly related to a renewed deterioration in the pandemic, for instance due to the spread of more infectious coronavirus (COVID-19) variants, as well as to financial disruptions that could result from a surge in corporate insolvencies.",
        "The increase in headline inflation, from 1.3% in March to 1.6% in April and 2.0% in May, was predominantly due to sizeable base effects in energy inflation.",
        "To a lesser extent, non-energy industrial goods inflation had also played a role.",
        "Pipeline pressures at the earlier stages of the pricing chain were intensifying, although there was no evidence so far that these were seeping through to inflation developments.",
        "Underlying inflationary pressures remained muted, especially as wage inflation was still weak.",
        "Owing to the reversal of last year’s temporary VAT reduction in Germany, headline inflation was projected to pick up after the summer and to peak towards the end of the year, averaging 1.9% in 2021, before returning to more moderate rates of 1.5% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2023.",
        "The projected increase in core inflation, from 1.1% in 2021 to 1.3% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2023, reflected an upgrade on the March staff projections.",
        "Long-term benchmark market interest rates had continued to increase, exerting some upward pressure on euro area sovereign bond yields.",
        "“Downstream” financing indicators, which capture the credit conditions facing households and firms, remained accommodative.",
        "Nonetheless, these could tighten in the months to come should the upward movement in long-term risk-free rates and sovereign bond yields prove sustained.",
        "The risk of tighter financing conditions needed to be seen against the still subdued outlook for inflation beyond the near term.",
        "At its meeting on 10-11 March, when confronted with a similar tightening in market interest rates against a backdrop of limited progress in the inflation outlook, the Governing Council had decided to significantly step up purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).",
        "The macroeconomic situation at the time of this meeting was more benign: economic prospects were brightening, risks were receding and the projected pick-up in core inflation improved the robustness of the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "At the same time, the negative pandemic shock to the projected inflation path had not been fully reversed.",
        "Also, if sustained, the rise in market rates could dampen the ongoing recovery and delay further progress in boosting inflation dynamics.",
        "Against this background, Mr Lane proposed that the Governing Council should continue to conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP over the coming quarter at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year.",
        "A significantly higher pace of purchases under the PEPP remained necessary to help preserve the favourable financing conditions that were needed to offset the negative impact of the pandemic on inflation.",
        "This meant that asset purchases under the PEPP remained a proportionate monetary policy response to the risks to the ECB’s inflation aim.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and of the risks to activity provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "After the contraction in the first quarter of 2021, the latest data signalled a bounce-back in services activity and ongoing dynamism in manufacturing production.",
        "Economic activity was expected to accelerate in the second half of the year as further containment measures were lifted.",
        "At the same time, uncertainties remained, as the near-term economic outlook continued to depend on the course of the pandemic and on how the economy responded after reopening.",
        "Inflation had picked up over recent months, largely on account of base effects in energy inflation and other transitory factors.",
        "It was expected to rise further in the second half of the year, before declining as temporary factors faded out.",
        "As regards the external environment, members largely shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction that the global economic outlook was broadly unchanged.",
        "This concealed an upgrade to the outlook for advanced economies relative to that for emerging market economies, given the more rapid progress with vaccination programmes in the former and some new concerns about the pandemic in the latter.",
        "The stronger trade relationships between the euro area and other advanced economies implied that an unchanged global growth outlook was consistent with stronger euro area foreign demand.",
        "It was observed that, compared with progress in other major economies around the world, the economic recovery in the euro area was as yet lacking in robustness.",
        "At the same time, it was suggested that the inflationary pressures being experienced in some of these cyclically more advanced economies, notably the United States, could be a harbinger of developments in the euro area further down the road.",
        "Turning to euro area developments, in the first quarter of the year euro area real GDP had declined further, by 0.3%, to stand 5.1% below its pre-pandemic level of the fourth quarter of 2019. Business and consumer surveys and high-frequency indicators pointed to a sizeable improvement in activity as of the second quarter.",
        "Over the medium term, the recovery in the euro area economy was expected to be buoyed by stronger global and domestic demand, with continued support from both monetary policy and fiscal policy.",
        "Members generally agreed with both the baseline view for economic growth in the June staff projections and the upward revision as compared with the March staff projections.",
        "It was widely acknowledged that incoming information and data had been favourable and bolstered confidence in the expected economic recovery.",
        "It was underlined that there had been a string of positive surprises in the euro area since the March monetary policy meeting.",
        "Significant progress had been made on vaccination and the containment of the pandemic, with many restrictions in euro area countries being lifted.",
        "The point was made that the upward revisions to growth in the June staff projections looked modest compared with the recent improvements in some indicators.",
        "Moreover, activity in the first quarter of this year had turned out less negative than anticipated in the June projections.",
        "It was argued that this would still need to be factored into the outlook and would imply a faster closing of the output gap.",
        "However, it was remarked that projection errors for the first quarter were very heterogeneous across countries and that the outcome had been better than expected only in parts of the euro area.",
        "At the same time, there were a number of reasons for caution.",
        "The recovery was still fragile and remained heavily dependent on the evolution of the pandemic and the assumption that the health crisis would be over after the summer.",
        "Reference was made to the uncertainty surrounding the emergence of new COVID-19 variants and the containment measures that these might necessitate.",
        "Moreover, it was suggested that positive surprises in incoming information had related more to soft data than to hard data, and it was noted that the June staff projections for growth in the second and third quarters of the year were above those of mechanical short-term forecasting tools.",
        "It was also stressed that the recovery remained heavily dependent on the support of fiscal policy measures and the very accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In assessing the risks to growth, it was underlined that there had been a number of consecutive upward revisions to the growth outlook across recent projection rounds, despite the earlier assessment of downside risks.",
        "It was observed that the June baseline staff projections had turned out somewhere between the baseline and mild scenarios of the March staff projections.",
        "Also, it was noted that the GDP projections had been moving successively closer to the pre-pandemic trajectory and it was argued that, from that perspective, scarring effects seemed to be turning out less pronounced than had been initially feared.",
        "At the same time it was cautioned that, if the pandemic continued and restrictions remained in place, the outlook might be just as prone to downward revisions as it had previously been to upward revisions.",
        "Moreover, in the June staff projections a number of previous upside risk factors were fully incorporated into the baseline, notably the impact associated with the US fiscal plans.",
        "The behaviour of consumers in response to an easing of lockdown measures continued to be surrounded by uncertainty.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that the assumption included in the June staff projections concerning the unwinding of accumulated forced savings might be too conservative.",
        "Even small additional releases of these savings could have large effects on consumption because of the amounts involved.",
        "Regarding possible additional upward risks to consumption, a question was raised on the role of wealth effects associated with the recent increases in house prices and equity prices.",
        "On the other hand, it was observed that, while the staff projections assumed only a small proportion of excess savings would be unwound by the end of the projection horizon, the projections were still predicated on the assumption of a very rapid normalisation of the saving ratio in the short term.",
        "It was recalled that excess savings had been accumulated mainly in richer households with lower propensities to consume and that there was large heterogeneity in such excess savings across euro area countries.",
        "A general question remained on the scale of pent-up demand and the extent to which excess savings could also be used for consumption rather than housing or other purposes, such as repaying debt.",
        "It was observed that there had been no change to the staff projection for real GDP growth in 2023 and that the upward revision for 2022 was essentially due to carry-over effects from 2021, both of which suggested further upside risks beyond the short term.",
        "The point was also made that downside risks from financial amplification mechanisms, owing to corporate bankruptcies and associated pressures on banks, had diminished.",
        "However, it was noted that the economic recovery remained uneven across sectors and that an increase in insolvencies might yet come, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and in the services sectors.",
        "It was suggested that uncertainties and risks remained in the final stretch of the recovery, related to the necessary resource reallocation typically associated with very deep recessions.",
        "Overall, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook were seen as broadly balanced.",
        "On the one hand, an even stronger recovery could ensue if global demand picked up faster and household savings were reduced more quickly, once social and travel restrictions were lifted.",
        "On the other hand, the ongoing pandemic, including the spread of virus mutations, and its implications for economic and financial conditions continued to be sources of downside risk.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance was considered to remain crucial, as a premature withdrawal of fiscal support would risk weakening the recovery and amplifying longer-term scarring effects.",
        "National fiscal policies should thus continue to provide critical and timely support to the firms and households most exposed to the ongoing pandemic and the associated containment measures.",
        "At the same time, governments should ensure fiscal measures remained temporary and countercyclical, as well as sufficiently targeted in nature, to address vulnerabilities effectively and to support a swift recovery in the euro area economy.",
        "The key role of the NGEU package was reiterated, with Member States called upon to deploy the funds productively and accompany these by productivity-enhancing structural policies.",
        "This would allow the NGEU programme to contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery and would increase economic resilience as well as the growth potential of Member States’ economies.",
        "Such structural policies were particularly important in improving economic structures and institutions and in accelerating the green and digital transitions.",
        "Members noted that the June staff projections contained substantial further fiscal loosening compared with the March staff projections.",
        "As a result, at present the fiscal stance in 2021 was expected to be similar to that in 2020, and the risk of “cliff-edge effects” was seen to be receding.",
        "While the continued importance of fiscal measures in supporting the economic recovery and tackling economic fragmentation was reiterated, concerns were expressed that fiscal consolidation might come too late rather than too early and that there was a risk of a substantial structural deterioration in fiscal deficits.",
        "Caution needed to be exercised in the interpretation of fiscal balances in the period ahead, as the crisis measures had been statistically recorded as structural spending.",
        "For the time being, it was generally considered that heterogeneity across countries in the timing and speed of economic recovery implied differentiated needs for targeted and temporary fiscal support.",
        "This suggested that calls for fiscal consolidation would need to be country-specific.",
        "Turning to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash release, euro area annual inflation had increased from 1.3% in March to 1.6% in April and 2.0% in May 2021.",
        "Headline inflation was likely to increase further towards the autumn, reflecting mainly the base effects of the reversal of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany.",
        "Inflation was expected to decline again at the start of next year as temporary factors faded out.",
        "Underlying price pressures were expected to increase somewhat this year owing to temporary supply constraints and the recovery in domestic demand.",
        "Nevertheless, price pressures were likely to remain subdued overall.",
        "This in part reflected low wage pressures, in the context of still significant economic slack, and the appreciation of the euro.",
        "Once the impact of the pandemic had begun to fade, the reduction in slack, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, would contribute to a gradual increase in underlying inflation over the medium term.",
        "Members widely agreed on the importance of looking through the temporary increase in inflation in 2021.",
        "It was underlined that the increase in inflation to 2.0% in May had been larger than expected, but also that this had followed a long period of subdued price increases, and that this development had to be assessed from a medium-term perspective.",
        "The question was raised as to the extent to which the recent rise in input costs and the temporary supply constraints, such as for semiconductors, could be expected to feed through to consumer prices over time.",
        "Pipeline pressures emerging at the intermediate goods stage typically showed only a limited and sluggish pass-through to producer prices for final consumer goods and from there to retail prices.",
        "At the same time, it was suggested that the current situation could be different from the past since companies had less scope for absorbing pipeline pressures in their margins, after a long period of subdued profits, while the marked pick-up in demand might offer an opportunity to adjust prices.",
        "A greater than usual pass-through to the final consumer stages might also be possible if households were prepared to pay higher prices in the light of ample savings accumulated involuntarily during the pandemic.",
        "Against this background, it was argued that there could be upside risks not only over the shorter term but also over the medium term.",
        "It was suggested that a perception among the public that prices could rise more persistently could have an impact on the behaviour of households and companies in the period ahead.",
        "It had to be acknowledged that household purchasing power would suffer more than anticipated this year, and it was difficult to say how that would interact with wage negotiations.",
        "If second-round effects from higher oil prices and headline inflation fed into higher wages, it would help convergence with the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "However, it was argued that currently there was little evidence of mounting wage pressures.",
        "There was evidence of a labour scarcity in some sectors and the situation differed from country to country, but there was, overall, still a significant degree of slack in the labour market, and a large number of employees in job retention schemes still needed to be brought back into work.",
        "Moreover, it was recalled that, following labour market reforms, wage indexation had become much less prevalent than some years before.",
        "In their discussion of the June staff projections, members noted that the projection of 1.4% for headline inflation in 2023 implied a medium-term figure that remained well below the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "The same held even for the mild scenario in the staff projections and for forecasts of other institutions.",
        "It was observed that the inflation forecasts of other institutions were broadly similar to those of the June projections, although their forecasts for economic growth were lower.",
        "It was pointed out that the inflation outlook would have been even lower without the substantial fiscal and monetary support in place.",
        "It was also mentioned that, in the June projections, the upward revision of underlying inflation to a rate above its longer-term average had been offset by a lower rate of change in energy prices.",
        "The staff projections, like several other forecasts and projections, were based on the assumption that oil prices would evolve along the path of their futures prices, implying a mechanical downward impact on energy price dynamics over the projection horizon, which in the context of the current projections implied a questionable decline in headline inflation between 2022 and 2023.",
        "It was also argued that, in a situation where governments were striving to meet climate change targets, it was likely that new measures would be required that might bring additional upside risks to price developments over a medium to longer-term horizon.",
        "For these reasons, projected inflation of only 1.4% in 2023 was widely seen as subject to upward risks.",
        "With regard to recent developments in inflation expectations, members noted that survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained at subdued levels, while comparable market-based indicators of inflation compensation had continued to increase and now stood above pre-pandemic levels.",
        "The increase in inflation expectations was seen as a welcome development.",
        "It was argued that inflation expectations on the part of firms and households tended to be closely linked to the latest actual inflation readings, and this was helping boost inflation expectations given that realised inflation was likely to exceed 2% for some months.",
        "However, it was also pointed out that the higher levels of market-based indicators of inflation compensation mainly reflected an increase in risk premia rather than an upward shift in the anticipated path of inflation.",
        "Nonetheless, a reduction in hitherto negative risk premia was a first step towards normalisation, with economic agents starting to hedge against inflation risks rather than deflation risks.",
        "With respect to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The annual rate of growth in broad money (M3) had declined in March and April, partly owing to strong negative base effects and weaker developments in deposits that reflected reduced liquidity needs as the pandemic situation improved.",
        "At the same time, the Eurosystem’s ongoing asset purchases remained the largest source of money creation.",
        "The annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector had fallen in April, with volatility in loans to non-financial corporations reflecting some frontloading in loan creation in March relative to April, and loans to households recording solid monthly flows.",
        "On aggregate, credit conditions were judged to have remained supportive.",
        "The risk of a premature tightening of bank lending conditions was seen as being mitigated by a continued sizeable degree of policy support.",
        "Bank profitability was improving, allowing banks to prepare for credit defaults and to use their balance sheet capacity in terms of capital and liquidity buffers for new lending.",
        "It was noted that some tightening in bank lending rates, as included in the baseline projection, was to be expected when support measures were phased out, and credit risk was likely to increase.",
        "An increase in bankruptcies in the corporate sector could be expected later this year, and cliff-edge effects could not be ruled out, notably for SMEs.",
        "However, it was underlined that an increase in insolvencies would come from artificially subdued levels.",
        "A view was expressed that, overall, risks of financial amplification effects or credit supply constraints affecting firms and banks were diminishing.",
        "At the same time, credit demand could slow as firms and households ran down precautionary liquidity buffers that they had built up during the pandemic, which might moderate a tightening of bank lending rates.",
        "Turning to the assessment of euro area financing and financial conditions, members generally agreed that, despite the increase in nominal risk-free rates, euro area financing conditions had remained accommodative and continued to support the recovery.",
        "The recent rise in nominal yields was seen as having been partly driven by the improving economic outlook, which was accompanied by an increase in inflation compensation, whereas real rates, which were considered to matter most for financing conditions, had fallen to new record lows or remained at very favourable levels.",
        "Downstream indicators of nominal financing conditions were assessed as favourable, too, with bank lending rates still near historical lows despite a recent rebound.",
        "Attention was drawn to the role of global factors in driving yield increases, with yields having stabilised in the United States since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting.",
        "The concern was voiced that a sustained rise in market rates could translate into a tightening of broader financing conditions that were relevant for the wider economy, thereby reinforcing vulnerabilities in the sectors most affected by the crisis.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that stock and residential property prices had become even more buoyant than in December 2020, when the PEPP was last expanded substantially.",
        "It was reiterated that preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period remained essential to reduce uncertainty and bolster confidence, thereby underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability.",
        "Members expressed broad agreement with Mr Lane’s proposal to reconfirm the very accommodative monetary policy stance and to leave the ECB’s monetary policy configuration unchanged, including the proposal to continue net purchases under the PEPP over the next quarter at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year.",
        "Although the medium-term outlook had improved, the June staff projections still saw inflation falling short of the pre-pandemic projected path at the policy-relevant horizon and did not show a robust convergence towards a level below, but close to, 2%.",
        "In this environment, monetary policy had to look through temporary short-term developments in inflation and focus on the medium-term outlook.",
        "While it seemed appropriate that the improved outlook should be reflected in the Governing Council’s policy stance, financing conditions were assessed as too fragile to allow a meaningful reduction in the pace of purchases without risking a disorderly rise in yields.",
        "It was stressed that the recovery was at an early stage and lacked robustness, as it depended heavily on policy support.",
        "Moreover, the projected path for the economy was subject to significant uncertainties and risks.",
        "An undue tightening of financing conditions at the current juncture could jeopardise the ongoing economic recovery and the outlook for inflation.",
        "A noticeable slowing of the pace of purchases for the next quarter was therefore seen as inappropriate at the current juncture.",
        "Concern was expressed that any change in net purchases not based on a clear improvement in the medium-term inflation outlook would lead to an unwarranted tightening of financing and financial conditions and cast doubt on the Governing Council’s resolve to bring inflation back to its aim.",
        "In this context, a remark was made that, in view of the persistent inflation shortfall projected in the June staff projections, even an increase in asset purchases as the main monetary policy instrument could be justified at present.",
        "It had also to be considered that the lower bound on interest rates was still constraining the available monetary policy space, which meant caution was required in relation to a tightening of the policy stance.",
        "A steady course was therefore warranted to maintain the monetary accommodation needed to underpin the economic recovery and to contribute to the sustained convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s aim in the medium term.",
        "In view of the better outlook for growth and inflation and the associated upside risks, it was, however, also argued that, to provide the same degree of accommodation, asset purchases should be scaled back somewhat.",
        "It was stressed that, as a matter of symmetry and consistency in decision-making, the improved outlook should be reflected in the pace of purchases.",
        "Financing conditions in the euro area were seen to be more favourable in June than they had been in March or December, implying an increasing degree of accommodation if the current purchase pace was maintained.",
        "Moreover, the improved outlook would also raise the natural interest rate, thereby effectively providing further accommodation.",
        "Reference was made to the Governing Council’s established communication that, if economic developments were better than expected and favourable financing conditions could be maintained with asset purchase flows that did not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that the PEPP was an emergency programme with a limited time span.",
        "Concerns were also expressed about potential side effects if the highly accommodative monetary policy stance was maintained much longer because it might hinder structural change in the corporate sector and resource reallocation in the labour market.",
        "In addition, property price dynamics were accelerating.",
        "Overall, most members expressed their readiness to join a broad consensus behind the proposal by Mr Lane.",
        "Hence, the Governing Council confirmed that it expected net asset purchases under the PEPP over the next quarter to continue to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year.",
        "The Governing Council’s commitment to preserve favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period and to prevent a tightening that was inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path was reiterated.",
        "Moreover, it was deemed essential that the Governing Council reaffirm its commitment to achieve its stated inflation aim.",
        "It was underlined that the Governing Council’s “reaction function” with respect to purchases under the PEPP would continue to rely on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the outlook for inflation over the medium term.",
        "It was reiterated that flexibility in the conduct of purchases was a cornerstone of the PEPP’s purchase strategy.",
        "The broad parameters for PEPP purchases would continue to be decided by the Governing Council on the basis of a quarterly joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook.",
        "They would then be implemented by the Executive Board in a flexible manner according to market conditions, including seasonality, with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that was inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council decided to confirm its very accommodative monetary policy stance: The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it had seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence had been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.",
        "The Governing Council would continue to conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP with a total envelope of €1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until it judged that the coronavirus crisis phase was over.",
        "Based on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council expected net purchases under the PEPP over the next quarter to continue to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year.",
        "The Governing Council would purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that was inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation.",
        "In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions would continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy.",
        "If favourable financing conditions could be maintained with asset purchase flows that did not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full.",
        "Equally, the envelope could be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.",
        "The Governing Council would continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023.",
        "In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio would be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "Net purchases under the APP would continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion.",
        "The Governing Council continued to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it started raising the key ECB interest rates.",
        "The Governing Council also intended to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Finally, the Governing Council would continue to provide ample liquidity through its refinancing operations.",
        "The funding obtained through the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) played a crucial role in supporting bank lending to firms and households.",
        "The Governing Council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "The President started her introduction by looking back at the strategy review that the Governing Council had been conducting over the previous 18 months, drawing on an immense collective effort by staff at the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs) of the euro area.",
        "While taking the ECB’s primary mandate of price stability as a given, the review had allowed the Governing Council to challenge its thinking, engage with numerous stakeholders, reflect, discuss and reach common ground on how to adapt its strategy.",
        "The new strategy, which would be reflected in the document entitled “The ECB’s monetary policy strategy statement” intended for publication on the ECB’s website, was a strong foundation that would help guide the Governing Council in the conduct of its monetary policy in the years to come.",
        "The President then reviewed the key elements of the new strategy in more detail.",
        "The Governing Council judged that the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) remained the appropriate price measure for assessing the achievement of its price stability objective.",
        "At the same time, European citizens had called for a broader coverage of housing costs in the HICP.",
        "The Governing Council had therefore recommended a roadmap for the inclusion of owner-occupied housing in the HICP, although it recognised that this was a multi-year project to be led by Eurostat.",
        "In the transition period, the main reference index for monetary policy remained the current HICP, but initial estimates of owner-occupied housing costs would play a supplementary role alongside the set of broader inflation measures and would help the Governing Council to assess the contribution of housing costs to inflation.",
        "To improve clarity about the price stability objective, and with the aim of better anchoring inflation expectations, the Governing Council had decided to amend its formulation.",
        "The Governing Council considered that price stability was best maintained by aiming for a two per cent inflation target over the medium term.",
        "A two per cent inflation target was consistent with standard definitions of price stability and provided a safety margin to protect the effectiveness of monetary policy in responding to disinflationary shocks and to guard against the risk of deflation.",
        "The formulation in terms of a specific quantitative target was clear and easy to communicate, and thereby provided a strong anchor for inflation expectations, which was essential for maintaining price stability.",
        "It would replace the double-key formulation, which featured a definition of price stability in terms of a range of positive inflation rates below two per cent and, within that range, an inflation aim of below, but close to, two per cent.",
        "The previous formulation was widely seen as too complicated and occasionally giving rise to misperceptions about the ECB’s aspirations.",
        "The new formulation removed possible ambiguities and resolutely conveyed that two per cent was not a ceiling.",
        "The Governing Council’s commitment to the two per cent target was symmetric.",
        "Symmetry meant that the Governing Council considered negative and positive deviations of inflation from the target to be equally undesirable.",
        "To maintain the symmetry of its inflation target, the Governing Council recognised the importance of taking into account the implications of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates.",
        "In particular, when these rates tended to be low throughout the business cycle, like at present, the economy operated not too far from the lower bound.",
        "Episodes in which the policy rate was constrained at the lower bound were often associated with disinflationary pressure.",
        "Addressing this required especially forceful or persistent monetary policy measures to avoid negative deviations from the inflation target becoming entrenched.",
        "In these conditions, in the face of large adverse shocks, the Governing Council’s policy response would, appropriately grounded in a careful proportionality analysis, include especially forceful monetary policy measures.",
        "In addition, closer to the effective lower bound, it might also call for a more persistent use of the ECB’s monetary policy instruments.",
        "This might also imply a transitory period in which inflation was moderately above target.",
        "The ECB’s new strategy would confirm the medium-term orientation of its monetary policy, which, since the ECB’s inception, had been an important principle of the strategy.",
        "The Governing Council recognised that monetary policy could not and should not attempt to fine-tune short-term developments in inflation.",
        "Monetary policy affected the economy with variable time lags.",
        "The medium-term orientation allowed the Governing Council to be forward-looking and respond flexibly to fluctuations in output and inflation.",
        "Flexibility was important, since the appropriate policy response depended on the circumstances as well as on the source, magnitude and persistence of the shocks affecting the economy.",
        "The medium-term orientation also allowed the Governing Council to cater for other considerations relevant to the pursuit of price stability.",
        "Employment, financial stability risks and climate change were some of the areas that had been assessed in great depth during the strategy review.",
        "The Governing Council had also carefully reviewed the appropriateness of the instruments in its monetary policy toolkit.",
        "It was clear that the key ECB interest rates – the rate on the main refinancing operations, the deposit facility rate and the marginal lending rate – would remain its primary instruments.",
        "But, in a low interest rate environment in which the policy rates were more likely to encounter and remain constrained at the lower bound, the Governing Council would continue to employ other instruments when needed.",
        "Forward guidance, asset purchases and longer-term refinancing operations over the past decade had helped mitigate the limitations generated by the lower bound and would remain an integral part of the Governing Council’s toolkit, to be used as appropriate.",
        "The Governing Council had also reflected on the ECB’s analytical framework and had introduced important changes.",
        "The framework provided the foundation for the Governing Council’s monetary policy decisions, including the regular proportionality assessment of the effectiveness, efficiency and side effects of its measures.",
        "Historically, the ECB had been known for its “two pillars”, which identified risks to price stability from two distinct perspectives: the “economic analysis” and the “monetary analysis”.",
        "These two sources of risks to price stability were cross-checked against each other to form an overall assessment.",
        "The new strategy acknowledged the advantages of having two specialised areas of analyses on the economy, but also recognised the value of integrating the analysis, in a world in which there were multiple feedback channels from the monetary and financial spheres to the broader economy, and vice versa.",
        "The new integrated assessment built on the evolution that the economic and monetary analyses had undergone over time.",
        "The monetary analysis had increasingly focused on assessing the transmission of monetary policy measures, as well as the risks to price stability from financial imbalances.",
        "Meanwhile – owing to a weakening of the link between monetary aggregates and inflation – the original focus of the monetary analysis had become less important.",
        "At the same time, the global financial crisis had brought to the fore the relevance of macro-financial linkages that further emphasised the need for integrated analyses.",
        "Climate change was an existential challenge for the world, and it was of strategic importance for the ECB’s mandate.",
        "The Governing Council would therefore account explicitly for the implications of climate change and the carbon transition in its new strategy.",
        "Moreover, the Governing Council would commit to an ambitious action plan, as outlined in the dedicated press release.",
        "The action plan covered several key areas.",
        "First, the ECB would further expand its analytical capacity in macroeconomic modelling and develop statistical indicators and new tools to assess the implications of climate change for monetary policy transmission and price stability.",
        "Second, it would introduce environmental sustainability disclosure requirements for eligibility for collateral and asset purchases.",
        "Third, it would adapt its risk assessment framework, its corporate sector asset purchases and the collateral framework for climate-related risks.",
        "During its strategy review, the Governing Council had also addressed the communication of the ECB’s monetary policy.",
        "It had heard directly how its policies affected the lives of European citizens and their desire to better understand those policies.",
        "The 2003 review had taken place well before smartphones were around, so there had been a strong case for enhancing the ECB’s communication with the outside world.",
        "Some changes to be adopted in the following weeks would relate to regular communication.",
        "For example, a new, more narrative-based, and more concise monetary policy statement would replace the introductory statement at monetary policy press conferences.",
        "But also, the monetary policy communication geared towards the wider public would be adapted through a more visualised and more accessible approach.",
        "Reflecting the successful experience with the listening events, the Governing Council would continue to interact on a regular basis with the public via Eurosystem outreach events.",
        "The strategy review 2020-21 had taken place 18 years after the previous one.",
        "Looking ahead, the rapidly changing world meant that the Governing Council could not wait for another 18 years before undertaking the next review.",
        "A regular review cycle, with the Governing Council periodically reassessing the appropriateness of its monetary policy strategy, would ensure that the strategy remained fit for purpose.",
        "It would also further enhance the ECB’s transparency and accountability to European citizens.",
        "The next assessment was expected to be carried out in 2025.",
        "In their subsequent discussion, members expressed their appreciation for the excellent preparation as well as the background documentation that staff had prepared.",
        "The underlying well-balanced and comprehensive work provided a sound basis for implementing the agreed outcome.",
        "Gratitude was also expressed to the President for initiating the review and to Mr Lane for guiding and leading the work.",
        "The fruitful collaboration between the ECB and NCBs was highlighted and it was suggested that this could serve as a model for further projects or taskforces.",
        "It was stressed that the revised strategy should be seen as an evolution of the original strategy, which had been in place since 1998 and was clarified in 2003.",
        "The original strategy had served the ECB well but needed updating to account for the profound structural changes that the euro area economy had undergone in the meantime.",
        "It was also to be highlighted that the expansion of the existing strategy had benefited from analysis conducted by ECB and NCB staff that had fed into the strategy review.",
        "At the same time, a wealth of research over the past years had helped to synthesise the experiences under the previous strategy and to mould it into the new one, which from now on would guide the Governing Council’s decisions, ensuring consistency in the conduct of the ECB’s monetary policy.",
        "Members unanimously supported the new formulation of the ECB’s price stability objective.",
        "An inflation target of 2% was judged to be in line with international practice and to provide an appropriate balance between avoiding the welfare cost of inflation and maintaining enough room for manoeuvre for monetary policy in the face of adverse shocks.",
        "The symmetric formulation of the target would confirm and add credibility to the Governing Council’s commitment to symmetry as communicated in its previous monetary policy decisions.",
        "It was also acknowledged that the existence of an effective lower bound on nominal interest rates required an especially forceful or persistent reaction to large adverse shocks, which might also imply that inflation could moderately exceed 2% for a transitory period.",
        "While the set of key ECB interest rates remained the Governing Council’s primary instrument, forward guidance, asset purchases and longer-term refinancing operations would remain an integral part of the ECB’s toolkit, to be used as appropriate and grounded in careful proportionality assessments, including analysis of the benefits and possible side effects of monetary policy measures.",
        "Such proportionality assessments also took into account the uncertainty about the effectiveness and side effects of policy instruments, as well as the risks of the unanchoring of longer-term inflation expectations from the two per cent target.",
        "Regarding the measurement of inflation, the HICP was considered the best available price measure due to its quality and timeliness.",
        "However, taking into account the feedback from the Eurosystem’s outreach activities, it was felt that further efforts should be made to incorporate the cost of owner-occupied housing into the HICP.",
        "The net acquisition approach was seen as the preferred method to do so.",
        "Members very much welcomed the European Statistical System’s related work and recommended a four-stage roadmap towards full inclusion in the HICP.",
        "It was stressed that, during the transition period, the main reference index for monetary policy would remain the current HICP.",
        "It was also noted that the consumption component – not the investment component – of owner-occupied housing was key, as the Governing Council was not intending to target asset prices.",
        "Regarding the climate-related action plan, it was highlighted that climate change was impacting the ECB’s primary mandate through various channels.",
        "Although the main responsibility to address climate change lay with governments, the ECB was obliged to contribute in this domain within its mandate.",
        "Members agreed with the proposed action plan and committed to further incorporating climate change considerations into the ECB’s monetary policy framework; to expanding its analytical capacity in macroeconomic modelling, statistics and monetary policy with regard to climate change; to including climate change considerations in monetary policy operations in the areas of disclosure, risk assessment, collateral framework and corporate sector asset purchases; and to implementing the action plan in line with progress on the EU policies and initiatives in the field of environmental sustainability disclosure and reporting.",
        "As regards communication, the engagement with the public and the public’s interest in the ECB’s policy were considered a great asset.",
        "The interest citizens expressed in monetary policy was seen as encouraging the Governing Council to continue its efforts to explain its monetary policy decisions in an accessible way to the wider public.",
        "While the 8 July press conference would announce the outcome of the review, the implementation of the changes planned would become visible in the communication following the Governing Council’s 21-22 July monetary policy meeting.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council unanimously approved the ECB’s monetary policy strategy statement, the longer explanatory note entitled “Overview of the monetary policy strategy” and the press release entitled “ECB presents action plan to include climate change considerations in its monetary policy strategy”.",
        "These would be published on the ECB’s website ahead of the press conference to be given by the President and Vice-President on the following day.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 10-11 March 2021.",
        "Euro area government bond yields had decoupled from US Treasury yields – which had continued to increase in the course of March 2021 before retreating somewhat in April – and had remained broadly unchanged since late February 2021.",
        "In part, this reflected the renewed rise in coronavirus (COVID-19) infections and the tightening of lockdowns in the euro area, which had affected near-term growth expectations.",
        "However, it also reflected the impact of the Governing Council’s monetary policy decisions in March and the preceding communication, convincing markets of the ECB’s determination to maintain favourable financing conditions.",
        "The ECB’s recent measures had been effective in shielding euro area long-term rates from spillovers, with regard to both the risk-free yield curve and sovereign spreads.",
        "A decomposition of the euro area ten-year overnight index swap rate into inflation and real components showed that nominal rates and their underlying components had remained broadly unchanged since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "Since the start of 2021, the observed synchronised pick-up in market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation across advanced economies likely reflected optimism regarding global growth.",
        "Model estimates suggested that the bulk of the increase in the inflation component was driven by inflation risk premia, and hence did not yet reflect a significant increase in investors’ genuine inflation expectations.",
        "In contrast to the inflation component, long-term real rates in the euro area had remained broadly unchanged since the start of 2021.",
        "This was also the case for medium-term real rates, which were particularly relevant for borrowing conditions for firms and which had remained at or close to historical lows throughout the recent global bond market sell-off.",
        "This suggested that the ECB’s measures had been effective in insulating not only longer-term sovereign bond yields but equally – or even more so – the short to medium end of the yield curve.",
        "In a similar vein, interest rate expectations over the next two years had remained unchanged since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting in January 2021.",
        "Markets were not pricing in any changes in the deposit facility rate until the first quarter of 2024.",
        "Rate expectations remained well anchored by the ECB’s forward guidance.",
        "Other asset prices served as a cross-check of the recent drivers of financing and financial conditions.",
        "Credit spreads across rating classes had remained stable, and had even decreased for high-yield bonds.",
        "The growth-driven nature of the bond market sell-off and the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy had thus kept a lid on corporate spreads.",
        "The optimism regarding global growth had also been the key driver of stock markets.",
        "Supported by the accelerating roll-out of vaccines, strong global economic data and the further improvement in longer-term earnings growth expectations, stock prices had rallied beyond pre-pandemic levels in the euro area.",
        "However, this development masked significant cross-country heterogeneity.",
        "An important driver of this was the sectoral composition of countries’ stock markets.",
        "Those with a large share of sectors that had benefited from the crisis had tended to outperform their peers during most of 2020, a trend that had reversed after the positive news on vaccines in November 2020.",
        "However, the surge in the prices of risky assets also created risks, with high equity price valuations being seen as dependent on continuing highly accommodative interest rates.",
        "One indicator was the equity duration, the inverse of the dividend yield, which stood at the highest level since the dot-com bubble in both the United States and the euro area.",
        "Overall, recent financial market developments had had a positive effect on financing and financial conditions in the euro area.",
        "Sovereign yields and spreads had remained compressed and stock prices had risen, while the euro exchange rate had appreciated only slightly.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and the recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "A new wave of infections had hit economies around the globe.",
        "At the same time, the world had been learning to live with the pandemic, so the impact on output was more limited than in the first wave in spring last year.",
        "Overall, there were positive signals for the global recovery, which remained investment-led, while consumption was lagging.",
        "The incoming data also pointed to a continued recovery in global trade, with goods trade surprising on the upside in January.",
        "Oil prices had remained essentially flat since the March monetary policy meeting.",
        "At the same time, the euro exchange rate, too, was basically flat, with the euro appreciating slightly both against the US dollar (1.2%) and in nominal effective terms (0.6%).",
        "In the euro area economy, headwinds resulted from lockdowns, especially for services, while investment dynamics were supportive.",
        "Short-term indicators pointed to a recovery starting in the second quarter of 2021.",
        "Focusing on the latest developments, large asymmetries between industry and services prevailed.",
        "Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) had been increasing for some time and showed very strong readings.",
        "There was also a strong recovery in services PMIs even though not quite into expansionary territory yet.",
        "Retail sales remained weak owing to new restrictions introduced to limit the spread of COVID-19.",
        "The high level of containment measures had continued to delay the recovery in consumption, as consumers, surveyed for example by the European Commission, remained cautious.",
        "Indicators for major purchases expected in the coming 12 months, business retail sales expectations and orders for consumer goods had all improved but remained below pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Meanwhile, private investment continued to recover.",
        "While growth in construction investment had remained muted in the final quarter of 2020, the forward-looking indicators were positive, with business expectations and construction confidence all ticking upwards.",
        "Growth in both extra- and intra-euro area goods exports had steadily recovered from the lows recorded in the second quarter of 2020.",
        "Tourism, which owing to the pandemic was the sector most affected in services trade, showed early signs of picking up.",
        "Labour market indicators continued to be heavily affected by government support programmes, which complicated the assessment of underlying developments.",
        "Unlike previous crises, the pandemic had disproportionately affected employment and average hours worked in “high-contact” market services sectors.",
        "Overall, the main labour market indicators were relatively stable, with the unemployment rate standing at 8.3% in February – broadly unchanged since November – despite the new wave of the pandemic and the associated lockdowns.",
        "However, high numbers of discouraged workers and people in job retention schemes pointed to continued vulnerabilities.",
        "Turning to nominal developments, headline inflation had increased to 1.3% in March, driven primarily by a strong further increase in energy price inflation, reflecting predominantly base effects but also recent oil price dynamics.",
        "Temporary and technical factors had continued to play an important role for inflation, although the impact from changes in expenditure weights had diminished.",
        "Focusing on the more persistent components of inflation, measures of underlying inflation continued to hover around levels seen in spring 2020 and did not provide a broad-based signal of a sustained pick-up.",
        "Furthermore, statistical issues linked to the effects of weights, tax changes and imputations continued to imply some uncertainty about the direction of underlying inflation.",
        "According to the latest ECB Survey of Professsional Forecasters for the second quarter of 2021, headline inflation expectations had been revised up for 2021, while medium and longer-term expectations were by and large stable.",
        "Meanwhile, market-based measures of long-term inflation expectations continued to increase, with the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead standing at 1.53% on 19 April 2021, which was 8 basis points higher than at the time of the March monetary policy meeting.",
        "Turning to financial conditions, long-term risk-free rates were broadly unchanged from the level prevailing at the time of the March meeting.",
        "Yield increases observed since the end of 2020 had been driven mainly by term premia and not by the expectations component.",
        "Equity and corporate bond markets were driven by expectations of an improving growth outlook.",
        "Overall, financial conditions remained broadly unchanged.",
        "Looking at policy rate expectations, the EONIA forward curve remained stable at the short end.",
        "With respect to monetary developments, annual M3 growth had declined marginally in February but remained at a high level (12.3%).",
        "Firms and households had continued to accumulate deposits at a pace similar to previous quarters.",
        "Looking at the sources of money creation, Eurosystem asset purchases and bank loans to the non-financial private sector in February had remained at levels comparable to those seen in the second half of 2020.",
        "While volumes of lending to firms had increased marginally in February, the annual growth rate of bank loans to firms remained high (at 7.1% in February) only because it was still affected by the very large flows observed between March and May 2020.",
        "Bank lending rates for firms remained close to their historical lows..",
        "According to the latest euro area bank lending survey, banks saw a further decline in demand for loans to firms, which was mainly explained by weakness in demand for the financing of investment and the fading of financing needs for working capital, reflecting the availability of liquidity buffers and direct government support.",
        "A moderate net percentage of banks had indicated a further tightening of credit standards in the first quarter of 2021, following two quarters of significantly more pronounced tightening.",
        "However, the tightening by banks was less than had been expected in the previous quarter.",
        "Credit standards for loans to households for house purchase had eased slightly in the first quarter of 2021 after four quarters of continued tightening, supported by competition among lenders.",
        "With respect to fiscal policy, some countries had recently scaled up fiscal support in response to lockdown extensions.",
        "Across euro area countries, fiscal support was, on average, stronger in the more severely hit countries but with quite some heterogeneity across countries.",
        "Following a strong fiscal impulse in 2020, fiscal support was expected to remain sizeable in the euro area in 2021.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane remarked that the recovery in global demand and additional fiscal measures were supporting global and euro area activity.",
        "At the same time, setbacks in vaccination campaigns, together with persistently high rates of new coronavirus infections in several countries and the associated tightening of containment measures, were restricting economic activity in the short term.",
        "Overall, incoming information, including high-frequency indicators, indicated that economic activity was likely to have contracted again in the first quarter, but pointed to a resumption of growth in the second quarter.",
        "Progress with vaccination campaigns and the envisaged gradual relaxation of containment measures underpinned the expectation of a firm rebound in economic activity, especially in the second half of 2021.",
        "Risks to the euro area growth outlook continued to be on the downside in the near term, but remained more balanced over the medium term.",
        "Upside risks stemmed from: better prospects for global demand, supported by sizeable fiscal stimulus; more rapid progress in vaccination campaigns; and a faster than expected reduction in household savings once social and travel restrictions were lifted.",
        "However, the new wave of the pandemic, including the spread of virus mutations, and a slower vaccine roll-out represented downside risks for the growth outlook over the coming quarters.",
        "Headline inflation had risen to 1.3% in March from the 0.9% recorded in January and February, owing mainly to strong increases in energy price inflation.",
        "At the same time, underlying price pressures were subdued in the context of weak demand and significant slack in labour and product markets, but were expected to increase somewhat in 2021 owing to short-term supply constraints and the recovery in domestic demand.",
        "Inflation would exhibit some volatility for the remainder of the year.",
        "Survey-based measures and market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remained at low levels compared with the ECB’s inflation aim, although market-based indicators had continued to increase, mainly driven by higher inflation risk premia.",
        "Amid continued robust risk sentiment in global financial markets, euro area financing conditions had remained broadly stable of late.",
        "In particular, risk-free rates and sovereign bond yields had moved sideways and appeared to have decoupled from the repricing in US interest rates.",
        "At the same time, the rise recorded earlier in the year in these key indicators in the upstream segment of the transmission chain still posed a risk to the wider set of financing conditions, which in turn warranted close monitoring.",
        "Against this background, Mr Lane proposed that the Governing Council leave its prevailing monetary policy configuration unchanged and confirm its very accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "Since the incoming information confirmed the joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook carried out at the March monetary policy meeting, the Governing Council should continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in the current quarter at a significantly higher pace than during the first few months of the year.",
        "As regards external communication, two aspects were important.",
        "First, the Governing Council needed to reaffirm its current practice of conducting a comprehensive joint evaluation of the prevailing state of financing conditions against the inflation outlook at monetary policy meetings in which policy deliberations were informed by a new round of staff projections.",
        "In line with this practice, a new comprehensive joint assessment should be conducted at the next monetary policy meeting in June.",
        "Second, it was important to highlight that calibrating purchases under the PEPP so as to counter the adverse effects of the pandemic on the medium-term inflation outlook was only one element in achieving the aim of stabilising medium-term inflation around levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "Ample monetary policy support remained crucial beyond the pandemic period in order to support inflation and return it to the inflation aim.",
        "The Governing Council therefore needed to continue to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as necessary, to fulfil its mandate.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks for activity provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "While the recovery in global demand and the sizeable fiscal stimulus were supporting global and euro area activity, the near-term economic outlook remained clouded by uncertainty about the resurgence of the pandemic and the roll-out of vaccination campaigns.",
        "Looking ahead, progress with vaccination campaigns and the envisaged gradual relaxation of containment measures underpinned the expectation of a firm rebound in economic activity in the course of 2021.",
        "Inflation had picked up over recent months on account of some idiosyncratic and temporary factors and an increase in energy price inflation.",
        "At the same time, underlying price pressures remained subdued in the context of significant economic slack and still weak demand.",
        "As regards the external environment, members broadly shared the assessment by Mr Lane that the global economic outlook continued to improve despite the new wave of infections occurring worldwide.",
        "Reference was made to recent forecasts from international institutions.",
        "Notably, in its April 2021 World Economic Outlook, for 2021 the IMF had revised its expectations for global growth up to 6% and had projected world trade to rise by over 8%.",
        "Attention was drawn, in particular, to positive news regarding economic developments in the United States and to the further growth recorded in China at the beginning of the year, reflecting an exceptional recovery since the start of the pandemic a year earlier.",
        "With respect to the latest exchange rate developments, it was noted that the euro had appreciated slightly since the Governing Council’s last monetary policy meeting.",
        "It was underlined that a further appreciation of the exchange rate could have adverse implications for the inflation outlook.",
        "Turning to euro area developments, real GDP had declined by 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020, remaining well below its pre-pandemic level.",
        "Incoming economic data, surveys and high-frequency indicators suggested that the resurgence of the pandemic and the associated intensification of containment measures might have led to a decline in activity in the first quarter of 2021, but they also pointed to a resumption of growth in the second quarter.",
        "In discussing the economic outlook for the euro area, members judged that, although the current situation remained fragile and subject to a high degree of uncertainty, recent data could overall be seen as confirming that GDP growth was broadly in line with the March 2021 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area.",
        "This assessment was also supported by the latest IMF and OECD forecasts.",
        "There had been a rise in infection rates, particularly among young people, a delay in the roll-out of vaccination campaigns and some concerns about the safety of vaccines.",
        "A prolongation of containment measures had acted as a drag on growth in the first quarter of the year, but there was also good news in that vaccination campaigns were now gaining momentum in the euro area, which could be expected to lead to a gradual easing of lockdown measures.",
        "This would, in particular, support the recovery in the services sector, which had been the sector most affected by the crisis.",
        "It was also encouraging that evidence of the efficiency of the vaccination campaigns was becoming stronger and that the share of the population that had received a first or even second dose was increasing more rapidly.",
        "The learning behaviour of households and firms in response to restrictions during the pandemic was considered to be another positive factor supporting growth.",
        "However, it was also underlined that the outlook continued to depend on how quickly the vaccination campaigns proceeded, as well as on the spread and transmission of different variants of the COVID-19 virus.",
        "Uncertainty about both the timing and the strength of the recovery in the euro area remained, with some grounds for caution as evidenced by the sequence of downward revisions to the growth rate expected for the first quarter of the year.",
        "It was also stressed that the outlook for both growth and inflation remained dependent on the support of fiscal policy measures and the very accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that the impact of the pandemic differed across countries in the euro area.",
        "While in some countries activity was expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021, in others – especially those in which the services sector had been most affected – it was expected still to be below the pre-pandemic level at the end of 2022.",
        "Members generally expected a stronger recovery to take place in the second half of 2021 but emphasised that uncertainty surrounding the near-term growth outlook remained high.",
        "A key question was how consumers would respond to an easing of lockdown measures.",
        "It was recalled that the March 2021 ECB staff projections exercise had been based on the assumption that the household saving ratio would gradually return to its pre-crisis level and that there would not be any substantial unwinding of the excess savings that had been accumulated during the pandemic.",
        "In assessing the risks to growth, a range of views was advanced concerning the likely behaviour of consumers.",
        "It was suggested that forced savings might unwind more dynamically than expected.",
        "A one-off boost to consumption later in the year was considered a possibility, based on previous observations, when higher consumption had followed lower infection rates and an easing of restrictions last summer.",
        "Still, it was also possible that the boost to consumption from pent-up demand might unfold more gradually.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that consumers might prove to be more cautious in their spending this year.",
        "Against this background, it was generally felt that risks to activity had become more balanced over the medium-term horizon, with a view also being expressed that they were now marginally tilted to the upside.",
        "However, there was broad agreement to retain the risk assessment as expressed at the March monetary policy meeting, which could be revisited more fully in the context of the June staff macroeconomic projection exercise.",
        "Accordingly, members considered that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook over the near term continued to be on the downside, while medium-term risks remained more balanced.",
        "On the one hand, better prospects for global demand – bolstered by the sizeable fiscal stimulus – and the progress with vaccination campaigns were encouraging.",
        "On the other hand, the ongoing pandemic – including the spread of virus mutations – and its implications for economic and financial conditions continued to be sources of downside risk.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance was still seen as crucial, since a premature withdrawal of fiscal support would risk delaying the recovery and amplifying longer-term scarring effects.",
        "National fiscal policies should thus continue to provide critical and timely support to the firms and households most exposed to the ongoing pandemic and the associated containment measures.",
        "At the same time, fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should, as much as possible, remain temporary and targeted in nature to address vulnerabilities effectively and to support a swift recovery of the euro area economy.",
        "Members expected that fiscal support would likely be increased in most European countries this year and the risk of “cliff-edge effects” was seen to be receding.",
        "Members also reiterated the key role of the Next Generation EU package and the urgency of it becoming operational without delay, calling on EU Member States to ensure a timely ratification of the Own Resources Decision, to finalise their recovery and resilience plans promptly and to deploy the funds for productive public spending, accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural policies.",
        "Governments should be encouraged to accelerate the pace of implementation, which was considered to be more important than the size of the fiscal support.",
        "This would allow the Next Generation EU programme to contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery and would increase economic resilience and the growth potential of Member States’ economies, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area.",
        "The link with reforms, to ensure sustainable growth, was also highlighted, as was the importance of fiscal measures in tackling economic fragmentation.",
        "Turning to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Euro area annual inflation had increased to 1.3% in March 2021, from 0.9% in February.",
        "Members generally agreed on the importance of looking through the increase in inflation in the short term – which was expected to be temporary – as well as the heightened volatility expected over the coming 12 months.",
        "At the same time it was noted that, since the cut-off date for the March 2021 ECB staff projections, there had been a further upward revision to the inflation outlook for 2021 and 2022.",
        "In addition to the impact of energy price developments, it was argued that there could also be some upward pressures on inflation in the short run resulting from supply chain disruptions, coinciding with a recovery in demand.",
        "However, it was also underlined that underlying inflation and price pressures generally remained subdued.",
        "There was still a significant degree of slack in the labour market and no evidence that wage-setting was picking up significantly.",
        "It was recalled that, according to the March 2021 ECB staff projections, inflation was projected to be only 1.4% in 2023.",
        "Against this background, a view was expressed that while the policy-relevant medium-term inflation outlook was broadly unchanged from the March meeting, risks to this outlook could be assessed as tilted to the upside.",
        "With regard to recent developments in inflation expectations, members noted that longer-term inflation expectations reported in the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters were unchanged, at 1.7%, while market-based indicators of inflation expectations had increased.",
        "Although this increase mainly reflected an increase in risk premia, there was also a genuine, albeit small, increase in inflation expectations.",
        "It was underlined that households’ inflation expectations differed from those of financial market participants and professional forecasters, but it would be welcome if this translated into higher inflation expectations more broadly.",
        "There was no risk seen, at present, that inflation expectations would become unanchored to the upside.",
        "However, the implications of higher headline inflation during 2021 for inflation expectations and possible second-round effects would need to be monitored.",
        "Turning to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Strong money growth had continued to be driven by the ongoing asset purchases of the Eurosystem, which remained the largest source of money creation.",
        "Lending to the private sector had remained broadly unchanged.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that loan rejection rates for firms had increased and that credit standards for loans to firms had tightened for the third consecutive quarter, which might hamper the transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy measures to the real economy.",
        "However, it was also underlined that the latest bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2021 showed a more moderate tightening than had previously been expected.",
        "In this context, it was highlighted that the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) continued to play a crucial role in supporting bank lending to firms and households, alleviating “cliff effects”, with the most recent operation registering a significant take-up of funds.",
        "Moreover, it appeared that the increase in market interest rates observed earlier in the year had not been passed through to loan supply and bank lending rates in the first quarter of the year.",
        "With respect to the assessment of financial and financing conditions, there was broad agreement among members that euro area financing conditions had remained broadly stable since the last monetary policy meeting in March.",
        "This was visible across the whole monetary transmission chain ranging from upstream indicators, such as market interest rates, to downstream indicators, such as bank lending conditions.",
        "Risk-free interest rates and sovereign bond yields, which had increased earlier in the year, had largely moved sideways since the March meeting and had decoupled from developments in US markets since late February, as reported by Ms Schnabel in her introduction.",
        "In addition, broader lending conditions were seen to have remained favourable, although bank credit standards for loans to firms had tightened somewhat further according to the latest bank lending survey, as presented by Mr Lane.",
        "This was widely seen as validating the Governing Council’s March decision to significantly increase the pace of net asset purchases under the PEPP, effectively insulating euro area financing conditions from global spillovers and preventing a premature tightening.",
        "However, some caution was voiced, given that risks to wider financing conditions remained.",
        "Market interest rates still stood at higher levels than those prevailing in December and had increased again slightly in the most recent period, which could in part be attributed to market perceptions about the future course of monetary policy in the United States and to more encouraging news on the vaccination campaigns in the euro area.",
        "At the same time, financial conditions across a broader range of markets had eased further based on most indicators, even though the euro exchange rate had appreciated slightly, to stand 0.5% above the level prevailing at the data cut-off point for the March staff projections.",
        "It was reiterated that developments in the exchange rate had to be monitored closely with regard to their possible implications for the inflation outlook.",
        "Members expressed broad agreement with the proposal made by Mr Lane to leave the ECB’s monetary policy configuration unchanged and to reconfirm the very accommodative stance.",
        "The monetary policy decisions taken in December and March were seen as effective and adequate to preserve favourable financing conditions and to provide the necessary support for the euro area economy.",
        "While the incoming information had largely confirmed the assessment made at the March monetary policy meeting, uncertainty remained high and the outlook for the economy and for inflation continued to be dependent on the very accommodative monetary policy stance and the fiscal policy stimulus.",
        "In this environment, monetary policy had to remain on a steady course, helping to reduce uncertainty and bolster confidence, thereby underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability.",
        "Based on the evidence that the incoming data and market developments had largely confirmed the joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook carried out at the March monetary policy meeting, the Governing Council’s decision in March to undertake significantly higher PEPP purchases than during the first few months of the year remained appropriate.",
        "Looking ahead, it was underlined that the Governing Council’s “reaction function” with respect to purchases under the PEPP would continue to be driven by the Governing Council’s determination to preserve favourable financing conditions on the basis of a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook and taking into account a holistic and multifaceted set of indicators.",
        "In this context, it was also reiterated that flexibility in the conduct of purchases was a cornerstone of the PEPP’s purchase strategy.",
        "PEPP purchases would continue to be conducted in a flexible manner according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that was inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation.",
        "This implied that if favourable financing conditions could be maintained with asset purchase flows that did not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full.",
        "Equally, the envelope could be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.",
        "With respect to recent developments, it was stressed that net purchases in March had increased to the highest monthly purchase volume since July 2020, representing a significant increase compared with average purchases during the first two months of this year, even though the decision to increase the pace of purchases was only taken in mid-March.",
        "Members recalled that the monetary policy meeting in June would provide the next opportunity to conduct a thorough assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, at which time the assessment would be informed by the new Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "While such a comprehensive assessment, based inter alia on the staff projections, would normally be undertaken on a quarterly basis, it was underlined that the PEPP continued to operate in a flexible manner, allowing the pace of purchases to be adapted according to market conditions and supporting the smooth transmission of monetary policy in a timely manner.",
        "Regarding communication, members broadly concurred with the communication outlined by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "It needed to be stressed that the March monetary policy decisions had been timely and adequate, having successfully contributed to stabilising financing conditions after the increase in market interest rates earlier in the year, although risks to wider financing conditions remained.",
        "The Governing Council’s commitment to preserving favourable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy over the pandemic period remained essential to reduce uncertainty and bolster confidence.",
        "It was also widely agreed that it should be highlighted that the future pace of purchases under the PEPP was data-dependent and would continue to be based on the joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council decided to reconfirm its very accommodative monetary policy stance: The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it had seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence had been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.",
        "The Governing Council would continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of €1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until it judged that the coronavirus crisis phase was over.",
        "Since the incoming information confirmed the joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook carried out at the March monetary policy meeting, the Governing Council expected purchases under the PEPP over the current quarter to continue to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first few months of the year.",
        "The Governing Council would purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that was inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation.",
        "In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions would continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy.",
        "If favourable financing conditions could be maintained with asset purchase flows that did not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full.",
        "Equally, the envelope could be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.",
        "The Governing Council would continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023.",
        "In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio would be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "Net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) would continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion.",
        "The Governing Council continued to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it started raising the key ECB interest rates.",
        "The Governing Council also intended to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Finally, the Governing Council would continue to provide ample liquidity through its refinancing operations.",
        "In particular, the latest operation in the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) had registered a high take-up of funds.",
        "The funding obtained through TLTRO III played a crucial role in supporting bank lending to firms and households.",
        "The Governing Council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 20-21 January 2021.",
        "Sovereign yield curves across advanced economies had steepened, while new coronavirus (COVID-19) cases had fallen, the pace of vaccination had accelerated and a large fiscal stimulus programme in the United States was expected to be soon put into law.",
        "The measurable rise in commodity prices had added to upward pressure on long-term nominal bond yields.",
        "The increase in long-term bond yields had been more muted in the euro area than in other advanced economies.",
        "The euro area GDP-weighted yield curve remained considerably flatter than throughout most of the years preceding the COVID-19 pandemic and it had largely the same shape and location as observed just before the outbreak of the pandemic.",
        "Moreover, sovereign spreads had remained resilient, even narrowing in some jurisdictions.",
        "Accordingly, the increase in yields reflected primarily a rise in the euro area risk-free rate.",
        "A decomposition of the ten-year overnight index swap rate indicated that investors had hardly changed their views on the expected future path of short-term rates.",
        "Recent yield increases had instead reflected, by and large, rising term premia.",
        "As the increase in term premia coincided with a notable rise in inflation swap rates, it was likely that the inflation risk premium had become larger as investors had started reappraising the balance of risk around the inflation outlook.",
        "An increase in the inflation risk premium at the current juncture suggested that investors no longer only saw downside risks around the future inflation outlook as they had done for most of 2020.",
        "Real ten-year risk-free interest rates had fluctuated over time but had fallen back close to the levels prevailing around the 9-10 December 2020 Governing Council meeting.",
        "They were currently some 120 basis points below their average since 2008.",
        "Real short and medium-term rates had been insulated from the recent bond market sell-off and had continued to hit new historical lows in recent weeks.",
        "Credit markets had remained resilient to the increase in bond market volatility and in risk-free rates, which suggested that investors remained fundamentally positioned for higher growth.",
        "Credit spreads across all rating classes, and in particular for high-yield bonds, had continued to narrow over the past few weeks supported by a visible recovery in realised earnings.",
        "Changes in the corporate default outlook mirrored expectations of a significantly improved growth outlook, contributing to favourable valuations in credit markets.",
        "In stock markets, the EURO STOXX 50 index had further extended its gains, gradually approaching pre-pandemic levels.",
        "ECB staff analysis suggested that the rise in risk-free rates and the deterioration in the short-term earnings outlook due to the prolongation of containment measures had pulled stock prices lower in recent weeks.",
        "However, the combination of better long-term earnings expectations on the back of vaccination roll-outs and the associated improvement in risk sentiment had more than offset this drag on stock prices.",
        "Yet, in some economies, the rise in risk-free rates had increased risks to asset valuations, which remained predicated on expectations of an extended period of low interest rates.",
        "Developments in emerging markets provided further evidence of investors so far having been able and willing to absorb the rise in risk-free rates.",
        "In February, portfolio inflows into emerging markets had continued at a robust pace, although they had started to reverse during the week ahead of the current meeting.",
        "Finally, in foreign exchange markets, expectations of higher US growth and a less accommodative US monetary policy had put upward pressure on the nominal effective exchange rate of the US dollar and also on the US dollar exchange rate against the euro.",
        "At the same time, risk sentiment continued to put some downward pressure on the US dollar on the back of hopes that a resolution of the pandemic and spillover effects from US fiscal policy would kick start and nurture a strong global cyclical upswing.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and the recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "As regards the external environment, there was an upgrade of the outlook as a result of a combination of ongoing vaccinations, learning effects on how to live with the pandemic and the additional fiscal stimulus in the United States.",
        "In the March 2021 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, global activity and trade had been revised up over the projection horizon after the global economy bounced back during the second half of 2020 at a faster pace than envisaged.",
        "Based on the latest Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), output in services had particularly improved of late.",
        "Global trade was not yet back to pre-crisis levels and the pace of trade expansion had stalled at the turn of the year, with trade in services continuing to be a drag on overall trade owing to limitations on travel and tourism.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s January monetary policy meeting, oil prices had risen by 23% and had climbed to USD 67.8 per barrel, close to pre-pandemic levels.",
        "In terms of the exchange rate, the euro had depreciated against the US dollar (-2.0%) but remained broadly stable in nominal effective terms (-0.3%).",
        "Turning to the euro area economy, growth in the last quarter of 2020 had been stronger than expected, but the ongoing restrictions would have a negative impact on growth in the first quarter – and perhaps also the second quarter – of 2021.",
        "Based on the March 2021 staff projections, real GDP would recover to exceed its pre-crisis level (of the fourth quarter of 2019) in the second quarter of 2022 and continue to increase at a robust rate thereafter.",
        "However, the recovery was expected to vary across the different GDP components and to rely quite heavily on fiscal support over the next two years.",
        "Zooming in on the latest economic developments, containment measures had had to remain stricter in the first quarter of 2021 than previously expected, holding back the near-term recovery but not really changing the overall path.",
        "Based on the latest PMIs for February, the divergence in manufacturing and services growth dynamics was expected to continue.",
        "Household savings continued to mirror pandemic-driven consumption dynamics.",
        "Savings seemed to have been accumulated mostly by older households, who typically had a lower propensity to consume out of income and wealth.",
        "They were therefore less likely to spend their savings as soon as lockdown measures were relaxed.",
        "By contrast, the younger population had seen a bigger deterioration in their financial situation, with low-skilled services and jobs particularly hit by the pandemic.",
        "Linked to recent delays in vaccination campaigns, households expected normal activities to resume with some delay.",
        "Investment remained quite resilient overall.",
        "Data for the production of capital goods gave encouraging signals about ongoing business investment.",
        "The resilience in capital goods production was also supported by foreign demand.",
        "Housing investment was expected to remain subdued in the near term.",
        "Trade had weakened at the turn of the year, driven mainly by weak intra-euro area exports, notwithstanding continued growth in extra-euro area exports.",
        "Leading indicators for manufacturing exports had continued to rise based on improvements in both shipping and survey indicators available for February.",
        "Labour markets remained resilient on the back of strong fiscal support but some indicators pointed to vulnerabilities further ahead.",
        "Overall, survey indicators of employment perceptions had risen somewhat, indicating an expansion for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, but developments remained uneven across countries and sectors.",
        "The low-tech services sectors were those most adversely affected by the second and third waves of the pandemic.",
        "With the tightened restrictions, the importance of job retention schemes had increased again in recent months.",
        "Turning to nominal developments, the short-term inflation outlook for 2021 had been revised up in the March 2021 ECB staff projections, while the inflation path embedded in the December 2020 Eurosystem staff projections was broadly confirmed for the outer years of the projection horizon.",
        "The projected profile of inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) was quite volatile, mainly as a result of energy prices.",
        "HICP inflation was expected to jump from 0.3% in 2020 to 1.5% in 2021, before falling back to 1.2% in 2022, and to increase again to 1.4% in 2023.",
        "The profile for HICP inflation excluding energy and food (HICPX) had shifted up somewhat, showing a gradual increase from 0.7% in 2020 to 1.3% in 2023.",
        "Zooming in on recent developments, headline inflation had increased sharply to stand at 0.9% in January and February, after four consecutive months at -0.3%.",
        "The unchanged rate in February 2021 was the result of less negative energy inflation being offset by a decline in HICPX inflation to 1.1% in February (from 1.4% in January), which was substantially higher than the 0.2% recorded in the last four months of 2020.",
        "The recent upswing in headline inflation reflected a number of factors, including less negative energy inflation, the end of the temporary VAT rate reduction in Germany, changes in sales patterns (timing and volumes) in some countries and the stronger than usual changes in HICP weights for 2021.",
        "Linked to the tightening of containment measures, the share of price imputations in the HICP increased further in January.",
        "The overall impact of price imputations on the change in HICP inflation remained unclear, adding to the high uncertainty as to whether the recent pick-up in inflation signalled genuinely increasing price pressures.",
        "Key wage measures, based on national accounts data such as compensation per employee or compensation per hour, continued to be strongly affected by the effects of job retention schemes.",
        "Relatively strong growth in unit labour costs had continued to contribute positively to developments in the GDP deflator, counterbalancing the effects of lower contributions from profit margins.",
        "As a result, the GDP deflator had risen slightly from 1.0% in the third quarter to 1.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020.",
        "As regards inflation expectations, the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the first quarter of 2021 had recorded an upward revision of short and medium-term inflation expectations, while longer-term inflation expectations had increased only very slightly.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation expectations stood somewhat above the levels observed around the Governing Council’s January monetary policy meeting, with the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead standing at 1.42% on 8 March 2021, compared with 1.32% on 19 January.",
        "Turning to financial conditions in the euro area, there had been an increase in nominal government bond yields at the long end of the curve, an improvement in risk attitude, an increase in inflation-linked swap rates, a decline in sovereign bond risk premia and a slight depreciation of the euro.",
        "The sell-off in bond markets had been synchronised and broad-based across major advanced economies, pointing to an important global factor.",
        "Looking at corporate bond markets, default rates of high-yield issuers remained much lower than in past crisis episodes.",
        "Short-term earnings expectations had deteriorated across almost all sectors since the January monetary policy meeting.",
        "Indices of financial conditions assign different weights to developments in financial markets and their respective signals could therefore differ somewhat.",
        "While increases in long-term yields signalled some tightening in conditions, the strong stock market and the slight depreciation of the euro pointed to a loosening.",
        "Regarding monetary developments, money growth continued to be strong − with broad money (M3) growing at an annual rate of 12.5% to January 2021 − amid a large footprint of Eurosystem asset purchases, which remained the largest source of money creation.",
        "The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth.",
        "Short-term monetary dynamics also remained strong.",
        "The monthly flow of January was weaker and largely driven by more volatile components.",
        "Growth in bank loans to non-financial corporations continued to moderate across countries, as reflected in monthly flows.",
        "The slowdown in the growth of lending reflected firms’ substantial liquidity buffers but also the continued postponement of fixed investment and a perceived tightening of credit standards.",
        "Bank lending rates to firms remained close to historical lows, reflecting the continued pass-through of recent monetary policy accommodation.",
        "However, the decline in nominal rates in the euro area throughout 2020 had been counterbalanced by lower inflation expectations for much of this period, keeping real rates above pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, according to the March 2021 projections, the 2020 budget deficit was expected to be smaller than foreseen in the December 2020 projections due to better economic developments and less need for support than previously expected.",
        "As partly anticipated, a sizeable additional stimulus was foreseen for 2021 in response to new lockdown measures.",
        "Nonetheless, the budget balance was projected to improve over the forecast horizon – from a deficit of 7.2% in 2020 to a deficit of 2.4% in 2023.",
        "This reflected not only a fiscal pull-back stemming from the winding-down of pandemic-related measures but also the reaction of automatic stabilisers and improvements linked to low interest rates.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane noted that, while the overall economic situation would improve throughout 2021, uncertainty in the euro area remained high, owing in particular to the persistently high rates of COVID-19 infection, the spread of virus mutations and the speed of vaccination campaigns.",
        "While the rebound in global demand and additional fiscal support measures were supporting global and domestic activity, the near-term economic outlook remained challenging.",
        "Looking beyond the short-term weakness, euro area economic activity was expected to gain momentum in the course of the year.",
        "Over the medium term the recovery in the euro area economy should be supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a recovery in demand as containment measures were gradually lifted.",
        "Accordingly, the March 2021 staff projections foresaw growth rebounding to 4.0% in 2021 and to 4.1% in 2022, before stabilising at 2.1% in 2023.",
        "The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook over the medium term had become more balanced, although downside risks remained in the near term.",
        "On the one hand, better prospects for the global economy, which had been bolstered by the sizeable fiscal stimulus, and progress in vaccination campaigns were encouraging.",
        "On the other hand, the ongoing pandemic – including the spread of virus mutations – and its implications for economic and financial conditions continued to be sources of downside risk.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, headline inflation had risen sharply to 0.9% in January and February 2021 (from -0.3% in December 2020), mainly owing to an increase in energy price inflation and several idiosyncratic factors.",
        "At the same time, underlying price pressures remained subdued in the context of weak demand and significant slack in labour and product markets.",
        "Survey-based measures and market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remained at low levels (compared with the Governing Council’s inflation aim), although the market-based indicators had continued to rise gradually.",
        "Looking ahead, inflation was expected to increase temporarily, reaching 2.0% towards the end of the year.",
        "The March 2021 staff projections foresaw HICP inflation averaging 1.5% in 2021, 1.2% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2023.",
        "The overriding theme in euro area and global financial markets had been the continued rise in longer-term risk-free interest rates and sovereign bond yields.",
        "In the overall context of a holistic and multifaceted approach to evaluating financing conditions (spanning the entire transmission chain of monetary policy), developments in risk-free interest rates and sovereign yields were particularly relevant.",
        "First, these market interest rates could be more directly influenced by the Governing Council’s monetary policy measures, notably its asset purchases.",
        "Second, risk-free rates and sovereign yields were leading indicators for financing conditions at the later stages of transmission.",
        "These were the key benchmark rates used in the pricing of other capital market instruments – such as corporate and bank bonds – as well as the pricing of bank loans to households and firms.",
        "It followed that shocks originating in the risk-free and sovereign bond markets tended to trickle down the transmission chain and influence downstream indicators of financing conditions with a lag.",
        "Accordingly, developments in risk-free interest rates and sovereign bond yields, which were measurable in real time, could give warnings about potential developments in the later stages of the transmission chain with a lag.",
        "In December, the Governing Council had pledged to preserve favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period and to prevent any tightening that was inconsistent with countering the negative pandemic shock to the projected inflation path.",
        "A sizeable and persistent rise in market interest rates that would prematurely tighten financing conditions for all sectors of the economy could challenge that commitment, especially in the context of a largely unchanged inflation outlook, as indicated by the March staff projections.",
        "Based on a joint assessment of the favourability of current financing conditions and the inflation outlook, Mr Lane proposed that net purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) over the next quarter be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first few months of the year.",
        "This fulfilled the Governing Council’s pledge to calibrate PEPP purchases, as appropriate, in order to preserve favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the projected path of inflation.",
        "The monthly purchase pace would continue to be implemented flexibly according to market conditions.",
        "The Governing Council should review the purchase pace on a quarterly basis at its monetary policy meetings, based on joint assessments of financing conditions and the inflation outlook.",
        "If conditions were such that favourable financing conditions (in the context of the inflation outlook) could be preserved with a slower pace of purchases, the Governing Council could scale down the pace.",
        "Likewise, the Governing Council could always scale up the pace of purchases if that was required to preserve favourable financing conditions.",
        "Furthermore, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions would continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy.",
        "The proposed significant increase in the purchase pace under the PEPP constituted a proportionate response to the risks that rising market interest rates posed to broader financing conditions and, thus, ultimately to the price stability mandate.",
        "Sizeable and persistent shifts in market interest rates, if left unchecked, were likely to withdraw monetary stimulus prematurely at a time when preserving favourable financing conditions remained necessary to underpin economic activity and safeguard medium-term price stability.",
        "Flexibly implemented asset purchases were a suitable monetary policy instrument that remained more efficient than alternative tools for preserving favourable financing conditions in the current pandemic environment characterised by high uncertainty.",
        "Their benefits for achieving the ECB’s price stability mandate also clearly outweighed any potential negative effects on other economic policy domains.",
        "The Governing Council also needed to reiterate that it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "This needed to be underlined in public communication, alongside restating the established forward guidance on the ECB’s key interest rates and asset purchase programmes.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks to economic activity provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "While the overall economic situation was seen to improve during 2021, uncertainty surrounding the near-term economic outlook remained, relating in particular to the dynamics of the pandemic and the speed of vaccination campaigns.",
        "The rebound in global demand and additional fiscal measures were supporting global and euro area activity, but persistently high COVID-19 infection rates, the spread of virus mutations and the associated extension and tightening of containment measures were weighing on euro area economic activity in the short term.",
        "Looking ahead, the ongoing vaccination campaigns, together with the envisaged gradual relaxation of containment measures, underpinned the expectation of a firm rebound in economic activity in the course of 2021.",
        "Inflation had picked up over recent months, mainly on account of some transitory factors and an increase in energy price inflation, but underlying price pressures remained subdued in the context of weak demand and significant slack in labour and product markets.",
        "As regards the external environment, members broadly shared Mr Lane’s assessment that the global economic recovery in 2020 had been faster than expected and that the outlook had improved in the context of ongoing vaccinations and learning effects on how to live with the pandemic.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that the additional US fiscal stimulus package (part of the Biden Administration’s American Rescue Plan – the so-called “Biden plan”) had not been factored into the March 2021 ECB staff projections, as the stimulus package had not been passed into legislation at the time the projections were finalised.",
        "This was seen to constitute an upside risk to the global and, consequently, euro area economic outlook as embedded in the staff projections.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that the impact of the Biden plan and the implications for the EUR/USD exchange rate depended on the type of open economy macro-model one had in mind and that spillovers were hard to quantify.",
        "Turning to euro area developments, real GDP had declined by 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020 following the strong rebound observed in the third quarter.",
        "Incoming economic data, surveys and high-frequency indicators pointed to continued economic weakness in the first quarter of 2021 driven by the persistence of the pandemic and the associated containment measures.",
        "As a result, real GDP was likely to contract again in the first quarter, but was then expected to rebound firmly in the course of the year.",
        "Overall, members generally agreed with the baseline view for economic growth in the March 2021 staff projections and noted that it was broadly unchanged from the December 2020 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "However, some nuances were expressed.",
        "On the one hand, it was stressed that real GDP growth had been repeatedly underestimated in successive quarters over the past year, pointing to the economy being more resilient than expected.",
        "It was argued that, beyond the short term, there could be grounds for a more optimistic view than had been taken by ECB staff on the medium-term outlook if, for example, assumptions regarding the evolution of the saving ratio turned out to be too conservative.",
        "Other reasons for being more optimistic were the passing by the US Congress of the Biden plan, whose fiscal impulse would exert a positive effect on euro area economic growth, as shown in staff analysis, and stronger global trade and activity more broadly, together with greater confidence about the path beyond the pandemic emergency, compared with the situation in December.",
        "On the other hand, it was noted that, compared with the December projections, the higher level of activity going forward was essentially reflecting a carry-over effect from past outturns.",
        "It was also noted that the projection for the first quarter of 2021 had been revised down and largely offset the better than expected outcome for the fourth quarter of 2020.",
        "Some caution was expressed that real GDP growth in the first quarter could be weaker than foreseen in the March projections, even though this might then be offset by a correspondingly stronger rebound in subsequent quarters.",
        "Members underlined the uncertainty surrounding the near-term growth outlook.",
        "The baseline continued to depend on the evolution of the pandemic and while uncertainty had decreased, it still remained high.",
        "Reference was made to the slow pace of vaccination compared with other parts of the world.",
        "Questions were raised as to how realistic it was to assume that containment measures would be reduced as early as the second quarter and it was pointed out that, depending on the further evolution of the pandemic, weakness in activity might continue well into the second quarter and beyond.",
        "Some concern was expressed that the true situation of the business and household sectors would only become apparent once the government support and guarantee schemes in response to the pandemic were phased out.",
        "This related, in particular, to the risk of insolvencies and their impact on bank balance sheets.",
        "The potential emergence of financial amplification loops would then also affect the medium-term economic outlook.",
        "It was also recalled that economic developments continued to be uneven across economic sectors, as the containment measures affected the services sector more adversely than the manufacturing sector.",
        "With respect to the euro area household sector, reference was made to the assumption in the baseline of the staff projections that the saving ratio would gradually return to pre-crisis levels, but that there would be no substantial unwinding of the excess savings accumulated during the pandemic period.",
        "The point was made that this assumption might be too conservative and implied upside risks to growth if precautionary motives had played no significant role and the high amount of accumulated savings simply reflected a lack of spending opportunities.",
        "This pointed to considerable potential for pent-up demand being unleashed once containment measures were eased.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that euro area countries were rather heterogeneous and that debt vulnerabilities, which to some extent predated the pandemic, had been exacerbated.",
        "Hence, it was conceivable that the saving ratio would remain higher than before, reflecting heightened caution and future deleveraging needs.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that there was still some risk that the unemployment rate would turn out to be higher than expected if jobs could not be preserved once the current job retention schemes expired.",
        "In their assessment of the balance of risks, members re-emphasised the dichotomy between continued elevated risks to the outlook in the short term and more positive developments in the medium term.",
        "While the degree of uncertainty was still high, it was seen to have lessened compared with at the time of the December projections.",
        "It was noted that financial market dynamics suggested a rather positive outlook.",
        "It was pointed out that some downside risks seen as prevailing in December had meanwhile been taken into account in a downward revision to growth in the first quarter of 2021 and that others had become smaller as the vaccination process had got under way.",
        "In addition, there were factors such as the Biden plan fiscal package which implied clear upside risks to the staff projections.",
        "Hence, while the pandemic continued to imply downside risks, the balance of risk was now shifting and becoming more balanced, or possibly even starting to shift to the upside, having been on the downside at the time of the Governing Council’s December monetary policy meeting and seen some improvement at the time of the 20-21 January meeting.",
        "Overall, members judged that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook over the medium term had become more balanced, although downside risks remained in the near term.",
        "On the one hand, better prospects for global demand, which had been bolstered by the sizeable fiscal stimulus, and the progress in vaccination campaigns were encouraging.",
        "On the other hand, the ongoing pandemic – including the spread of virus mutations – and its implications for economic and financial conditions continued to be sources of downside risk.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance was still seen as critical in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy.",
        "To this end, continued support from national fiscal policies remained warranted given weak demand from firms and households due to the ongoing pandemic and the associated containment measures.",
        "At the same time, fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should, as much as possible, remain temporary and targeted in nature to address vulnerabilities effectively and to support a swift recovery.",
        "The key role of the Next Generation EU package and the importance of it becoming operational without delay were underlined.",
        "Member States were called upon to ensure a timely ratification of the Own Resources Decision, to finalise their recovery and resilience plans promptly and to deploy the funds for productive public spending, accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural policies.",
        "This would allow the Next Generation EU programme to contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery and would increase economic resilience and the growth potential of Member States’ economies, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area.",
        "Such structural policies were particularly important in addressing long-standing structural and institutional weaknesses and in accelerating the green and digital transitions.",
        "Against this background, it was argued that in considering the fiscal stimulus in the United States, one should not overlook that more fiscal stimulus was in the pipeline also in euro area countries and that the disbursements of the Next Generation EU recovery fund were still to come.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Euro area annual HICP inflation had increased sharply, standing at 0.9% in January and February 2021 after -0.3% in December 2020.",
        "The upswing in headline inflation reflected a number of idiosyncratic factors, such as the end of the temporary VAT rate reduction in Germany, delayed sales periods in some euro area countries and the impact of the stronger than usual changes in HICP weights for 2021, as well as higher energy price inflation.",
        "On the basis of current oil futures prices, headline inflation was likely to increase further in the coming months, but some volatility was to be expected.",
        "These factors could be expected to fade out of annual inflation rates early next year.",
        "Underlying price pressures were expected to increase somewhat this year due to current supply constraints and the recovery in domestic demand, although pressures were expected to remain subdued overall, also reflecting low wage pressures and the past appreciation of the euro.",
        "Once the impact of the pandemic was fading, the unwinding of the high level of slack, supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, would contribute to a gradual increase in inflation over the medium term.",
        "According to the March 2021 ECB staff projections, the outlook for inflation had been revised up for 2021 and 2022, largely due to temporary factors and higher energy price inflation, while it was unchanged for 2023.",
        "While the projections foresaw a gradual increase in underlying inflation pressures, they confirmed that the medium-term inflation outlook remained broadly unchanged from the Eurosystem staff projections in December 2020 and below the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "In discussing the inflation outlook, members generally agreed that the large upward surprise in the latest HICP data and the upward revision to headline inflation for 2021 in the March 2021 ECB staff projections were mainly due to temporary factors which could be expected to fade away.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that there had been a small upward surprise in the latest HICP data also after accounting for the temporary factors.",
        "It was highlighted that the medium-term outlook for headline inflation in the March 2021 ECB staff projections was broadly unchanged from the December 2020 Eurosystem staff projections and thus remained well below the Governing Council’s inflation aim and below the projections prevailing just before the onset of the pandemic.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that spillovers from the Biden plan fiscal package to the euro area had not been taken into account in the current inflation projections, but would lead to an upward impact when doing so in subsequent projections.",
        "As regards inflation expectations, survey-based measures and market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations had remained at subdued levels, although the market-based indicators were continuing to rise gradually.",
        "It was noted that part of this upward trend might reflect “imported” inflation expectations from outside the euro area, but also that long-term inflation expectations had risen more strongly in the euro area than in the United States since the beginning of the year.",
        "Members also considered the implications that the expected temporary increase in headline inflation to around 2% later in 2021 could have on inflation expectations.",
        "On the one hand, it was suggested that there could be an upward impact if inflation expectations were backward looking.",
        "On the other hand, it was pointed out that economic agents would likely look through the temporary rise in inflation.",
        "However, it was also reported that contacts with businesses pointed to a perception of higher inflation in a context of spikes in commodity prices, supply bottlenecks and rising production costs.",
        "This warranted a close monitoring of producer price developments going forward.",
        "Turning to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Strong money growth had continued to be supported by the ongoing asset purchases of the Eurosystem, which remained the largest source of money creation.",
        "Developments in loans to the private sector had been characterised by somewhat weaker lending to non-financial corporations and resilient lending to households.",
        "A question was raised regarding the information content of money growth for medium-term inflation at a time when secular forces still seemed to be holding down the natural rate of interest and the Phillips curve relationship appeared to have weakened.",
        "Attention was drawn to the potential consequences of the prolonged pandemic crisis for the liquidity and solvency of non-financial corporations, which could eventually result in higher defaults, especially when public support and moratoria expired.",
        "Reference was also made to the tightening of credit conditions expected by banks, according to the latest bank lending survey.",
        "The prospect of increasing non-performing loans in the banking sector bore a risk of creating financial amplification loops, which ultimately could also cloud the medium-term economic outlook and give rise to financial stability risks.",
        "With regard to the assessment of financial and financing conditions, there was broad agreement among members that financing conditions were to be assessed on the basis of a holistic and multifaceted set of indicators covering the entire chain of monetary policy transmission.",
        "Longer-term risk-free interest rates and sovereign bond yields in the euro area had increased since the Governing Council’s early December meeting.",
        "This reflected, in part, spillovers from US bond yield increases on the back of the expected US fiscal stimulus, as well as rising commodity prices and improved growth prospects globally, as new global COVID-19 infections had declined and vaccination campaigns were proceeding.",
        "Although a better economic outlook in the United States also entailed positive demand effects for the euro area, it was observed that the optimism prevailing on financial markets, reflected in “reflation trades”, seemed not to be shared by businesses and households, which had generally maintained a cautious stance.",
        "At the same time, the view was held that the increase observed in sovereign yields had remained contained and to some extent decoupled from developments in the United States.",
        "Moreover, financing conditions for the non-financial private sector had remained very favourable overall, also on account of ample monetary policy support.",
        "In this context, the important role of both the PEPP and the supportive communication by the President and Governing Council members were underlined, which had helped to dampen the increase in euro area yields and contributed to the partial decoupling in the face of the global bond market sell-off.",
        "It was also noted that these increases had taken place from very low levels and that other indicators of financing conditions, such as lending rates for non-financial companies and households, as well as sovereign spreads and credit spreads, remained highly accommodative.",
        "However, it was also argued that, while a holistic and multifaceted approach to assessing the favourability of financing conditions along the entire transmission chain of monetary policy was deemed appropriate, special attention needed to be paid to sovereign yields and risk-free interest rates, which played a key role for financing conditions at the later stages of the transmission chain.",
        "In this context, it was remarked that a rise in risk-free interest rates and GDP-weighted sovereign yields needed to be pronounced and persistent in order to exert a material impact on broader financing conditions.",
        "The role of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, which could shield banks somewhat from possible increases in market-based funding costs, was also underlined.",
        "Members concurred with Mr Lane that ample monetary stimulus remained necessary to preserve favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period in order to ensure a sustained convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "It was emphasised that the assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook had to be undertaken jointly and that the assessment of favourable financing conditions would have to evolve over time.",
        "The focus of the Governing Council’s December decisions had been on countering an unwarranted and premature tightening of financing conditions, rather than preserving any particular level.",
        "A possible misperception that the Governing Council was engaging in a form of implicit yield curve control had to be avoided.",
        "However, the view was also expressed that, as long as the medium-term inflation outlook remained unsatisfactory, the Governing Council needed to preserve financing conditions close to the favourable levels observed in December to bring inflation back to the projected pre-pandemic path.",
        "Any material tightening in financing conditions, irrespective of the underlying driver and origin, would delay the convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim of below, but close to, 2% in the medium term.",
        "In this context, the view was held that the Governing Council had to look through the recent spike in inflation and focus instead on the continued shortfall of inflation from the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "However, the point was also made that the financing conditions that had prevailed in December 2020, as well as the pre-pandemic staff projections for inflation, could become less relevant over time in the light of other shocks that had occurred in the intervening period.",
        "Against this background, although the risks to the economic outlook for the euro area were becoming more balanced over the medium term, the recent tightening of financing conditions was generally seen as premature for the euro area, which was still in a weaker cyclical position than the United States.",
        "On the basis of the March staff projections, the euro area inflation and growth outlook had remained largely unchanged since the Governing Council’s December meeting.",
        "This was widely seen to call for a continuing high degree of accommodation.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that, to assess the favourability of financing conditions, it was necessary to understand the underlying drivers of the rise in risk-free rates.",
        "Real yields in the euro area had not increased materially since December and had even declined at short maturities, indicating that the pick-up in nominal yields reflected almost entirely markets’ reappraisal of the inflation outlook.",
        "Moreover, it was argued that higher real rates were not necessarily a cause for concern and should not trigger a policy intervention if they reflected higher growth prospects rather than higher real term premia.",
        "In this context, a remark was made that assessing developments in real interest rates was subject to uncertainty as regards the measurement of the relevant inflation expectations.",
        "In view of the Governing Council’s commitment to maintaining favourable financing conditions, adopted at its early December meeting, there was broad consensus among members that the recent rises in risk-free rates and GDP-weighted sovereign yields required a scaling-up of the pace of purchases under the PEPP.",
        "Since longer-term sovereign yields figured prominently among the key variables used to evaluate financing conditions and were indicative of future changes in other components of financing conditions, a significant increase in the pace of PEPP purchases for the next three months was widely seen as warranted.",
        "All in all, members expressed broad support for Mr Lane’s proposal to conduct purchases under the PEPP over the next quarter at a significantly higher pace than during the first few months of the year.",
        "A significant increase in the purchase pace for the next three months was seen as warranted by the observed tightening of financing conditions and the lack of a material improvement in the growth and inflation outlook.",
        "The proposal was also deemed proportionate in the light of the ECB’s mandate, balancing increased optimism about the medium-term outlook against the considerable uncertainty that still prevailed in the shorter term.",
        "Consideration was given to the appropriate size of the increase in the pace of purchases.",
        "It was highlighted that, to give a clear message to markets on the Governing Council’s “reaction function”, the purchase volume needed to be increased significantly, as proposed by Mr Lane.",
        "This would send a strong signal that the Governing Council wanted to lean against the tightening of financing conditions.",
        "However, it was also argued that a more moderate increase in the pace would better reflect the assessment of more balanced risks to the outlook, also in the light of previous decisions when a similar pace had been chosen but economic conditions had been worse.",
        "Although risk-free rates and GDP-weighted sovereign bond yields had increased, it was observed that this had occurred mostly on account of higher expected inflation and a better outlook for the global economy.",
        "In this context, it was remarked that the Governing Council needed to avoid giving the impression of being overly focused on sovereign yields or reacting mechanically to a set of indicators of financing conditions.",
        "Moreover, the view was put forward that the tightening might not be sizeable and persistent enough to affect broader financing conditions materially.",
        "Overall, there was wide agreement that the purchase pace needed to take into account a joint assessment of the favourability of current financing conditions and the inflation outlook.",
        "Against this background, all members joined a broad consensus around the proposal put forward by Mr Lane, on the understanding that the total PEPP envelope was not being called into question in the current conditions and that the pace of purchases could be reduced in the future.",
        "In this context, the flexibility of purchases over time was seen as essential for reacting to changes in financing conditions as needed over time.",
        "The decision to accelerate the purchase pace significantly would show that the Governing Council was willing to use the flexibility of the programme, without changing the overall envelope or duration of the programme.",
        "The envelope could, however, be recalibrated if required in order to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.",
        "Equally, if favourable financing conditions could be maintained with asset purchase flows that did not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full.",
        "It was underlined that the flexibility embodied in the PEPP was symmetric, implying that the purchase pace could be increased and decreased according to market conditions.",
        "Looking ahead, members agreed that the Governing Council would undertake a quarterly joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook in order to determine the pace of purchases needed to keep financing conditions favourable.",
        "At the same time, it was also deemed important that in the intervening period flexibility in the pace of purchases continued to be applied according to market conditions.",
        "As regards communication, it was seen as essential that the Governing Council reiterated its commitment to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "It was important to provide reassurance that the Governing Council would maintain an accommodative monetary policy for as long as necessary and saw no risk of overheating in the euro area in the present environment.",
        "Finally, in view of the sharp contraction of the euro area economy and the uneven recovery across sectors, it was deemed important to emphasise the need for continued support from fiscal policies to sustain the recovery.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the following monetary policy decisions.",
        "First, the Governing Council would continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of €1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until it judged that the coronavirus crisis phase was over.",
        "Based on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council expected purchases under the PEPP over the next quarter to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year.",
        "The Governing Council would purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that was inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation.",
        "In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions would continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy.",
        "If favourable financing conditions could be maintained with asset purchase flows that did not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full.",
        "Equally, the envelope could be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.",
        "The Governing Council would continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023.",
        "In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio would be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "Second, net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) would continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion.",
        "The Governing Council continued to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it started raising the key ECB interest rates.",
        "The Governing Council also intended to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Third, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it had seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence had been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.",
        "Finally, the Governing Council would continue to provide ample liquidity through its refinancing operations.",
        "In particular, the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) remained an attractive source of funding for banks, supporting bank lending to firms and households.",
        "The Governing Council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 9-10 June 2021.",
        "Long-term government bond yields had declined notably across advanced economies, including in the euro area, despite the ongoing strong recovery from the shock of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.",
        "Model-based evidence on the drivers of euro area yields suggested that a very large share of the recent decline in euro area risk-free rates reflected foreign spillovers, mainly in the form of an increase in global risk aversion.",
        "The fast spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus and rising infection rates across many countries had likely been the main reason behind the increase in global risk aversion, as also reflected in the ratio of value to growth stocks having fallen markedly in recent weeks.",
        "Although the experience of the United Kingdom suggested that, so far at least, progress in vaccination campaigns had succeeded in weakening the link between the number of infections and hospitalisation rates, the Delta variant had instilled new uncertainties about the path to economic normalisation, thereby weighing on yields in recent weeks.",
        "Long-term sovereign yields had declined more markedly in the United States, where investors had continued to reverse a large part of the rise in long-term real interest rates seen earlier this year, a move possibly linked to changes in market expectations about monetary policy.",
        "A model-based decomposition of the ten-year US Treasury yield suggested that term premia had declined considerably in recent weeks, while revisions to the expected future path of short-term rates had been more limited.",
        "This suggested that the sharp rise in US real rates earlier this year may have largely reflected increased uncertainty around the outlook for monetary policy, and that this uncertainty may have diminished in recent weeks.",
        "By comparison, in the euro area, real risk-free rates had been much more stable than in the United States, although they had also started to grind lower in recent weeks.",
        "Real ten-year risk-free rates in the euro area were currently almost 20 basis points below the level prevailing at the Governing Council meeting on 9-10 December 2020.",
        "In addition, market-based measures of inflation compensation had resisted broad downward pressure in the euro area, suggesting that investors remained fundamentally positioned for a sustained recovery from the pandemic crisis.",
        "As government bond spreads had remained resilient, the nominal euro area ten-year GDP-weighted sovereign bond yield had declined further since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 9-10 June 2021 and was currently again in negative territory.",
        "Yields had fallen by more than 30 basis points since mid-May when changes in market expectations about the likely future path of asset purchases had put upward pressure on yields.",
        "The EONIA forward curve had also flattened considerably in recent weeks, although this likely mirrored the decline in term premia related to the increased risk from the spreading of the Delta variant and did not necessarily reflect a genuine change in interest rate expectations.",
        "This was consistent with the unchanged expectations for a lift-off reported in the latest ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA).",
        "At the same time, the flattening of the forward curve could also in part reflect an adjustment in policy rate expectations in response to the outcome of the ECB’s strategy review, though immediate market reactions had been muted.",
        "As markets now expected an earlier lift-off of interest rates in the United States, the euro had depreciated markedly against the US dollar, reinforced by a flight to safety.",
        "Indeed, since the start of the year there had been a close correlation between the EUR/USD exchange rate and the short-term interest rate differential, implying that movements at the long end of the curve did not seem to have mattered much for foreign exchange markets, which had instead focused on the timing of the interest rate lift-off.",
        "Despite the notable increase in global risk aversion, so far there had been little adjustment of credit risk premia in euro area fixed income markets.",
        "Corporate bond spreads had weathered the recent flight to safety well.",
        "Investment-grade credit spreads had declined further, while high-yield bond spreads had increased somewhat, but remained below their pre-pandemic levels despite the strong issuance of high-yield bonds in the year to date.",
        "ECB data showed that the strong issuance by high-yield issuers had been to a large extent absorbed by investment funds, thereby further raising the risk profile of non-banks.",
        "The increase in global risk aversion had, however, weighed on equity prices.",
        "The EuroStoxx had declined, with larger losses in countries that were more heavily exposed to potential and actual travel restrictions imposed in the wake of the fast spread of the Delta variant.",
        "The events of recent days had also illustrated how current elevated stock market valuations could be prone to sudden corrections as cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratios were at, or close to, record highs.",
        "Price corrections, if sudden and sizeable, could have tangible effects on investors’ balance sheets, as inflows into equity funds had continued to increase since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 9-10 June 2021 and were several times higher than inflows seen in previous years.",
        "Overall, financial conditions in the euro area had remained broadly stable at highly accommodative levels.",
        "Taking a snapshot across indicators, those that put a large weight on the exchange rate showed an easing of financial conditions and those that stressed stock markets showed a tightening.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and the recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "As regards the external environment, incoming data had confirmed that the general recovery was proceeding, but with increasing evidence of supply constraints.",
        "At the same time, the spread of new COVID-19 variants continued to be a major concern for the global and euro area economic recovery.",
        "The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data for June gave historically high readings for the second quarter of 2021 as a whole – but this was before the Delta variant had led to a sharp increase in cases of infection.",
        "Trade in goods remained on the strong upward trend observed since the middle of last year – even though it had flattened slightly according to the most recent data.",
        "Since the June monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council, the euro had depreciated markedly against the US dollar (-3.6%) and less so in nominal effective terms (-0.9%).",
        "Oil prices had decreased by 3.9% in the same period (remaining broadly in line with the technical assumptions for the June projections), amid heightened volatility in the oil market.",
        "The upward trend in non-oil commodity prices had stopped and, overall, prices of metals and food had remained broadly unchanged since the June Governing Council meeting.",
        "Turning to the euro area, GDP had decreased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2021, especially owing to the implications of the lockdowns in many euro area countries for private consumption.",
        "Supply-side bottlenecks continued to dampen manufacturing activity, with supplier delivery times remaining close to the record high recorded in June, both globally and in the euro area, and the ratio of new orders to stocks of finished goods reaching a record high.",
        "The intensification of supply constraints was weighing on manufacturing and investment and had led to a fall in industrial production in May.",
        "In the latest ECB Corporate Telephone Survey, firms had reported that it was probably going to take until somtime next year before these supply constraints would no longer be an issue.",
        "Recent survey indicators, such as the PMIs for manufacturing output and services business activity, had suggested a strong rebound in activity in the second quarter, particularly in services, with continued growth in manufacturing.",
        "Retail sales volumes up to May, together with the increased availability of certain services, were consistent with robust consumption growth in the second quarter.",
        "Business confidence indicators pointed to a big recovery, with industrial confidence at very high levels in June – well above its pre-pandemic level – while other indicators were just about returning to pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Consumer confidence had increased, mainly reflecting a marked improvement in the assessment of the general economic situation over the next 12 months, while confidence in consumers’ personal financial situation, which tended be the main factor in purchasing decisions, had improved far less strongly.",
        "For business investment, survey indicators up to June suggested a strengthening in the second quarter of 2021, although the decline in capital goods production in May reflected the constraints posed by supply-side bottlenecks.",
        "Construction firms had also flagged shortages of materials and labour close to historical highs in June, amid strong demand conditions and confidence indicators.",
        "Turning to trade, the April data reflected continuing momentum, especially in goods exports to the United States and Asia, but the local contribution had weakened.",
        "In particular, exports of vehicles and electronics had been affected by supply constraints, while the delivery delays had also extended to machinery.",
        "Forward-looking indicators for tourism pointed to a recovery but were still very far from levels consistent with a complete normalisation.",
        "Looking at the labour market, the unemployment rate had declined in May to stand at 7.9%, which was 0.2 percentage points lower than in April 2021 but 0.6 percentage points higher than in February 2020.",
        "The number of workers in job retention schemes had been reduced but still amounted to around 5% of the labour force.",
        "Overall, the labour market continued to be substantially affected by the pandemic, but high-frequency indicators and survey data pointed to robust employment growth in the period ahead.",
        "Turning to nominal developments, inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had decreased slightly from 2.0% in May to 1.9% in June.",
        "HICP energy inflation had remained high (12.6%), contributing the lion’s share (1.1 percentage points) to headline inflation in June.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food had decreased slightly from 1.0% in May to 0.9% in June, driven by a decrease in services price inflation.",
        "While non-energy industrial goods (NEIG) price inflation had increased further from 0.6% in May to 1.2% in June, services price inflation, which historically had been an important driver of overall inflation, remained below 1%.",
        "In particular, prices in the tourism and hospitality sectors had not yet fully recovered.",
        "The change in HICP weights for 2021 had started to become a drag again on HICP inflation in June, a factor which was expected to increase over the summer.",
        "Developments in measures of underlying inflation remained subdued overall, with special factors playing an important role for many measures.",
        "The Persistent and Common Component of Inflation index had increased because the common component in this measure also captured the persistent part of energy price developments.",
        "For measures of core inflation, developments depended on whether volatile items such as travel-related services or clothing and footwear were included and also whether the effects of changes in value added taxes were netted out.",
        "In general, it continued to be important to assess developments in underlying inflation on the basis of a broad range of indicators.",
        "Pipeline pressures for NEIG inflation had increased further over recent months, mainly at the earlier stages of the pricing chain, and additional upward pressure on NEIG inflation from recent input cost developments was likely over the coming months.",
        "Wage developments had been subdued overall.",
        "Many wage settlements had been low, which reflected the difficulty entailed in negogiating higher wages amid the current level of economic slack and high uncertainty.",
        "The latest data gave no indication that rising inflation rates were leading to higher wage agreements.",
        "Increases in input costs continued to put profit margins under pressure.",
        "Looking ahead, it was important to assess whether the pass-through of higher input costs would strengthen.",
        "In the latest ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters, longer-term expectations for headline inflation had been revised up to 1.8% (for 2026) from 1.7% (for 2025) in the previous round.",
        "The distribution of longer-term inflation expectations had moved to the right as many more respondents had revised their longer-term inflation expectations upwards than downwards.",
        "At the same time, market-based measures of inflation compensation and option-implied risk-neutral inflation probabilities had remained broadly unchanged since the June monetary policy meeting.",
        "Turning to financial and monetary developments, nominal risk-free rates and sovereign yields had declined since the June policy meeting.",
        "Looking at the downstream indicators, interest rates for households and firms remained low and financial and financing conditions were broadly unchanged overall.",
        "Long-term GDP-weighted sovereign yields had fallen in parallel with risk-free rates since the June monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council, but they were still far above the levels recorded last December.",
        "The annual growth of M3 had declined further in May, suggesting a normalisation of monetary flows compared with the peak of the crisis, with households and firms returning to accumulating deposits at a pace similar to the rate prevailing before the pandemic.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to firms had declined in May as a result of the improvement in economic activity and confidence indicators.",
        "The real cost of bank financing had moved back towards pre-pandemic levels, supported by the recent rebound in inflation expectations.",
        "In the July bank lending survey, euro area banks had reported a moderate net increase in demand for loans to firms in the second quarter of 2021, after two quarters of significant declines.",
        "Financing needs of firms for fixed investment were seen as making a positive contribution to loan demand for the first time since the third quarter of 2019.",
        "The reported change in the composition of lending hence reflected a normalisation.",
        "It was also reassuring that banks had reported broadly unchanged credit standards for loans to enterprises in the second quarter of 2021, following a significant net tightening in the second half of 2020 and a moderate tightening in the first quarter of 2021.",
        "Some companies seemed to have replaced bank loans with market-based financing, taking advantage of the attractive bond yields.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households had edged up in May and continued to be driven by lending for house purchase.",
        "Credit standards for housing loans had remained broadly unchanged in the second quarter of 2021.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, strong fiscal support was expected for 2021, including from the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme.",
        "Since the June staff projections were prepared, additional fiscal measures of around 0.25% of GDP had been announced for the current year.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane noted that, in implementing the new monetary policy strategy, it was important to update the Governing Council’s forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates.",
        "A commitment to maintain monetary accommodation on a persistent basis was essential in view of the effective lower bound constraint and the shortfall in the medium-term inflation outlook relative to the two per cent target.",
        "The new strategy incorporated two key innovations which should be reflected in the ECB’s forward guidance on interest rates: first, the redefinition of the ECB’s price stability objective as a two per cent inflation target over the medium term; and, second, a conditional commitment to take into account the implications of the effective lower bound when conducting monetary policy in an environment of structurally low nominal interest rates.",
        "Under the current conditions, forward guidance would reinforce the commitment to attaining the inflation target by clarifying that the policy rates would be raised only if the evidence was sufficiently robust to allow the Governing Council to expect with a high degree of confidence that the inflation rate would reach two per cent on a durable basis.",
        "In practice, the proposed new forward guidance would serve two distinct purposes: first, it would provide a concrete operationalisation of the concept of robust convergence of inflation to the new target; and, second, it would reflect the clear need for the ECB’s policy reaction to be especially persistent in conditions, such as at present, in which nominal interest rates had been close to their lower bound for some time and the outlook for inflation was still well below the target.",
        "A recalibrated forward guidance should contain three key conditions that should be met before interest rates were raised: first, inflation should reach the target well in advance of the end of the projection horizon, in order to ensure that the lift-off decision was based on firm foundations and not exposed to the volatility of longer-horizon projection errors; second, the Governing Council should be confident that the target would be reached on a durable basis; and, third, the Governing Council should not consider raising rates unless underlying inflation was also judged to have made satisfactory progress towards two per cent.",
        "This was an extra safeguard against a policy tightening in the face of cost-push shocks that might elevate headline inflation temporarily but fade quickly.",
        "Finally, a preamble should make clear that the new guidance was in the service of ensuring robust convergence to the target over the medium term.",
        "In line with these principles, Mr Lane proposed the following reformulation: “In order to ensure robust convergence to the two per cent inflation target over the medium term, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until we see inflation reaching two per cent well ahead of the end of our projection horizon and on a durable basis and we judge that realised progress in underlying inflation towards two per cent is sufficiently advanced”.",
        "First, by stipulating that inflation should be expected to reach the target “well ahead of the end of our projection horizon”, the new forward guidance would give reassurance that the rise in inflation to two per cent at the time of a rate lift-off should not be expected to occur only at the end point of the horizon.",
        "This earlier convergence to the target also helped to hedge monetary policy against the risk of reacting to forecast errors, which tended to be larger at longer horizons.",
        "Second, by stating that the inflation target should be reached on a durable basis, the Governing Council would signal that the target would be attained on a lasting basis, rather than as the result of short-lived forces that led to one-off price increases but were unlikely to lead to persistently higher year-on-year inflation.",
        "For that purpose, the Governing Council needed to look beyond the initial threshold of “well ahead of the end of the projection horizon” to see whether the inflation target was expected to be reached on a durable basis.",
        "In both dimensions, the forward guidance was formulated as an expectation of the Governing Council, rather than being mechanically linked to staff projections.",
        "This formulation would also keep an element of the focus on current developments by retaining the reference to underlying inflation.",
        "Specifically, the third condition would imply that the “realised progress in underlying inflation towards two per cent is sufficiently advanced” at the time of a rate hike.",
        "This additional condition would provide added insurance against a premature policy reaction to transitory, and possibly contractionary, price shocks.",
        "It was important to keep in mind that “underlying inflation” was a broad concept – it was the persistent component of inflation that provided the best guide to future inflation developments and was not proxied by any single indicator, in view of the state-contingent nature of the forces shaping underlying inflation trends.",
        "Some other elements of the new forward guidance were important to note.",
        "First, the forward guidance remained state-contingent and would continue to provide a powerful automatic stabilisation mechanism.",
        "In one direction, if the inflation outlook were to improve by more than anticipated as the recovery proceeded, the time horizon to the first increase in interest rates would automatically shorten and financing conditions tighten.",
        "In the other direction, if there were setbacks to the inflation outlook, the time to lift-off would automatically lengthen, leading to easier financing conditions that would help support the economy and the inflation outlook.",
        "Second, specifying a condition in terms of a relatively earlier convergence within the projection horizon did not mean altering the Governing Council’s concept of the medium term.",
        "The condition was meant to act as a signpost to orientate monetary policy at a time when acting too pre-emptively would risk exposing policy to “false signals” and when longer-term inflation expectations remained well below the Governing Council’s inflation target.",
        "The orientation, as stated in the preamble to the new forward guidance, remained resolutely focused on “ensuring robust convergence to the two per cent inflation target over the medium term”.",
        "Third, the formulation provided ex ante guideposts, rather than requirements that needed to be met ex post.",
        "In particular, the preamble limited the validity and scope of the new forward guidance to a situation in which robust convergence was not yet assured.",
        "Once robust convergence to the two per cent target had been achieved, revised forward guidance would be necessary.",
        "Given that the reformulation of forward guidance constituted a revision to the policy stance that might prolong the horizon over which the key interest rates were expected to remain at their present or lower levels, a proportionality assessment was warranted.",
        "The proposed revision to the forward guidance was indeed judged a proportionate response to the risks to the ECB’s price stability mandate.",
        "Since the Governing Council had first introduced forward guidance on interest rates in 2013, it had gained substantial experience with this instrument: there was little doubt that it was an effective tool to steer interest rate expectations.",
        "There was abundant evidence that it had contributed to bringing inflation closer to the Governing Council’s objective, and the proposed new guidance was expected to be similarly effective.",
        "The proposed reformulation was also efficient compared with alternative policy options.",
        "Other tools, while also effective, would be less efficient in the medium-term segment of the term structure: in order to provide the same additional inflation impulse with different instruments, the Governing Council would need to either lower policy rates substantially deeper into negative territory or significantly scale up its asset purchase programmes.",
        "Moreover, any unintended consequences of the current low level of interest rates for financial intermediation and the wider economy were unlikely to be strongly amplified by the limited delay in the lift-off date to which this reformulation could give rise, and in any case would be outweighed by the benefits of low interest rates for employment and economic activity.",
        "Of course, the Governing Council would continue monitoring the potential side effects – positive or negative – if it extended the period over which negative or low interest rates were applied.",
        "In this respect it was also important to note that the support which the new strategy and the proposed forward guidance provided for the re-anchoring of inflation expectations reduced the risk of possible side effects, since it should help to shorten the time spent at very low interest rates and, all else being equal, lower the required volume of asset purchases.",
        "Turning to the assessment of the economic outlook, the recovery of the euro area economy was gaining momentum.",
        "While the Delta variant was a source of concern, the advance of the vaccination campaigns over recent weeks had allowed containment measures to be rolled back in most euro area countries.",
        "The improvement in the economic outlook was reflected in forward-looking activity and sentiment data for all sectors of the economy and was also starting to show through in indicators of realised economic activity.",
        "The composite manufacturing PMI had hit a new record in June, retail sales had improved significantly in May, and trade was showing robust momentum.",
        "However, the increasing spread of the Delta variant could dampen the recovery, especially in services such as tourism and hospitality.",
        "Moreover, supply constraints continued to restrain production in some sectors.",
        "The intensification of global supply chain disruptions that was becoming evident, for example in longer delivery times or shortages of computer chips, had led to a decline in industrial production in the three largest euro area economies in May.",
        "Risks to the outlook remained broadly balanced.",
        "Downside risks were primarily related to the possibility of a renewed intensification of the pandemic owing to the spread of more aggressive virus variants or more persistent supply bottlenecks.",
        "The strong incoming forward-looking data and the possibility of a faster than anticipated draw-down of savings represented some upside risks to the outlook.",
        "HICP inflation had decreased slightly, from 2.0% in May to 1.9% in June.",
        "While, the latest data implied some upward revision to the short-term profile for headline and core inflation on account of stronger than envisaged inflation for the NEIG and energy components, the profile envisaged in the June staff projections was broadly confirmed.",
        "Survey-based measures of inflation now also indicated a small rise in longer-term inflation expectations, although to levels that were still some distance below the inflation target.",
        "Although long-term benchmark interest rates remained above the levels observed in the first months of the year, these had fallen since the June monetary policy meeting, influenced by movements in US bond yields and renewed uncertainty about the future evolution of the pandemic.",
        "The market reaction to the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting in June had been a key driver of international financial markets, but interest rate expectations in the euro area had remained mostly unaffected.",
        "Since the incoming information was broadly in line with the joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook carried out at the June monetary policy meeting, Mr Lane proposed to continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme in the third quarter at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks to the outlook provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The recovery in the euro area economy was widely seen as on track.",
        "More and more people were being vaccinated, and lockdown restrictions had been eased in most euro area countries.",
        "But the pandemic continued to cast a shadow, especially as the Delta variant constituted a source of growing uncertainty.",
        "Inflation had picked up, although the increase was expected to be mostly temporary.",
        "The outlook for inflation over the medium term remained subdued.",
        "With respect to the external environment, members broadly shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction that global economic activity and trade had continued to improve, despite the fourth wave of the coronavirus spreading across the world.",
        "It was generally believed that less stringent measures would be adopted by authorities and that the link between widely used lockdown indices and economic activity should be substantially weaker than in earlier waves.",
        "At the same time, concern was expressed about the situation in emerging economies, where vaccination campaigns were much less advanced.",
        "Moreover, trade continued to be heavily affected by supply bottlenecks and rising shipping costs, and was still dependent on the future evolution of the pandemic.",
        "In this environment, the outlook for global trade was seen as highly uncertain.",
        "The outlook for economic activity and inflation in the United States was regarded as difficult to interpret in the light of recent financial market developments, with US bond yields having declined considerably at a time when inflation in the United States had clearly risen.",
        "While market participants might have become more pessimistic about the growth outlook in view of the recent spread of the Delta variant, they had also become more receptive to the Federal Reserve System’s argument that the ongoing bout of inflation would be temporary.",
        "However, it was also argued that a number of indicators pointed to risks of a more protracted rise in inflation in the United States, not least against the background of substantial fiscal policy support.",
        "In discussing the euro area’s economic outlook, members generally concurred that the June baseline staff projections remained broadly valid, despite some changes in the likely quarterly pattern.",
        "It was underlined that the euro area economy was rebounding strongly and economic sentiment had improved notably.",
        "If anything, recent indicators seemed to have become more favourable than previously expected and were confirming that the recovery was gaining ground.",
        "Generally, they now pointed to a somewhat stronger outcome for economic activity in the second quarter, while growth in the third quarter might fall short of the ambitious figure contained in the June projections.",
        "Taking both quarters together, growth seemed to be well on track overall.",
        "Manufacturing was expected to perform strongly, even though supply bottlenecks were holding back production in the near term.",
        "The reopening of large parts of the economy was supporting a vigorous bounce-back in the services sector.",
        "However, the Delta variant of the coronavirus could dampen the recovery in services, especially in tourism and hospitality.",
        "As people returned to shops and restaurants and resumed travelling, consumer spending was rising.",
        "Better job prospects, increasing confidence and continued government support were reinforcing spending.",
        "The ongoing recovery in domestic and global demand was boosting optimism among businesses.",
        "While the spread of the Delta variant had led to renewed uncertainty, as also reflected in financial markets, the economy was holding up.",
        "Households and firms continued to adapt rapidly to living with the presence of the coronavirus.",
        "The assessment was broadly shared that a fourth wave of the coronavirus would have a more limited health impact owing to rising vaccination rates, for example in terms of hospitalisation and pressure on intensive care units.",
        "Hence a fourth wave was also likely to result in less stringent containment measures and have a more limited economic impact overall.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that the correlation between containment measures and the economic cost of the pandemic was changing over time.",
        "Overall, economic activity could be expected to return to its pre-crisis level in the first quarter of next year.",
        "However, there was still a long way to go before the damage to the economy caused by the pandemic was overcome.",
        "For example, the number of people in job retention schemes had been declining but remained high.",
        "Members assessed the risks to the economic outlook as broadly balanced.",
        "On the upside, economic activity could outperform expectations if consumers spent more than currently expected and drew more rapidly on the savings they had built up during the pandemic.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that the recovery was gaining momentum, with a strong rebound in consumption and qualitative indicators pointing to a fall in the household saving rate.",
        "A faster improvement in the pandemic situation could also lead to a stronger expansion than currently envisaged.",
        "In addition, the approval of the NGEU programmes for the individual countries was moving in a favourable direction, even if implementation risks remained.",
        "Previously identified risks of a wave of bankruptcies in the corporate sector appeared to be receding.",
        "Regarding possible downside risks, growth could underperform expectations if the pandemic intensified or if supply shortages turned out to be more persistent and held back production more than previously anticipated.",
        "Concerns were expressed that much about the virus was still poorly understood and a sequence of further mutations was not unlikely, with consequences that were hard to predict despite progress with vaccination campaigns.",
        "It was also argued that tail risks in the non-financial corporate sector, and notably for small and medium-sized enterprises, were still accumulating in a recovery that was very asymmetric and uneven from a sectoral perspective.",
        "Moreover, it was underlined that the benign evidence of limited bankruptcies so far had to be ascribed to the massive and timely responses of fiscal and monetary policy.",
        "Finally, rising oil and commodity prices could weigh on consumption, while economic slack remained substantial in a fragile recovery.",
        "Looking at a comparison with the June staff projections, it was pointed out that the risk of the Delta variant spreading had clearly materialised but with less immediate economic impact than might have been feared.",
        "Overall, the balance of risks for economic activity as expressed in the June projections was judged to be still valid.",
        "Against this background, members agreed that ambitious, targeted and coordinated fiscal policy should continue to complement monetary policy in supporting the recovery.",
        "In this context, the NGEU programme had a key role to play.",
        "It would contribute to a stronger and uniform recovery across euro area countries.",
        "It would also accelerate the green and digital transitions and support necessary structural reforms that lifted long-term growth.",
        "Turning to price developments, headline HICP inflation had stood at 1.9 per cent in June.",
        "Inflation was expected to rise over the coming months and to decline again in 2022.",
        "The current increase was largely being driven by higher energy prices and by base effects from the sharp fall in oil prices at the start of the pandemic and from the impact of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany last year.",
        "By early 2022 these factors would fade as they dropped out of the year-on-year inflation calculation.",
        "Members highlighted that recent inflation numbers had clearly been higher than previously expected, for both headline inflation and core inflation excluding food and energy, continuing a persistent string of upside surprises.",
        "They were driven, in particular, by unexpectedly strong developments in NEIG prices.",
        "However, the picture of a mostly transitory increase in inflation was still widely seen to hold true.",
        "While the increases in inflation were expected to continue in the near term, in part owing to temporary cost pressures in supply chains, most measures of underlying price pressures had remained subdued.",
        "Significant slack in the economy, weak wage growth and the past appreciation of the euro meant that underlying price pressures would likely remain subdued for some time.",
        "Attention was drawn to indications that profit margins were falling rapidly, implying that cost increases were being absorbed by businesses rather than being passed through to prices.",
        "Moreover, available data on wage agreements for the first few months of the current year pointed to growth in negotiated wages that remained relatively low in an environment in which inflation was relatively high.",
        "Subtracting reasonable estimates of trend productivity growth from wage growth showed subdued unit labour costs.",
        "It was argued that, taken together, this evidence suggested a subdued medium-term outlook for inflation.",
        "It was also argued that, so far, evidence of second-round or indirect effects of higher inflation was limited, with a contained pass-through from non-energy input costs to consumer prices.",
        "However, it was also stressed that profit margins had already been squeezed for some time during the pandemic and, based on past experience, such a continuous decline in margins was not sustainable and would likely reverse.",
        "This suggested that cost increases would increasingly be passed through to consumers in the future.",
        "This was all the more likely in the current environment, since households appeared ready to spend part of their accumulated savings.",
        "Reference was also made in this context to upward revisions to earnings expectations for listed companies.",
        "In addition, supply bottlenecks now seemed to be more severe and persisting for longer than previously expected, although they were clearly expected to remain transitory.",
        "Moreover, labour market developments had been getting stronger in recent months, with reduced recourse to government support schemes.",
        "The new package of climate policies recently proposed by the European Commission was seen as likely to lead to sustained upward pressures on energy prices and some other price components in the period ahead.",
        "However, it was also argued that such cost and price pressures linked to the climate transition might be offset by efficiency gains from technological change, by the replacement of fossil fuels with renewables in the energy mix and by an intended downward impact on energy consumption.",
        "The point was made, however, that the direct effect of climate policies on energy prices should dominate initially and that any substitution effect was likely to kick in only later.",
        "With respect to public investment and the impact on aggregate demand, and hence on economic slack, the net effect of the climate package would clearly be to stimulate the economy for the next decade.",
        "In line with the conclusions of the ECB’s strategy review, a discussion of the costs of owner-occupied housing was welcomed.",
        "Residential property prices in the euro area were increasing at their fastest pace since 2007, and experience at the country level suggested that the underlying trends were rather persistent.",
        "The available experimental owner-occupied housing cost data related to the first quarter of 2021, and the contribution they would have made to headline inflation for the euro area as a whole had been estimated at around 0.2-0.3 percentage points.",
        "In this context, it was underlined that the existing HICP remained the relevant measure of inflation for the ECB, with owner-occupied housing an auxiliary consideration and the available experimental indicator lagging the HICP.",
        "In the past there had also been earlier periods, such as between 2011 and 2014 – i.e.",
        "during the sovereign debt crisis – when the contribution from owner-occupied housing would have been significantly negative, at around 30 basis points.",
        "Mapping the property price index to the owner-occupied housing component in consumer prices remained experimental and required further work.",
        "So far, a distinction had not been made between the consumption and the investment element.",
        "Considering recent developments in inflation expectations, members noted that longer-term inflation expectations had edged up to 1.8 per cent, from 1.7 per cent, according to the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, while market-based indicators of inflation expectations had remained broadly stable.",
        "The survey had been carried out before the ECB’s announcement of its revised strategy but possibly reflected some anticipation of the Governing Council’s new framework.",
        "While no significant market impact had been observed around the day on which the new strategy was announced, it might take some time until the markets and the public had fully digested the changes.",
        "Confidence was expressed that inflation expectations were starting to move in the right direction.",
        "However, it was also cautioned that inflation expectations for the coming five years as reflected in option market prices continued to show a much higher probability of euro area inflation falling short of two per cent than exceeding it.",
        "Members broadly concurred that, while the inflation outlook had improved, it remained some distance from the ECB’s target level.",
        "The Governing Council would consider the outlook again in more detail at its September meeting, once the new staff projections were available.",
        "At the same time, risks to the inflation outlook, as embodied in the June Eurosystem staff projections, were widely regarded as increasingly tilted to the upside.",
        "This was clearly seen to be the case over the short term.",
        "It was also seen to be the case to a lesser extent in the assessment of the medium-term outlook, although this was more uncertain.",
        "Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members broadly concurred that incoming data suggested monetary flows were normalising as the pandemic situation improved.",
        "The annual rate of growth in broad money (M3) had declined further in May, reflecting a strong negative base effect.",
        "Deposit flows of households and firms had returned to pre-pandemic levels as liquidity needs subsided.",
        "The annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector had declined in May, reflecting a negative base effect and net loan redemptions.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that in the July bank lending survey euro area banks had reported a moderate net increase in firms’ demand for loans in the second quarter of 2021. Credit conditions were judged to have remained supportive against the backdrop of a generally improving economic situation and continued policy support from monetary, fiscal and supervisory authorities.",
        "Interest rates on bank loans had so far been insulated from the upward trend in risk-free interest rates since the end of 2020 and remained near historical lows.",
        "Members agreed that, overall, financial and financing conditions had remained broadly unchanged at highly favourable levels.",
        "Euro area risk-free interest rates and sovereign yields had fallen in both nominal and real terms since the June monetary policy meeting, with the euro area GDP-weighted ten-year bond yield falling back into negative territory.",
        "It was remarked that real interest rates stood at historical lows.",
        "The decline in euro area market interest rates was seen to largely reflect renewed risk aversion, owing to the rapid spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus, as well as spillovers from the decline in US yields.",
        "Further downstream, bank lending rates for firms and households had remained near historical lows.",
        "It was reiterated that preserving favourable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy throughout the pandemic crisis period remained essential for the current economic rebound to turn into a lasting expansion and to offset the negative impact of the pandemic on inflation.",
        "With regard to the proposed policy measures, members agreed that it was necessary to align the forward guidance on interest rates with the revised formulation of the price stability objective in the ECB’s new monetary policy strategy.",
        "Given that the conclusion of the strategy review had been announced only two weeks prior to the current monetary policy meeting, it was highlighted that changes in the forward guidance would shape market participants’ understanding of the new strategy and could be seen as a first test of the revised strategy itself.",
        "It was underlined that the new strategy had been agreed unanimously and provided the Governing Council with a shared framework.",
        "The strategy incorporated two key innovations, which needed to be reflected in the forward guidance.",
        "First, it provided a numerical clarification of the price stability objective by specifying an explicit two per cent symmetric inflation target.",
        "Second, it included a “conditional commitment” to take into account the implications of the effective lower bound when setting monetary policy in an environment of structurally low nominal interest rates, including through the adoption of more forceful or persistent policy measures.",
        "The need to revise the forward guidance on interest rates was emphasised, in order to provide a credible commitment to bringing inflation up to the new target.",
        "It was also seen as essential to provide safeguards against a premature tightening of monetary policy in the current environment.",
        "It was also recalled that forward guidance was a state-contingent instrument that expressed monetary policy intentions, rather than being a fixed commitment to a pre-determined policy path.",
        "The forward guidance was always based on the Governing Council’s current assessment of the outlook for price stability.",
        "Hence, the Governing Council retained discretion and judgement, and the guidance could change as circumstances evolved.",
        "Moreover, as the forward guidance was not mechanically linked to the staff projections, the Governing Council retained flexibility to exercise its own judgement regarding the inflation outlook.",
        "The reformulated forward guidance was best understood as a set of conditions that would help guide the ECB’s actions in pursuit of its inflation target, as defined in the new strategy.",
        "It did not necessarily imply “lower for longer” interest rates if it ultimately succeeded in anchoring inflation expectations at the target, as intended.",
        "Accordingly, it was remarked that forward guidance on interest rates, if credible, should reduce the extent to which other instruments needed to be deployed.",
        "Against this background, the new formulation of the forward guidance proposed by Mr Lane was widely seen as finely balanced.",
        "It reflected the new symmetric inflation target of two per cent and the conditional commitment to take into account the implications of the effective lower bound when conducting policy in an environment of structurally low nominal interest rates.",
        "In particular, by stipulating more specific outlook-based and outcome-based conditions to be met before interest rates were raised, it underlined the need for persistence in the accommodative policy stance.",
        "This would help avoid a premature tightening of the stance and ensure a robust convergence of inflation to the target in the medium term.",
        "In this regard, it was noted that the forward guidance language should clearly dispel the notion that two per cent was a ceiling for inflation, given that the new strategy explicitly allowed for a moderate and transitory overshooting.",
        "In the discussion, members put forward a number of considerations.",
        "On the one hand, the case was made for strengthening the forward guidance on interest rates even further.",
        "First, policy rates remained constrained by the lower bound.",
        "Second, medium-term inflation expectations continued to stand below the inflation target.",
        "Third, markets were pricing in a lift-off of the key ECB policy rates at a time when inflation over the medium term was still expected to be well below two per cent.",
        "This could be interpreted as a sign that the current forward guidance was insufficient to guide market expectations.",
        "From this perspective, it was felt that the forward guidance could be strengthened by formulating the lift-off conditions in terms of realised inflation rather than expected inflation.",
        "The point was made that stepping up the forward guidance now and scaling it back later, when necessary, would be better for credibility than having to scale up the guidance later.",
        "On the other hand, it was cautioned that requiring inflation to durably reach two per cent at an earlier point in time would risk undermining the medium-term orientation of monetary policy.",
        "In addition, given the significant lags with which monetary policy was transmitted to the real economy, it would amount to intentionally overshooting the inflation target.",
        "In this regard, it was recalled that other instruments were continuing to provide strong monetary policy support at the lower bound.",
        "The point was made that some loosening of the monetary policy stance would occur automatically, without substantial changes to the forward guidance, because the somewhat higher inflation target in the new strategy would in any case likely imply a postponement of the lift-off date.",
        "The credibility of the Governing Council’s forward guidance was seen as key to its success.",
        "It was noted that the further into the future forward guidance extended, the less credible the commitment was likely to be.",
        "Under the forward guidance in place at the time of the meeting, markets were not expecting the lift-off until 2024 and were pricing in negative policy rates until 2028.",
        "Moreover, the argument was made that the proposed formulation could prove too ambitious and hence jeopardise credibility by risking a break with the stipulated conditions later on.",
        "A suggestion was made to include “knock-out” clauses in the forward guidance as a possible means to enhance credibility, mitigate financial stability risks and underscore that the Governing Council was just as concerned about inflation being too high as it was about inflation being too low.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that the strategy itself provided a safeguard by stipulating that only temporary and moderate overshoots of inflation would be consistent with price stability over the medium term.",
        "Against this background, members exchanged views on how to formulate the three conditions in the recalibrated forward guidance set out in the proposal by Mr Lane.",
        "With regard to the first condition, it was remarked that the phrase “well ahead” was essential in order to avoid referring only to the end of the projection horizon, which was seen as subject to greater uncertainty than shorter-term forecasts.",
        "Given projection errors, preferences were expressed to formulate the first condition in terms of realised inflation rather than projected inflation.",
        "This might help avoid a premature tightening of the monetary policy stance, strengthen the credibility of the guidance and provide greater clarity to markets.",
        "At the same time, concerns were raised that the phrase “well ahead” could be perceived as deviating from the medium-term orientation of the monetary policy strategy.",
        "However, it was clarified that specifying a condition in terms of a relatively earlier convergence within the projection horizon did not mean altering the concept of the medium term.",
        "With regard to the second condition outlined by Mr Lane, the phrase “on a durable basis” was seen to provide flexibility by allowing for small oscillations around the target level.",
        "However, concerns were raised that the phrase was too vague to sufficiently anchor expectations, as suggested by experience with the current formulation of forward guidance.",
        "It was argued that the notion of durability could be reinforced by referring explicitly to the level of inflation over the remainder of the projection horizon.",
        "In this regard, and in view of the symmetric nature of the inflation target, it was suggested that reference could be made, for example, to inflation not falling below or staying above two per cent over the forecast horizon.",
        "It was acknowledged that such a reformulation of interest rate forward guidance would imply an almost certain overshoot of the two per cent inflation target.",
        "Such overshooting, if temporary and moderate, could however be seen as fully in line with the new strategy.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that requiring inflation not to fall below the target would effectively amount to intentionally overshooting, which was viewed as inconsistent with the strategy.",
        "It was also remarked that, because there was no explicit safeguard ensuring that any potential overshoot would be moderate, maintaining price stability could give rise to the need for a rapid increase in policy rates once the conditions of the interest rate forward guidance had been met.",
        "Such a swift tightening of policy rates at a later stage might then not prove easy to pursue or might give rise to financial stability risks, exacerbating the initial overshoot.",
        "This needed to be taken into account in the proportionality analysis.",
        "Against this background, there was broad support for including an explicit reference to the ECB’s agreed monetary policy strategy statement on overshooting in the communication on forward guidance, in order to address potential misunderstandings.",
        "With regard to the third condition, referring to underlying inflation was seen as an effective means to safeguard against a premature tightening of monetary policy in response to forecast errors or to supply-side shocks that might affect headline inflation only temporarily.",
        "However, a concern was expressed that the phrase “realised progress in underlying inflation towards two per cent is sufficiently advanced” could be misinterpreted as suggesting that the Governing Council had a separate two per cent target for underlying inflation.",
        "Moreover, the point was made that such a perceived target for underlying inflation would effectively render the guidance rather ambitious because standard measures of underlying inflation, in particular core inflation excluding food and energy, had typically been well below headline inflation in the euro area historically.",
        "It was also remarked that there were multiple measures of underlying inflation and therefore the reference might be viewed as ambiguous and leaving ample room for discretion.",
        "Reflecting the balance of the arguments, overwhelming support emerged around an amended version of the forward guidance proposal by Mr Lane.",
        "The notion of “robust” convergence was further clarified by the inclusion of the phrase “durably for the rest of the projection horizon” with reference to inflation reaching two per cent.",
        "The inclusion of language from the new strategy statement – namely a reference to the target being symmetric and the possibility of a transitory period in which inflation could be moderately above target – would place the forward guidance firmly within the strategy framework.",
        "It would also act as a safeguard against persistent or pronounced overshooting.",
        "The phrase “underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at two per cent” made it clear that the target was headline inflation, not underlying inflation.",
        "Turning to proportionality considerations, the proposed revisions to the forward guidance on interest rates were generally assessed to be a proportionate response to the risks to the Governing Council’s price stability mandate.",
        "Experience with forward guidance suggested that it had been an effective tool for steering market expectations regarding interest rates, thereby helping to bring inflation closer to the Governing Council’s target.",
        "The proposed reformulation was also viewed as efficient compared with alternative policy options.",
        "While forward guidance could, in part, substitute for the use of other instruments that might have more pronounced side effects, it was remarked that a recalibration of the interest rate forward guidance could be erroneously perceived by market participants as necessarily implying a longer period of net asset purchases owing to the link between rate guidance and forward guidance on the asset purchase programme (APP).",
        "There was general agreement to defer the discussion on the APP forward guidance to a future meeting.",
        "The Governing Council continued to assess the benefits of negative policy rates as outweighing their costs, although the longer negative rates remained in place the greater the likelihood of the balance of risks shifting to the downside.",
        "Against this background, a large majority of members indicated that they could support the revised forward guidance proposal.",
        "The proposal was widely seen as providing a fine balance between greater emphasis on outcome-based elements in the forward guidance and a more flexible, forward-looking perspective.",
        "After the unanimous agreement on the new strategy, broad consensus on forward guidance was generally regarded as of great importance.",
        "At the same time, a few members upheld their reservations, as the amended formulation did not sufficiently address their concerns.",
        "These related in particular to the implied likelihood and persistence of overshooting, and being seen as promising to keep interest rates at their present or lower levels for a very long time period without an explicit escape clause.",
        "Turning to other elements of the stance assessment, members concurred with Mr Lane that incoming information had broadly confirmed the joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook carried out at the June monetary policy meeting.",
        "Accordingly, it was agreed to continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme in the third quarter at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year.",
        "On communication, it was regarded as important to explain that the forward guidance on interest rates reflected the new strategy and the need for persistent monetary policy measures in the face of the lower bound.",
        "The forward guidance underscored the Governing Council’s commitment to achieving its new inflation target and indicated that it would wait until it was confident about the path of inflation before raising the key policy rates.",
        "The guidance was not a rule but rather provided an indication to financial markets and the broader public so they could better align their inflation expectations with the Governing Council’s target.",
        "It was essential to emphasise that the forward guidance remained consistent with the medium-term orientation of monetary policy, which remained distinct from the projection horizon.",
        "In this regard, it was nonetheless seen as helpful to clarify the notion of “well ahead”, which could be specified as referring to the mid-point of the projection horizon for practical purposes.",
        "It was noted that only the forward guidance on interest rates had been adjusted, and that the forward guidance on asset purchases remained unchanged for the time being.",
        "The point was made that the Governing Council had already been reacting forcefully for some time to the challenges posed by the effective lower bound, using a range of instruments.",
        "Highlighting this could help to dispel any notions that the reformulation of the forward guidance was a novel or delayed reaction to the lower bound problem calling for imminent deployment of further policy measures.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the press release that would be published after the conclusion of the meeting.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting."

    "2020": [
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 9-10 September 2020.",
        "Financial markets had been driven by two opposing forces.",
        "On one side, reduced risks of a contested presidential election in the United States and expectations of a large fiscal stimulus programme under a potential Biden presidency had boosted risk sentiment and revived the reflation trade.",
        "On the other side, renewed lockdown measures in different countries on the back of a surge in new coronavirus (COVID-19) cases, especially in the euro area, were increasingly reflected in asset price valuations.",
        "Unlike in spring, however, so far there had been no widespread flight into safe-haven assets.",
        "Instead, euro area sovereign bond spreads had compressed further and corporate bond spreads had remained stable.",
        "Equity markets, where policy support was least direct, had experienced a marked correction.",
        "Risk premia in euro area equity markets had increased and were estimated to have pulled euro area stock prices down by nearly 10% since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, although this decline had been partly mitigated by a rise in short-term earnings growth expectations.",
        "In the United States, stock markets had increased by 5% since opinion polls started to point to a victory for the Democratic Party in the presidential election on 3 November 2020.",
        "Improved risk sentiment had also put renewed downward pressure on the US dollar, with positioning data pointing to risks of further US dollar depreciation.",
        "In bond markets, heightened expectations of fiscal stimulus in the United States had led to a notable steepening of the US Treasury curve, also reflecting rising inflation expectations.",
        "In the euro area, by contrast, inflation expectations had trended lower since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, thereby also putting downward pressure on yields.",
        "The euro area risk-free curve was close to its flattest ever level, while the euro area GDP-weighted sovereign yield curve had shifted down further since the September monetary policy meeting.",
        "The curve was now measurably below the pre-pandemic level and firmly in negative territory up to the ten-year maturity.",
        "There was not a single euro area country that was not benefiting from negative yields, in most cases extending out to the three-year maturity.",
        "The degree of accommodation currently embedded in euro area sovereign bond markets was practically unprecedented since the global financial crisis, both in its scale and its breadth across countries.",
        "The dispersion across euro area ten-year sovereign yields was at its pre-pandemic level, which itself had been far below the levels observed in previous years due to the substantial convergence in bond spreads in those countries that had been hit hardest by the sovereign debt crisis.",
        "Market participants had pointed to three main reasons to explain why the spreads had fallen further.",
        "The first reason related to risk sentiment.",
        "There had been a strong negative correlation between euro area sovereign spreads and US stock price developments in the weeks before the current meeting.",
        "The second reason related to expectations of further monetary policy support by the ECB.",
        "The third reason related to the first successful bond issuance under the European Commission’s temporary programme of Support to mitigate Unemployment Risk in an Emergency (SURE), which had met with unprecedented demand.",
        "This provided tangible evidence of how the common European response to the crisis had helped to alleviate pressure on euro area sovereign funding and hence financing conditions.",
        "Therefore, contrary to the early phase of the crisis, the joint fiscal and monetary policy responses in the euro area had succeeded in providing firm protection against the risks of fragmentation and of an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions.",
        "This was also clearly visible in corporate bond markets.",
        "In recent weeks, corporate credit spreads had largely resisted upward pressures despite a deteriorating growth outlook.",
        "The resilience in corporate bond markets likely also reflected the fact that firms had built up significant liquidity buffers over the past several months, limiting the extent to which they would have to rely on external credit in the event of a renewed collapse in business activity.",
        "At present, euro area firms’ cash coverage was nearly four times higher than at the height of the global financial crisis.",
        "Finally, growing excess liquidity was increasingly putting downward pressure on the term money market and commercial paper rates.",
        "Since early October 2020, the three-month EURIBOR had traded below the deposit facility rate, and corporates could issue three-month commercial paper at rates close to the deposit facility rate, providing an important liquidity backstop for corporates, with rates falling even faster at longer tenors.",
        "All in all, financial market conditions remained very favourable across market segments, but vulnerabilities remained in the face of the exceptionally high uncertainty surrounding the future evolution of the pandemic-related crisis.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, the global economy had come back rapidly early in the third quarter, after the end of the lockdowns.",
        "Developments in the global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), excluding the euro area, indicated that the recovery in activity was quite strong up to July but had flat-lined in September.",
        "Retail sales had recovered strongly around the world, while global consumer confidence had risen from its lowest level but still remained very weak.",
        "Turning to trade, high-frequency data pointed to a strong rebound in the third quarter of 2020 and early indications for the fourth quarter were also positive.",
        "Global financial conditions were broadly unchanged in both advanced and emerging economies.",
        "Oil prices had increased slightly, by 1.8%, since the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting, to stand at USD 39.8 per barrel on 26 October 2020, after trading in a narrow range.",
        "The euro had remained broadly stable against the US dollar (+0.4%), which continued to have a unique role in global trade, and in nominal effective terms (+0.2%) since the September meeting.",
        "Turning to the euro area, output had rebounded strongly in the third quarter of 2020.",
        "At the same time, clear risks to GDP growth had emerged for the fourth quarter of 2020, linked primarily to the latest news about the plans for more severe lockdowns from November onwards.",
        "The latest data supported the view that the recovery had been losing steam in the euro area.",
        "Industrial output had bounced back vigorously until August, when growth had decelerated to only 0.7% month on month.",
        "Retail sales had also softened in the summer months, and manufacturing and services PMIs for September and October suggested that the pace of recovery across the euro area had slowed.",
        "Looking ahead, the outlook for services was gloomy, while industry appeared more resilient.",
        "Household savings were expected to remain high, but income support remained important for consumer confidence over the coming months in order to protect the economy.",
        "The outlook for business investment was depressed by weak demand, low revenues and low profitability.",
        "Turning to euro area trade, exports and imports of goods had continued their recovery.",
        "Looking ahead, PMI new export orders signalled a continuation of the recovery in euro area goods exports, whereas the rebound in euro area services exports seemed to be fading, particularly in countries which relied heavily on tourism.",
        "With respect to euro area labour markets, employment was expected to contract further and a large share of jobs were at risk.",
        "The PMI composite employment index had recovered strongly since spring, but remained below 50 in October.",
        "Since the start of the pandemic, the weakening in employment conditions had been particularly marked in labour-intensive sectors such as accommodation, food, transportation and warehousing.",
        "The euro area unemployment rate, which had increased from 7.2% in February to 8.1% in August, likely underestimated the ongoing adjustment in the euro area labour market.",
        "Turning to nominal developments, HICP inflation fell to -0.3% in September, while HICP inflation excluding energy and food declined to a new low of 0.2% in September.",
        "The decrease in headline inflation, from -0.2% in August to -0.3% in September, reflected lower inflation not only for energy but also for non-energy industrial goods and services.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation were also weakening.",
        "Regarding wage growth, euro area compensation per employee growth and compensation per hour growth had diverged strongly due to large changes in hours worked.",
        "Negotiated wage growth, which was not directly affected by changes in hours worked, had declined only gradually, with the few wage agreements that had been concluded over recent months pointing to lower wage increases.",
        "Looking at survey-based longer-term inflation expectations, as reported in the latest ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), inflation expectations five years ahead had remained broadly stable at around 1.6%-1.7%.",
        "Since the September monetary policy meeting, market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations had halted their recovery and remained broadly stable around their pre-pandemic levels.",
        "The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead stood at 1.16% on 26 October 2020.",
        "As regards financial conditions in the euro area, the EONIA forward curve remained slightly inverted, but there were no firm expectations of an imminent rate cut.",
        "Longer-term risk-free rates remained broadly unchanged at low levels despite upward movements in US rates.",
        "Sovereign spreads had declined further amid expectations of additional monetary and fiscal support.",
        "Risk asset markets were largely unchanged despite significant intra-period fluctuations and, overall, euro area financial conditions remained broadly stable.",
        "Turning to money and credit, broad money (M3) growth remained buoyant, accelerating in September to 10.4% in annual terms.",
        "The strengthening of monetary dynamics since the start of the crisis had largely reflected precautionary motives.",
        "Domestic credit remained the main source of money creation.",
        "The pandemic had triggered a major increase in non-financial corporate debt ratios in relation to gross operating surplus, both in gross terms and net of liquid assets.",
        "The increase in the gross debt ratio reflected both an increase in debt levels and the steep fall in activity, while net debt in absolute terms had declined slightly as firms accumulated large amounts of liquid assets that offset the increase in gross debt.",
        "External finance had recorded steep increases since the onset of the crisis, driven by both bank lending and corporate bond issuance.",
        "Bank lending rates remained very favourable, close to their historical lows.",
        "Direct market finance had been hit by the acute market turmoil in the initial phase of the crisis but had subsequently benefited from the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).",
        "Policy support remained decisive for favourable credit conditions.",
        "A significant fraction of bank lending had been concentrated in those parts of the loan market that were benefiting from government guarantees, and the large and broad-based participation in the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), including the latest operation, had provided banks with significant funding cost relief.",
        "The October bank lending survey signalled a tightening of credit standards, primarily related to a deterioration in banks’ perceptions of the risks underlying the macroeconomic environment and borrowers’ creditworthiness.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, the fiscal stance was expansionary in 2020 and the latest fiscal plans for 2021 foresaw larger support than previously expected.",
        "Fiscal plans for 2022 remained very uncertain, but the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme could provide additional fiscal support for the economy.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane pointed out that, after a strong (albeit partial and uneven) rebound in economic activity over the summer months, the incoming data signalled that the euro area economic recovery was losing momentum relative to the previously projected recovery path.",
        "The rise in COVID-19 cases and the associated intensification of containment measures would restrict activity levels (especially in high-contact sectors), constituting a clear deterioration in the near-term outlook.",
        "High-frequency mobility indicators for transport, retail and recreation had started to weaken.",
        "Activity in the services sector was being hit the hardest, since it was most affected by the renewed restrictions on mobility and social interaction.",
        "Household consumption was expected to stay subdued, with the precautionary saving motive reinforced by the resurgence of the pandemic and its impact on employment and incomes.",
        "Weaker balance sheets and increased uncertainty about the economic outlook were weighing on business investment.",
        "Headline inflation had declined from -0.2% in August to -0.3% in September, with inflation excluding energy and food decreasing from 0.4% to an all-time low of 0.2%.",
        "In terms of categories, the decline was being driven by the extension of seasonal summer sales to non-summer items, a fall in travel-related prices and more negative energy inflation.",
        "While some of the factors weighing on inflation were likely to be transitory in nature, the persistence of weak demand implied more prolonged weakness in non-energy industrial goods inflation.",
        "Moreover, services inflation was expected to remain low, since the services sector was the most exposed to the ongoing intensification of containment measures.",
        "Accordingly, measures of underlying inflation were likely to remain subdued in the context of weak demand and significant slack in labour and product markets.",
        "Market-based indicators and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained broadly unchanged at low levels.",
        "On the basis of the downside inflation surprise and the current expected trajectory of energy prices, headline inflation would likely run below previous expectations and was currently expected to remain negative through early 2021, longer than in the September baseline projection.",
        "The pace of monthly loan flows to firms had recently moderated and the results from the bank lending survey pointed to deteriorating credit conditions.",
        "In particular, after muted reactions in the earlier stages of the pandemic, credit standards on loans to firms had tightened in the third quarter of 2020.",
        "While banks indicated that their funding and balance sheet conditions remained supportive, higher risk perceptions were weighing on loan creation.",
        "The surveyed banks also reported a fall in loan demand from firms in the third quarter, reflecting a decline in emergency liquidity needs and weakening corporate investment.",
        "Accordingly, the amplification of adverse real-financial feedback loops remained a material risk and needed to be closely monitored.",
        "The monetary policy measures taken in response to the pandemic had been effective and efficient in stabilising financial markets and supporting financing conditions for households and businesses.",
        "However, the incoming data pointed to a more severe slowdown in growth momentum and a weakening of underlying inflation dynamics compared with the previously expected recovery path.",
        "Furthermore, other near-term risk events were looming, including geopolitical risks.",
        "In the current environment, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook were clearly tilted to the downside.",
        "In the weeks to come, key information would be received.",
        "This included a new round of macroeconomic projections, which would allow a reassessment of the economic outlook and the balance of risks.",
        "Pending that information, Mr Lane proposed leaving the overall monetary policy stance unchanged and reconfirming the full set of existing monetary policy measures.",
        "At the same time, the Governing Council should clearly signal that on the basis of its updated assessment in December, it would recalibrate all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that financing conditions remained favourable to support the economic recovery and counteract the negative impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path, thereby fostering the convergence of inflation towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "In its communication, the Governing Council needed to: (a) stress that the incoming information signalled that the euro area economic recovery was losing momentum and that the rise in COVID-19 infections and the associated intensification of containment measures was weighing on economic activity, constituting a clear deterioration in the near-term outlook; (b) emphasise that measures of underlying inflation were declining and that inflation pressures were expected to remain subdued on account of weak demand, lower wage pressures and the past appreciation of the euro; (c) underline that in the current environment of risks clearly tilted to the downside, the Governing Council would carefully assess the incoming information, including the dynamics of the pandemic and developments in the euro exchange rate, and that the new round of Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections in December would allow a thorough reassessment of the economic outlook and the balance of risks; (d) highlight that on the basis of this updated assessment, the Governing Council would recalibrate its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that financing conditions remained favourable to support the economic recovery and counteract the negative impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path, thereby fostering the convergence of inflation towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry; and (e) emphasise that an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remained critical in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy and the reduction in private demand.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks for activity provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Incoming data and survey results signalled that the euro area economic recovery was losing momentum more rapidly than expected.",
        "Following a strong, but partial and uneven, rebound in the third quarter, the rise in COVID-19 cases and the associated intensification of containment measures was weighing on activity and constituted a clear deterioration in the near-term outlook.",
        "While activity in the manufacturing sector had continued to recover, activity in the services sector, which was most affected by the new restrictions on social activities and mobility, had been slowing visibly.",
        "Although fiscal policy measures were supporting households and firms, consumers were cautious in the light of the pandemic and its ramifications for employment and earnings.",
        "Moreover, weaker balance sheets and increased uncertainty about the economic outlook were weighing on business investment.",
        "Looking ahead, while the uncertainty related to the evolution of the pandemic was likely to dampen the strength of the recovery in the labour market and in consumption and investment, the euro area economy should continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions and an expansionary fiscal stance.",
        "As regards the external environment, members broadly shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Global activity had rebounded swiftly early in the third quarter and more strongly than expected.",
        "However, the momentum had slowed more recently and downside risks were related to increasing COVID-19 infection rates globally and to geopolitical factors.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting, the exchange rate of the euro had remained broadly stable both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms.",
        "Turning to euro area developments, members underlined that there had been both positive and negative news since the last monetary policy meeting.",
        "Euro area real GDP had contracted by 11.8%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2020.",
        "However, following the trough in April 2020, the euro area economy had rebounded strongly in the third quarter, likely more than had been expected in the September ECB staff projections, making up a large part of the contraction in the first half of the year.",
        "However, the strength of the rebound might also have reflected that countries had eased containment measures too much too soon.",
        "Rising COVID-19 infection rates were seen as undermining confidence again and leading to additional containment measures, generating a loss in growth momentum in the fourth quarter earlier and at a faster pace than had been foreseen.",
        "Reference was made to the level of the composite output PMI, which had fallen below 50, and to the fact that the PMI for new business had fallen back even more strongly.",
        "No data released so far had incorporated the recent announcements of further containment measures.",
        "As in March, the economic situation was once again changing rapidly.",
        "It could not be excluded that the euro area, or at least some countries, would experience a double-dip recession.",
        "The euro area economic outlook was seen to depend crucially on the effectiveness of administrative measures and the infection dynamics of the pandemic, with the magnitude and duration of a further downturn being very uncertain.",
        "It was noted that the restrictions being implemented now tended to be more targeted than in the spring, either at regions or at sectors, and could therefore have a more limited effect on activity than earlier in the year.",
        "It was also remarked that the rate of infections appeared to be more relevant for economic activity than the stringency of containment measures, which varied considerably.",
        "Nevertheless, it was clear that while some sectors – such as manufacturing and construction – would be less affected in the euro area than had been the case in the more general lockdowns earlier in the year, others – such as entertainment and leisure or tourism – would be heavily affected by the new restrictions.",
        "Members were of the view that in the period ahead containment measures could be expected to become more stringent and to last longer than previously anticipated.",
        "The winter months would be challenging in terms of limiting the spread of the virus and a sequence of temporary “circuit breaker” lockdowns might prove to be necessary.",
        "As a result, the growth trajectory could be bumpier than previously projected.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that the economy had rebounded very strongly after the lockdowns in the first wave of the pandemic and that a similar dynamic recovery might be expected in the future.",
        "However, it was unclear whether the liquidity buffers that firms and households had built up in recent months would prove to be sufficient to withstand a renewed deterioration in the economy in the period ahead.",
        "The emergence of the second wave of the pandemic could lead to more widespread business closures in a number of sectors, for example retail trade.",
        "Moreover, the point was made that governments might be more prudent in easing containment measures after the experience of the summer months.",
        "As a result, growth figures for 2021 as a whole could be adversely affected.",
        "Against this background, members argued that, looking ahead, it would be important to consider the possibility that the pandemic might have longer-lasting effects both on the demand side and on the supply side, reducing potential growth.",
        "Concerns were also expressed about the possibility of non-linear effects arising from financial amplification channels and about the impact of the pandemic on balance sheet positions of firms, households, banks and governments, particularly given the persistence of the crisis.",
        "Overall, it was emphasised that there was no clear trade-off between containment measures required to reduce the spread of the virus and the impact on the economy and it was recognised that, ultimately, concerns about the economy would remain until a vaccine or effective treatment became widely available, which could take some time.",
        "In this context, members emphasised the role of both national and European fiscal policy in cushioning the impact on the economy of necessary containment measures.",
        "In particular, it was regarded as positive news that additional fiscal stimulus was being announced at the same time as new measures to contain the spread of the virus.",
        "These new fiscal measures clearly went beyond those assumed in the September staff projections.",
        "Members exchanged views on the extent to which the latest developments were still broadly consistent with the baseline scenario in the September ECB staff projections, or whether revisions in the upcoming December Eurosystem staff projections were likely to result in the baseline being closer to the severe scenario included in the September projections.",
        "While the September baseline scenario had assumed some resurgence of the virus and the need for ongoing containment measures, recent developments were seen as constituting a clear downside risk to the projections.",
        "It was highlighted that uncertainty remained very high, as it had been throughout the year.",
        "However, by the time of the December monetary policy meeting, information would be available on major geopolitical developments – such as the result of the US presidential election and Brexit – as well as the initial evidence on the effectiveness of the new restrictions in containing the spread of the virus and their impact on the economy.",
        "Moreover, by that time, draft national budgetary plans and their assessment by the European Commission should also have become available, together with further indications on the prospective use of NGEU funds.",
        "Overall, members considered the risks surrounding the growth outlook to be clearly tilted to the downside.",
        "This assessment largely reflected the recent resurgence in COVID-19 infections, the associated intensification of containment measures and the high uncertainty surrounding the timeline of the pandemic and the implications for economic and financial conditions.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remained critical in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy.",
        "While fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should, as much as possible, be targeted and temporary in nature, weak demand from firms and households and the heightened risk of a delayed recovery warranted continued support from national fiscal policies.",
        "The three safety nets endorsed by the European Council for workers, businesses and sovereigns provided important funding support in this context.",
        "The key role of the NGEU package was stressed, as well as the importance of it becoming operational without delay.",
        "Provided that the funds were deployed for productive public spending and accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural reforms, the NGEU programme would contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery and would thereby enhance resilience and the growth potential of EU Member States’ economies, supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area.",
        "Such structural policies were particularly important in addressing long-standing structural and institutional weaknesses and in accelerating the green and digital transitions.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Euro area annual HICP inflation had decreased to -0.3% in September 2020, from -0.2% in August, reflecting developments in the prices of energy, non-energy industrial goods and services.",
        "On the basis of oil price dynamics and taking into account the temporary reduction in German VAT, headline inflation was likely to remain negative until early 2021.",
        "Moreover, near-term price pressures would remain subdued owing to weak demand, notably in the tourism and travel-related sectors, as well as to lower wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro.",
        "Once the impact of the pandemic faded, a recovery in demand, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, would put upward pressure on inflation over the medium term.",
        "Market-based indicators and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained broadly unchanged at low levels.",
        "It was observed that headline inflation was now expected to be in negative territory for longer than had been foreseen in the September ECB staff projections.",
        "Moreover, it was highlighted that HICP inflation excluding energy and food had fallen to a new low of 0.2% in September, owing to lower non-energy industrial goods and services inflation.",
        "At the same time, there had also been a reduction in inflation in other items in the price index, which was considered a cause for concern.",
        "It was pointed out that 35% of all items were currently posting negative growth rates and underlying price pressures were also weak, raising concerns over a lasting impact.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined in this context that it was important to stress the temporary nature of the current inflation dynamics, partly owing to special factors such as exceptional patterns in seasonal sales and temporary tax reductions.",
        "Moreover, account should also be taken of changes in the consumption basket, which implied that inflation might actually be slightly higher than reported.",
        "The impact of the latest developments in growth and inflation on the medium-term outlook for inflation would have to be carefully evaluated in the December projections.",
        "However, the view was expressed that the probability that inflation rates would be closer to the severe scenario included in the September staff projections was increasing, even if no additional negative surprises were to materialise.",
        "Regarding recent developments in inflation expectations, members noted that longer-term inflation expectations reported in the ECB’s SPF were stable at 1.7%, while market-based indicators of inflation expectations had declined slightly, with the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead standing at 1.16%.",
        "It was pointed out that the SPF survey round for the fourth quarter of 2020 had been conducted at the beginning of October, before the resurgence of the pandemic and the widespread re-introduction of containment measures, and the results therefore needed to be treated with caution.",
        "It was considered important to ensure that the protracted period of lower inflation in the short run did not lead to lower medium and long-term inflation expectations.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction that broad money (M3) growth continued to reflect domestic credit creation and the ongoing asset purchases by the Eurosystem.",
        "While monthly flows in loans to non-financial corporations had moderated in recent months amid a decline in emergency liquidity needs and subdued investment, bank lending to the private sector continued to be supported by government guarantees and monetary policy, particularly TLTRO III, which provided banks with sizeable funding cost relief.",
        "Bank lending rates continued to stand near historical lows.",
        "TLTRO III was seen to provide continuous support to bank lending, as evidenced by the higher than expected take-up in the latest operation.",
        "The results of the euro area bank lending survey signalled a tightening of credit standards in the third quarter of 2020, mainly on account of the deterioration in banks’ perceptions of the risks to the macroeconomic environment and borrowers’ creditworthiness.",
        "According to the survey, banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation had not contributed to the tightening, underscoring the positive impact of monetary policy support on bank funding conditions.",
        "Looking ahead, banks reported that they expected a considerable net tightening of credit standards also in the fourth quarter of 2020.",
        "It was remarked, however, that the results of the bank lending survey should not be over-interpreted or overstated in view of the very substantial credit easing observed in the second quarter, underpinned by state-guaranteed lending.",
        "Moreover, further fiscal and supervisory policy support might be forthcoming in the fourth quarter.",
        "The point was made that heightened uncertainty surrounding the second wave of the pandemic and the associated containment measures could pose renewed risks to the transmission of monetary policy through the banking sector, which required close monitoring.",
        "Financial vulnerabilities in the corporate sector, in particular, could have negative ramifications for banks’ balance sheets and give rise to adverse real-financial feedback loops.",
        "Against this backdrop, concerns were expressed about a likely increase in non-performing loans and a heterogeneous impact of the pandemic on the banking sector across countries.",
        "It was noted that recent equity price developments suggested that markets might have started pricing in the adverse impact on the banking system of the resurgence in COVID-19 infections, as evidenced by the underperformance of financial sector share prices.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that low profitability in the banking sector and the erosion of net interest margins presented ongoing challenges for euro area banks.",
        "The view was expressed that fiscal initiatives to address non-performing loans and ensure an adequately capitalised banking sector should be encouraged, while monetary policy was playing its part in supporting favourable financing conditions and ample liquidity in the banking sector.",
        "With regard to financial conditions, members widely shared the assessments provided by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane in their introductions.",
        "It was noted that euro area financial markets had been relatively calm, with financial conditions – including exchange rate developments – being broadly stable and financing conditions for banks, households and firms remaining very favourable.",
        "The relatively muted reaction of markets to the second wave of the pandemic was seen as evidence of the effectiveness of the ECB’s monetary policy measures in containing tail risks, including the risk of market fragmentation.",
        "At the same time, markets were seen to remain fragile and could face a correction in pricing – for example in the event of a no-deal Brexit, a further worsening of the pandemic or if an agreement on the disbursement of funds under the NGEU plan was delayed.",
        "At the current juncture, members viewed the monetary policy stance as highly accommodative and appropriate.",
        "It was stressed that monetary policy had to aim to preserve favourable financing conditions in the future in order to support economic activity.",
        "Against this backdrop, members supported the proposal by Mr Lane to leave the overall monetary policy stance unchanged and to reconfirm the full set of existing monetary policy instruments.",
        "Furthermore, members widely agreed that, given the sharper slowdown in growth momentum and the weakening of underlying inflation dynamics compared with what had previously been expected, as well as the deterioration in the balance of risks, it would be warranted to recalibrate the monetary policy instruments in December.",
        "It was noted that taking monetary policy decisions in December would be consistent with prevailing market expectations.",
        "However, it was also stressed that the Governing Council was in a position to act at any time, if needed.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that more than half of the PEPP envelope was still available to conduct ongoing purchases in a flexible manner in case of renewed market turbulence.",
        "By the time of the December meeting, updated staff projections would be available and a clearer picture of the dynamics of the pandemic and prospects of a vaccine might have emerged, together with more information on the fiscal policy responses in the euro area.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy measures taken since early March, members widely agreed that they were helping to preserve favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions across the euro area, thereby providing crucial support to underpin economic activity and to safeguard medium-term price stability.",
        "The TLTROs were seen to be providing funding to banks at favourable rates and contributing to low interest rates for bank lending, and had so far successfully averted a credit crunch.",
        "The PEPP was proving successful in stabilising market conditions and reducing fragmentation, as well as easing the monetary policy stance.",
        "It was remarked that the flexibility embedded in the PEPP was essential to its continued success.",
        "While the existing monetary policy instruments were viewed as effective, questions were raised about possible non-linearities, side effects and “diminishing returns” in an environment of high uncertainty and very favourable financial conditions.",
        "With markets having stabilised since the introduction of the pandemic-related monetary policy measures in March, it was noted that additional asset purchases might not have the same impact on financial conditions and real economic activity as they had had earlier in the year.",
        "It was emphasised that, in the present environment, monetary policy in part operated by facilitating fiscal expansion through keeping financing costs affordable, and both policy domains were working “hand in hand”.",
        "It also had to be acknowledged, however, that an accommodative monetary policy stance could create the temptation for governments to enter into commitments that were difficult to undo and thereby increase expenditure beyond what was necessary to deal with the pandemic, exacerbating structural deficits and damaging the long-term sustainability of public finances.",
        "As regards communication, members widely agreed with the proposals made by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The Governing Council needed to signal that it stood ready to act with all the flexibility that was embodied in its pandemic emergency monetary policy tools, while also stressing its determination to act and signalling its willingness to adjust all instruments, if needed.",
        "It was stressed that any sign of complacency – even inadvertent – could be detrimental in the present circumstances.",
        "While there was wide agreement on the need to signal the necessity of recalibrating the ECB’s monetary policy instruments at the December monetary policy meeting, it was cautioned that the Governing Council should not pre-commit itself to specific policy actions.",
        "In its communication the Governing Council needed to highlight that the downside risks to the baseline scenario of the September projections had clearly increased, shifting the balance of risks further downwards, and that the Governing Council was carefully evaluating the worsening of the pandemic and the associated intensification of government containment measures with regard to their implications for the near-term outlook.",
        "Therefore, there was broad agreement that the Governing Council should communicate that, on the basis of this updated assessment, it would recalibrate its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that financing conditions remained favourable to support the economic recovery, counteracting the negative impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path and thereby fostering the convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "Finally, there was broad agreement among members to emphasise that an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remained critical and was the most effective policy in the current situation to deal with the effects of the pandemic and the associated containment measures.",
        "In its communication the Governing Council should strongly welcome the NGEU package and encourage the EU institutions to approve this package swiftly in order to activate it in a timely manner to support the regions and sectors hardest hit by the pandemic.",
        "In this context, it could be emphasised that monetary policy was removing obstacles to the expansion of fiscal policy by supporting favourable financing conditions and the proper functioning of financial markets.",
        "In this way fiscal and monetary policy reinforced each other in the current circumstances, with monetary policy increasing its own effectiveness by empowering fiscal policy and fostering confidence.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, who ascertained that the decisions and proposed communication were supported by all members, the Governing Council took the following monetary policy decisions: The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 23-24 October 2019, there had been signs of increased optimism among market participants.",
        "Global bond yields had remained at some distance above the very low levels that had been observed towards the end of summer 2019.",
        "Global stock prices were at, or close to, historical highs.",
        "All in all, financial market participants were less pessimistic and were pricing in less additional accommodation by central banks than earlier in the year.",
        "Global sovereign bond markets had been much quieter over the previous few weeks than they had been prior to the 23-24 October monetary policy meeting, when prospects of a breakthrough in the trade negotiations between the United States and China had pushed up ten-year US Treasury and German government bond yields.",
        "Since then, yields had moved broadly sideways, with German ten-year sovereign bond yields oscillating at around -30 basis points.",
        "There were likely two main reasons why yields had not continued on an upward trajectory.",
        "First, the outlook remained less favourable than at the start of 2019 and there was still no breakthrough in the resolution of the two major risk factors currently facing the global economy, i.e.",
        "the imposition of tariffs and Brexit.",
        "Second, monetary policy easing by major central banks, including the ECB, had put persistent downward pressure on yields.",
        "Since September 2019 expectations of a further easing of monetary policy in the euro area had undergone a reversal, which had affected the entire forward interest rate curve.",
        "There were currently only limited expectations of a further cut in the ECB’s deposit facility rate over the following 12 months.",
        "At the same time, the prospect of a tightening had also remained far out in the future, with a first full 10 basis point hike not priced in until the end of 2022.",
        "Mr Cœuré also provided an update on the progress and impact of the two-tier system of reserve remuneration.",
        "The share of banks’ unused allowances had dropped sharply after the implementation of the Governing Council’s decision on the two-tier system.",
        "Many banks had been fast to make full use of their allowances, in part through cross-border borrowing in money markets, which was also reflected in trading volumes.",
        "The impact on unsecured short-term money market rates, such as the €STR, had been very limited.",
        "The occasional spikes in €STR volatility were attributed to other factors unrelated to the two-tier system.",
        "At the same time, there had been a notable initial increase in repurchase agreement market rates in some jurisdictions in response to the launch of the tiering system, but it had not been persistent.",
        "Global equity prices had increased measurably as the prospects of a breakthrough in trade negotiations had improved.",
        "The EURO STOXX50 index had gone up by 2% since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 23-24 October 2019 and the S&P 500 by almost 5%, hitting a new all-time high.",
        "At first sight, stock and bond market developments seemed to be somewhat out of sync.",
        "However, stock markets were currently being driven by short-term factors, including the recent drop in risk aversion, while earnings expectations suggested that both stock and bond market investors remained very cautious about the medium-term growth and inflation outlook.",
        "The near-term global outlook had possibly been supported by the substantial easing of financial conditions in some emerging markets on the back of a reversal in portfolio flows.",
        "Since the start of 2019, investors had resumed channelling funds into emerging bond markets despite the ongoing trade tensions and broader uncertainty in financial markets.",
        "The effective exchange rate of the euro had also continued to move broadly sideways, reflecting, among other things, very limited movements against the US dollar.",
        "The notable exception to these broadly stable exchange rate developments was the pound sterling, which had risen by 9% since mid-August 2019, when the risk of a no-deal Brexit had peaked.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, the pace of global activity had remained subdued.",
        "The projected annual growth rate of global activity excluding the euro area stood at 2.9% in 2019, its lowest level since 2008-09.",
        "Nonetheless there were signs of a stabilisation in the outlook for global GDP.",
        "Compared with the September 2019 ECB staff projections, growth in global activity had been revised down though, reflecting less dynamic activity in some emerging markets.",
        "News regarding trade growth had been mixed, while uncertainty remained elevated.",
        "In some emerging economies there were tentative signs that growth was stabilising, thanks in part to fiscal support.",
        "However, this reflected domestic activity in particular and did not necessarily imply an upward revision to imports.",
        "Risks to global trade hence also remained on the downside.",
        "Global financial conditions had eased moderately since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting in October.",
        "In particular, global equity prices had continued to rise on account of improved risk sentiment, amid a retrenchment of safe-haven flows.",
        "Oil prices had increased by 10.7% since the October meeting on the back of tighter oil supply following the OPEC+ extension of production cuts.",
        "The euro had depreciated somewhat both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms.",
        "Turning to the euro area, in the December 2019 Eurosystem staff projections, real GDP growth was almost unrevised compared with the September 2019 ECB staff projections: real GDP was expected to increase by 1.1% in 2020, 1.4% in 2021 and 1.4% in 2022.",
        "The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remained tilted to the downside but had become somewhat less pronounced.",
        "While the growth outlook remained muted in the near term, a moderate recovery was expected later on, reflecting the assumption of some dissipation of global headwinds, which would allow the fundamentals supporting growth to regain traction.",
        "Since the last Governing Council meeting, economic news, as perceived by market participants, had become less negative.",
        "Overall, business surveys since mid-September suggested a stabilisation in output growth at moderate rates.",
        "The weakness in the manufacturing sector continued, although the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) on euro area manufacturing output, which had been in contraction territory since February 2019, recorded a slight rebound to 47.4 in November 2019.",
        "At the same time, spillovers to the rest of the economy remained contained.",
        "Economic sentiment in the services sector, albeit declining, remained slightly above its long-run average, while construction, retail trade and consumer confidence continued to stand clearly above their 1999-2019 averages.",
        "Private consumption continued to be supported by higher labour income, which remained the main driver of real disposable income.",
        "Looking ahead, real disposable income and private consumption growth were expected to remain solid, albeit declining somewhat on account of weakening employment dynamics.",
        "At the same time, some near-term moderation in housing investment was suggested by a range of indicators, including residential investment, construction confidence and building construction production.",
        "Business investment growth was expected to weaken further in the near term, given the fall in industrial production and the rise in uncertainty about manufacturing activity, which was contributing to investment being postponed.",
        "As regards developments in euro area labour markets, sectoral indicators pointed to a further moderation in labour market conditions, largely driven by the manufacturing sector.",
        "National accounts data for the third quarter showed that employment growth had declined to 0.1% (in quarter-on-quarter terms), from 0.2% in the second quarter of 2019 and from 0.3% in the first.",
        "The PMI on employment had edged up in November to 51.8, remaining in contractionary territory for manufacturing and in expansionary territory for services and construction.",
        "National accounts statistics confirmed persistent weakness in euro area exports of goods and services in the third quarter of 2019.",
        "Extra-euro area exports of goods had been stable as the negative contribution from Asia was offset by the positive contribution from the United States, while intra-euro area trade had proved weaker, especially in intermediate goods.",
        "Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation had increased from 0.7% in October to 1.0% in November, mainly reflecting higher services and food price inflation.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food had increased from 1.1% in October to 1.3% in November.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation remained generally subdued, although there were some indications of a mild increase, which was in line with previous projections.",
        "In the December 2019 Eurosystem staff projections, HICP inflation was projected to be 1.1% in 2020, 1.4% in 2021 and 1.6% in 2022, reaching 1.7% at the end of the projection horizon.",
        "Projections for headline inflation as well as for HICP inflation excluding food and energy were broadly unrevised.",
        "This reflected the interplay between, on the one hand, upward pressures from a weaker exchange rate and higher oil prices, and, on the other hand, weaker global prices and staff taking a cautious view on domestic price dynamics.",
        "In addition, certain indicators of underlying inflation had also been heavily affected by statistical effects in package holiday prices in the euro area’s largest economy.",
        "Some indicators that excluded this component suggested a very gradual but notable upward slope in the path of underlying inflation over recent years.",
        "At the same time, other measures showed a less convincing upward trajectory.",
        "Moreover, as HICP inflation only partially reflected changes in housing-related costs inflation measures would likely be higher currently if the cost of owner-occupied housing was accounted for.",
        "Wage growth remained resilient but stronger labour cost pressures had been largely absorbed by profit margins.",
        "Annual growth in compensation per employee declined to 2.1% in the third quarter of 2019, down from 2.2% in the second quarter and 2.3% in the first, although it remained close to its long-term average (2.1%) and substantially above its low of 1.1% in the second quarter of 2016.",
        "At the same time, profit margin growth, following its significant weakening in 2018 on account of the slowdown in economic activity, had started to recover tentatively but remained negative in the third quarter of 2019.",
        "The recent slowdown in foreign and domestic demand had particularly affected activity in the industrial sector, where unit profit growth was highly correlated with the business cycle, and less so services activity, for which the correlation tended to be somewhat lower.",
        "Average point estimates for longer-term inflation expectations in the Survey of Professional Forecasters had declined in each quarter of 2019 and stood at 1.67% in the fourth quarter of the year, down from 1.88% in the final quarter of 2018.",
        "Euro area market-based indicators of medium to longer-term inflation expectations had remained at low levels.",
        "Like other indicators, the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, currently at 1.24%, continued to hover somewhat above the all-time low (of 1.12%) reached in early October 2019.",
        "Turning to euro area financial conditions, the EONIA forward curve had shifted up further since the Governing Council’s October monetary policy meeting, reflecting generally favourable risk sentiment owing to promising trade talks between the United States and China and a tentative stabilisation of the macroeconomic outlook.",
        "The forward curve now showed only a slight inversion, with its trough slightly above -0.5%.",
        "As term premia were now estimated to be close to zero – up from previously negative levels – “genuine” policy expectations had shifted by less than the forward curve suggested.",
        "At the same time, the estimated impact of the asset purchase programme (APP) on the compression of term premia in ten-year sovereign bonds remained sizeable.",
        "Euro area equity prices had increased further for non-financial corporations since the October monetary policy meeting, while they remained largely unchanged for financial corporations.",
        "According to a dividend discount model, the increase in euro area non-financial equity prices was mainly driven by declines in the equity risk premium on the back of a perceived improvement in global risk sentiment.",
        "This was dampened by the ongoing decline in longer-term earnings expectations, which, however, showed some signs of stabilisation.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, the annual growth rate of broad money (M3) stood at 5.6% in October.",
        "This was almost entirely driven by annual M1 growth, with the decreasing opportunity cost of holding monetary assets being the main factor supporting robust broad money growth.",
        "From a counterpart perspective, credit to the private sector accounted for only about half of broad money creation, while net external monetary flows accounted for the other half.",
        "Lending volumes continued to grow at a solid pace.",
        "The annual growth of bank loans to non-financial corporations was slightly below 4% in October, while that in credit to households reached 3.5% in October, with some differences across countries.",
        "The ECB’s monetary policy measures continued to be passed through to bank lending rates.",
        "At the euro area level, the composite lending rate for non-financial corporations stabilised at 1.56% in October, while the cost of borrowing for households for house purchase stood at the historical low of 1.44%.",
        "While a large part of banks’ deposit funding, in particular retail deposits, remained floored at zero, the distribution of deposit rates to non-financial corporations continued to shift into negative territory in October 2019.",
        "At the same time, margin pressure was offset by the favourable developments in bank bond yields, despite recent increases.",
        "Moreover, while the net interest income earned by banks for each unit of their assets had been compressed, robust growth in intermediation volumes meant that the base for income generation was expanding.",
        "In addition, the two-tier reserve system was expected to reduce the cost for banks of holding excess liquidity.",
        "The euro area fiscal stance was assessed as being expansionary over 2019-21, which would provide some support to demand conditions, and broadly neutral in 2022.",
        "The composition of fiscal expansion was tilted towards direct tax cuts and higher transfers.",
        "At the euro area level, the reduction in interest payments was estimated to offset around half of the budget effect of fiscal loosening.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane remarked that incoming data since the last monetary policy meeting pointed to continued weak but stabilising euro area growth dynamics.",
        "The ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of persistent global uncertainties in combination with sector-specific domestic factors continued to weigh on the euro area manufacturing sector and was dampening investment.",
        "Private consumption remained resilient amid rising wages and favourable – albeit moderating – labour market developments.",
        "The December staff projections foresaw an increase in real GDP growth from 1.1% in 2020 (which was a slight downward revision) to 1.4% in both 2021 and 2022.",
        "Although risks to the growth outlook remained tilted to the downside due to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, these risks had become somewhat less pronounced.",
        "Bank lending conditions for firms and households had continued to improve, in a sign of continuing strong pass-through of monetary policy.",
        "In addition, equity prices had increased in line with improved market sentiment and the euro exchange rate had depreciated somewhat.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation remained generally subdued, although there were some indications of a mild increase, which was in line with previous projections.",
        "Indicators of both market-based and survey-based inflation expectations had remained at or near historical lows.",
        "Solid and broad-based wage growth was expected to continue, and the profile of a gradual pick-up in inflation remained largely unchanged compared with the September 2019 ECB staff projections.",
        "The December 2019 Eurosystem staff projections foresaw inflation increasing from an average of 1.2% in 2019 to an average of 1.6% in 2022, reaching 1.7% at the end of the projection horizon.",
        "Overall, the Governing Council was still faced with an inflation outlook that was below its medium-term aim, and inflation expectations continued to stand at low levels.",
        "Significant action had been taken to support the rise of inflation towards the medium-term aim.",
        "The Governing Council would, therefore, closely monitor inflation developments and the impact of the unfolding monetary policy measures on the economy.",
        "Its strengthened forward guidance would ensure that financial conditions adjusted in line with changes to the inflation outlook.",
        "Against this background, Mr Lane proposed to keep the monetary policy stance unchanged at today’s meeting.",
        "This would entail reiterating the forward guidance on policy interest rates, net asset purchases and reinvestments.",
        "At the same time, in its communication the Governing Council needed to stress that it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards the aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, Governing Council members broadly agreed with the assessment of the outlook for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Incoming information since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting in October pointed to continued weak euro area growth dynamics, although there were some signs of stabilisation.",
        "The ongoing weakness of international trade amid persistent global uncertainties continued to weigh on the euro area manufacturing sector and was dampening investment growth.",
        "At the same time, the services and construction sectors had remained resilient, despite some recent moderation, with employment growth and increasing wages continuing to underpin the euro area economy.",
        "This outlook was broadly reflected in the December 2019 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "The outlook for real GDP growth had been revised down slightly for 2020 compared with the September 2019 ECB staff projections.",
        "Regarding the outlook for the external environment, it was noted that the global outlook remained weak, with a further downward revision to the outlook for both global growth and trade in the December 2019 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "This was illustrated by the fact that the latest projections now foresaw growth in global trade excluding the euro area of below 1% in 2020, compared with an increase of over 2% in the September 2019 ECB staff projections.",
        "Members assessed the risks to the external environment as having remained on the downside overall, due to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, with reference being made to the persistence of uncertainties related to trade tensions and to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.",
        "At the same time, it was suggested that sentiment in the United States seemed to have become more upbeat recently following indications that trade tensions between the United States and China were diminishing.",
        "Positive developments in financial markets perhaps reflected the view that an escalation of trade disputes in the coming year had become less likely.",
        "However, it was also argued that the global geopolitical situation was not conducive to lowering uncertainty, at least in the short term, with reference also being made to developments at the World Trade Organisation that could impair its functioning for some time.",
        "Concern about the risks to trade was also linked to the very complex nature of global supply chains.",
        "It was emphasised that policies to rebuild confidence and reduce uncertainty were needed in relation to geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, members broadly agreed that recent economic data and survey information, while remaining weak overall, had also contained some more positive signs, pointing to a stabilisation in euro area growth.",
        "Real GDP growth had been confirmed to have increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2019 – unchanged from the previous quarter.",
        "In the euro area’s largest economy and in the euro area as a whole, real activity had been stronger than expected in the third quarter.",
        "In addition to some positive developments in recent survey data, the Citigroup surprise index was trending upwards and had been close to achieving positive values in recent weeks, while according to various models estimates of the probability of recession had declined significantly.",
        "With regard to the risk of adverse spillovers from the ongoing weakness in manufacturing to sentiment and activity in other sectors of the economy, there appeared to be tentative indications that industrial production might bottom out before these spillovers became more generalised.",
        "At the same time, even though services sector activity had so far been resilient, it was argued that there was a need to remain cautious given the risk of spillovers across countries.",
        "In discussing the December 2019 Eurosystem staff projections, it was highlighted that this was the first projection exercise for some time in which there had not been a significant downward revision to the euro area growth outlook.",
        "These projections could be interpreted as confirming the narrative contained in the previous projection exercise and increasing the Governing Council’s confidence in the baseline.",
        "At the same time, it was acknowledged that the downward revision to foreign demand over the projection horizon had been offset by the prospect of stronger domestic demand, which had benefited from the additional monetary policy accommodation introduced in September as well as some extra fiscal stimulus.",
        "It was emphasised that the comprehensive package of policy measures that the Governing Council had decided in September was supporting the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and thus the robust convergence of inflation to its medium-term aim.",
        "However, it was also stressed that in order to reap the full benefits from the ECB’s monetary policy measures, other policy areas needed to contribute decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential, supporting aggregate demand at the current juncture and reducing vulnerabilities.",
        "The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, were assessed as remaining tilted to the downside, but having become somewhat less pronounced.",
        "Regarding fiscal policy, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance in 2020 was seen as providing some support to economic activity.",
        "However, in view of the weak economic outlook, members welcomed the Eurogroup’s call for differentiated fiscal responses and its readiness to coordinate.",
        "It was emphasised that governments with fiscal space should be ready to act in an effective and timely manner, while governments in countries where public debt was high needed to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targets.",
        "This would create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely.",
        "Also all countries should redouble their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation had been 1.0% in November 2019, compared with 0.7% in October, mainly reflecting higher services and food price inflation.",
        "On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation was likely to rise somewhat in the coming months.",
        "Although measures of underlying inflation had generally remained muted, there were indications of a mild increase in line with previous expectations.",
        "While labour cost pressures had strengthened due to tighter labour markets, the weaker growth momentum was delaying their pass-through to inflation.",
        "Over the medium term inflation was expected to increase, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and solid wage growth.",
        "This assessment was also broadly reflected in the December 2019 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Compared with the September 2019 ECB staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised up slightly for 2020 and down slightly for 2021, mainly driven by the expected future path of energy prices.",
        "In discussing the inflation outlook in the December 2019 Eurosystem staff projections, members acknowledged the absence of major revisions and considered that the latest projections provided broad confirmation of the path for inflation in the previous projections exercise.",
        "It was noted that, excluding volatile package holiday prices in the euro area’s largest economy, there had been a solid upward movement in underlying inflation, supported by high capacity utilisation levels, rising energy commodity prices and tight labour markets.",
        "It was also observed that staff had adopted a more cautious approach to developments in profit margins over the projection horizon, which were now assumed to recover more gradually, while the impact of the ECB’s monetary policy measures on growth and inflation contained in the December 2019 staff projections was seen as being rather conservative compared with a range of estimates from different models.",
        "Members also noted, however, that even though the latest inflation projections had not been revised down further, there had previously been substantial downward revisions to the inflation outlook over the past year.",
        "HICP inflation in 2021 was expected to be only 1.4% in the current projection exercise compared with 1.8% in the December 2018 staff projections.",
        "Moreover, the comment was made that previous forecast errors for inflation were not fully explained by domestic and international factors and it was suggested that further efforts should be made to try to better understand the reasons behind the unexplained weakness in inflation.",
        "Regarding the impact of the cost of owner-occupied housing on inflation measures it was pointed out that while the effect of including this factor was generally procyclical and increased the volatility of inflation, it could also help to explain the perception of higher inflation in some countries where housing market developments had been relatively strong.",
        "There was also some discussion about how climate-related policies, including the European Commission’s Green Deal package, should be taken into account in the projection exercises, with members contending that there was a need to step up efforts to understand the economic consequences of climate change.",
        "It was highlighted that while policies designed to mitigate the impact of climate change could be expected to have an impact on growth and inflation in the coming years, the implications for the projections would need to be analysed carefully.",
        "In particular, it was argued that while such policies could be considered a negative supply shock, the response to climate change could also lead to significantly higher investment, while the impact on oil and energy prices was uncertain.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, members noted that while market-based measures of longer-term expectations had stabilised, the ECB’s September monetary policy measures had not yet had any visible positive effect, with longer-term inflation expectations continuing to stand at historically low levels and clearly below the ECB’s inflation aim.",
        "In terms of market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead currently stood at 1.24%, while in terms of survey-based measures, longer-term inflation expectations stood at 1.7% for the fourth quarter of 2019 in the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF).",
        "However, it was pointed out that most of the gap between survey-based and market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations disappeared when adjusting for estimates of liquidity and risk premia, and that the risk of deflation was low.",
        "Moreover, a remark was made that the point estimates provided by SPF participants were still at levels consistent with the Governing Council’s inflation aim and that, according to most available indicators, the degree to which longer-term inflation expectations were anchored had remained unchanged recently.",
        "At the same time, the previous declines in many of the indicators suggested close monitoring was warranted.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members broadly shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction that money and credit developments remained robust overall.",
        "The sustained rates of broad money growth reflected ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3.",
        "Continued robust growth of money was also seen as evidence for the ongoing transmission of monetary policy, given that the monetary aggregates had continued to expand despite the pause in net asset purchases between the beginning of the year and their resumption on 1 November.",
        "The solid growth of loans to firms and households had benefited from the continued improvement in bank lending conditions, which was seen as a sign of the ongoing pass-through of the accommodative monetary policy stance to the borrowing conditions for the real economy.",
        "The accommodative monetary policy stance was seen as safeguarding very favourable bank lending conditions and as continuing to support access to financing across all economic sectors.",
        "The bank lending channel of monetary policy was seen to be functioning well, as also evidenced by the euro area bank lending survey and the continued translation of favourable market funding conditions into easier borrowing conditions for firms and households.",
        "At the same time, some cross-country heterogeneity in the pass-through to lending rates was visible, as competitive pressures in the banking industry differed across countries.",
        "Similarly, it was noted that the extent to which banks were passing on the ECB’s monetary policy to bank deposit rates varied considerably.",
        "This was seen to be due to differences in legal frameworks, market practices, funding needs and competitive pressures across the banking systems of euro area countries.",
        "Moreover, the potential financial stability implications of the current monetary policy environment were seen to merit close monitoring.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "The incoming data since the last Governing Council meeting in late October pointed to continued weakness in euro area growth dynamics, although there were some initial signs of stabilisation in the growth slowdown.",
        "Inflation developments had remained subdued overall, although there were some indications of a slight increase in measures of underlying inflation in line with previous expectations.",
        "Members expressed confidence that the monetary policy measures would provide the necessary monetary stimulus to support the stabilisation of economic growth – compensating to a large degree for the negative impulse from global factors – and the recovery of inflation towards the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "The September monetary policy measures had contributed to an overall substantial easing in financial conditions, preserving much of the easing that had occurred via anticipation effects since the summer.",
        "Perceptions of receding uncertainties, mainly related to the trade dispute between the United States and China, had led to some upward movement in risk-free interest rates and yields in the corporate and sovereign bond markets since the October monetary policy meeting.",
        "The more positive market sentiment had also supported equity prices and the euro had depreciated somewhat.",
        "The point was made that the upward adjustment in the yield curve observed since September showed that markets were responding to changes in the data, outlook and risks, in line with the Governing Council’s state-dependent forward guidance.",
        "This ran counter to perceptions of circularity between market expectations and the ECB's policy decisions.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that real interest rates remained at very low levels across the entire maturity spectrum, which was seen as confirmation of the effectiveness of the ECB’s policy measures in underpinning very favourable financing conditions.",
        "The continued pass-through of the monetary accommodation to improving loan dynamics and lower bank lending rates was also underlined.",
        "This was providing support to firms and households for financing consumption and investment.",
        "It was remarked that the introduction of the two-tier system for reserve remuneration had proceeded very smoothly and had worked as intended.",
        "It had relieved banks from part of their costs of holding excess liquidity, while at the same time preserving money market rates at low levels.",
        "It had also encouraged additional borrowing and lending activity in the money market, including cross-border trades, which had led to a more homogenous distribution of liquidity across countries, as also evidenced in the decline in TARGET2 balances.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the tiering-induced cross-border trading had been almost entirely based on secured money market transactions, while unsecured transactions had remained largely domestic.",
        "This suggested that the euro area money market continued to display some degree of fragmentation.",
        "While it appeared that the take-up in the operation under way as part of the new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) would turn out to be somewhat lower than expected, it was seen as contributing to preserving favourable bank lending conditions.",
        "This lower take-up was attributed to banks’ desire to minimise exposures towards the year-end and the better distribution of liquidity through money markets as a result of the tiering system for reserve remuneration.",
        "It was cautioned that the take-up in the present operation should not be over-interpreted, but be assessed together with the take-up in future operations, and that the overall success of TLTRO III should only be judged at the end of the programme.",
        "Against this background, members widely agreed with the proposal by Mr Lane to keep the monetary policy stance unchanged, with a steady hand being warranted for monetary policy.",
        "This would entail reiterating the Governing Council’s forward guidance on policy interest rates, net asset purchases and reinvestments of principal payments.",
        "The present monetary policy stimulus appeared fully appropriate, lending substantial support to growth and inflation developments.",
        "While vigilance on the efficacy of the policy measures and the appropriateness of the monetary policy stance was called for, it was highlighted that the measures should be given time to exert their full impact on the euro area economy.",
        "Faced with a subdued inflation outlook, which was largely unchanged from September, members reiterated the need for a highly accommodative monetary policy stance for a prolonged period of time.",
        "Projected inflation was generally seen to remain some distance from the Governing Council’s inflation aim, while market-based measures of inflation expectations had stagnated at historically low levels and downside risks to the growth outlook continued to prevail, despite having become somewhat less pronounced.",
        "In this environment, monetary policy needed to remain highly expansionary.",
        "Members highlighted the crucial role of the Governing Council’s forward guidance in providing monetary accommodation, with the strengthened state-based forward guidance decided at the September monetary policy meeting being seen as providing a degree of “automatic stabilisation” in response to changes in macroeconomic conditions.",
        "Tying the likely path of policy interest rates more clearly to inflation prospects ensured that financial conditions would adjust in accordance with the evolving state of the economy and the outlook for inflation.",
        "Looking ahead, there was broad agreement on the need to carefully monitor the incoming data and the evolution of risks, while continuing to evaluate the pass-through of the September policy measures.",
        "In any case, it remained vital for the Governing Council to be prepared to act by adjusting all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards the aim in a sustained manner, in line with the Governing Council’s commitment to symmetry.",
        "At the same time, some members highlighted the need to be attentive to the possible side effects of the present monetary policy measures, which merited close monitoring in the period ahead.",
        "It was suggested that the liquidity created by the Eurosystem needed to be tracked carefully regarding its impact on bank intermediation and asset markets – namely equities, housing and real estate – as well as capital outflows outside Europe in a search for yield.",
        "Some concern was also voiced with regard to the potential impact of negative interest rates on euro area households, with savings and consumption dynamics also requiring close monitoring.",
        "Nonetheless, confidence was expressed that policy rates had not yet reached the so-called reversal rate.",
        "Thus far there was ample evidence that credit conditions in the euro area had continued to improve, with rising credit volumes and declining borrowing rates for firms and households providing support to their consumption and investment plans.",
        "Moreover, while the negative interest rate environment was dampening banks’ net interest income, the overall effects on bank profitability had remained positive.",
        "This related in particular to capital gains from banks’ sales of securities to the Eurosystem and lower provisions for loan impairment, with the overall macroeconomic environment having improved in part as a consequence of the accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that macroprudential policies were the first line of defence for addressing risks and side effects, as they could be tailored to the issues identified.",
        "To some extent, the implementation of monetary policy could also be adjusted to reduce unwanted side effects, with the introduction of the two-tier system for excess reserve remuneration being seen as a case in point.",
        "On communication, members broadly agreed with the proposals put forward by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "It needed to be emphasised that overall the incoming data remained weak, but had signalled some stabilisation of the euro area economy.",
        "It had to be pointed out that risks remained tilted to the downside, although they had become somewhat less pronounced.",
        "With regard to monetary policy, the need for patience and perseverance needed to be stressed.",
        "On the one hand, it needed to be highlighted that the measures decided in September had been effective and were reaching the economy, although more time was needed for their full effects on economic outcomes to unfold.",
        "On the other hand, it needed to be emphasised that the baseline scenario for growth and inflation continued to be predicated on a highly accommodative monetary policy stance for a prolonged period of time.",
        "Therefore, steady handed communication was needed in order to preserve the very favourable financial conditions to support a robust convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Likewise, it was felt that the Governing Council needed to reiterate its commitment to achieving its inflation aim.",
        "In this regard, the important role of the Governing Council’s state-dependent forward guidance needed to be highlighted, as it might not have been fully appreciated by market participants and ECB observers.",
        "It needed to be stressed that the forward guidance formulation – by tightly linking the likely future path of policy rates to an inflation outlook that was sufficiently close to, but below, 2%, as well as a consistent rise in observed underlying inflation – ensured that financial conditions would adjust in accordance with changes to the inflation outlook.",
        "At the same time, it was seen as important to stress that the Governing Council was attentive to potential side effects of its monetary policy measures.",
        "While the present monetary policy configuration was fully appropriate, it needed to be emphasised that the analysis and monitoring of side effects was part and parcel of the Governing Council’s ongoing monetary policy assessment.",
        "Furthermore, it was necessary to reiterate that other policymakers needed to contribute more decisively to supporting the euro area economy, contributing to further stabilisation and building confidence, as well as alleviating uncertainties relating to trade and geopolitical tensions that were holding back a more dynamic expansion of the economy.",
        "In particular, fiscal policy, notably that of governments with fiscal space, had to play a more prominent role in stabilising economic conditions in view of the weakened economic outlook.",
        "In this context, the Governing Council welcomed the Eurogroup’s recent call for differentiated fiscal responses and its readiness to coordinate.",
        "Finally, it was also suggested that some broad guidance be communicated about the forthcoming strategy review, including the likely timeline, although it was generally seen as advisable to refrain from public discussions on the strategy prior to the envisaged launch of the review by the Governing Council early in 2020.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it saw the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence had been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.",
        "On 1 November net purchases had been restarted under the Governing Council’s asset purchase programme (APP) at a monthly pace of €20 billion.",
        "The Governing Council expected them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it started raising the key ECB interest rates.",
        "The Governing Council intended to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "The period since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 11-12 December 2019 had been marked by three major events: the year-end, the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, and the signing of the “phase-one” trade agreement between the United States and China.",
        "The trade agreement appeared to be the most significant, as it had helped consolidate the general improvement in market sentiment that had gained momentum in early September 2019.",
        "Expectations that monetary policy would remain highly accommodative, both in the United States and in the euro area, further supported the improved market sentiment.",
        "The year-end, as usual, had been characterised by thin liquidity in money markets due to reporting and regulatory obligations.",
        "The turn of this year, however, had been the smoothest since 2016.",
        "Repo rates had remained mostly concentrated around levels prevailing before the turn of the year.",
        "Use of the Eurosystem’s securities lending facilities had also increased only slightly over the year-end.",
        "In the US money market, the Federal Reserve’s injections of additional liquidity had mitigated any potential year-end tensions.",
        "The new year had started with geopolitical tensions escalating in the Middle East.",
        "However, financial markets had proved rather resilient, which could be explained by a number of factors.",
        "One had been the attempt by the authorities to quickly de-escalate the situation through their rhetoric.",
        "A second factor had been the prevailing high level of oil inventories in OECD countries.",
        "Combined with a global economy much less reliant on oil than in the past, this cushioned the expected impact of supply-side disruptions on the oil price.",
        "A third factor might have been the general underlying improvement in market sentiment.",
        "This improved sentiment had been visible in global bond markets since early September 2019, following indications that a phase-one trade deal between the United States and China was within reach.",
        "Since September 2019, yields on 10-year German benchmark government bonds had increased by around 50 basis points.",
        "In addition, the spread vis-à-vis the 10-year US Treasury benchmark had narrowed by some 30 basis points.",
        "Some insight into the reversal in the US-euro area interest rate differential could be derived from the breakdown of bond yields into the short-term rate expectations component and the term premia component.",
        "In both the United States and the euro area, yields were currently well below their end-2018 levels, but for different reasons.",
        "In the euro area, the expected interest rate path during 2019 had been adjusted downwards much less than in the United States, and had also partly reversed as sentiment had brightened in recent months.",
        "However, the decline in term premia had proven much more persistent in the euro area.",
        "This might partly be linked to the resumption of net asset purchases by the ECB, which had removed additional duration risk from the market.",
        "In addition, the decline in term premia might be related to the reduced uncertainty around the outlook for short-term interest rates.",
        "The overnight index swap forward curve suggested that the markets currently expected the ECB to stay on hold for at least the next two years.",
        "These expectations were broadly consistent with the subdued inflation outlook priced in by markets.",
        "Turning to corporate and government bond issuances, the combination of improved market sentiment and continued monetary accommodation had likely fostered investor demand.",
        "In the private sector, strong issuance of corporate bonds had been observed for the year to date.",
        "For public issuers, investor demand for long-maturity government bond issuances, such as those of Italy or Spain, had been exceptionally high in January.",
        "Prospects for continued monetary policy accommodation and improved market sentiment likely also supported equity valuations.",
        "The S&P 500 and the EURO STOXX 600 were up by around 5% and 4%, respectively, since 12 December 2019.",
        "Many equity indices were at, or close to, their historical highs.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, global activity and trade had remained subdued.",
        "There were some signs of a stabilisation, and even a slight pick-up, in the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data, with the turnaround being most visible in the manufacturing PMI.",
        "Overall, the PMIs had signalled a stabilisation in global activity at modest growth rates in the fourth quarter of the year, with signs of improvement within the last quarter.",
        "Global trade had recovered in the third quarter of 2019 and, more recently, trade uncertainty had declined based on the trade deal between the United States and China.",
        "On the whole however, global trade had remained subdued, dampened by a still high level of trade tensions and weak Asian demand.",
        "Turning to global financial conditions, market sentiment towards risky assets had remained positive.",
        "Global equity prices had continued to increase, especially in the United States.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s December monetary policy meeting, oil prices had decreased by around 1% and the euro had remained broadly stable against the US dollar, although it had depreciated slightly in nominal effective terms.",
        "Turning to the euro area, GDP growth had stood at 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2019, according to Eurostat’s third estimate.",
        "In the fourth quarter, business indicators had provided some signs of a stabilisation, with the composite output PMI and the Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator starting to increase.",
        "In particular, the results of forward-looking manufacturing surveys appeared to have stabilised.",
        "Incoming data since the last Governing Council meeting pointed to continued positive but modest GDP growth.",
        "The demand components of private consumption had continued to be supported by robust income developments.",
        "This had reflected the overall resilience of the labour market.",
        "Most importantly, solid growth in compensation of employees had continued.",
        "Moreover, fiscal policies – mainly in the form of lower taxes or higher transfers – had also started to contribute positively to developments in disposable income.",
        "In addition, terms of trade developments – driven by energy prices in particular – had supported annual growth in disposable income over the course of 2019.",
        "However, business investment dynamics remained weak and had been slowing since early 2019.",
        "The latest sectoral indicators suggested business investment would remain subdued in the short term.",
        "Extra-euro area exports of goods had increased in the last four months, although displaying some Brexit-related volatility.",
        "Looking at developments in euro area labour markets, euro area employment had continued to rise in the third quarter but had increased only slightly, consistent with the slowdown in economic growth.",
        "The euro area unemployment rate had stood at 7.5% in November, essentially unchanged since August.",
        "Euro area annual HICP inflation had increased to 1.3% in December, reflecting mainly higher energy inflation, but it remained considerably below the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food was unchanged at 1.3%, with services inflation continuing to be substantially stronger than non-energy industrial goods inflation.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation had remained generally muted, although there were further signs of a gradual increase in line with previous expectations.",
        "HICP sub-components with a relatively high domestic content had become more prominent drivers of underlying inflation over recent years.",
        "Wage growth continued to be solid.",
        "Annual growth in compensation per employee was 2.2% in the third quarter of 2019, unchanged from the second quarter of 2019, and broadly in line with its long-term average of 2.1%.",
        "Furthermore, wage growth had remained broad-based across sectors.",
        "According to the latest Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), HICP inflation expectations were 1.2%, 1.4% and 1.5% for 2020, 2021 and 2022 respectively.",
        "Following four successive rounds of downward revisions, SPF respondents had kept their inflation forecasts essentially unchanged, with longer-term inflation expectations standing at 1.7%.",
        "Market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area had recovered somewhat since the Governing Council’s last monetary policy meeting, but remained at subdued levels, with the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead standing at just above 1.3%.",
        "Turning to euro area financial conditions, long-term risk-free rates had changed little since the December Governing Council meeting, as was the case for the EONIA forward curve, with the short end of the curve remaining almost flat.",
        "Euro area equity prices for both financial and non-financial corporations had continued to increase since the December meeting.",
        "Lower discount rates, on the back of accommodative monetary policy, had played an important role in supporting euro area equity prices in 2019, counteracting the drag from a decline in longer-term earnings expectations.",
        "Financing conditions for euro area non-financial corporations remained very favourable and had remained broadly unchanged since the December meeting.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, the annual growth rate of M3 had remained robust in November, at 5.6%, almost entirely driven by annual M1 growth.",
        "Portfolio considerations linked to low opportunity costs of holding M3 were the main economic factor supporting robust broad money growth.",
        "From a counterpart perspective, credit to the private sector was contributing about half of broad money creation, while net external monetary flows accounted for the other half.",
        "The pass-through of monetary accommodation to euro area bank lending rates had been continuing, although lending rates had stabilised in November, standing slightly above historical lows.",
        "This likely reflected earlier movements in market rates.",
        "Since February 2019 interest rates on loans to the private sector had been on a declining trend.",
        "Growth in loans to households and firms remained solid.",
        "While the annual growth rate of loans to households had remained unchanged from October to November, at 3.5%, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations had moderated to 3.4%, from 3.8%, likely reflecting some lagged reaction to the past weakening in the economy.",
        "According to the January 2020 bank lending survey, credit standards for loans to enterprises remained broadly unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2019.",
        "A continued tightening contribution from risk perceptions consistent with subdued economic activity in the euro area was counterbalanced by an easing impact from competitive pressures.",
        "The survey had also indicated a weakening in demand for loans to firms, in line with the slowdown in economic activity observed since 2018.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance was assessed to be mildly expansionary for 2019-21.",
        "The fiscal stimulus consisted mainly of direct tax cuts and increases in transfers and was expected to contribute positively to disposable income growth in 2019-21.",
        "This provided a tailwind for private consumption for the first time since 2010.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane remarked that financial conditions had remained accommodative, supported by receding trade tensions and the unfolding effects of the September policy package.",
        "Bank lending conditions for firms and households continued to be favourable, indicating an ongoing pass-through of favourable market funding conditions.",
        "Incoming economic data confirmed the Governing Council’s previous assessment of ongoing but moderate growth, with slightly more positive signals from forward-looking indicators.",
        "Some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade was receding but the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook – relating to geopolitical factors, protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets – remained skewed to the downside.",
        "HICP inflation dynamics and developments in underlying inflation remained subdued overall.",
        "Market and survey-based indicators of inflation expectations continued to signal the risk of a prolonged period of low inflation.",
        "However, wage growth was resilient and broad-based, even though the pass-through to inflation continued to be slow.",
        "In addition, there were tentative signs of a gradual pick-up in underlying inflation.",
        "Overall, despite some positive signals for future growth and inflation, the outlook for price developments remained below the Governing Council’s medium-term aim and risks to the outlook were still elevated.",
        "However, financial conditions remained favourable and could rely on the automatic stabilisation function embedded in the forward guidance to accommodate any short-term volatility in the outlook.",
        "Considering the tentative signals of a stabilisation in the euro area economy, the Governing Council would await further data to see if there were firmer grounds for optimism.",
        "On the basis of this assessment, Mr Lane proposed keeping the monetary policy stance unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "This would entail reiterating the forward guidance on policy rates, net asset purchases and reinvestments of principal payments.",
        "In addition, in its public communication, the Governing Council should continue to highlight that it remained ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards the aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "On the economic analysis, the members of the Governing Council generally shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Incoming information since the Governing Council’s December monetary policy meeting was considered to be in line with the baseline scenario of ongoing, but moderate, growth in the euro area economy in the December 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "In particular, the weakness in the manufacturing sector remained a drag on euro area growth momentum.",
        "However, ongoing, albeit decelerating, employment growth and robust wage growth continued to support the resilience of the euro area economy.",
        "In considering the outlook and risks for the external environment, members noted that although global activity and trade were still subdued, there were some indications, as also reflected in recent survey data, of a stabilisation and even a possible pick-up in activity.",
        "Attention was drawn to the January 2020 update of the IMF’s World Economic Outlook, which foresaw growth in global activity slightly above the December 2019 staff projections and stronger growth in 2020 compared with 2019.",
        "Moreover, reference was made to the IMF’s assessment that temporary factors behind the slowdown in global manufacturing, such as the adjustment in the automobile sector to new emission standards and the lull in the launch of new tech products, had appeared to fade.",
        "Members also agreed that some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade was receding, although the risks to the external environment relating to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets continued to be tilted to the downside.",
        "In discussing the risks to the external environment, members took note of the recent phase-one trade deal between the United States and China, which appeared to have increased confidence and had been received positively by financial markets.",
        "This, together with greater clarity on the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU following the UK general election in December, had contributed to a decline in international risks – although there was still substantial uncertainty.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that the tariffs imposed by both China and the United States had largely been left in place and that the trade deal could have adverse consequences for euro area exports as a result of trade diversion.",
        "In addition, unresolved issues remained between the United States and the EU as regards trade and there was evidence that firms were affected by uncertainty, including about the impact of potential tariffs on the automobile sector.",
        "Moreover, although it was now clear that the United Kingdom would be leaving the EU at the end of January 2020, their future trade relationship still had to be agreed and there could be more divergence in this relationship than previously expected.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, members broadly agreed that incoming economic data and survey information pointed to some stabilisation in euro area growth dynamics.",
        "Near-term growth was expected to be similar to rates observed in the previous quarters, thus broadly in line with the December 2019 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Real GDP had increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2019, following growth of 0.2% in the previous quarter.",
        "This pattern of moderate growth reflected the ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of continued global uncertainties, which had particularly affected the euro area manufacturing sector and had also dampened investment growth.",
        "At the same time, the services and construction sectors remained more resilient, despite some moderation in the second half of 2019.",
        "Nowcasting models, which took recent data releases into account, pointed to a stabilisation in growth at low rates, below estimates of potential growth.",
        "The EuroCOIN indicator had remained unchanged in December, as the impact of the positive stock market performance had been offset by persistent pessimism among firms in the manufacturing sector.",
        "It was remarked that the increase in the stock market did not seem to be related to an improvement in earnings expectations.",
        "As also appeared to be the case in the United States, this pointed to a possible disconnect between buoyant financial markets and the continued subdued outlook for the real economy.",
        "The risk of adverse spillovers from the continued weakness in the manufacturing sector to other sectors of the economy still needed to be monitored closely.",
        "It was noted that so far activity in the services sector had been quite resilient – supported by domestic demand, and underpinned by favourable financial conditions related to the ECB’s September 2019 monetary policy package as well as expansionary fiscal policy.",
        "However, while there might have been a bottoming-out in manufacturing, it was too soon to conclude that the slowdown in growth in the services sector had stopped, as spillovers to services could emerge with a lag and the sector’s current resilience might not last.",
        "The point was made that the stabilisation in euro area growth was mainly driven by household consumption, while external demand and corporate investment remained subdued.",
        "Weak investment suggested that there was little prospect of a sustained increase in growth potential and productivity.",
        "The slowdown in employment growth was highlighted.",
        "In the euro area’s largest economy this slower employment growth could be considered a normal feature of a maturing business cycle amid emerging supply bottlenecks, but other countries were not in a situation of full employment.",
        "While euro area unemployment, at 7.5%, was around pre-crisis levels, it had been flat for some time and there was considerable heterogeneity in the level of unemployment across countries.",
        "More positively, reference was made to developments in a number of euro area indicators, including the improvement in forward-looking expectations components of business surveys and the rise in the Citigroup surprise indicator.",
        "It was felt to be important to acknowledge these positive signs and care should be taken to avoid being too slow to change the risk assessment.",
        "It was noted that the automobile sector remained a concern and that there were also deeper structural factors affecting this industry that needed to be monitored closely.",
        "However, some caution was also expressed about becoming too optimistic.",
        "It was noted that although the manufacturing PMI had improved, it was still at a level which signalled a contraction in activity.",
        "In particular, the automobile sector and industrial production were still declining in the euro area’s largest economy, which would affect other countries, in part via value chain linkages.",
        "Moreover, the improvement in the Citigroup surprise indicator was mainly related to confidence indicators, while the real economy remained weak and the improvement in hard data had been negligible.",
        "The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, remained tilted to the downside, but had become less pronounced as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade had receded.",
        "The euro area fiscal stance was expected to provide some support to economic activity.",
        "In view of the weak economic outlook, the Governing Council welcomed the Eurogroup’s call in December for differentiated fiscal responses and its readiness to coordinate.",
        "Governments with fiscal space should stand ready to act in an effective and timely manner, while in countries where public debt was high governments needed to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targets, which would create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely.",
        "All countries should intensify their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances.",
        "On price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "According to Eurostat, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.3% in December 2019, after 1.0% in November, mainly reflecting higher energy price inflation.",
        "On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation was likely to hover around current levels in the coming months.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation had remained generally muted, although there were further indications of a moderate increase in line with previous expectations.",
        "While indicators of inflation expectations remained at low levels, recently they had either stabilised or ticked up slightly.",
        "Labour cost pressures had strengthened amid tighter labour markets, but the weaker growth momentum was delaying their pass-through to inflation.",
        "Over the medium term inflation was expected to increase, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and solid wage growth.",
        "In discussing recent inflation developments, members were encouraged by the fact that headline and underlying inflation had recently evolved in line with the December staff projections and by the evidence of a continued gradual upward trend in some indicators of underlying inflation.",
        "HICP inflation excluding food and energy was at its highest level for four years, although it was still slightly below its pre-crisis average.",
        "It was remarked that this level had been reached even without housing costs fully represented in the inflation measures.",
        "While goods prices were being dampened by global factors and weak demand, services prices were gradually increasing, linked to the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "On developments in other inflation measures, it was noted that the GDP deflator was also increasing.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that the level of underlying inflation remained muted, even though the likelihood of a general upward trend in inflation dynamics had increased.",
        "Members agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction that wage growth remained resilient and was broad-based, against the background of solid labour market developments.",
        "The observed upward movement in inflation had increased confidence that, with wages and salaries having grown by over 2.5% in the third quarter of 2019 and above their long-term average, recent wage dynamics would pass through to inflation over time.",
        "However, it was felt that there was a need to continue to investigate the pass-through of wages to inflation, and developments in profit margins.",
        "On longer-term inflation expectations, members noted that although the indicators had either stabilised or ticked up recently, they continued to stand at low levels.",
        "Market-based inflation expectations, as measured by the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, currently stood at 1.3%.",
        "Meanwhile, in terms of survey-based measures, in the SPF for the first quarter of 2020 longer-term inflation expectations were unchanged at 1.7%.",
        "It was recalled that there were important issues related to the measurement of inflation expectations and that most of the gap between survey-based and market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations could be accounted for by estimates of risk and liquidity premia.",
        "It was also pointed out that the risk of deflation had declined further.",
        "However, it was suggested that the low level of inflation expectations indicated that most investors expected inflation to remain below the ECB’s aim for some time to come.",
        "Reference was made to survey evidence from the European Commission highlighting a strong correlation between households’ inflation perceptions and measured HICP inflation.",
        "Mention was also made of some analysis showing that short-term inflation expectations were heavily influenced by actual inflation and, in turn, affected longer-term inflation expectations.",
        "The concern was also expressed that the recent slight increase in market-based measures of inflation expectations might be related to higher oil prices and might therefore not be sustained.",
        "On the monetary analysis, members broadly shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction, that overall money and credit developments remained robust.",
        "The annual rate of M3 growth stood at 5.6% in November 2019, broadly unchanged since August.",
        "The growth of loans to firms and households remained solid, benefiting from very low bank lending rates and the ongoing support provided by a highly accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In November although the annual growth rate of loans to households had remained unchanged, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations had moderated, likely reflecting some lagged reaction to the past weakening in the economy.",
        "These developments were also visible in the results of the euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2020.",
        "Demand for loans to firms had weakened for the first time since 2013 and rejection rates were increasing, which could indicate a further decline in credit growth in the months ahead.",
        "It was cautioned, however, that the bank lending survey reported banks’ estimates of demand, not actual credit growth, which had remained buoyant in some countries.",
        "Moreover, credit standards for both loans to firms and loans to households for house purchase had remained broadly unchanged, pointing to still favourable credit supply conditions.",
        "On the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Financial conditions had remained very accommodative overall.",
        "All components of financial conditions indices had loosened over the course of 2019, namely short-term and long-term interest rates, exchange rates and equity prices.",
        "The monetary policy measures decided at the Governing Council’s September meeting were seen to have lowered term premia and contributed to the overall substantial easing in financial conditions.",
        "Market sentiment had turned positive and risk appetite among market participants seemed strong.",
        "Uncertainties were perceived as receding, mainly due to reduced US-China trade tensions and the recent stabilisation in the economic outlook.",
        "This had led to some upward movement in risk-free interest rates, with no further cuts currently being priced into the forward curve.",
        "The accommodative monetary policy stance continued to safeguard very favourable bank lending conditions, supporting household investment demand, consumers’ expectations about their financial situation, and consumer confidence.",
        "Members saw indications that the Governing Council’s September package was being gradually transmitted to the economy.",
        "They expressed confidence in the capacity of the monetary policy measures to provide the necessary monetary stimulus to support the euro area expansion and the gradual build-up of domestic price pressures.",
        "On the two-tier system for reserve remuneration, it was remarked that the implementation of the tiering had worked well.",
        "Banks’ access to the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) was highlighted as an additional measure that was helping preserve favourable bank lending conditions.",
        "The accommodative monetary policy stance had benefited the economy by contributing to the resilience of domestic demand, in particular in the services sector, whereas manufacturing continued to suffer from weak global demand.",
        "Notably, investment was being held back by international uncertainty despite the low cost of borrowing.",
        "It was also recalled, however, that the interest rate elasticity of investment had always been low and that a lack of correlation between borrowing costs and investment demand did not mean that monetary policy was ineffective.",
        "Members agreed that monetary policy had to remain highly accommodative for a prolonged period of time.",
        "Inflation was still far away from the Governing Council’s objective and a robust convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s aim was not yet assured, notwithstanding a slight uptick in underlying inflation.",
        "The current monetary policy configuration was seen as appropriate and sufficient to support underlying inflation pressures and developments in headline inflation over the medium term.",
        "The point was made that the recent absence of any large projection errors for core inflation should support the Governing Council’s confidence in the robust convergence of inflation to its medium-term aim.",
        "While market-based measures of inflation expectations had increased slightly, also on the back of the accommodative monetary policy stance, it was argued that risks of an unanchoring of longer-term inflation expectations remained.",
        "Against this background, all members agreed with the proposal by Mr Lane to keep the monetary policy stance unchanged.",
        "This entailed reiterating the Governing Council’s forward guidance on policy interest rates, net asset purchases and reinvestments of principal payments.",
        "A highly accommodative monetary policy stance for a prolonged period of time was seen as necessary to sustain the euro area expansion, the build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the robust convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s medium-term aim.",
        "It was pointed out that the measures taken in September should be given time to exert their full impact on the euro area economy.",
        "In this context, members highlighted the essential role of the Governing Council’s state-dependent forward guidance in providing monetary accommodation.",
        "It needed to be stressed that the forward guidance formulation – by tightly linking the expected future path of policy rates to an inflation outlook that was sufficiently close to, but below, 2% as well as a consistent rise in observed underlying inflation – ensured that financial conditions adjusted in accordance with changes in the inflation outlook.",
        "In addition, tying the likely path of policy interest rates to inflation prospects ensured that financial conditions would not tighten prematurely purely on the back of an improving growth outlook.",
        "At the same time, the need to continue evaluating the pass-through of the September policy decisions was highlighted, also in the light of the potential side effects of the present monetary policy stimulus.",
        "Financial stability-related risks needed to be monitored closely, as potential side effects might become more pronounced in an environment with low rates and a flat yield curve persisting for a long time.",
        "In this context, it was noted that a shift from bank-based to market-based finance, in combination with investors’ search for yield, could lead to increased risk-taking.",
        "Reference was made to equity markets, where the continued rise in valuations was difficult to square with a weaker earnings outlook on both sides of the Atlantic, subdued profit margins and pervasive uncertainty.",
        "A remark was also made that higher housing prices could lead to fragilities in the financial system which might be insufficiently addressed by macroprudential policies.",
        "On communication, members broadly agreed with the proposals put forward by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "It needed to be emphasised that a prolonged accommodative monetary policy stance was required, that monetary policy transmission was effective and that the Governing Council was confident that the substantial monetary policy stimulus would pass through to inflation.",
        "It was pointed out that risks remained tilted to the downside, although they had become less pronounced as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade was receding.",
        "Although a more positive assessment of risks could foster confidence in the upswing and further support positive economic developments, it was cautioned that a more optimistic outlook for the economy needed to be communicated carefully in order not to give rise to a premature tightening of financial conditions.",
        "As regards the Governing Council’s forward guidance, it needed to be emphasised that it was tied to the inflation outlook and therefore an accommodative stance would be maintained until the Governing Council had seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within the projection horizon, and such convergence had been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.",
        "At the same time, it was felt that the Governing Council needed to reiterate its commitment to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "Following members’ preliminary considerations at the December 2019 meeting, the Governing Council decided to launch a review of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy.",
        "Since the last strategy review in 2003 the euro area and global economies had been undergoing profound structural changes.",
        "Declining trend growth, on the back of slowing productivity and an ageing population, as well as the legacy of the financial crisis, had driven interest rates down.",
        "This had reduced the scope for the ECB and other central banks to ease monetary policy using conventional instruments in the face of adverse cyclical developments.",
        "In addition, addressing low inflation was different from the historical challenge of addressing high inflation.",
        "The threat to environmental sustainability, rapid digitalisation, globalisation and evolving financial structures had further transformed the environment in which monetary policy operated, including the dynamics of inflation.",
        "It was emphasised that the discussion on the strategy was to be kept separate from the ongoing monetary policy deliberations and should not be perceived as constraining the Governing Council in its readiness to act by adjusting all of its instruments, as appropriate.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it had seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence had been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.",
        "The Governing Council would continue to make net purchases under its asset purchase programme (APP) at a monthly pace of €20 billion.",
        "The Governing Council expected them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it started raising the key ECB interest rates.",
        "The Governing Council intended to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "The Governing Council furthermore decided to launch a review of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy, approving the related press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the financial market developments since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 29-30 April 2020.",
        "Three key conclusions could be drawn on the basis of recent market developments.",
        "First, the ECB’s monetary policy measures, together with the Franco-German recovery fund proposal which was subsequently broadly taken up in the package proposed by the European Commission, had reduced downside tail risks for the euro area.",
        "A drop in coronavirus (COVID-19) infection numbers and further large fiscal stimulus measures in other advanced economies had added to the improved sentiment.",
        "Second, the broad-based decline in risk premia on the back of these developments had offset the tightening impact of a deterioration in macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "While developments in euro area financial markets had, until recently, been broadly consistent with the prospect of a swift economic recovery, expectations were gradually being revised downwards.",
        "Third, and as a consequence, the latest easing of financial conditions in the euro area in part hinged on the contribution of fiscal and monetary policy to mitigating fragmentation risks across markets and jurisdictions.",
        "The ECB’s composite indicator of systemic stress was consistent with these broad conclusions.",
        "It showed that systemic stress across a range of financial markets had continued to steadily recede, although it remained at an elevated level compared with the period before the coronavirus pandemic in both the euro area and the United States.",
        "Global volatility too had abated across various market segments, in part owing to the effective liquidity backstop provided by central banks worldwide.",
        "In this environment, overall funding conditions in euro area sovereign bond markets had eased further, as reflected in a downward shift of the euro area GDP-weighted sovereign yield curve, which remained, however, above its pre-crisis level.",
        "Empirical evidence suggested that monetary policy had contributed significantly to the fall in bond yields since the announcement of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).",
        "The PEPP was offsetting upward pressure on bond yields that resulted from the crisis-induced increase in the free float ratio, i.e.",
        "the share of bonds held by price-sensitive investors relative to total bond supply.",
        "Prevailing market segmentation implied that monetary policy needed to act in a more targeted and flexible way to preserve policy transmission across the entire euro area.",
        "Fiscal developments, and in particular the news relating to a more ambitious European fiscal response to the crisis, had reinforced the effectiveness of the ECB’s measures.",
        "As a result, fiscal and monetary policy in the euro area were starting to act as complements, thereby effectively containing tail risks.",
        "Downward pressure on sovereign bond yields had also contributed to easing funding conditions in euro area corporate bond markets, although they too remained relatively tight compared with the pre-pandemic period.",
        "The exceptionally high pace of gross issuance in the investment grade corporate bond market had not decelerated, highlighting the continued high financing needs of companies, even as lockdown measures were gradually being eased.",
        "The ECB’s monetary policy was providing considerable support to corporate credit markets, including the commercial paper market, helping firms manage their cash flow needs.",
        "Financial investment grade commercial paper rates had come down notably in recent weeks from their peaks, while non-financial commercial paper rates had stabilised.",
        "The ECB’s presence in the commercial paper market had helped firms reduce rollover risks, which in turn had also contributed to an increase in the issuance of longer-dated paper.",
        "Improvements on the debt funding side for firms had been accompanied by improvements in equity markets.",
        "All the major global indices had posted substantial gains since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, further offsetting a large part of the losses recorded at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.",
        "The decline since the beginning of 2020 was still highest in the euro area, but the Euro Stoxx index had more recently been outperforming other markets following the Franco-German recovery fund proposal.",
        "Since its announcement on 18 May 2020, the Euro Stoxx index had risen by 13%, compared with 8% for the S&P 500 index, mainly reflecting a further decline in the equity risk premium.",
        "This easing had, however, been partially offset by deteriorating medium to long-term earnings growth expectations, consistent with a shift in expectations towards a more protracted impact of the crisis.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "The external environment was characterised by a sharp downturn in global activity and trade, which implied a reduction in foreign demand for the euro area.",
        "Incoming data confirmed that the global economy had fallen into an unprecedented recession in the first half of the year.",
        "The global (excluding the euro area) composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had extended the losses registered in the first quarter, declining to a historical low in April before recovering somewhat in May.",
        "The downturn in global trade was expected to be even more severe than the contraction in output as a result of closed borders and disruptions to logistics.",
        "Moreover, trade developments tended to be procyclical, especially in downturns.",
        "Data on new export orders pointed to a sharp fall of global trade in the second quarter of the year.",
        "Financial conditions had continued to ease in advanced and emerging market economies since the April monetary policy meeting, but remained substantially tighter than before the pandemic shock.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had increased by 62% since the April meeting, but continued to stand at low levels.",
        "The euro had appreciated somewhat against the US dollar even if it remained broadly unchanged in nominal effective terms.",
        "In the euro area, the pandemic and the associated containment measures were taking a toll on productive capacity and domestic demand.",
        "In the first quarter of 2020, euro area real GDP had decreased by 3.8%, quarter on quarter, although strict containment measures were only in place from mid-March in most countries.",
        "At a sectoral level, both the manufacturing and services sectors had been severely hit by the pandemic.",
        "This had been reflected by PMI business expectations in the manufacturing and services sectors reaching record lows in March and April, before bouncing back somewhat in May.",
        "The pandemic shock had also led to a sharp increase in household savings, as consumption had decreased more strongly than income.",
        "The exceptional degree of uncertainty had led to the postponement of consumption and investment with strongly negative effects on growth.",
        "Labour market conditions were rapidly deteriorating and a sizeable decline in euro area trade was expected for the second quarter of 2020.",
        "Overall, the incoming data pointed to a further significant contraction of real GDP in the second quarter.",
        "While euro area activity was expected to rebound in the third quarter as the containment measures were eased further, the overall speed and scale of the rebound remained highly uncertain.",
        "This assessment was broadly reflected in the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area.",
        "The June projections signalled that output would decline steeply (by 13.0%) in the second quarter of 2020, after having already declined by 3.8% in the first quarter.",
        "This was expected to be only partly reversed in the second half of the year, with quarterly growth rates of 8.3% and 3.2% projected for the third and fourth quarters respectively.",
        "Under this baseline, annual output was projected to shrink by 8.7% in 2020, followed by positive growth rates of 5.2% in 2021 and 3.3% in 2022.",
        "Compared with the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth had been revised substantially downwards by 9.5 percentage points in 2020 and revised upwards by 3.9 percentage points in 2021 and 1.9 percentage points in 2022.",
        "In general, the extent of the contraction and the recovery was seen to depend crucially on the duration and the effectiveness of the containment measures, the success of policies to mitigate the adverse impact on incomes and employment, and the extent to which supply capacity and domestic demand would be permanently affected.",
        "The euro area fiscal stance provided a strong contribution to stabilising GDP growth, based on a combination of discretionary policy measures and the working of automatic stabilisers.",
        "However, this was resulting in large increases in deficit and debt.",
        "For 2020, the anticipated strong increase in the euro area government debt-to-GDP ratio was expected to be pushed higher by an unfavourable interest-growth differential.",
        "Turning to price developments, headline inflation had dropped further from 0.3% in April to 0.1% in May (according to Eurostat’s flash estimate).",
        "Energy inflation continued to push down headline inflation, while inflation for (especially unprocessed) food remained elevated and could affect consumers’ inflation perceptions.",
        "The HICP excluding energy and food had remained at 0.9% in May, unchanged from April.",
        "Overall measures of underlying inflation had fallen somewhat since February, partly reversing the earlier gradual increases.",
        "Pipeline price pressures had weakened and wage negotiations remained on hold.",
        "On the basis of current and futures prices for oil, headline inflation was likely to decline somewhat further over the coming months and to remain subdued until the end of the year.",
        "Over the medium term, weaker demand was expected to put downward pressure on inflation, which was expected to be only partially offset by upward pressures related to supply constraints.",
        "For the long term, survey-based measures of inflation expectations had mostly remained at historical lows, but stood considerably higher than market-based measures.",
        "This assessment was also reflected in the June 2020 Eurosystem staff projections, which entailed a substantial downward revision of the inflation outlook in the baseline scenario, with headline inflation expected to average 0.3% in 2020, 0.8% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2022.",
        "The revisions to the outlook for core inflation indicated an even larger deterioration, with core inflation projected to reach only 0.9% in 2022.",
        "Compared with the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised downwards by 0.8 percentage points in 2020, 0.6 percentage points in 2021 and 0.3 percentage points in 2022.",
        "While to some extent related to the lower path of energy prices, the revisions also reflected lower price pressures on account of the sharp decline in real GDP and the associated significant increase in economic slack.",
        "As regards euro area financial conditions, risk-free rates had changed little since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting.",
        "The latest EONIA forward curve had also remained largely unchanged, indicating no expectations of a rate cut in 2020.",
        "Sovereign bond market fragmentation had declined but spreads remained elevated.",
        "A partial recovery in risk asset prices was attributable to an improvement in risk sentiment.",
        "Meanwhile, corporate fundamentals continued to deteriorate.",
        "Overall, financial conditions had been broadly stable since the Governing Council’s April meeting, but remained significantly tighter than before the pandemic crisis.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, broad money (M3) growth had increased to 8.3% in April 2020, from 7.5% in March.",
        "Strong money growth reflected bank credit creation, which was driven to a large extent by the acute liquidity needs in the economy.",
        "Moreover, high economic uncertainty was triggering a shift towards money holdings for precautionary reasons.",
        "In this environment, the narrow monetary aggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rose further to 6.6% in April 2020, up from 5.5% in March, reflecting firms’ need to finance their ongoing expenditures and working capital in a context of rapidly declining revenues.",
        "At the same time, the annual growth rate of loans to households decreased to 3.0% in April, from 3.4% in March, amid containment measures, declining confidence and a deteriorating labour market.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane observed that the incoming information confirmed that the euro area economy was experiencing an unprecedented contraction.",
        "Survey data and real-time indicators for economic activity had shown some positive signs as the containment measures were gradually eased.",
        "Nonetheless, these readings indicated only a minor improvement compared with the speed at which the indicators had plummeted in the preceding two months.",
        "The steep decline of output in the second quarter that followed the decline in the first quarter was projected to be only partly reversed in the second half of the year.",
        "Under the baseline, which had been revised substantially downwards relative to the March projections, annual output was projected to shrink by 8.7% in 2020, followed by positive growth rates of 5.2% in 2021 and 3.3% in 2022.",
        "The baseline was surrounded by an exceptional degree of uncertainty.",
        "The June 2020 staff projections also entailed a substantial downward revision of the inflation outlook in the baseline scenario, with headline inflation expected to average 0.3% in 2020, 0.8% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2022.",
        "It was important to note that without the vigorous policy response (including an estimated 2.5 percentage point contribution to 2020 output from fiscal policy), the projected paths for output and inflation would be even lower.",
        "The announcement of the PEPP on 18 March had arrested a sharp sell-off in bond and equity markets that was threatening to undermine the ECB’s monetary policy stance and its effective transmission.",
        "Both the highly accommodative pricing of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) and the collateral easing measures were providing strong incentives for banks to maintain credit flows to the real economy.",
        "In addition, the unconditional refinancing operations together with the establishment of international swap lines were ensuring that liquidity in the banking system was protected.",
        "These measures had acted as a stabilising force during this exceptional period.",
        "Nevertheless, financial conditions had tightened sharply since the escalation of the pandemic, as the downward shift in risk-free rates had not been fully transmitted to the broader set of asset prices and yields that set the financial conditions for the real economy.",
        "In particular, the upward pressure on average sovereign yields had contributed to higher corporate and bank bond yields and a decline in equity valuations, especially for bank stocks.",
        "Against this background, Mr Lane emphasised that two main factors called for further policy action at the current meeting.",
        "First, the medium-term outlook for price stability was threatened by the fallout from the coronavirus crisis: in particular, the baseline in the new projections saw 0.3 and 0.6 percentage point downward revisions in the 2022 headline and core inflation rates respectively, with substantially larger revisions in the severe scenario.",
        "Second, financial conditions for the euro area as a whole were significantly tighter compared with the period before the pandemic, whereas the growth and inflation outlook called for easier financial conditions.",
        "In order to counter these pandemic-related negative revisions to the inflation outlook, the appropriate policy response was to increase the size of the PEPP envelope.",
        "In March, the Governing Council had decided to launch the PEPP “to counter the serious risks to the transmission mechanism and the outlook for the euro area posed by the outbreak and escalating diffusion of the coronavirus”.",
        "As expressed in the preamble to the PEPP legal act: “It is also clear that this situation hampers the transmission of the monetary policy impulses and adds severe downside risks to the relevant inflation outlook.",
        "Against this background, the PEPP was a measure which was proportionate to counter the serious risks to price stability, the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the economic outlook in the euro area, which are posed by the outbreak and escalating diffusion of COVID-19.” Accordingly, the downward revision to the inflation outlook, together with the further downside risks captured in the severe scenario, called for a temporary phase of additional asset purchases, in order to deliver the monetary conditions that could support a return to the pre-crisis inflation trajectory within the projection horizon.",
        "In terms of timing, the lags in the transmission of monetary policy to inflation dynamics meant that it was important to take a significant step in addressing the increase in the inflation shortfall.",
        "Furthermore, the value of a timely response was compounded by the importance of avoiding a sustained unanchoring of inflation expectations, in view of the downside risks faced and the near-term prospect of a sustained phase of very low inflation outcomes.",
        "In terms of the overall monetary stance, the PEPP provided a temporary additional source of accommodation, which operated alongside the more standard suite of policy instruments (the level of the ECB policy rates; the APP; forward guidance; and the TLTRO III programme).",
        "Before the pandemic shock, this set of measures had been configured to lift inflation towards the Governing Council’s policy aim over the medium term.",
        "Given the scale and unique nature of the shock, it was better to tackle the substantial downward shift in the inflation outlook through a targeted and temporary programme (the PEPP), rather than a recalibration of the existing policy package.",
        "Moreover, an increase in the size of the PEPP envelope would also provide additional protection against the risks of fragmentation across market segments, which could potentially obstruct the smooth transmission of monetary policy.",
        "At the same time, the envelope should be understood as a ceiling, which implied that in the event of significant upside surprises to the outlook, the full envelope would not need to be used.",
        "Looking ahead, incoming economic and financial data and subsequent projection rounds would provide essential guidance as to whether the pandemic-related negative shock to inflation dynamics had been sufficiently contained.",
        "Ongoing monetary accommodation would likely prove necessary in order to support the macro-financial conditions conducive to making further progress towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Once the pandemic shock to the inflation path had subsided, the monetary stance could again be controlled by calibrating the Governing Council’s pre-crisis suite of policy instruments.",
        "In terms of the overall monetary policy strategy, purchases of government bonds under the PEPP and the APP were an effective tool for delivering on the Treaty-assigned price stability objective in the current environment.",
        "This was especially the case given the already low levels of the ECB’s policy rates and the crucial role of sovereign yields in determining the financing conditions of firms and households.",
        "These measures were also efficient, especially in combination with other policy measures, since other instruments would require extraordinary adjustment to generate the same impact on inflation dynamics.",
        "The easing of credit conditions would help viable businesses continue to operate and retain as many workers as possible.",
        "In turn, preserving jobs was the most important factor in determining incomes and the financial security of individuals and families in the euro area.",
        "The Governing Council’s measures played a key role in supporting credit intermediation through banks, not least since the business prospects of the banking system depended first and foremost on the macroeconomic outlook.",
        "Accordingly, the PEPP and the APP were proportionate measures under the current conditions for pursuing the price stability objective, with sufficient safeguards having been built into the design of these programmes to limit potential adverse side effects, including risks of fiscal dominance, and to address the monetary financing prohibition.",
        "On the basis of this assessment, Mr Lane proposed that the Governing Council take the following decisions: First, to increase the size of the PEPP by €600 billion.",
        "The size of the proposed envelope was calculated to make a significant contribution to offsetting the pandemic-related downward shift in the projected inflation path.",
        "Second, to extend the net purchase horizon of the PEPP to at least the end of June 2021.",
        "This would align the Governing Council’s minimum purchase horizon with the phase of the most severe pandemic-related restrictions on economic activity and the weakest inflation pressures.",
        "It was also broadly aligned with the horizons of the other monetary policy measures taken by the Governing Council in response to the pandemic.",
        "In any case, net asset purchases under the PEPP would be conducted until the Governing Council judged that the coronavirus crisis phase was over.",
        "Third, to announce that maturing principal payments from securities purchased under the PEPP would be reinvested until at least the end of 2022 and that, in any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio would be managed to avoid interference with the desired monetary stance.",
        "This reinvestment strategy for the PEPP would avoid the risk of an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions at a time when the recovery from the pandemic shock was likely to remain incomplete.",
        "At the same time, a separate reinvestment strategy (distinct from the APP) was appropriate in view of the temporary and emergency nature of the PEPP.",
        "Fourth, to continue net purchases under the APP at a monthly pace of €20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional €120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year.",
        "The Governing Council would continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it started raising the key ECB interest rates.",
        "Fifth, to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Sixth, to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged and to expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until the Governing Council had seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence had been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.",
        "In the current stressed market conditions, asset purchases (together with the TLTRO III programme) were the most effective and efficient tools for adding monetary accommodation.",
        "High uncertainty and heightened risk aversion would weaken the transmission of policy rate cuts to the market reference rates that mattered for the pricing of credit to households and firms, especially in the context of a temporary shock.",
        "In this environment, asset purchases were more efficient at easing funding conditions and thereby the lending rates that mattered for the real economy.",
        "In its public communication, the Governing Council needed to confirm that the incoming information indicated an unprecedented contraction of the euro area economy; highlight that the projections entailed a substantial downward revision to both the level of economic activity and the inflation outlook over the whole projection horizon, while the baseline was surrounded by an exceptional degree of uncertainty; emphasise that additional monetary policy action had become necessary to ensure the necessary degree of monetary accommodation and a smooth transmission of monetary policy across sectors and jurisdictions, in order to safeguard medium-term price stability; explain that its decision to recalibrate the PEPP was in response to the pandemic-related negative revision to the projected inflation path and would further ease the general monetary policy stance, supporting the funding costs of the real economy; stress that the PEPP also allowed the Governing Council to counter risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy through the flexible implementation of the purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions; and reiterate that the Governing Council would do everything necessary within its mandate and continued to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the outlook provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Incoming information confirmed that the euro area economy was experiencing an unprecedented contraction.",
        "In the first quarter of 2020, euro area real GDP had decreased by 3.8% quarter on quarter as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the measures to contain it.",
        "Both the manufacturing and services sectors were severely affected, and the pandemic had taken a toll on the productive capacity of the euro area economy as well as on domestic demand.",
        "Information from surveys, high-frequency indicators and incoming hard data all pointed to a further significant contraction of real GDP in the second quarter.",
        "Most recent indicators suggested some bottoming-out of the downturn in May as parts of the economy gradually reopened.",
        "Accordingly, euro area activity was expected to rebound in the third quarter as the containment measures were eased further, supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a resumption of global activity.",
        "However, the overall speed and scale of the rebound remained highly uncertain.",
        "This assessment was also broadly reflected in the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area.",
        "As regards the external environment, the outlook for global activity had been revised downwards significantly compared with the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "The pandemic crisis was affecting not only activity in individual countries but also international trade, and downward revisions to foreign demand for the euro area were larger than those to global activity.",
        "Looking at this from a different perspective, it implied that at the current juncture the euro area could not rely on exports to offset weakness in domestic demand.",
        "On euro area activity, members stressed the exceptional uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the euro area in the present circumstances.",
        "It was underlined that much of the uncertainty lay outside the economic sphere and related to the future course of the pandemic and its medical solution.",
        "The extent of the contraction and the recovery would depend crucially on the duration and the effectiveness of the containment measures, the success of policies to mitigate the adverse impact on incomes and employment, and the extent to which supply capacity and domestic demand were affected more permanently.",
        "The point was also made that economic outcomes were highly dependent on the success of policy interventions, for instance in preventing acute liquidity shortages among firms from turning into widespread insolvencies.",
        "More broadly, there was a link between the quality of the policy responses and the degree to which the supply side of the economy could be damaged more permanently.",
        "Against this background, members widely acknowledged the difficulties of preparing projections in view of the high degree of uncertainty that presently surrounded economic developments and clouded the outlook.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement that publishing a “mild” and a “severe” scenario alongside a most likely baseline projection was a reasonable way of reflecting the elevated risk and uncertainty.",
        "Some concern was expressed that the mild scenario might already be outdated.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that keeping a mild scenario was warranted, as the unlocking of the economy could give rise to more positive outcomes in the short term than envisaged in the baseline.",
        "Reference was also made to some positive signs from countries outside the euro area that were further ahead in the unlocking process.",
        "In the exchange of views on the scenarios in the June 2020 Eurosystem staff projections, it was remarked that these broadly confirmed the range of outcomes in the scenarios that had been prepared by ECB staff in April and released on 1 May.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that all scenarios assumed that an effective medical solution would become available by mid-2021.",
        "This implied that all scenarios might turn out to be too optimistic for the latter part of the projection horizon if that was not the case.",
        "Similarly, it was recalled that the baseline projection assumed that there would be no adverse real-financial feedback loops.",
        "Historical experience suggested that such loops would draw out the recovery and imply a worse outlook than that entailed in the baseline.",
        "In this context, it was observed that to date financial markets had remained fairly resilient and rebounded rather rapidly, also reflecting the swift and forceful monetary policy response so far.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that, in view of the cut-off date, neither the positive impact of the European Commission’s proposed recovery fund nor that of the additional fiscal stimulus announced in the largest euro area economy had been taken into account in the staff projections.",
        "Overall, the balance of risks around the baseline projection for growth was seen as to the downside.",
        "Members underlined that the shape of the recovery would depend crucially on how consumption and investment evolved under the present uncertainties and whether the pandemic led to longer-lasting changes in the behaviour of economic agents.",
        "In particular, the expected pattern of the saving ratio was seen as a key issue, as was the extent to which a sharp spike owing to the lockdown would subsequently unwind as the economy gradually reopened.",
        "Some concern was expressed that expecting a full unwinding of higher savings might be too optimistic, as protracted uncertainty might keep the ratio higher for longer.",
        "In the services sector, in particular, workers and consumers might review not only their current but also their long-term income prospects, leaving consumption subdued for quite some time.",
        "Moreover, a rise in real interest rates and attempts to restore net wealth could be further factors encouraging saving.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that the unwinding could lead to a saving rate below the pre-crisis rate if the involuntary savings made during the lockdown and containment periods were spent to meet pent-up demand.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remained critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy.",
        "Members therefore strongly welcomed the European Commission’s proposal for a recovery plan dedicated to supporting the regions and sectors most severely hit by the pandemic, to strengthening the Single Market and to building a lasting and prosperous recovery.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation had decreased to 0.1% in May, down from 0.3% in April, mainly on account of lower energy price inflation.",
        "On the basis of spot and futures prices for oil, headline inflation was likely to decline somewhat further over the coming months and to remain subdued until the end of the year.",
        "Over the medium term, weaker demand would put downward pressure on inflation, which would only be partially offset by upward pressures related to supply constraints.",
        "This assessment was also reflected in the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresaw annual HICP inflation in the baseline scenario at 0.3% in 2020, 0.8% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2022.",
        "Some concern was expressed that that model-based estimates of deflation risks surrounding the baseline scenario in the June 2020 projections had reached their highest levels since the December 2008 projections.",
        "The point was made that while deflation was not a likely outcome for now, it was also no longer a low probability event and warranted careful monitoring.",
        "In their exchange of views on the inflation outlook, members recalled the considerable uncertainty about the net effect of rising slack and lower demand on the one side, and the possible longer-term adverse impact on aggregate supply capacity on the other side.",
        "It was argued that the pandemic could influence potential output in either direction.",
        "For instance, notwithstanding increased production and distribution costs associated with public health and safety measures, total factor productivity could increase, for example due to the improvements in digitalisation prompted by the crisis.",
        "It was acknowledged that the uncertainty about the impact of the pandemic crisis on potential output made real-time estimates of output gaps even more uncertain than in normal times.",
        "In this context, it was stressed that while the output gap might overstate the amount of slack, the unemployment gap would understate it, as statistically recorded unemployment was being kept artificially low by temporary employment schemes.",
        "The concern was raised that the lagged nature of the labour market response would eventually lead to a period of higher unemployment.",
        "This would put downward pressure on wage growth that would come on top of the deceleration that had already started before the pandemic crisis.",
        "Overall these arguments pointed to protracted weakness in the inflation outlook.",
        "However, the point was also made that, while the balance of demand and supply effects was disinflationary in the shorter term, the medium term might see rising inflationary pressures.",
        "These could stem from factors including disruptions in supply chains, de-globalisation tendencies and regulatory restrictions in the context of containing the pandemic.",
        "It was argued that there remained considerable uncertainty about how the negative supply effects would affect pricing, but that some goods and services would have to become more expensive, if only to keep businesses viable.",
        "It was also recalled that price measurement issues could be an additional source of uncertainty in the current environment.",
        "This related to difficulties with collecting price data and increased recourse to imputations.",
        "In addition, the goods and services actually purchased during the lockdown and containment periods likely deviated from the expenditure weights assumed in the consumption baskets used in the HICP compilation.",
        "It was argued that, as a result, consumers’ perceptions could deviate substantially from what was recorded in the official statistics.",
        "Reference was made to the strong increase in food prices, which suggested that perceived inflation could currently be higher than measured inflation, possibly feeding through to expectations.",
        "In discussing recent developments in inflation expectations, members broadly shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction that market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations had remained at depressed levels.",
        "While survey-based indicators of inflation expectations had declined somewhat over the short and medium term, longer-term expectations had been less affected (despite remaining near historical lows).",
        "It was argued that the elevated probability of inflation remaining below 1% according to market-based indicators suggested that market participants’ inflation expectations might have become less well anchored.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members widely agreed with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction that strong growth in broad money (M3) reflected a shift towards money holdings for precautionary reasons in the context of elevated uncertainty.",
        "Strong money growth also reflected bank credit creation, which was driven to a large extent by acute liquidity needs in the economy.",
        "At the same time, a question was raised on the impact of the ongoing, large-scale accumulation of monetary liquidity on risks to price stability over the medium term.",
        "It was remarked that the bank lending channel continued to perform well, which was important for monetary policy transmission given that the bulk of financial intermediation in the euro area operated through banks.",
        "The annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations had picked up further in April, reflecting firms’ need to finance their ongoing expenditures and working capital in the context of rapidly declining revenues.",
        "The upcoming TLTRO allotments at very favourable conditions should further encourage banks to continue extending loans to all private sector entities.",
        "Moreover, attention was drawn to complementary support provided on the prudential side aimed at easing conditions in the banking system.",
        "However, it was still uncertain whether the funds provided by the ECB’s lending operations would reach those sectors of the euro area economy where liquidity was most urgently needed, such as small and medium-sized enterprises.",
        "With regard to financial conditions and the monetary policy stance, members shared the assessment provided by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane in their introductions.",
        "While sentiment in financial markets had improved since the previous monetary policy meeting in late April, financial conditions had tightened overall since the escalation of the pandemic.",
        "More recently, euro area bond spreads had declined and equity prices, which were one driver of overall financial conditions, had rebounded.",
        "The easing in financial conditions and improvement in sentiment since the previous monetary policy meeting were attributed to a number of factors: the gradual relaxation of containment measures; the support provided by the ECB’s monetary policy decisions; national fiscal policy measures; and the Franco-German recovery fund proposal, as broadly taken up in the comprehensive recovery package subsequently proposed by the European Commission.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that improved sentiment in financial markets should not lead to complacency.",
        "While the ECB’s set of monetary policy measures, most notably the PEPP, had contributed to calming financial markets, real interest rates in the euro area had increased, thereby contributing to a tightening in the stance of monetary policy in the context of a subdued outlook for inflation.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy transmission mechanism, it was noted that the decline in risk-free rates had not been transmitted in full to the broader set of asset prices and yields affecting the financial conditions faced by the real economy.",
        "In particular, the upward pressure on average sovereign bond yields, which was in part related to the increased issuance of government debt, had contributed to higher corporate and bank bond yields and a decline in equity valuations, especially for banks.",
        "Looking ahead, this could trigger an increase in the price of credit to households and businesses.",
        "The tighter financial conditions compared with pre-coronavirus levels, the unprecedented magnitude of the economic contraction, and the notable downward revisions to the outlook for growth and inflation entailed in the June projections were highlighted.",
        "In addition, there were downside risks to the outlook, as well as rising risks of disinflation and even deflation.",
        "Against this background, all members agreed that further monetary policy action was needed, in accordance with the Governing Council’s price stability objective.",
        "At the same time, some reservations were expressed about the precise timing and proposed scale of the expansion of the PEPP envelope to further boost monetary policy accommodation at the current meeting.",
        "Prevailing uncertainties and some indications of a bottoming-out of economic and financial conditions were seen to argue for a more cautious approach.",
        "However, it was generally felt that not acting at the present meeting could trigger a further tightening of financial conditions, to the detriment of the economic recovery.",
        "Continued exceptionally high levels of uncertainty were not seen as a valid reason to postpone a response that was required by the ECB’s price stability objective, but rather as calling all the more for decisive action.",
        "It was seen as particularly important in the current environment that monetary policy and fiscal action should act as complements in combating the economic fallout from the pandemic crisis.",
        "Members broadly agreed with the arguments put forward by Mr Lane in his introduction that the PEPP was the most effective and efficient tool for providing additional monetary accommodation in the current environment, reflecting its dual role in supporting both the monetary policy stance and the transmission of the stance to all parts of the euro area economy in the current stressed market conditions.",
        "In terms of the overall stance and given the scale and unique nature of the pandemic shock, the substantial downward shift in the inflation outlook would be better tackled through a targeted and temporary programme rather than a recalibration of the more standard policy tools.",
        "It was argued that the PEPP was the best available instrument for lowering the medium and long-term interest rates which mattered most for the real economy.",
        "Expanding the PEPP would help to bring the sovereign bond yield curve more closely into line with the risk-free curve.",
        "This in turn would support the transmission of monetary policy to the interest rates applicable to households and businesses, to the extent that sovereign bond yields acted as a benchmark for the pricing of loans and market-based credit instruments.",
        "It was also remarked that increasing the size and duration of asset purchases would contribute to containing overall uncertainty, thereby supporting the recovery of the euro area economy.",
        "In this vein, the PEPP could provide additional protection against the risks of fragmentation across market segments that might obstruct the smooth transmission of monetary policy.",
        "It was recalled that the PEPP had been rather successful in containing spread volatility in the European government bond markets and in averting risks of self-fulfilling adverse market dynamics.",
        "In this context, the importance of the flexible implementation of the PEPP was emphasised as a means to ensure the transmission of monetary policy across time, asset classes and jurisdictions.",
        "Such flexibility was seen as most effective and efficient during periods of market stress.",
        "At the same time, it was reiterated that, in line with the design features of the PEPP, the capital key remained the relevant benchmark for the allocation of purchases across jurisdictions.",
        "On this basis, members broadly agreed with the proposal by Mr Lane to increase the size of the PEPP by €600 billion, to extend the horizon for net purchases under the PEPP to at least the end of June 2021, and to announce that principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP would be reinvested until at least the end of 2022 and that, in any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio would be managed so as to avoid interference with the desired monetary policy stance.",
        "With regard to the calibration of the PEPP expansion, a range of preferences were expressed in favour of either a larger or smaller envelope.",
        "The case for a larger envelope was based on the significant downside risks to the June projections amid the exceptionally high degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook, together with the subdued inflation outlook, with heightened risks of protracted disinflation or even deflation.",
        "In addition, the point was made that the June projections did not cover the possibility that the crisis could spill over to the financial sector: if this were to happen, it would trigger a further deterioration in financial conditions and necessitate an even stronger monetary policy response.",
        "At the same time, a number of arguments were made in favour of a smaller expansion of the PEPP, which would allow more time to assess the evolution of the economic situation and the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "The point was also made that the June projections did not take into account the Commission’s recovery fund proposal or recently announced national fiscal measures, which could entail an upside risk to the economic outlook contained in the staff projections.",
        "In the end, a broad consensus emerged among members around the proposal put forward by Mr Lane to expand the PEPP envelope by €600 billion in order to deliver the monetary conditions that could support a return to the pre-crisis inflation trajectory within the projection horizon.",
        "An expansion of this amount was seen as providing a clear signal that the Governing Council was not satisfied with the medium-term inflation outlook of 1.3%.",
        "It was also noted that expanding the size of the PEPP by €600 billion would help support the smooth transmission across all jurisdictions of the euro area.",
        "With regard to the envisaged horizon of net purchases under the PEPP, members broadly concurred with the proposal put forward by Mr Lane to extend it until at least the end of June 2021, thus aligning it with the phase of the most severe impact of the pandemic-related restrictions on economic activity and the weakest inflation pressures in the period ahead.",
        "The purchase horizon would also be broadly aligned with the horizons of the other monetary policy measures taken by the ECB in response to the pandemic.",
        "It was underlined that the proposed extension of the PEPP was consistent with the Governing Council’s communication that net asset purchases would continue until the coronavirus crisis phase was over.",
        "The more prolonged economic slowdown than previously anticipated thus warranted such an extension.",
        "With regard to the reinvestment of principal payments, members broadly agreed with the proposal made by Mr Lane to announce a PEPP reinvestment horizon of until at least the end of 2022.",
        "This was seen to avoid the risk of an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions at a time when the recovery from the pandemic shock was likely to remain incomplete.",
        "These reinvestments were seen to enhance the effectiveness of the PEPP by reducing the amount of duration risk that investors needed to absorb in the future, thereby helping to limit upward pressure on longer-term interest rates.",
        "Announcing a minimum duration for the reinvestment horizon of until at least the end of 2022 was viewed as appropriate, given the temporary and emergency nature of the PEPP.",
        "It was argued that this would also allow time, in a manner that would not interfere with the broader monetary policy stance, to reduce possible deviations from the capital key that might arise during the net purchase phase.",
        "Members also put forward some broader considerations with regard to the effectiveness and efficiency of using asset purchases as a monetary policy tool in the pursuit of the ECB’s price stability objective, including in the light of the upcoming review of the monetary policy strategy and with a view to explaining the Governing Council’s monetary policy deliberations in a more comprehensive way to the public.",
        "It was argued that the proportionality assessment of any monetary policy measure had to consider, among other things, the degree to which the measure contributed to achieving the monetary policy objective, on the one hand, and possible unintended side effects, on the other hand.",
        "It required a judgement as to whether other policy measures were available that were as effective and efficient while offering a better balance between intended and unintended effects.",
        "It was highlighted that asset purchases were an essential tool with which monetary policy could affect macroeconomic developments and, ultimately, inflation outcomes, via a number of transmission channels.",
        "From the outset, purchases under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) of securities with maturities of between two and thirty years had been aimed at lowering market interest rates that are relevant for the real economy and inflation developments.",
        "There was now ample evidence from an exhaustive literature showing that asset purchase programmes in general and the PSPP in particular had proven effective in achieving their intended effects on the euro area economy and thereby in maintaining price stability.",
        "Asset purchases had lowered relevant market interest rates throughout the euro area, which translated into lower bank lending rates and higher lending volumes and, ultimately, into higher growth and inflation outcomes.",
        "Although the quantitative estimates varied to some extent and were subject to the usual model uncertainty, the overall evidence underpinned the view that the PSPP had had a positive impact on macroeconomic outcomes, confirming the assessment that it was a policy measure that was effective in putting upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations as intended.",
        "It was recalled that the decision to implement a large-scale asset purchase programme in January 2015 had been taken in response to two major challenges, namely strong disinflationary headwinds in the aftermath of the financial and sovereign debt crises in the euro area and the global phenomenon of declining equilibrium (or “natural”) interest rates that ultimately determined the degree of accommodation that a given level of policy rates would deliver.",
        "There was vast empirical evidence documenting the decline in the level of equilibrium interest rates over the past three decades which was broadly related to a decrease in potential output growth in many industrial countries, reflecting factors such as demographic trends or low productivity growth.",
        "Therefore, with policy interest rates close to their effective lower bound, unconventional instruments were needed to provide the degree of monetary accommodation that was consistent with the ECB’s inflation aim.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that the low interest rate environment in which central banks had to navigate was associated with a number of challenges.",
        "First, low interest rates might incentivise market participants to adopt excessive risk-taking behaviour, ultimately triggering risks to financial stability.",
        "Second, low interest rates prevailing over an extended period of time could strain the profitability, and hence the capitalisation, of banks.",
        "Third, the low interest environment might give rise to scenarios in which banks financed inefficient firms, which implied a misallocation of resources and could ultimately lead to a decrease in overall productivity in the economy.",
        "Moreover, low interest rates were also challenging for earnings on the savings of households and insurance companies that aimed for certain nominal yields.",
        "It had to be acknowledged, however, that the asset purchases under the PSPP had contributed to these potential issues, but only to the extent that they lowered interest rates below the natural interest rate.",
        "Hence, the challenges of a low interest rate environment mainly arose from the structural factors driving the decline of interest rates, while monetary policy had only contributed to these effects and was clearly not the main factor behind them.",
        "In assessing the benefits and costs of asset purchases, the relevant benchmark was not the status quo, but a counterfactual situation in which policy accommodation through asset purchases had not been provided.",
        "There was ample evidence that the euro area economy would have fared much worse without the policy stimulus from asset purchases.",
        "The Eurosystem’s asset purchases had created financial conditions that countered disinflationary forces and helped to avert deflationary risks in the euro area.",
        "In overall macroeconomic terms, asset purchases had made a very significant positive contribution to both economic growth and inflation in the euro area.",
        "With respect to the earnings situation of banks, the low interest rate environment had reduced their interest rate margins, but the positive impact of asset purchases on the broader economy had in turn supported banks’ balance sheets.",
        "In this context, it was also highlighted that so far there was no convincing evidence that the low interest rates had contributed to so-called zombie lending.",
        "The empirical evidence on the effects of the low interest rate environment on retirement provisions was also unclear.",
        "In this context, it was not only the nominal return on an individual asset that was relevant for overall retirement provisions, but also the overall real return on all assets that people held in their portfolios over their lifetime.",
        "As regards the impact of the ECB’s monetary policy measures on households, there was ample evidence from numerous studies on the impact of low interest rates and asset purchases on household income.",
        "Evidence derived from the European Household Finance and Consumption Survey showed that net borrowers had benefited from lower interest rates, whereas net savers had seen a decline in their interest income.",
        "It was also noted that the effects of lower interest rates arising from asset purchases were similar to the effects of using conventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "Moreover, to judge the overall effects of low interest rates on household income, all transmission channels, not just savings income, had to be taken into account.",
        "The significant macroeconomic effects of asset purchases contributed to higher wages and higher employment, and thereby positively affected households’ disposable income and consumption.",
        "With regard to the potential interactions between monetary policy and fiscal policy, a clear focus on the primary objective of maintaining price stability, combined with safeguards which ensure the respect of the prohibition of monetary financing, was viewed as essential to the lasting success and credibility of monetary policy, and ultimately to acceptance and trust in the euro as a common currency.",
        "In order to ensure sustainable public finances, the countries participating in the monetary union had adopted common budgetary rules and a budgetary surveillance procedure.",
        "Moreover, the institutional set-up also relied on market discipline for sound fiscal policies, while monetary policy needed to observe the prohibition of monetary financing.",
        "It was also recalled that the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union had not only granted the ECB independence, assigned it the primary objective of price stability and prohibited monetary financing, it also required the ECB to adhere to the principle of an open market economy with free competition.",
        "Against this background, it was underlined that allocating the Eurosystem’s purchases of public sector securities across jurisdictions using the ECB’s capital key as the benchmark was one of the safeguards helping to maintain incentives for sound fiscal policies.",
        "Moreover, it was also regarded as important to set issue and issuer limits ensuring that Member States continued to finance themselves primarily through the bond market.",
        "In this environment, markets played an important disciplining role, as bonds purchased in the primary market could not simply be passed on to the Eurosystem.",
        "However, the view was also expressed that, if the Eurosystem became the main holder of euro area government bonds, this could weaken the disciplining role of markets and their incentives to assess the fiscal soundness of euro area sovereigns.",
        "These aforementioned safeguards were supplemented by further operational constraints on the conduct of purchases, criteria on the eligibility of sovereign issuers and a risk-sharing mechanism, whereby the risks of the PSPP holdings of national debt securities were borne by the respective national central banks.",
        "The point was also made that the combination of a very expansionary monetary policy with potentially unsound or unsustainable fiscal policies could undermine the foundation of a credible monetary policy.",
        "Risks of fiscal dominance could arise, in which monetary policy might be pressured to refrain from raising interest rates even if this was required to fulfil the monetary policy mandate.",
        "Likewise, with an increasing portfolio of public securities on the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, financial risks could increase, which might – in adverse scenarios – hamper the effectiveness of monetary policy in the future.",
        "Therefore, it was viewed as essential to embed safeguards in the design of the Eurosystem’s asset purchases, including a limits framework and the capital key as a benchmark, so as to mitigate the risk of monetary policy becoming dependent on countries’ fiscal policies.",
        "Accordingly, these should constitute guiding principles.",
        "A remark was also made that in some situations in which misguided fiscal and structural policies threatened the transmission of monetary policy and the achievement of the ECB’s price stability objective, the Governing Council also had other tools that could be activated in conjunction with an adjustment programme by the European Stability Mechanism.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement among members that while different weights might be attached to the benefits and side effects of asset purchases, the negative side effects had so far been clearly outweighed by the positive effects of asset purchases on the economy in the pursuit of price stability.",
        "However, it was also noted that it could not be ruled out that unintended effects could increase over time and eventually outweigh the overall positive effects.",
        "It was thus seen as important to continuously assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the monetary policy measures, their transmission channels and their benefits and costs.",
        "In this context, it was remarked that all expansionary monetary policy instruments contributed to a low interest rate environment.",
        "Therefore, the associated side effects of low rates were not a distinguishing feature of asset purchases, such as under the PSPP or the PEPP, but were a factor pertaining to all policy instruments that contributed to a low interest rate environment.",
        "With respect to communication on the outcome of the current Governing Council meeting, members broadly agreed with the proposals put forward by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Members also agreed to emphasise in the communication that two main factors called for further policy action: first, the pandemic-related downward revision to the inflation outlook on the back of lower energy prices and a significant increase in economic slack, which posed a threat to the Governing Council’s medium-term price stability objective; and, second, the unwarranted tightening of financial conditions in an economic environment that instead required easier financial conditions.",
        "Accordingly, it had to be stressed that additional monetary policy action was needed to ensure the necessary degree of monetary accommodation and a smooth transmission of monetary policy across sectors and jurisdictions, in order to support the swift recovery of economic activity to pre-coronavirus levels and to safeguard medium-term price stability.",
        "In this regard, recalibrating the PEPP was the most appropriate course of action, as expanding the PEPP and extending its horizon would be most effective for further easing the general monetary policy stance, maintaining favourable funding costs for the real economy and providing temporary support in response to the pandemic-related shock to the euro area economy and the path of inflation.",
        "In addition, it had to be stressed that conducting purchases in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions allowed the Governing Council to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy.",
        "There was broad agreement among members to reiterate that the Governing Council would do everything necessary within its mandate and that it continued to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards the Governing Council’s aim in a sustained manner.",
        "While this included the possibility of further adjusting the size and composition of the PEPP, it needed to be highlighted that the Governing Council was ready to adjust the full range of its instruments, including the TLTROs, policy interest rates and forward guidance.",
        "Finally, it needed to be highlighted that monetary and fiscal policies were increasingly complementing each other in the current situation, where the additional monetary policy stimulus went hand in hand with the measures taken by euro area governments and European institutions to ensure sufficient healthcare resources and to provide support to affected companies, workers and households.",
        "At the same time, a call was made for further strong and timely efforts to prepare and support the recovery.",
        "The Governing Council, therefore, strongly welcomed the European Commission’s proposal for a recovery plan dedicated to supporting the regions and sectors most severely hit by the pandemic, to strengthening the Single Market and to building a lasting and prosperous recovery.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the following monetary policy decisions: The Governing Council continued to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the latest financial market developments, focusing on the implications of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic from three different perspectives: a contextual perspective, a policy perspective and a stability perspective.",
        "First, from a contextual perspective, stock markets had corrected sharply and equity market volatility had spiked.",
        "The S&P 500 volatility index (VIX) had risen above the levels seen during the height of the sovereign debt crisis.",
        "On Monday, 9 March 2020 equity markets had experienced the sharpest one-day sell-off since the global financial crisis.",
        "However, the severity of the sell-off needed to be assessed in the broader market context in which it had taken place.",
        "Specifically, over the course of the second half of 2019, equity market valuations had risen notably and, in some places, had been pricing in an outlook for the global economy that had become increasingly more optimistic than leading indicators of economic activity suggested.",
        "This risk-on mood in financial markets had, in turn, implied a higher risk of a more pronounced correction should sentiment change.",
        "Such a scenario was currently materialising.",
        "Second, from a policy perspective, the severity of the anticipated economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic had already led to wide-ranging policy actions by several central banks, including the Federal Reserve System.",
        "In other jurisdictions, including the euro area, expectations of policy easing had risen markedly.",
        "In particular, there had been a notable downward shift and an inversion of the EONIA forward curve.",
        "Survey data, however, signalled more limited expectations of further interest rate cuts.",
        "The changes in policy rates, as well as expectations of further easing, had amplified price movements seen in global sovereign bond markets.",
        "The ten-year US Treasury yield had, for the first time in history, fallen below the 1% level.",
        "The yield of the ten-year German government benchmark bond, at currently -75 basis points, was also very close to its historical trough recorded in late summer 2019.",
        "Third, from a stability perspective, implied volatility had increased sharply across asset classes, and market liquidity in both private and public credit markets had tightened since the coronavirus started to spread more quickly beyond China.",
        "Some first signs of tighter funding conditions for banks had been observed both in the euro area and the United States.",
        "The Libor-OIS spread and the foreign exchange swap basis had both widened.",
        "Moreover, euro area banks had underperformed the broader euro area equity market since the outbreak of the coronavirus, with bank stocks down by over 30% since 20 February 2020.",
        "The price-to-book ratios of euro area banks had fallen to new historical lows.",
        "Stressed market conditions, rising risk aversion and flight-to-safety dynamics had also left a notable footprint in euro area sovereign bond markets, where spreads had widened by between 40 basis points and 130 basis points.",
        "In credit markets, spreads for financial institutions were up by some 30 basis points, with a more limited widening for investment grade non-financial corporation bonds of around 20 basis points, which likely also reflected the mitigating effect of the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP).",
        "High-yield bond spreads had widened by 200 basis points, both in the euro area and in the United States.",
        "Sovereign spreads in emerging markets had also increased measurably over the past few weeks, by around 160 basis points.",
        "This widening had offset the previous marked easing in financial conditions observed in 2019.",
        "In commodity markets, the recent oil price movements had reflected two largely separate events.",
        "Until last week, the broader repercussions of heightened uncertainty, related to the economic and financial impact of the coronavirus, had led to a drop of around 20% in oil prices.",
        "This fall had later been exacerbated by the breakdown of the talks between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia on the coordination of oil production targets.",
        "Taken together, oil prices were down by 38% since 20 February 2020.",
        "Long-term market-based inflation expectations had fallen alongside oil prices.",
        "Finally, in foreign exchange markets, with the outbreak of the coronavirus in China in mid-January 2020, the US dollar had begun a period of marked appreciation against all currencies, including the euro.",
        "In mid-February 2020 the euro had briefly fallen to its lowest level against the US dollar in nearly three years.",
        "Since late February 2020 the US dollar had been volatile against major currencies, which likely also reflected the impact of changes in monetary policy expectations.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area since the Governing Council’s January monetary policy meeting.",
        "The review was based on the limited data available to date.",
        "It was clear that the coronavirus pandemic was a major shock to the economy, whose impact was challenging to assess based on the available information.",
        "Thus incoming data needed to be carefully monitored on a continuous basis in the period ahead.",
        "Regarding the external environment, global indicators at the turn of the year had been pointing to a stabilisation in activity.",
        "Trade indicators had even shown some improvement, as trade-related uncertainty had declined following the trade deal between the United States and China.",
        "These developments had then been reversed by the outbreak of the coronavirus, with manufacturing output in China plunging in February and negative spillovers from China to the rest of the Asia-Pacific region.",
        "Turning to global financial conditions, market sentiment towards risky assets had declined strongly, amid a flight to safety.",
        "Accordingly, global equity prices had fallen strongly across advanced and emerging market economies, leading to a tightening in financial conditions.",
        "Since the January Governing Council meeting oil prices had fallen strongly by 43%, on account of uncertainty surrounding the spread of the coronavirus and discord among OPEC+ countries.",
        "The euro had, overall, strengthened somewhat both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms.",
        "Turning to the euro area, the latest indicators suggested a considerable worsening of the near-term growth outlook.",
        "The disruption of supply chains was impeding production plans in the manufacturing sector, while necessary containment measures against the further spread of the coronavirus were adversely affecting economic activity.",
        "This was only partly reflected in the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, as their data cut-off date predated the rapid spread of the coronavirus to the euro area.",
        "Before the outbreak of the coronavirus, euro area real GDP growth had moderated to 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2019, following growth of 0.3% in the third quarter.",
        "This easing mainly reflected the ongoing weakness in the euro area manufacturing sector and reduced investment growth.",
        "The March ECB staff projections foresaw annual real GDP increasing by 0.8% in 2020, 1.3% in 2021 and 1.4% in 2022.",
        "In particular, the projections foresaw very muted growth in the first half of 2020, followed by an improvement in the second half of the year.",
        "Compared with the December 2019 Eurosystem staff projections, the outlook for real GDP growth had been revised down notably for 2020 and slightly for 2021, on account of the potential economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.",
        "Overall, the projections needed to be treated with caution in the light of the substantial uncertainty related to the spread of the coronavirus and the necessity, duration and impact of the measures that had been adopted to counter it.",
        "The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook were clearly on the downside.",
        "In addition to the previously identified risks related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, the spread of the coronavirus added a new and substantial source of downside risk to the growth outlook.",
        "Turning to inflation, euro area annual HICP inflation had decreased to 1.2% in February 2020, from 1.4% in January, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate.",
        "On the basis of the sharp decline in current and futures prices for oil, headline inflation was likely to decline considerably over the months ahead.",
        "Indicators of inflation expectations had fallen and measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted.",
        "While labour cost pressures had remained resilient amid tighter labour markets, the weaker growth momentum was delaying their pass-through to inflation.",
        "Over the medium term, the increase in inflation would be supported by the Governing Council’s monetary policy measures and – looking through the coronavirus shock in the nearer term – the anticipated recovery in euro area growth dynamics.",
        "The March ECB staff projections foresaw annual HICP inflation at 1.1% in 2020, 1.4% in 2021 and 1.6% in 2022.",
        "Compared with the December 2019 Eurosystem staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation was broadly unrevised over the projection horizon.",
        "The implications of the coronavirus for inflation were surrounded by high uncertainty, given that downward pressures linked to weaker demand might be offset by upward pressures related to supply disruptions.",
        "However, the sharp decline in oil prices presented significant downside risks to the short-term inflation outlook.",
        "Market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations had fallen to a new all-time low, with the euro area five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead standing at 0.92% on 10 March 2020.",
        "With respect to euro area financial conditions, the EONIA forward curve, which had been flat over short to medium-term maturities at the time of the January meeting, had inverted significantly, hinting at market expectations of imminent rate cuts.",
        "In addition, both the euro area ten-year overnight index swap (OIS) rate and the ten-year US Treasury yield had fallen strongly.",
        "Equity prices of financial and non-financial companies had also undergone a sharp correction.",
        "Taken together, euro area financial conditions had tightened since the January 2020 monetary policy meeting and stood close to the levels observed in early 2019, as the accommodative effects of lower risk-free rates only partially offset the decline in euro area stock prices and the euro’s appreciation.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, the annual growth rate of M3 had stood at 5.2% in January 2020, having moderated somewhat from its recent peak.",
        "Money growth continued to reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3 relative to other financial instruments.",
        "The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth.",
        "Loans to the private sector had continued to expand.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households had picked up slightly to 3.7% in January 2020, from 3.6% in December 2019.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations remained unchanged at 3.2% in January, confirming the moderation seen since autumn 2019 and likely reflecting the typically lagged reaction to the past weakening in the economy.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance was foreseen in the March ECB staff projections as being mildly expansionary in 2020-21 and broadly neutral in 2022.",
        "This, however, did not include the planned fiscal measures for cushioning the economic impact of the coronavirus.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane remarked that the spread of the coronavirus was a major shock to the world and the euro area economies, with severe near-term implications for aggregate expenditure levels and supply chains.",
        "The disruption of supply chains was impeding production plans in the manufacturing sector, while the necessary containment measures against the further spread of the coronavirus were adversely affecting activity in the services sector, notably related to transport, travel and recreational services.",
        "The March ECB staff projection baseline scenario already reflected a 0.3-percentage point decline in projected GDP growth in 2020 owing to the coronavirus.",
        "However, this was unlikely to capture the full impact on the euro area.",
        "In a risk scenario, the projections suggested that the negative impact on euro area output could become substantially larger, ranging from 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points depending on the models used.",
        "If lockdown measures were implemented more broadly and for a longer time period, a substantial recession could be envisaged.",
        "The ramifications on the economy had already been amplified by a tightening in financial conditions, especially through declining stock prices and rising yields in some asset classes.",
        "Even if limited so far, the appreciation of the euro added to the tightening of financial conditions and, if it proved to be more persistent, could be a further drag on the economy and inflation dynamics.",
        "The overall magnitude and duration of the shock remained highly uncertain.",
        "While the baseline scenario was that the main economic impact was temporary, with a recovery in activity later this year, the spread of the coronavirus represented a substantial downside risk to the euro area growth outlook.",
        "Inflation remained subdued and was set to decline considerably in the near term, following the recent sharp decline in oil prices.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation had moved sideways and market-based measures of inflation expectations had reached new historical lows.",
        "Staff projected the HICP to rise gradually, but the same uncertainty that applied to the growth outlook also applied to the inflation outlook.",
        "A monetary policy response was required, both to preserve the monetary stance and to underpin the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.",
        "The response needed to have three elements: first, to safeguard liquidity conditions in the banking system; second, to protect the continued flow of credit to the real economy; and third, to prevent financing conditions for the economy from tightening in a pro-cyclical way.",
        "The effectiveness of monetary policy would be enhanced and reinforced by fiscal measures that supported those businesses and employees at risk and cushioned the impact of the shock on aggregate expenditure levels.",
        "In the light of the significant risks of the economic repercussions of the coronavirus, Mr Lane proposed that the following decisions be taken at the current meeting: First, to offer additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to provide immediate liquidity support to the euro area banking system at an interest rate equal to the average deposit facility rate over the life of the respective operation.",
        "While no signs of strains in money markets or liquidity shortages in the banking system were currently seen, the operations would provide an effective backstop in case of need.",
        "The additional LTROs would temporarily ease funding conditions for banks, in order to provide an effective bridge to the TLTRO III operation in June 2020.",
        "Second, to apply considerably more favourable terms to all TLTRO III operations during the period from June 2020 to June 2021.",
        "In particular, the rate applied in these operations, over the period ending in June 2021, could be as low as 25 basis points below the average interest rate on the deposit facility over the same period, with the entry rate also lowered to 25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations (MROs).",
        "Furthermore, lending allowances would be temporarily raised from 30% to 50% of stocks of eligible loans.",
        "The operations would support bank lending to those sectors most affected by the coronavirus outbreak, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).",
        "In addition, the Governing Council should ask the Eurosystem Committees to look into options to temporarily ease the collateral eligibility rules to ensure that counterparties would be able to make full use of the operations.",
        "Third, to add a temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases amounting to €120 billion until the end of the year.",
        "During this period, the Governing Council would make full use of the flexibility embedded in the programme.",
        "In combination with the existing asset purchase programme (APP), the temporary envelope would support financing conditions more broadly and thereby also ease the interest rates that matter for the real economy.",
        "Moreover, the higher purchase pace would ensure that the Eurosystem showed a more robust presence in the market during times of heightened volatility, not least in the market for corporate bonds.",
        "By contributing to stability in the corporate bond market, the increase in net asset purchases would also reinforce the effectiveness of the TLTRO III programme in supporting SMEs.",
        "Increasing the volume of net asset purchases was also important in maintaining the consistency of the Governing Council’s policy reaction function by showing its agility in responding to major shifts in euro area financial conditions and to heightened risks to the economic and inflation outlook.",
        "Together with the substantial monetary policy stimulus already in place, these measures would support liquidity and funding conditions and help preserve the smooth provision of credit to the real economy.",
        "In view of the expected temporary nature of the shock, the easing of the monetary stance provided by the additional asset purchases and the considerable support for credit supply through the revised TLTRO III programme, the Governing Council should not reduce the deposit facility rate on this occasion.",
        "In particular, through the expectations component of bond yields, cuts in the short-term policy rate were more suited to setting the medium-term orientation of monetary policy than navigating a path through a temporary period of elevated uncertainty.",
        "At the same time, it was essential to maintain the option of future cuts in the policy rate in case warranted by a tightening in financial conditions or a threat to the ECB’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "In its communication, the Governing Council needed to: (a) note that the latest indicators suggested a considerable worsening of the near-term growth outlook; (b) acknowledge that the economic consequences of the coronavirus were only partly reflected in the March staff macroeconomic projections, as their cut-off date predated the rapid spread of the coronavirus in the euro area; (c) highlight that there were substantial downside risks to the euro area outlook, since the spread of the coronavirus had added a new and substantial source of risk; (d) stress that, in view of current developments, the Governing Council would continue to monitor closely the consequences of the spreading coronavirus for the economy, for medium-term inflation and for the transmission of its monetary policy, and that it would stand ready to adjust all of its measures, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner; (e) welcome the commitment and readiness of euro area governments and European institutions to take joint policy action in the current situation, but reiterate the need for a more supportive and targeted fiscal stance in view of the weakened outlook and to safeguard against the further materialisation of downside risks.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Euro area real GDP growth had moderated to 0.1% quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2019, following growth of 0.3% in the previous quarter, reflecting mainly the ongoing weakness in the euro area manufacturing sector and slowing investment growth.",
        "However, this depicted the situation before the global outbreak of the coronavirus.",
        "While most indicators had remained robust or stronger than expected into February 2020, the latest information suggested a considerable worsening of the near-term growth outlook.",
        "The disruption of supply chains was impeding production plans in the manufacturing sector, while necessary measures to contain the further spread of the coronavirus were adversely affecting economic activity.",
        "As regards the external environment, members noted that there were clear downside risks to the ECB staff projections for global activity, given that these had been finalised in February, prior to the spread of the coronavirus beyond China and the subsequent reaction of the financial markets.",
        "It was highlighted that, in the March 2020 staff projections, the decline in activity in China incorporated in the baseline for the external environment was concentrated in the first quarter of the year and was followed by a rebound in the second quarter.",
        "However, a U-shaped recovery was now considered more likely than such a V-shaped recovery.",
        "Oil prices, which had fallen sharply, were seen as reflecting a fall in global demand for raw materials, as well as the failure of Saudi Arabia and Russia to agree on cuts in production.",
        "More generally, in view of the global reach of the coronavirus pandemic in conjunction with remaining uncertainties regarding geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, members agreed that the risks to the external environment were clearly on the downside.",
        "In an environment of considerable uncertainty, the risk of adverse global spillovers was significant because of disruptions in global supply chains, a broader retrenchment in demand and heightened financial market volatility.",
        "In this context, international coordination was seen as particularly important.",
        "Reference was also made to the uncertainty about the outcome of the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on a future trade relationship, and to the ongoing refugee crisis and tensions on the EU border in Greece.",
        "The risk of an unwinding of globalisation and of global supply chains was highlighted as a possible consequence of the coronavirus pandemic.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, members agreed that the spread of the coronavirus was a major shock to growth prospects and that the impact on the euro area economy could be severe, even if it was, in principle, temporary.",
        "The size of the impact would be determined, in particular, by the further spread of the coronavirus and the extent of the containment measures implemented.",
        "These containment measures, including the lockdown already in place in Italy, would adversely affect activity in the short run.",
        "Members expressed their solidarity with the Italian people.",
        "It was considered more than likely that the recent developments seen in Italy would soon be repeated in many other countries.",
        "It was recalled that the outbreak had had relatively little impact on euro area data for January and February 2020, which supported the assessment that the impact would be seen more in the second quarter than in the first.",
        "However, it was also possible that the impact might extend beyond one or two quarters and it was important that governments did not mistake the relatively good data for the first few months of the year as a reason not to react strongly to the current situation.",
        "With governments prioritising public health issues over short-term economic concerns in order to contain the pandemic, it was argued that containment measures not only reduced economic activity sharply in the short run, but could also be expected to spread out the impact on the economy over time.",
        "It was observed that the impact of the coronavirus pandemic was being felt particularly sharply in services sector activities, such as travel and tourism.",
        "Some doubt was expressed about the likelihood of lost output being recovered once growth picked up again in these sectors.",
        "It was felt that those forgoing travel or visits to the cinema or gym were unlikely to expand these activities after the crisis.",
        "It was also recalled that these services sector activities tended to be fairly labour-intensive, which suggested a more persistent impact, going beyond one or two quarters, on employment, wages and disposable income.",
        "In this context, the challenges faced by euro area SMEs, which could face cash-flow problems and liquidity constraints, were highlighted – notably with regard to financing and preserving working capital.",
        "Against the background of the pandemic, it was emphasised that the outlook for the euro area was subject to an exceptionally high level of uncertainty and that the March ECB staff projections already appeared rather outdated, as they predated the rapid spread of the coronavirus in Europe.",
        "Given the extent of developments since the finalisation of the ECB staff projections, members viewed the scenarios prepared by ECB staff as especially relevant when considering a potential intensification of the coronavirus crisis beyond what was contained in the March 2020 baseline projection.",
        "The “mild” scenario considered the implications of a more persistent outbreak of the coronavirus for China and the euro area.",
        "Building on this, a more “severe” scenario had also been considered by staff, which incorporated some additional shocks to financial markets and oil prices.",
        "In both of these scenarios, the epidemic in China extended into the second quarter of 2020 and the spread of the coronavirus to the euro area was assumed to accelerate significantly.",
        "The negative impact on euro area GDP under the mild scenario was estimated to be between 0.6 and 0.9 percentage points, compared with the ECB staff’s baseline projection, while in the severe scenario the negative impact was between 0.8 and 1.4 percentage points below the March 2020 projections.",
        "Neither of these scenarios incorporated either a monetary policy or a fiscal policy reaction.",
        "It was underlined that including such policy reactions could significantly mitigate the effects in both scenarios, notably in the event of timely and targeted fiscal measures.",
        "Reference was also made to the OECD’s interim Economic Outlook, in which the euro area growth outlook for 2020 had similarly been revised down to 0.8% and which had also included several more adverse scenarios.",
        "Private sector forecasters were also in the process of revising down significantly their growth outlook for 2020.",
        "Against this background, members discussed the possibility of a recession in the euro area, acknowledging that the risk had increased significantly.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that recent forecasts did not take into account the very rapid deterioration in economic conditions in Europe and that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to avoid a recession.",
        "Accordingly, perhaps the question was rather how deep the recession would be and whether the recovery would be only moderate for a prolonged period.",
        "On the other hand, it was emphasised that the outlook depended critically on the strength of the policy response.",
        "In this context it was underlined that the situation called for joint action and close coordination in the euro area, between monetary and fiscal policy as well as macroprudential policy and supervision, and that cooperation was needed both at the national level and with European institutions.",
        "While the magnitude of the downward revision to growth in the short term was very uncertain, the direction was very clear.",
        "However, the need for revisions to the growth and inflation outlook in the medium term was considered more of an open question, depending not only on the future course of the coronavirus pandemic itself and the policy responses, but also on the persistence of the effects on demand and supply conditions.",
        "In terms of the consequences for the supply side, it was noted that there were serious risks of a large-scale destruction of productive capacity and a partial dismantling of global supply chains more generally.",
        "Whereas monetary policy was primarily concerned with the weakness of aggregate demand, there was now also an acute risk to the supply side in the medium to longer term.",
        "It was important to ensure that a temporary demand and supply shock did not lead to a fully fledged macroeconomic and financial crisis if disruptions in production and cash flows, compounded by liquidity and financing constraints, triggered balance sheet problems in the corporate and banking sectors.",
        "Such a scenario could lead to long-run damage to the supply side of the economy and to substantial hysteresis effects.",
        "The situation therefore had to be monitored closely and everything possible should be done in all policy domains to ensure that permanent damage was contained.",
        "Members concluded that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook were clearly on the downside.",
        "In addition to the previously identified risks related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, the spread of the coronavirus had added a new and substantial source of downside risk to the growth outlook.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance was now needed in view of the weakened outlook and to safeguard against the materialisation of downside risks.",
        "It was emphasised that the Governing Council welcomed the measures already taken by several governments to ensure sufficient health sector resources and to provide support to affected companies and employees.",
        "In particular, measures such as providing credit guarantees were needed to complement and reinforce the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "It was also underlined that the Governing Council welcomed the commitment of the euro area governments and European institutions to act without delay, strongly and collectively, in response to the repercussions of the further spread of the coronavirus.",
        "There was broad agreement that fiscal policy had to play a leading role, with temporary, timely and targeted measures.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "According to Eurostat, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.2% in February 2020, compared with 1.4% in January.",
        "On the basis of the sharp decline in spot and futures prices for oil, headline inflation was likely to decline considerably over the coming months.",
        "Indicators of inflation expectations had fallen and measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted.",
        "While labour cost pressures had so far remained steady amid tighter labour markets, the weaker growth momentum was delaying their pass-through to inflation.",
        "In the exchange of views about the implications of the coronavirus outbreak for the outlook for inflation, a number of factors were stressed.",
        "In particular, a clear distinction had to be made between the short-term and the medium-term impact.",
        "There was also a need to distinguish between the relative importance of shocks to demand and shocks to supply, as they could be expected to have different implications for price developments.",
        "It was observed that the pandemic, which had initially been viewed as primarily a global supply-side shock, was being propagated to demand and was intensifying in Europe, reducing activity across most sectors of the economy.",
        "Demand would be negatively affected as a result of job losses and any reduction in household income growth, as well as the impact of increased uncertainty on confidence and investment.",
        "It was argued that, in the short term, the shortfall in demand could be expected to outweigh any supply-side effects.",
        "In the mild scenario produced by ECB staff, the downward impact on inflation in 2020 was assumed to be around 0.2 percentage points, while the impact in a severe scenario was expected to be between 0.4 and 0.8 percentage points.",
        "There was uncertainty about the need to revise the outlook for inflation in the medium term, which was the policy-relevant horizon for the ECB’s price stability objective.",
        "On the one hand, the temporary nature of the downturn suggested that there might be limited need for revisions to the medium-term outlook for inflation, although the assessment was subject to unusually high uncertainty.",
        "On the other hand, the picture of broadly unrevised inflation in the medium term could be questioned, in view of the recent sharp decline in oil prices and the possibility that a more persistent effect on demand would materialise.",
        "It was also to be hoped that the coronavirus crisis would not have a lasting adverse effect on attitudes to consumer expenditure, although this was possible in the case of large shocks.",
        "The point was made that the ultimate medium-term implications were not independent of short-term events and that the magnitude and duration of the shock’s impact would in turn depend on the course of the pandemic and the policy reaction to it.",
        "Regarding longer-term inflation expectations, members noted that market-based inflation expectations in both the euro area and the United States had fallen.",
        "For the euro area, the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had declined to a record low of 0.95%.",
        "At the same time, it was suggested that the importance of market-based measures should not be over-emphasised, as recent developments reflected market tensions and a flight to safety.",
        "Such measures should thus be regarded as an imperfect indicator of future inflation developments.",
        "On the monetary analysis, members broadly concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction that monetary dynamics had moderated, due in part to decelerating bank lending to firms.",
        "The annual rate of M3 growth had stood at 5.2% in January 2020, having decreased somewhat from its recent peak.",
        "Money growth was reflecting ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3 relative to other financial instruments.",
        "Loans to the private sector had continued to expand overall, while the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations had remained unchanged at 3.2% in January, confirming the moderation seen since autumn 2019.",
        "It was noted that credit standards for SMEs had tightened somewhat and that their loan rejection rate had increased over the last four rounds of the survey on access to finance for enterprises.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Financial conditions and bank funding conditions in the euro area had tightened since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "Equity market valuations had dropped significantly in recent weeks, as also shown in the presentation by Ms Schnabel, although it was mentioned that part of the fall in asset prices could be seen as a correction of earlier overvaluation.",
        "While limited so far, the euro’s recent appreciation added to the tightening of financial conditions, which ‒ if it proved to be more persistent ‒ could move inflation expectations further away from the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "While the implications of the coronavirus pandemic pointed to a considerable worsening of the euro area growth outlook and increased downside risks in the near term, the implications for inflation were surrounded by high uncertainty in the light of supply disruptions and weaker demand.",
        "Members agreed that a decisive monetary policy response was required in the present circumstances, both to preserve the monetary stance and to underpin the monetary transmission mechanism.",
        "Although the source of the shock was outside the realm of monetary policy and was to be primarily addressed by timely and targeted fiscal policies, a forceful package of monetary policy measures was seen as necessary.",
        "First, such a package would mitigate the threat of a liquidity and credit crunch further aggravating the situation in the real economy.",
        "Second, it would help counter self-fulfilling fear dynamics and renewed fragmentation in financial markets.",
        "In order to maximise the effectiveness of the monetary policy response, coordination with fiscal and supervisory policies was deemed essential.",
        "As outlined by Mr Lane in his introduction, members agreed that a first element of the policy response was to safeguard ample liquidity in the banking system by ensuring banks’ continued access to funding at attractive conditions as a necessary element to guard against a potential credit crunch.",
        "However, it was also argued that this was not sufficient to ensure that the liquidity made available to banks would be passed on to the end-users.",
        "It was pointed out that, whereas during the financial crisis of 2008 banks were at the heart of the problem, the current situation differed in the sense that problems would materialise first in the real economy and would subsequently be reflected in banks’ balance sheets.",
        "Members also agreed that the second element of the proposed policy response, namely to protect the continued flow of credit to the real economy, was of paramount importance.",
        "Under the current conditions, however, it was seen as more difficult to ensure that the liquidity provided via monetary policy operations reached those that were most in need, such as SMEs, as problems in the real economy risked impairing credit flows to businesses.",
        "Banks needed to be incentivised to provide credit to viable firms that were suffering from a reduction in cash flow because of the coronavirus pandemic.",
        "In this regard, it was underlined that commensurate action by governments and supervisors could support effective monetary transmission, for example via credit guarantees.",
        "Agreement also prevailed with regard to the third element of the required monetary policy response, namely safeguarding the monetary policy stance by averting a procyclical tightening of financing conditions in the economy.",
        "However, it was cautioned that instruments affecting the monetary policy stance would only become fully effective once the spread of the coronavirus had been contained by other policies.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that the ECB’s monetary policy had been highly accommodative since the financial crisis.",
        "It was emphasised that, in order to maintain accommodative monetary conditions, the Governing Council needed to consider using all the tools at its disposal in a flexible way.",
        "Against this background, all members agreed with the package of monetary policy measures proposed by Mr Lane in his introduction, namely: first, offering additional LTROs to provide immediate liquidity support to the euro area banking system at an interest rate equal to the deposit facility rate; second, applying more favourable terms to all TLTRO III operations during the period from June 2020 to June 2021; and, third, adding a temporary envelope of €120 billion to the volume of net asset purchases.",
        "Overall, the package was seen as appropriate to address the three elements of the proposed policy response, though some nuances were expressed with regard to individual components.",
        "Together with the substantial monetary policy stimulus already in place, these measures would support liquidity and funding conditions and help to preserve the smooth provision of credit to the real economy.",
        "Members welcomed the proposed additional LTROs, which would immediately ease funding conditions for banks, thus providing an effective bridge to the TLTRO III operation in June 2020 that would be conducted at the proposed, more favourable terms.",
        "The first LTRO operation would be announced on 16 March 2020, allotted on 17 March 2020 and settled on 18 March 2020, with subsequent operations taking place weekly until 10 June 2020.",
        "All operations would mature on 24 June 2020, on which date they could be rolled over into the June TLTRO III operation.",
        "By offering funding at the deposit facility rate, the LTROs would allow banks to benefit from very favourable borrowing conditions immediately and, at the same time, offer them a high degree of flexibility at a low operational cost.",
        "This would provide a simple and effective backstop, in particular in combination with the full allotment of the operations, and ensure that banks were supplied with liquidity until the June TLTRO III operation, which required a longer lead time because of its operational complexity.",
        "Members widely shared the view that the proposed changes to the TLTRO III operations would support bank lending to the firms affected most by the spread of the coronavirus, in particular SMEs.",
        "For the period from 24 June 2020 to 23 June 2021, the interest rate on all TLTRO III operations outstanding during that time would be 25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem’s MROs over the same period.",
        "For counterparties whose eligible net lending met the benchmark, the interest rate applied would be 25 basis points below the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the same period, and in any case not higher than -0.75%.",
        "The lending performance threshold for attaining the minimum interest rate would be lowered to 0%, from 2.5%.",
        "The maximum total amount that counterparties would be entitled to borrow would be raised from 30% to 50% of their stock of eligible loans.",
        "The limit on the amount of funds that could be borrowed in each operation would be removed.",
        "The proposed amendments to the TLTRO III parameters were considered to be well suited to temporarily ease funding conditions for banks, supporting credit flows to affected sectors and avoiding a tightening in credit supply.",
        "These amendments effectively lowered interest rates in a ring-fenced way for eligible counterparties and provided a strong incentive to banks not to cut lending.",
        "Linking the favourable terms to banks’ credit portfolios would incentivise banks not to cut credit at a time when the economy was in need.",
        "It was cautioned, however, that the reduction in the lending performance threshold to 0% might turn out to be insufficiently supportive if banks were forced to reduce their credit exposure because of supervisory concerns or market pressures, possibly resulting in a contraction of credit.",
        "Members widely agreed that it was important to further investigate options for better incentivising banks to expand their lending to SMEs.",
        "In order to allow banks to make full use of the ECB’s lending facilities, members widely welcomed Mr Lane’s proposal to task the Eurosystem committees with studying ways to further broaden the collateral framework.",
        "Expanding the eligible collateral and reviewing the additional credit claims framework were seen as particularly important with regard to improving bank lending flows to SMEs.",
        "Members generally agreed that the additional envelope for net asset purchases as part of the proposed policy package was essential to influence the level of the risk-free yield curve.",
        "In combination with the existing APP, an additional temporary envelope of €120 billion until the end of the year, with a strong contribution from the private sector purchase programmes, would support favourable financing conditions for the real economy in times of heightened uncertainty.",
        "Limiting the additional envelope to the current calendar year was deemed an appropriate response to a shock that was assessed as being temporary at this stage.",
        "The private sector purchases would provide a strong signal of support for favourable funding conditions in the corporate sector.",
        "A flexible expansion of APP net purchases was also seen as partially compensating for not cutting the deposit facility rate, with the public sector purchases helping to preserve a risk-free rate that served as a benchmark for pricing many other financial products.",
        "A remark was made that although the envelope of €120 billion seemed large, in the face of the disruptions that had been witnessed a larger volume would be justified.",
        "It was also remarked that an increase in the envelope of the APP could be seen as an appropriate way to support a coordinated policy response, as the Governing Council was urging policymakers to take decisive fiscal measures.",
        "Overall, it was felt that adding more volume to the APP was preferable to another reduction in the deposit facility rate.",
        "Additional net purchases would support policy transmission to the long end of the risk-free yield curve and provide some form of backstop for public and private bond markets.",
        "However, some reservations were also expressed regarding the case for expanding the public sector purchase programme as a means of preserving or lowering the risk-free yield curve at a time when higher-rated government bond yields had fallen to record low levels in an environment of heightened risk aversion.",
        "It was also pointed out that, in normal circumstances, the relationship between the ECB’s capital key and the risk-free yield curve was stable, whereas under the current conditions this relationship was distorted by a shift into safe assets, calling for temporary and tactical flexibility in the APP purchases to address liquidity issues arising from this flight to safety.",
        "It was argued that the provision of the additional envelope until the year-end would allow enough flexibility in the implementation of the purchases to temporarily target markets where conditions were particularly tight.",
        "While it was confirmed that the parameters guiding the APP remained in place, the timeline for the convergence of the ECB’s sovereign bond holdings towards the capital key would allow some flexibility for purchases within the existing parameters.",
        "The rationale for using additional asset purchases, in particular public sector purchases, as an instrument to ease the monetary policy stance was recalled, in line with the purpose of the expanded APP as conceived in 2015.",
        "In this context, it was remarked, however, that it was difficult to distinguish whether observed spreads were driven by an increase in credit risk or a lack of liquidity.",
        "The view was widely shared that the present, very challenging circumstances called for a maximum degree of cohesion, consensus and unity in the Governing Council, notwithstanding different preferences with regard to the various monetary policy instruments under consideration.",
        "In view of the expected temporary nature of the shock and the proposed measures, members agreed that it did not seem appropriate to lower the deposit facility rate on this occasion.",
        "While a few members expressed their willingness to consider a cut in the deposit facility rate at the current meeting, most members were of the view that increasing the APP would be more effective in lowering risk-free rates.",
        "At the same time, it was seen as important for the Governing Council to stress, in line with its current forward guidance, that rates could be lowered further if the Governing Council considered this to be appropriate.",
        "On communication, it was stressed that, in view of the current developments, the Governing Council would continue to monitor closely the consequences of the spread of the coronavirus for the economy, for medium-term inflation and for the transmission of monetary policy, and it would stand ready to adjust all of its measures, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "Although the proposed measures were considered to be adequate for the time being, the view was held that, as the spread of the coronavirus continued to unfold, the Governing Council might be confronted with continued market pressures and expectations of further policy actions at its meetings for some time to come.",
        "The commitment to joint policy action by euro area governments and the European institutions in the current situation was welcomed, and the need for a more supportive and targeted fiscal stance was reiterated in view of the weakened outlook and to safeguard against the further materialisation of downside risks.",
        "While monetary policy could effectively address liquidity constraints on financial markets, the limits to what monetary policy could do to address the immediate consequences of the coronavirus pandemic had to be acknowledged.",
        "The substantial downside risks to the euro area outlook had to be highlighted, since the spread of the coronavirus had added a new and substantial source of risk.",
        "As regards forward guidance, it was emphasised that the Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until the Governing Council had seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within the projection horizon, and such convergence had been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.",
        "The Governing Council also confirmed that it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided on the following comprehensive package of monetary policy measures: Further details on the precise terms of the new operations would be published in dedicated press releases at the end of the ECB’s press conference.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous regular monetary policy meeting on 11-12 March 2020.",
        "Although the general risk-off mood had subsided and market liquidity was progressively improving, financial markets continued to show signs of fragility, mainly along four key dimensions.",
        "First, most euro area sovereign bond spreads had widened relative to German benchmark bonds, irrespective of their credit rating.",
        "In some jurisdictions, bond spreads had temporarily returned to, or even risen above, the levels observed before the announcement of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), compounded by expectations of increased issuance needs and the high prevailing uncertainty surrounding the economic and financial fallout from the crisis.",
        "There were also signs that liquidity premia had likely exacerbated the upward pressure on term premia resulting from increased issuance needs.",
        "Bid-ask spreads remained well above normal levels in many jurisdictions.",
        "In this environment, there was evidence that the PEPP had established itself as an important anchor of stability for euro area bond markets beyond the initial effects of the announcement.",
        "High investor demand had been observed for sovereign bond auctions with, at times, historic bid-to-cover ratios.",
        "Even though the yield premium for some issuances had been considerable, the Eurosystem purchases were helping to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy across all parts of the euro area.",
        "Second, although the PEPP had contributed to easing financial conditions and to stimulating issuance, concerns over the outlook for corporate profitability implied that financial conditions for firms and banks remained tighter than before the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.",
        "Investment-grade issuers currently faced spreads which were around twice as high as before the crisis, in part reflecting expectations of a notable increase in credit rating downgrades.",
        "The number of “fallen angel” bonds was increasing, while downgrades of high-yield issuers were already much more prominent.",
        "Corporate default rates could increase measurably over the next twelve months.",
        "Third, although global stock markets had partly recovered the losses seen in late February and early March 2020 – the Euro Stoxx 50 index had risen by more than 20% since the PEPP announcement – there were signs that the significant remaining uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook continued to pose risks to current valuations.",
        "While expectations regarding short-term earnings growth over the next 12 months had declined substantially, longer-term earnings expectations had remained surprisingly resilient so far.",
        "Either investors were sanguine about the long-term repercussions of the crisis and expected a V-shaped recovery with no protracted effects on growth, or they were finding it difficult to price in the impact on growth and earnings from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "The amount of tail risk priced into the market, as reflected in option prices, suggested that the latter hypothesis could not be ruled out.",
        "At the same time, investors were less sanguine about the earnings prospects of banks.",
        "The total Euro Stoxx Banks index had fallen by around 50%, with the extent of losses on euro area bank shares not very different from that on US banks.",
        "Fourth, market-based funding conditions for banks were tightening in unsecured money markets, as could be observed from the increase over the past few weeks in the spread between the three-month EURIBOR and OIS rates, which had recently reached the widest level seen since 2012.",
        "These developments were likely to reflect, at least in part, remaining strains in the commercial paper market.",
        "New commercial paper issuance had remained limited to the shortest maturities owing to the withdrawal of some traditional buyers, most notably money market funds and corporations, in response to the deteriorating liquidity situation.",
        "However, current and future Eurosystem liquidity-providing operations, in combination with the collateral easing package, offered immediate relief from higher market-based funding costs, thereby safeguarding monetary policy transmission and keeping the bank lending channel open.",
        "In this environment, the new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) was highly attractive for a large part of the euro area banking sector, and market participants had doubled their expectations regarding take-up over recent weeks, to around €1.1 trillion in total.",
        "At the same time, expectations of further adjustments in the ECB’s key policy rates had subsided in recent weeks as the OIS forward curve had shifted up notably.",
        "Market-based measures of interest rate expectations were consistent with survey evidence, signalling no significant expectations of further cuts in the deposit facility rate.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, survey data signalled a sharp and deep economic downturn.",
        "The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) pointed to a sharp contraction in global activity in the first half of 2020, which was likely to be more pronounced than the trough observed during the great financial crisis.",
        "The global composite output PMI excluding the euro area had declined sharply from 52 in January to 45 in February, and further to 41 in March – with services being affected more strongly than manufacturing.",
        "Driven by supply chain disruptions and a massive demand shock, global trade was estimated to have fallen sharply as signalled, for example, by the substantial drop in the PMI for new manufacturing orders.",
        "Production disruptions had spread and were likely to weigh on global trade for some time to come.",
        "Amid considerable volatility, global financial conditions had remained broadly unchanged in advanced economies since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 11-12 March, but had tightened significantly compared with mid-February when the coronavirus had started to spread globally.",
        "Since that meeting oil prices had fallen by approximately 50% to below USD 20 per barrel, primarily due to the sudden collapse in demand owing to the coronavirus pandemic.",
        "The euro had weakened considerably against the US dollar but had depreciated only marginally in nominal effective terms since the 11-12 March monetary policy meeting.",
        "Turning to the euro area, the latest economic indicators and survey results covering the period since the coronavirus spread to the euro area showed an unprecedented decline, pointing to a significant contraction in economic activity and to rapidly deteriorating labour markets.",
        "The coronavirus pandemic and the associated containment measures had severely affected the manufacturing and services sectors, taking a toll on the productive capacity of the euro area economy and on domestic demand.",
        "In the first quarter of 2020, which was only partially affected by the spread of the coronavirus, euro area real GDP had decreased by 3.8%, quarter on quarter, reflecting the impact of the lockdown measures in the final weeks of the quarter.",
        "The sharp downturn in economic activity in April suggested that the impact was likely to be more severe in the second quarter.",
        "Looking beyond the immediate disruption stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, euro area growth was expected to resume as the containment measures were gradually lifted, supported by favourable financing conditions, the euro area fiscal stance and a resumption of global activity.",
        "Given the high level of uncertainty regarding the evolution of the pandemic, it was difficult to predict the likely extent and duration of the imminent recession and the subsequent recovery.",
        "However, without pre-empting the forthcoming Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which would be published in June, growth scenarios produced by ECB staff suggested that euro area GDP could fall by between 5% and 12% this year, followed by a recovery and normalisation of growth in subsequent years.",
        "The extent of the contraction and the recovery would depend crucially on the duration and the success of the containment measures, the extent to which supply capacity and domestic demand were permanently affected and the success of policies in mitigating the adverse impact on incomes and employment.",
        "Turning to euro area price developments, annual HICP inflation had decreased from 0.7% in March to 0.4% in April, largely driven by lower energy price inflation, but also by slightly lower HICP inflation excluding energy and food.",
        "On the basis of the sharp decline in current and futures prices for oil, headline inflation was likely to decline considerably further over the coming months and was expected to bottom out around June.",
        "The sharp downturn in economic activity was expected to have a downward impact on underlying inflation.",
        "However, the medium-term implications of the coronavirus pandemic for inflation were surrounded by high uncertainty, given that downward pressures linked to weaker demand could be partially offset by upward pressures related to more lasting damage to the supply side.",
        "Market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations had remained at depressed levels.",
        "While survey-based indicators of inflation expectations had declined for the short and medium term, indicators of longer-term expectations had been less affected.",
        "Regarding euro area financial conditions, the short end of the EONIA forward curve had remained broadly unchanged since 21 February, when international financial market turmoil had begun on the back of the global spread of the coronavirus.",
        "Overall, therefore, euro area long-term risk-free rates had remained broadly unchanged over this period.",
        "Stock prices had decreased substantially following the global spread of the coronavirus, despite some recent improvement in sentiment.",
        "With respect to financing conditions for non-financial corporations, there had been some limited tightening of financing costs and concerns over the availability of external financing.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, broad money (M3) growth had increased to 7.5% in March 2020, from 5.5% in February.",
        "Money growth reflected bank credit creation for the private sector, which was being driven to a large extent by drawing on credit lines, and low opportunity costs of holding M3 relative to other financial instruments, while heightened economic uncertainty appeared to have triggered a shift towards monetary holdings, likely for precautionary reasons.",
        "In this environment, the narrow monetary aggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth.",
        "Developments in loans to the private sector had also been shaped by the impact of the coronavirus crisis.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households had stood at 3.4% in March 2020, after 3.7% in February, while the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations had stood at 5.4% in March, after 3.0% in February.",
        "These developments were also clearly visible in the results of the euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2020, which indicated a surge in firms’ demand for loans and for drawing on credit lines to meet liquidity needs for working capital, while financing needs for fixed investment had declined.",
        "Demand for loans to households for house purchase had increased less than in the previous quarter.",
        "Credit standards for loans to firms had tightened slightly, while credit standards for loans to households had tightened more strongly.",
        "In both cases, this was related to the deterioration in the economic outlook and a decline in the creditworthiness of firms and households.",
        "At the same time, banks expected an easing of credit standards for loans to firms in the second quarter of 2020.",
        "The euro area fiscal stance was assessed to have become strongly expansionary as euro area countries had announced significant fiscal measures to cushion the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.",
        "Transfers to firms and households constituted the largest part of the packages of measures.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane remarked that the European and world economies were currently experiencing an extraordinary and severe economic contraction.",
        "Public healthcare measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus had halted many economic activities across the globe.",
        "The assessment of the most likely economic developments had been rendered more difficult than usual by the exceptionally high level of uncertainty.",
        "Scenario analysis was the best approach and the work of the ECB’s staff indicated that even a deep recession of around 5% in 2020 now appeared to be a benign outcome, with more severe scenarios projecting a contraction of up to 12% in GDP.",
        "At the same time, as the containment measures were gradually lifted, the Governing Council could expect a significant recovery in economic activity, although its speed and scale remained highly uncertain.",
        "The uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic and the economic consequences of the containment measures had resulted in turbulent financial market developments.",
        "There had been a sharp repricing of risk across asset categories and a generalised tightening of financial conditions.",
        "At the same time, the results of the latest euro area bank lending survey showed only a very mild net tightening of credit standards for firms.",
        "This tightening was significantly less pronounced than the tightening seen at the time of the financial and sovereign debt crises between 2008 and 2012, which was a sign that the ECB’s measures (together with the announcement in many countries of public credit guarantees and other support for firms and households) had so far largely protected bank-based credit flows.",
        "Inflation had declined as a result of the sharp fall in oil prices and the drop in services sector inflation.",
        "Market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained at very depressed levels, after recording new historical lows.",
        "Even though survey-based indicators of inflation expectations had also declined for the short and medium term, they had remained stable for the longer term.",
        "While monetary policy could not anticipate the point at which the economy would reopen, it could make sure that all the necessary conditions for a rebound were in place, in line with the easing of the containment measures.",
        "In particular, monetary policy measures had helped to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms (especially small and medium-sized enterprises – SMEs) and to maintain favourable financing conditions that benefited all sectors and jurisdictions.",
        "In addition to the Governing Council’s credit easing measures, the successful implementation of the PEPP – including its flexibility across jurisdictions throughout the duration of the programme – was critical in delivering the favourable financial conditions that were necessary to support the economy, in view of the severe risks both to the monetary policy transmission mechanism and to the outlook for the euro area posed by the coronavirus pandemic.",
        "The rapidly evolving situation needed to be reflected in an adjustment to the Governing Council’s monetary policy stance.",
        "Both the tail risks associated with the present macro-financial crisis and its scale were assessed to have deteriorated substantially since the monetary policy meetings on 11-12 March and on 18 March.",
        "The TLTRO III programme complemented the accommodative impact of the ECB’s other monetary policy measures, notably the asset purchase programmes.",
        "TLTRO III maintained the bank-based monetary transmission mechanism, funnelling the monetary easing associated with negative interest rates to those sectors that relied on access to bank credit.",
        "Accordingly, in finalising the revised design of the TLTRO III programme, Mr Lane proposed recalibrating the TLTRO III pricing.",
        "In particular, the interest rate on TLTRO III operations during the period from June 2020 to June 2021 would be reduced to 50 basis points below the average interest rate on the main refinancing operations prevailing over the same period.",
        "Moreover, for counterparties whose eligible net lending reached the lending performance threshold, the interest rate over the period from June 2020 to June 2021 would be lowered to 50 basis points below the average deposit facility rate prevailing over the same period.",
        "Mr Lane also proposed offering a new series of non-targeted pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) to support the liquidity conditions in the euro area financial system and contribute to preserving the smooth functioning of money markets by providing an effective liquidity backstop.",
        "The PELTROs would consist of seven additional refinancing operations commencing in May 2020 and maturing in a staggered sequence between July 2021 and September 2021 in line with the duration of the collateral easing measures.",
        "The operations would be carried out as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment, with an interest rate that was 25 basis points below the average rate on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations prevailing over the life of each PELTRO.",
        "Together with the substantial monetary policy stimulus already in place, these measures would support liquidity and funding conditions and would help to preserve the smooth provision of credit to the real economy.",
        "At the same time, the Governing Council needed to continuously evaluate each of its measures, both individually and as a package, to assess whether they were still adequately calibrated and appropriately sized to provide the necessary degree of accommodation in this uncertain economic environment.",
        "At the June meeting, more information would be available, including new Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "At that point, the Governing Council would have to stand ready to adjust the PEPP and potentially other instruments if it saw that the scale of the stimulus was falling short of what was needed.",
        "Regarding communication, it was proposed that the Governing Council should acknowledge that the available indicators suggested a very substantial contraction in economy activity in 2020, depending on the duration of the containment measures and the extent to which supply capacity and domestic demand were affected more permanently, and also on the combined success of fiscal, monetary and supervisory policies in mitigating the adverse impact on incomes and employment.",
        "It should be stressed that the decisive policy actions taken in mid-March had been effective in providing crucial support to the euro area economy and that, in view of the current rapidly evolving economic environment, the Governing Council would do everything necessary within its mandate to support all citizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time.",
        "It was fully prepared to adjust all of its measures, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in particular signalling that it was fully prepared to increase the size of the PEPP and adjust its composition as much as necessary and for as long as needed.",
        "Finally, the measures taken by euro area governments and the European institutions to ensure sufficient healthcare sector resources and to provide support to affected companies, workers and households were to be welcomed, while reiterating the need for continued and ambitious efforts, notably through joint and coordinated policy action, to guard against downside risks and in support of the recovery.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment, provided by Mr Lane in his introduction, of the current economic situation in the euro area and of the risks to activity.",
        "Members agreed that the incoming data since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meetings on 11-12 March and on 18 March allowed for a better assessment of the impact of the crisis on the euro area economy.",
        "In particular, reference was made in the discussion to the GDP releases for the first quarter of 2020 in a number of countries, which had just been published together with the euro area data.",
        "Moreover, survey-based indicators for the euro area, covering both businesses and consumers, had fallen very sharply in March and April to stand at very low levels.",
        "It was now clear that the euro area economy was heading towards a decline in activity that was unprecedented in recent history.",
        "This could be demonstrated by comparing the scenarios for growth in the event of an intensification of the crisis presented in the March 2020 ECB staff projections with the various scenarios by ECB staff presented at the current meeting.",
        "It was clear that the June 2020 Eurosystem staff projections would be revised down significantly compared with the March 2020 ECB staff projections, and that the current situation could prove to be more disruptive than the global financial crisis.",
        "The point was made that the present situation was characterised by Knightian or “radical” uncertainty, implying unquantifiable risks.",
        "Against this background, drawing on a range of scenarios was considered warranted in circumstances where the outlook for the euro area was subject to exceptional uncertainty.",
        "Members expressed appreciation for the scenario analysis conducted by ECB staff, while registering some reservations on the prospect of the scenarios becoming rapidly outdated in the light of evolving conditions.",
        "Although different views were expressed about these scenarios, it was generally considered that, of the three scenarios presented, the “mild” scenario was probably already too optimistic.",
        "While it was agreed that in the ongoing projection round the economic outlook would have to be revised down drastically compared with the March ECB staff projections, it also had to be acknowledged that the extent and duration of the coronavirus pandemic could not be foreseen and the current crisis, which emanated from outside the economy, was very different from previous crises.",
        "The longer the lockdown measures were in place, the more serious the impact on activity and prices would be.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that the economic effects of the pandemic would continue for a considerable period after the coronavirus was contained, as the decline in demand owing to precautionary motives or to income losses could be expected to weigh on economic activity, leading to a slow recovery.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that precautionary saving was already increasing and, if consumers did not regain confidence quickly after containment measures were lifted, there was a risk that demand would remain depressed.",
        "It was also to be expected that containment measures would stay in place for some time, at least until a vaccine was available.",
        "Uncertainty could also adversely affect investment behaviour.",
        "As demand was considered likely to recover only gradually, a swift V-shaped recovery could probably already be ruled out at this stage.",
        "At the same time, the comment was made that it was too early to conclude that the “severe” scenario presented by ECB staff was the most likely.",
        "It was emphasised that the outlook and the strength of the recovery would depend critically on the actions of EU Member States and the European Union, and the strength of the overall policy response.",
        "It was also difficult to predict the extent to which entrepreneurial spirit and innovative thinking about how to conduct business in this new environment might emerge.",
        "In this context, it was also recalled that the largest shock to activity in the euro area would likely have been in April, and that in May there should be some improvement owing to a relaxation of some of the containment measures.",
        "Looking beyond the immediate disruption stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, euro area growth could be expected to resume as the containment measures were gradually lifted, supported by favourable financing conditions, the euro area fiscal stance and a resumption of global activity.",
        "It was considered that even more attention than usual should be paid to differences across sectors, as some sectors were particularly exposed to the impact of social distancing measures.",
        "Moreover, although the coronavirus was a common shock that had severely affected all euro area jurisdictions, further discussion was needed about the impact on individual countries, which was likely to be heterogeneous (e.g.",
        "in the case of euro area countries with greater reliance on tourism).",
        "Members expressed concern about the possibility of non-linear effects amplifying the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on activity, although these were difficult to quantify.",
        "In the discussion, reference was made in particular to the impact of the economic downturn on the liquidity and solvency situation of firms, the prospect of higher levels of non-performing loans and the consequences for the banking sector.",
        "The development of fiscal positions and concerns about rising public debt were also mentioned in this context, as well as the nexus between banks and sovereigns.",
        "However, it was suggested that the probability of such risks occurring would depend on the strength of the recovery in 2021, which would in turn depend on the policy responses.",
        "In particular, it was argued that the likelihood of a self-reinforcing downward spiral was contained owing to the stabilising effect of the far-reaching fiscal and monetary policy support measures that had been adopted by euro area governments and the ECB, as well as globally.",
        "In addition, it was remarked that, to the extent that timely, targeted and temporary measures were effective in addressing acute liquidity shortfalls, they should limit adverse longer-term implications for public and private debt sustainability.",
        "Members also emphasised the possible impact of the pandemic on foreign trade, including the effect of changes in the future structure of global production, and the risks surrounding the speed and strength of the recovery in emerging market economies given their reliance on raw materials.",
        "There was a risk of being too optimistic about the recovery in these economies, and it was considered that they could be the source of a number of downside risks to the outlook to the real economy that should be closely monitored.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, members welcomed the measures taken by euro area governments and the European institutions to ensure sufficient healthcare resources and to provide support to affected companies, workers and households.",
        "At the same time, continuous and ambitious efforts were needed, notably through joint and coordinated policy action, to guard against downside risks and to underpin the recovery.",
        "An ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance was critical in view of the sharp correction in the euro area economy.",
        "Measures taken should, as much as possible, be targeted and temporary in nature in response to the pandemic emergency.",
        "The endorsement by the European Council of the Eurogroup agreement on the three safety nets for workers, businesses and sovereigns, amounting to a package worth €540 billion, was welcomed.",
        "At the same time, it was felt that further strong and timely efforts were urgently needed to prepare and support the recovery.",
        "In this regard, members welcomed the European Council agreement to work towards a recovery fund dedicated to dealing with the unprecedented crisis.",
        "It was noted that euro area governments had implemented ambitious policy packages and that these packages were needed in the current circumstances to reduce the risk of what should be a temporary shock becoming a more permanent one.",
        "However, this would lead to a very significant increase in the financing needs of all euro area countries, which should, in principle, imply only a one-off increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio, but could also lead to higher financing needs for several years.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Members agreed that the outlook for headline inflation in the short term had to be revised down, reflecting not only the reduction in oil prices but also the expectation of lower underlying inflation.",
        "It was argued that in 2020 the downward impact on prices of weaker demand would clearly be stronger than supply-side effects.",
        "However, in an exchange of views about the likely impact of the pandemic on the outlook for price developments in the medium to long term, it was emphasised that this would depend on a number of factors and could be considered more ambiguous, with the overall net effect depending on the balance between increasing slack and lower aggregate demand, and the possible long-term adverse impact on aggregate supply capacity.",
        "At the same time, it was possible that the pandemic could have a prolonged negative effect on demand, in which case the output gap might remain large, putting downward pressure on prices for some time to come.",
        "A remark was made that the negative effect of the pandemic on the supply side of the economy, and on potential growth, might even not lead to upward price pressures but to further negative demand effects, such as those associated with debt deflation.",
        "However, it was also noted that inflation had in the past shown a high degree of persistence and there could be upward pressure on prices from the costs of containment measures and supply disruptions, as well as from a number of structural effects following the pandemic.",
        "These were seen to include the exit of firms from the market and associated changes in the degree of competition, lasting changes in supply chains and the location of production, and increasing emphasis on resilience, leading to higher buffers and inventories.",
        "There could also be tighter limits to production as the spatial distribution of global production changed.",
        "Reference was also made in the discussion to the problem of measuring inflation accurately in the current circumstances, taking into account changes in the composition of purchases of goods, as well as the impaired ability to collect price data and uncertainty about how prices would be imputed in the absence of actual price data.",
        "All of this would make it more difficult to assess, with any precision, the situation with respect to inflation.",
        "In discussing recent developments in inflation expectations, members noted that short-term inflation expectations according to the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) had been revised down sharply, to stand at 0.4% for 2020.",
        "At the same time, SPF inflation expectations for 2021 and 2022 had been revised down by much less, and survey-based longer-term inflation expectations had so far not been affected by the coronavirus crisis, remaining at 1.7% for headline inflation.",
        "Market-based indicators of inflation expectations remained at very low levels and had fallen further in the euro area, with the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead posting a new record low of 0.72%.",
        "The point was made that inflation expectations appeared to be reacting more to developments in actual inflation, which could be taken as an indicator that inflation expectations were becoming less well anchored.",
        "Moreover, inflation had remained below the ECB’s inflation aim for an extended period.",
        "It was highlighted that, since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the likelihood of inflation being below zero, or below 1%, according to option-implied probabilities, had increased substantially, pointing to a significant risk of deflation or very low inflation in the coming years.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members broadly concurred with the assessment, provided by Mr Lane in his introduction, that the increase in broad money growth mostly reflected a rise in loans to non-financial corporations that was driven to a large extent by drawing on credit lines.",
        "These developments were also clearly visible in the results of the euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2020, which indicated a surge in firms’ demand for loans and for drawing on credit lines to meet liquidity needs for working capital, while financing needs for fixed investment had declined.",
        "The latest results of the bank lending survey also showed only a very mild net tightening of credit standards for firms, whereas interim results from the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE) suggested that SMEs had registered a significant deterioration in their access to external finance owing to the unfavourable evolution of their own financial prospects.",
        "It was stressed that, while increased lending was a welcome development, it raised the level of risk-weighted assets on banks’ balance sheets and lowered capital ratios, which could induce banks to restrict lending eventually.",
        "In that context, public loan guarantees were seen as a crucial element in maintaining credit flows to firms and households.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members shared the view that financial market developments had been volatile since the Governing Council’s previous regular monetary policy meeting in March, with a sharp repricing of risk across asset categories, especially around mid-March, which had been partly reversed subsequently as described by Ms Schnabel in her introduction.",
        "Financial conditions had tightened overall since the outbreak of the pandemic despite the measures taken by the Governing Council, whereas it was felt that, in the light of the darkened outlook, an easing would have been appropriate.",
        "Liquidity premia had remained elevated across jurisdictions and term funding markets for banks had still not fully reopened.",
        "Concerns were also voiced about the increasing spread between the EURIBOR and OIS rates, as the EURIBOR represented an important benchmark for pricing loans.",
        "Although equity prices had recovered recently, it was remarked that this improvement was not grounded in improved fundamentals.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the risk of higher real interest rates if expected inflation continued to decline.",
        "The view was widely shared that the Governing Council’s monetary policy measures taken in March, and reinforced by decisions taken on the collateral framework in April, had provided forceful monetary accommodation in a rapidly evolving environment and succeeded in safeguarding the ECB’s monetary policy stance and effective monetary policy transmission across the euro area, which included countering unwarranted increases in risk premia.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that undue risks of fragmentation could re-emerge with a further worsening of the economic outlook.",
        "It was underlined that past experience showed that a loss of confidence in financial markets had to be avoided and pre-emptive action was preferable.",
        "Financial amplification mechanisms, such as those triggered by illiquid corporations or banks, could affect the real economy in a non-linear way and increase deflationary risks.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that monetary policy was not able to address these problems on its own and that fiscal policy also needed to play an essential role.",
        "Overall, it was felt that the longer the crisis endured, the more the risk of financial amplification effects would increase.",
        "Members agreed that the rapidly evolving situation had to be reflected in a further adjustment to the Governing Council’s monetary policy stance as both the scale and the associated tail risks of the macro-financial crisis had grown substantially since the March monetary policy meetings.",
        "Against this background, members broadly supported the monetary policy measures proposed by Mr Lane in his introduction, namely, first, to recalibrate the TLTRO III pricing by reducing the interest rate on TLTRO III operations during the period from June 2020 to June 2021, and second, to offer a new series of non-targeted pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) to support liquidity conditions in the euro area financial system and contribute to preserving the smooth functioning of money markets by providing an effective liquidity backstop.",
        "The proposed amendments to the TLTRO III parameters were considered to be well suited to enhancing the accommodative stance of monetary policy.",
        "It was widely felt that the attractive pricing of TLTRO III operations – in conjunction with government guarantees to banks – helped to provide incentives to maintain lending at a time when banks were facing challenges to reach their lending benchmarks and also counteracted pressures on bank lending rates resulting from recent increases in the EURIBOR.",
        "At the same time, a concern was expressed that lowering the minimum rate in the TLTRO III operations to 50 basis points below the deposit facility rate could open up the possibility for banks to obtain funds in the TLTRO III operations and then deposit them at the deposit facility rate instead of increasing their lending to the private sector.",
        "Members welcomed the proposal to conduct a new series of non-targeted longer-term refinancing operations to address the pandemic emergency.",
        "These PELTROs would consist of seven additional refinancing operations commencing in May 2020 and maturing in a staggered sequence between July 2021 and September 2021, in line with the duration of the Governing Council’s collateral easing measures.",
        "The provision of term funding without the operational complexity associated with TLTRO III was seen as important in providing funding for banks at attractive conditions and in helping to preserve the smooth functioning of money markets.",
        "Overall, with a broad range of measures already in place, the Governing Council’s monetary policy response was considered to have been suitable and forceful so far and, including the additional measures under consideration, was providing ample liquidity to banks and appropriate monetary stimulus to all sectors of the euro area economy.",
        "Looking ahead, and in the light of the high uncertainty surrounding the economic and inflation outlook as shown in the scenarios prepared by ECB staff, it was stressed that the ECB needed to stand ready to adjust its monetary policy stance as appropriate and also to ensure the functioning of transmission across the euro area.",
        "This was widely seen to include ensuring favourable financing conditions and addressing downside risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole, including those resulting from negative real-financial feedback loops, as well as preventing fragmentation.",
        "The policy measures taken in response to the crisis, most notably the PEPP, had been essential and had limited the likelihood of a self-reinforcing downward spiral.",
        "Although the announcement of the PEPP had been followed by a decrease in sovereign bond yields, it was observed that a reversal had taken place subsequently and some yields were currently higher than before the start of the crisis.",
        "National governments had announced ambitious fiscal packages that would entail a significant increase in financing needs for all euro area countries for several years.",
        "Members widely agreed that, to make the most effective use of the PEPP and to support financing conditions that were consistent with the Governing Council’s policy aim, purchases under the PEPP should use all the flexibility that was built into the programme to ward off severe risks to the smooth functioning of monetary transmission.",
        "The concern was voiced that large-scale interventions in sovereign bond markets could give rise to the risk of “fiscal dominance” and that the programme had to be executed carefully in order not to encourage irresponsible behaviour on the part of governments.",
        "However, it was also underlined that this was by no means a justification for the Governing Council not to fulfil its price stability mandate and support monetary policy transmission.",
        "This included addressing self-fulfilling redenomination risk and fragmentation in the event that these risks were to rise.",
        "In this context, it was remarked that the PEPP, like the asset purchase programme (APP), worked by extracting duration risk from asset markets, with the objective of preserving financing conditions that were consistent with a return of inflation towards levels in line with the ECB’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "To ensure compatibility with the ECB’s mandate, it was underlined that price stability always needed to be kept to the fore, while government debt issuance and the evolution of structural deficits had to be monitored closely.",
        "With respect to communication, members broadly agreed with the elements put forward by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "It was stressed that the decisive policy actions taken in mid-March had been effective in providing crucial support to the euro area economy.",
        "Moreover, the Governing Council stood ready to adjust all of its measures, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner.",
        "It was fully prepared to increase the size of the PEPP and adjust its composition, and potentially its other instruments, if, in the light of information that became available before its June meeting, it judged that the scale of the stimulus was falling short of what was needed.",
        "The Governing Council highlighted its willingness to adapt its tools and to implement them forcefully as needed and continued to stand ready to take bold, innovative action to safeguard the smooth functioning of the transmission mechanism and the integrity of Monetary Union, aiming to support the economic recovery and delivering on the ECB’s medium-term price stability objective.",
        "In this context it was deemed important to stress the flexibility of PEPP implementation.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the following monetary policy decisions: The Governing Council was fully prepared to increase the size of the PEPP and adjust its composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed.",
        "In any case, it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "Finally, the Governing Council took note that further details on the amendments made to the terms of TLTRO III and on the new PELTROs would be published in dedicated press releases at the end of the press conference.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 15-16 July 2020.",
        "The functioning of euro area financial markets had, by and large, been restored.",
        "Stress symptoms had largely dissipated and liquidity had returned to the market.",
        "The Composite Indicator of Systemic Stress (CISS) remained only marginally higher than before the coronavirus (COVID-19) period, with the difference primarily being driven by still elevated volatility, particularly in stock markets.",
        "Financial conditions had also improved broadly in the euro area.",
        "The GDP-weighted government bond curve had shifted further down and had returned to its pre-crisis level.",
        "Large parts of the curve were again in negative territory and very close to the lowest level ever recorded.",
        "Government bond spreads too had reached, or were close to, their pre-crisis levels and investment-grade corporate bond spreads had fallen by nearly 20 basis points since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "High-yield bond spreads had even fallen by nearly 50 basis points.",
        "One factor that might explain the general resilience of financial markets was the growing divergence between the number of COVID-19 fatalities, which remained stable at low levels, and the number of new infections, which had more than tripled since the beginning of August 2020.",
        "Many market participants believed that this divergence – if it were to persist – would lower the risk of widespread lockdowns, resulting in less of a downside risk to economic activity.",
        "It was notable that there was a growing dispersion in the extent of easing of financial conditions across advanced economies, with the euro area lagging behind.",
        "The dispersion could largely be explained by two factors, namely developments in global stock markets and shifts in exchange rates.",
        "Even after the developments of the past few days, the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock market index was still up by around 50% from its mid-March 2020 trough and remained above pre-crisis levels.",
        "Chinese stocks were also trading well above pre-pandemic levels.",
        "In the euro area, by contrast, stock prices had increased by only around 32% since mid-March 2020 and remained well below pre-crisis levels.",
        "Idiosyncratic factors could partially explain these divergences.",
        "One factor was the sectoral composition of stock markets as, despite the recent correction, the technology sector continued to benefit most from the pandemic.",
        "Technology stocks had a larger weight in the United States than in the euro area.",
        "A second factor was the fall in equity risk premia that had contributed substantially to the rise in valuations in the United States.",
        "In the euro area, the reversal in risk premia had been slower.",
        "Differences in portfolio rebalancing might have contributed to the divergence in risk premia.",
        "Over the summer real interest rates had declined notably faster in the United States than in the euro area.",
        "Real ten-year US Treasury yields were currently close to historical lows and, for the first time since 2013, were lower than equivalent yields in the euro area.",
        "Empirical evidence suggested that a marginal increase in inflation expectations tended to raise stock valuations, and this effect was considerably greater when real rates were in negative territory.",
        "Negative real yields also reduced the opportunity cost of holding a zero-coupon asset such as gold, which helped explain in part why gold prices had increased so strongly over the course of this year.",
        "Furthermore, declining real rates were also likely to have accelerated the depreciation of the US dollar.",
        "The euro nominal effective exchange rate had been on an upward trend since the crisis had struck, driven to a large extent by the euro’s appreciation against the US dollar.",
        "Thus far the euro had appreciated by some 7% against the US dollar from its pre-pandemic level.",
        "Investors tended to reduce their holdings of US dollar-denominated debt securities when break-even inflation rates increased, and this effect was also stronger when real rates were in negative territory.",
        "More specifically, model-based analysis identified two main drivers behind the recent shifts in exchange rates.",
        "The first and most important one was the substantial improvement in global risk sentiment, i.e.",
        "the reversal of previous safe-haven flows into the United States.",
        "The decisive policy actions taken by euro area governments to fight the crisis had likely contributed to the improvement in risk sentiment.",
        "A second driver was likely related to monetary policies implemented in the United States and the euro area, in part reflecting differences in conventional policy space before the pandemic.",
        "Looking ahead, market positioning remained tilted towards further euro appreciation, with net speculative US dollar positions against advanced economy currencies, including the euro, remaining sizeable.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, the widespread collapse of activity in the second quarter had been followed by a significant rebound – but not yet a full recovery of the economy, as gaps remained.",
        "Such a pattern of developments was seen around the world.",
        "Global trade had posted a double-digit decline in the second quarter.",
        "In line with global activity, trade had also been recovering recently.",
        "While, by and large, risks to global activity and trade remained on the downside, there were also some upside risks.",
        "Financial conditions had continued to ease in advanced and emerging economies since the Governing Council’s July monetary policy meeting.",
        "One important factor behind the rally in global risk assets was related to positive global macroeconomic surprises – as reflected in the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for advanced economies, which stood at an all-time high.",
        "In addition, risk sentiment had improved.",
        "In particular, investors and forecasters had become more optimistic about the prospects for the early availability of a vaccine.",
        "Since the July monetary policy meeting the recovery in oil prices seemed to have stalled, with prices declining by 9.0% – driven by a combination of decelerating demand growth and higher supply.",
        "The euro had continued to appreciate against the US dollar (+3.8%) and in nominal effective terms (+1.7%) against a trade-weighted basket of 42 currencies.",
        "The appreciation of the euro resulted, in part, from the broad weakness of the US dollar.",
        "Turning to the euro area economy, real GDP had contracted by 11.8%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2020.",
        "Incoming data and survey results pointed to a strong rebound in GDP growth in the third quarter – in line with short-term forecasts that included high-frequency data.",
        "Recently, momentum had slowed in the services sector compared with the manufacturing sector, which was also visible in survey results for August.",
        "Looking at the components of GDP in more detail, consumer spending had increased strongly since April, but its recovery remained far from complete.",
        "Survey data indicated that the perceived lack of demand was increasingly becoming a drag on investment – in particular business investment – in the second and third quarters of 2020.",
        "In the labour market, the adjustment in employment and unemployment had been relatively sluggish.",
        "In part this reflected an increase in inactivity, which was likely linked to the suddenness of the loss of employment in March and April.",
        "Most of the adjustment in the labour market had stemmed from a decline in average hours worked, which mainly reflected the impact of job retention schemes.",
        "Looking ahead, although surveys and high-frequency indicators had improved recently, they still pointed to employment losses in the third quarter, despite the effect of the labour market policies in place.",
        "Turning to euro area price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation had decreased from 0.4% in July to −0.2% in August (according to Eurostat’s flash estimate).",
        "Overall, the latest readings of measures of underlying inflation pointed to a moderate weakening.",
        "Looking at inflation developments in recent months in more detail, energy inflation had continued to be a drag on euro area inflation, as oil prices were still at low levels, implying very negative year-on-year rates of energy inflation.",
        "However, it was notable that services inflation – which was much more closely linked to domestic developments and had a high wage content – had also declined further, falling from 1.2% in June to 0.9% in July and 0.7% in August.",
        "On the basis of current and futures prices for oil and taking into account the temporary reduction in the German VAT rate, euro area headline inflation was likely to remain negative over the coming months before turning positive again in early 2021.",
        "Moreover, in the near term price pressures were expected to remain subdued owing to weak demand, lower wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate, despite some upward price pressures related to supply constraints.",
        "Turning to wage developments, the large take-up of the short-time work and temporary lay-off schemes had led to a strong divergence between growth in compensation per employee and growth in compensation per hour in the first and second quarters of 2020.",
        "Negotiated wage growth, allowing for one-off effects, had declined only moderately thus far but stood clearly below the levels reached in 2018 and 2019.",
        "Market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations had returned to their pre-pandemic levels, but the increase had been much smaller than in the United States and they still remained at very subdued levels.",
        "Survey-based measures generally remained at low levels.",
        "Turning to financial conditions in the euro area, the EONIA forward curve remained slightly inverted, but there were no firm expectations of a cut in the deposit facility rate.",
        "Longer-term risk-free rates remained at low levels amid a further decline in real rates.",
        "In sovereign debt markets, fragmentation had receded, which had led to a further narrowing of sovereign spreads.",
        "Markets for risky assets had remained broadly stable overall, while the easing trend in financial conditions had been halted by the appreciation of the euro.",
        "Regarding money and credit, broad money (M3) growth had continued to rise, reaching 10.2% in July 2020, after 9.2% in June.",
        "Strong money growth reflected domestic credit creation and the ongoing asset purchases by the Eurosystem, as well as a heightened preference for liquidity in the money-holding sector.",
        "In this environment, the narrow monetary aggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth.",
        "Following strong increases during the early months of the pandemic, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations had remained broadly stable in July, standing at 7.0%.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households, which had stood at 3.0% in July, had remained stable since April 2020.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance was expected to be strongly expansionary in 2020, with most of the additional spending comprising transfers to firms and households.",
        "Additional expansionary fiscal measures could be expected over the coming months – by Member States but also in the context of the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane remarked that the incoming data indicated a strong rebound in activity, following the record decline in output of 11.8%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2020 and the cumulative decline of 15.1% in the first half of 2020.",
        "The speed of the rebound was broadly in line with the expected pace set out in the June 2020 projections.",
        "However, the recovery was asymmetric, being further advanced in the manufacturing sector than in the services sector.",
        "Moreover, momentum in the services sector had slowed somewhat recently.",
        "Consumer spending had increased, but accumulated savings remained high and households were likely to remain cautious, especially in the context of the expected deterioration in labour market conditions.",
        "The data suggested a partial recovery in euro area business investment, even though firms were likely to cancel or postpone investment plans in an environment of heightened uncertainty, spare capacity and weaker balance sheets.",
        "The September ECB staff macroeconomic projections signalled that output would rebound in the third and fourth quarters by 8.4% and 3.1% respectively.",
        "Growth was foreseen to average −8.0%, 5.0% and 3.2% in 2020, 2021 and 2022 respectively.",
        "Only towards the end of the projection horizon was output projected to return to its pre-pandemic level.",
        "Euro area HICP inflation had fallen to −0.2% in August, from 0.4% in July, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate.",
        "Underlying this sharp decline was a fall in inflation excluding food and energy, which had declined from 1.2% to an all-time low of 0.4%.",
        "While temporary factors had distorted the August figure, underlying price pressures had likely weakened owing to subdued demand and significant labour market slack.",
        "Near-term price pressures were expected to remain subdued, in part owing to the recent appreciation of the euro exchange rate.",
        "Since the July monetary policy meeting, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had continued to recover from the historical lows reached in mid-March, but remained at very depressed levels.",
        "Survey-based measures remained well above market-based measures, but were still at historical lows.",
        "Close monitoring of inflation expectations remained warranted, since there was a clear risk that the negative shock to the path of inflation as a result of the pandemic could give rise to a renewed downward trend in inflation expectations.",
        "In the near term the earlier collapse in oil prices and the temporary reduction in the VAT rate in Germany implied negative rates of euro area headline inflation for the rest of 2020.",
        "However, base effects in the energy component and, to a lesser extent, the reversal of the VAT rate cut in Germany, would generate a mechanical rebound in 2021.",
        "Inflation was expected to remain persistently low over the medium term, notwithstanding a gradual pick-up over the projection horizon.",
        "The September ECB staff projections foresaw an increase in headline inflation from 0.3% in 2020 to 1.0% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2022.",
        "The unchanged projection for inflation in 2022 masked an upward revision to core inflation (reflecting the positive impact of monetary and fiscal policy measures).",
        "However, the scale of the upward revision to core inflation was muted by the appreciation of the euro.",
        "Headline inflation in 2022 did not increase, as the upward revision to core inflation was offset by the changed profile of the path of energy price inflation.",
        "Valuations of risky assets had continued to recover across the globe, driven by a combination of positive data surprises and strong policy actions.",
        "In the euro area, the stock market had been resilient and bond spreads had declined.",
        "The composite financing costs for non-financial firms (including the cost of bank borrowing) had continued to decrease.",
        "There had been a marked appreciation of the euro exchange rate since July.",
        "While the appreciation to some extent reflected improvements in global risk sentiment, as well as euro area factors such as the NGEU recovery plan, it also reflected developments in monetary conditions in the euro area relative to the rest of the world.",
        "The ECB’s monetary policy measures were providing crucial support to the recovery of the euro area economy.",
        "The paths of both output and inflation would have been lower than foreseen in the September projections, had the ECB not recalibrated the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in June.",
        "In addition, the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) had been a major force behind the declining path of bank lending rates.",
        "The outlook remained surrounded by high uncertainty and the balance of risks continued to be tilted to the downside.",
        "While the NGEU recovery plan was a positive development, uncertainty about the evolution of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the potential materialisation of adverse real-financial feedback loops called for vigilance.",
        "Over the coming months additional information would help to inform the direction of policy.",
        "This included tracking the underlying dynamics of the pandemic, developments in negotiations on the post-transition Brexit arrangements and decisions on fiscal plans.",
        "Against this background, at the present meeting Mr Lane proposed to leave the overall monetary policy stance unchanged and to reconfirm the full set of existing monetary policy measures.",
        "At the same time, there was no room for complacency.",
        "Inflation had been persistently below levels consistent with the Governing Council’s inflation aim and inflation expectations remained close to their historical lows, amplifying risks to the anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations.",
        "It followed that the Governing Council should monitor the incoming data very carefully with regard to their implications for the economy and the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "It was important to stand ready to adjust all of the instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with the commitment to symmetry.",
        "In its public communication the Governing Council needed to: With regard to the economic analysis, members generally agreed with the assessment of the current economic outlook for the euro area and the risks to activity provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Incoming data and survey results indicated a continued recovery of the euro area economy and pointed to a strong rebound in GDP growth in the third quarter.",
        "At the same time, the level of activity remained well below the levels prevailing before the pandemic.",
        "Uncertainty related to the evolution of the pandemic would likely dampen the strength of the recovery in the labour market and in consumption and investment, but the euro area economy should be supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a strengthening in global activity and demand.",
        "This assessment was also broadly reflected in the September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area.",
        "Annual real GDP growth was projected to fall by 8% in 2020 and to increase by 5% in 2021 and 3.2% in 2022.",
        "As regards the external environment, members broadly shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "It was noted that while there had been an upward revision to global activity and foreign demand for 2020 in the September projections, there had not been an upward revision to euro area trade, which could point to a small upside risk.",
        "However, there were also a number of downside risks – including the probability of a no-deal Brexit, which seemed to be increasing.",
        "With respect to the recent volatility in the euro exchange rate, it was noted that developments in the nominal effective exchange rate were to some extent being driven by a broad-based improvement in risk sentiment and a reduction in “flight-to-safety” flows, in part reflecting more favourable developments in the euro area as well as weakness in the US dollar.",
        "Relative changes in the monetary policy in the United States and the euro area were also seen as an important driver.",
        "While it was noted that the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro was above the level recorded in 2018, it was suggested that it was the pace of the euro’s appreciation, rather than the level of the exchange rate, that could become a concern.",
        "At the current stage, however, it was not clear how persistent recent movements in the exchange rate would be, with volatility being high and the potential for movements in both directions.",
        "Members agreed that the incoming data for the euro area since the finalisation of the June 2020 Eurosystem staff projections had been broadly in line with previous expectations.",
        "The slump in activity in the second quarter had actually been somewhat less pronounced than feared and real GDP growth in the third quarter was likely to turn out higher than expected.",
        "There were indications that, in the absence of lockdowns, activity – and especially domestic consumption – would improve markedly in the third quarter, but the extent to which the pace of the recovery would be sustained throughout the rest of the year was less clear.",
        "Recently, momentum had slowed in the services sector compared with the manufacturing sector, which was also visible in the survey results for August.",
        "High-frequency indicators, such as data on labour mobility patterns, as well as the Purchasing Managers’ Index for the services sector, were signalling more subdued activity and retail sales had lost some momentum.",
        "Weaker demand for services was also seen in lower services inflation.",
        "While the pandemic was a common shock across euro area countries, references were made to the heterogeneity of developments in activity across countries, which could be attributed to differences in the evolution of the virus, to the containment measures and fiscal policy responses implemented in each country, and to the structure of each economy.",
        "These factors were considered likely to continue to cause divergence in the period ahead.",
        "In this context, NGEU funds were seen as important in helping to create a more level playing field, as the scope for national fiscal measures differed across countries.",
        "In discussing the outlook for growth embedded in the September ECB staff projections, it was considered important to avoid being either unduly optimistic or unduly pessimistic.",
        "The June Eurosystem staff projections had been produced near the trough of the crisis.",
        "Since then there had been a noticeable improvement, with growth revised upwards for the second quarter of this year and for 2020 as a whole.",
        "The risk of the severe scenario outlined in June had receded.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that the September projections were broadly in line with the June projections only as a result of the policy measures that had been taken and without these measures the outlook for growth and inflation would have been much worse.",
        "It was also noted that real GDP and potential output were both foreseen to be lower at the end of the projection horizon than had been anticipated a year earlier, pointing to the prospect of permanent losses arising from the pandemic.",
        "Members stressed that the degree of uncertainty remained exceptionally high.",
        "High economic uncertainty was seen to weigh on consumption, with the level of precautionary savings in particular being dependent on developments in household confidence.",
        "Lingering uncertainty surrounding the fallout from the pandemic could have the effect of keeping household savings elevated for some time.",
        "Given the uncertainty surrounding the outlook, the latest projections again included two alternative scenarios.",
        "The remark was made that the degree of uncertainty reflected in the gap at the end of the horizon between the level of GDP in the mild scenario and the level in the severe scenario was higher than in the June 2020 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "However, the view was also expressed that confidence in the baseline scenario had increased notably compared with June and there was also increased confidence that governments would do what was needed to stabilise the economy in the event of future adverse shocks.",
        "It was noted that while the baseline scenario assumed that the virus was largely under control, there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the future evolution of the pandemic and the development of a vaccine.",
        "It was argued that the severe scenario could not be entirely ruled out as there had been a new wave of infections, even if it had not so far been as lethal as the first wave.",
        "Many countries were now experiencing new outbreaks of the virus.",
        "In some parts of the euro area, the resurgence of the virus was assessed to be affecting the recovery and the probability that other countries would have further outbreaks was seen as very high.",
        "Alongside a resurgence of the virus, the winter months could be expected to be more challenging from a medical perspective.",
        "It was also underlined that it would take some time for a vaccine to become widely available and until that point concerns over the economy would remain.",
        "A more positive assessment regarding the future pattern of private consumption was based on the view that people would learn to live with the virus.",
        "There was now also greater confidence that governments could prevent their health systems being overwhelmed and that they could contain the spread of the virus without a full lockdown and the ensuing severe harm to the economy.",
        "Reference was also made to the large stock of accumulated household savings, which could be drawn down more quickly than foreseen in the staff projections and underpin a rebound in consumption growth in the coming years.",
        "An upside risk to growth and to the labour market was seen as emanating from fiscal policy, as several governments had decided on, or were currently discussing, additional measures that were not incorporated in the current projections.",
        "It was noted that the labour market had been shielded from the slump in activity through the use of labour market support schemes and governments had shown their willingness to extend these schemes where necessary.",
        "There was also a more determined approach to the crisis at the European level and the September baseline did not include the additional expenditure that could be expected from the NGEU programme.",
        "Generally, it was felt that more time was needed to better understand the possible impact, including the timing, of fiscal stimulus at the domestic and European levels.",
        "It was widely underlined that fiscal support was critical, should arrive as early as possible and should not be withdrawn too soon.",
        "At the same time, debt sustainability considerations meant that it was important for fiscal expansion to be temporary and well targeted, in particular aimed at improving productivity and sustainable economic growth.",
        "Reference was also made to the risk of debt deflation in the period ahead, given the increase in private and public sector indebtedness, and concern was expressed about possible “cliff effects” as fiscal and supervisory measures came to an end, with the risk of financial amplification associated with increasing insolvencies and higher non-performing loans, notably in the non-financial corporate sector.",
        "While adverse financial amplification effects had to some extent been included in the September staff projections with regard to bank lending rates, the swift rebound in business investment foreseen in the baseline might appear optimistic, in part in view of the strong preference of firms for liquidity.",
        "However, it was also noted that the emerging risk of insolvencies could be addressed by governments, with shortfalls in liquidity and capital being dealt with through existing government programmes.",
        "Overall, the balance of risks to the euro area growth outlook was seen to remain on the downside.",
        "This assessment largely reflected the still uncertain economic and financial implications of the pandemic.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, there was wide agreement that an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remained critical in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy.",
        "Fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should as much as possible be targeted and temporary in nature.",
        "The three safety nets endorsed by the European Council for workers, businesses and sovereigns, amounting to €540 billion, provided important funding support in this context.",
        "The members of the Governing Council also strongly welcomed the NGEU package of €750 billion, which had the potential to significantly support the regions and sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, strengthen the Single Market and build a lasting and prosperous recovery.",
        "Members emphasised that in order for the NGEU package to fully achieve its potential, it would need to be firmly rooted in sound structural policies conceived and implemented at the national level in order to ensure strong ownership.",
        "Well-designed structural policies could contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery from the crisis, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area.",
        "Targeted structural policies were particularly important to revitalise euro area economies, with a focus on boosting investment in priority areas such as the green and digital transitions.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation had decreased to −0.2% in August 2020, after 0.4% in July, reflecting lower contributions from the food, non-energy industrial goods and services components.",
        "On the basis of current and futures prices for oil, and taking into account the temporary reduction in the German VAT rate, headline inflation was likely to remain negative over the coming months before turning positive again in early 2021.",
        "Moreover, in the near term price pressures would remain subdued owing to weak demand, lower wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate, despite some upward price pressures related to supply constraints.",
        "Over the medium term a recovery in demand, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, would put upward pressure on inflation.",
        "This assessment was broadly reflected in the September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area.",
        "Annual HICP inflation was projected to be 0.3% in 2020, 1.0% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2022.",
        "The unchanged projection for inflation in 2022 masked an upward revision to inflation excluding energy and food – in part reflecting the positive impact of the monetary and fiscal policy measures – which was largely offset by the revised path of energy prices.",
        "Members noted that although the inflation outlook was largely unchanged relative to the baseline in the June projections, this was in large part due to the policy measures taken, which were responsible for an upward revision to underlying inflation, and the outlook would have been weaker in the absence of these measures.",
        "Moreover, it was underlined that inflation remained below the Governing Council’s aim over the projection horizon, notwithstanding ample policy support.",
        "The argument was made that the inflation outlook in the September staff projections appeared too optimistic.",
        "The situation in the labour market could be expected to lead to weaker wage pressures over time.",
        "Moreover, Phillips curve estimates, in particular those incorporating the output gap or using total hours worked rather than the unemployment gap, tended to show lower inflation compared with the September baseline.",
        "Inflation pressures were very low in some services sectors, and certain services sectors, such as hospitality, would probably experience a more gradual recovery than previously thought.",
        "The pick-up in inflation to 1.3% in 2022 could also be considered optimistic against the background of the sharp decline in activity and high uncertainty.",
        "The projected inflation profile also reflected an increase in oil prices as embodied in futures markets, which depended on adherence to the recent agreement by OPEC to cut production.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that the upward impact on growth of further fiscal measures, which were not yet incorporated in the projections, would imply a smaller output gap, which would normally translate into a better inflation outlook.",
        "It was underlined that uncertainty surrounding inflation was exceptionally high at present.",
        "The relationship between slack and inflation was being heavily distorted by the lockdowns and specific factors that were at play during the pandemic, including uncertainty about the pandemic’s impact on the supply side and on potential growth.",
        "It was suggested that the relative impact of negative shocks to demand and supply could be investigated in more depth by analysing sectoral developments.",
        "While activity in sectors such as hospitality and tourism was not likely to recover soon, in other sectors, such as IT or online commerce, there had even been a positive demand shock.",
        "Given the openness of the euro area economy, members considered that a further appreciation of the exchange rate constituted a risk to both growth and inflation.",
        "It was recalled that a significant impact of the exchange rate appreciation on euro area inflation had been included in the September 2020 ECB staff projections.",
        "The argument was made that ultimately the impact of a one-off adjustment of the exchange rate would be seen in the level of prices rather than in the rate of inflation.",
        "Moreover, the economic impact would also depend on the underlying causes of the exchange rate movement, which were difficult to reliably disentangle.",
        "In discussing recent developments in inflation expectations, members noted that longer-term inflation expectations, as reported in the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, had fallen to 1.6%, the lowest level since the start of Economic and Monetary Union.",
        "At the same time, market-based indicators of inflation expectations had continued to recover, with the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead presently standing at 1.19%.",
        "The comment was made that inflation expectations appeared to have stabilised overall and, although uncertainty about the inflation outlook remained high, markets were beginning to price out the risk of deflation.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that inflation expectations were still too low and that even though the risk of deflation was decreasing, it remained non-negligible.",
        "It was argued that the moderate improvement in inflation expectations was mostly due to the monetary policy decisions taken in June and that the prospect of a further appreciation of the exchange rate implied downside risks to inflation.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) growth had continued to rise, reflecting domestic credit creation and the ongoing asset purchases by the Eurosystem, as well as precautionary motives which fostered a heightened preference for liquidity in the money-holding sector.",
        "Bank lending to the private sector continued to be supported by the measures taken by the supervisory, fiscal and monetary policy authorities, including the latest TLTRO III operation.",
        "Bank lending conditions remained very favourable, with lending rates continuing to stand at historical lows.",
        "High rates of corporate loan growth continued to mirror elevated liquidity needs of firms to finance their ongoing expenditures, such as wage payments and working capital, and to further build liquidity buffers.",
        "While the rebound in economic activity had resulted in some recovery in firms’ revenues and a shift in loan demand towards longer-term loans, the uncertainty over the economic outlook was likely to cast a shadow over future loan demand.",
        "In fact, it was pointed out that banks also expected some slowing of firms’ future loan demand, as highlighted in the most recent bank lending survey for the euro area.",
        "The uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook was seen to pose a potential challenge to the transmission of monetary policy through the banking sector, which had to be monitored carefully.",
        "In this context, the crucial role of government guarantee schemes in underpinning bank loan provision to the real economy was stressed, as was the need to avoid “cliff effects”.",
        "The point was made that the full effects of the pandemic had yet to become evident in corporate balance sheets.",
        "Possible financial vulnerabilities in the corporate sector could, in turn, have adverse repercussions for bank balance sheets and thereby had the potential to impair monetary policy transmission and give rise to financial stability risks.",
        "In particular, in the absence of further regulatory relief regarding the classification of loans as non-performing, a surge in corporate insolvencies resulting from the pandemic could lead to an increase in non-performing loans on bank balance sheets, especially as governments were likely to start withdrawing some of the support provided, such as debt moratoria or loan guarantees.",
        "Weakened bank balance sheets associated with rising firm indebtedness and defaults could, in turn, lead banks to charge higher lending rates to their customers and to cut back on new loans even though bank lending rates were currently still at historically low levels.",
        "In this context, it was remarked that bank stock prices had been continuously declining, with low bank valuations being evident in very low price-to-book ratios.",
        "While banks had increased their provisions in view of higher expected losses, the point was made that low bank valuations could reflect a weak profitability outlook as well as doubts among investors about the quality of bank balance sheets and the adequacy of the level of provisions given expected increases in firm defaults and bankruptcies.",
        "It was also cautioned that sovereign exposures of banks had risen again since the start of the crisis, giving rise to renewed concerns about the tight nexus between banks and sovereigns.",
        "Overall, it was important to monitor the transmission of monetary policy carefully, to ensure that the liquidity injected was directed towards funding the real economy and to avoid unduly fuelling financial asset prices and reinforcing the bank-sovereign nexus.",
        "With regard to financial conditions and the monetary policy stance, members broadly shared the assessments provided by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane in their introductions.",
        "While financial market conditions had continued to normalise since the July monetary policy meeting, with valuations of risky assets across the globe continuing to recover, the easing trend in financial conditions had been partly counteracted by the appreciation of the euro.",
        "Euro area sovereign and corporate bond yield spreads had narrowed further, while equity prices, notwithstanding some weakening in bank stocks, had remained resilient overall on the back of favourable global risk sentiment and supportive monetary and fiscal policies.",
        "It was, however, cautioned that although low equity valuations in some sectors reflected investor expectations of an extended impact of the pandemic, overall stock prices still appeared to be highly valued, for example when looking at measures such as cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratios.",
        "This pointed to the possibility of volatility or corrections in stock markets in the period ahead, as seen in US stock markets in the days preceding the September Governing Council meeting.",
        "At the same time, since the July Governing Council meeting the euro exchange rate had appreciated significantly against almost all advanced and emerging market currencies, reflecting in part positive risk sentiment towards the euro area, which was also supported by the agreement on the NGEU plan as well as relative monetary policy configurations in major jurisdictions.",
        "In this context, the risk of a further euro appreciation was seen as partly linked to market perceptions of the scope for further changes in monetary policy in different jurisdictions.",
        "Against this background, it was considered important to avoid complacency and the perception among investors that the direction of exchange rate movements was a one-way bet.",
        "Members widely agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane that ample stimulus remained necessary to support the economic recovery and to safeguard medium-term price stability.",
        "While the incoming data since the last Governing Council meeting had been positive overall, suggesting a strong resumption of euro area activity broadly in line with previous expectations, risks continued to be tilted to the downside and the strength of the recovery remained surrounded by significant uncertainty.",
        "In this environment, inflation pressures were expected to remain subdued on account of weak demand, lower wage pressures and the recent appreciation of the euro exchange rate.",
        "Against that background, members agreed with the proposal by Mr Lane to leave the overall monetary policy stance unchanged and to reconfirm the current configuration of existing monetary policy instruments.",
        "In the prevailing environment of high uncertainty, keeping a steady hand with respect to monetary policy was seen as most appropriate.",
        "At the same time, the case was made for keeping a “free hand” in view of the elevated uncertainty, underpinning the need to carefully assess all incoming information, including the euro exchange rate, and to maintain flexibility in taking appropriate policy action if and when needed.",
        "Over the coming weeks more data would become available, which would provide improved visibility about how the various forces at play would influence the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In this regard, the underlying dynamics of the pandemic, developments in negotiations on the post-transition Brexit arrangement, the outcome of the US presidential election and decisions on fiscal plans at the individual country level as well as at the euro area level had to be closely monitored.",
        "Members widely agreed that the ECB’s monetary policy measures were providing crucial support for the recovery of the euro area economy and underlying inflation pressures.",
        "It was underlined that the inflation and growth outlook would have been significantly worse had the Governing Council not taken its decisive action since the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis.",
        "The configuration of monetary policy was supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses and contributing to accommodative funding conditions in all parts of the economy.",
        "In this regard, the TLTROs continued to underpin the declining path of bank lending rates and were supporting bank credit provision to households and businesses.",
        "With regard to the two objectives of the PEPP, it was underlined that the PEPP had been successful in stabilising financial market conditions in the euro area.",
        "In the light of normalising market conditions and subsiding risks of fragmentation, it was highlighted that the role of the PEPP in easing the monetary policy stance had taken centre stage.",
        "In conjunction with the ongoing asset purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), the PEPP purchases were providing significant monetary stimulus, helping to re-anchor inflation to the path that had been projected before the outbreak of the pandemic.",
        "In this context, it was nonetheless stressed that, notwithstanding the positive contribution of monetary policy to underlying inflation dynamics, the baseline scenario in the September projections still foresaw inflation remaining well below the pre-crisis path over the projection horizon.",
        "On the basis of the current information, the PEPP envelope would likely have to be used in full to provide the necessary accommodation to offset the downward impact of the pandemic on the path of inflation, which was also in line with prevailing market expectations.",
        "It was seen as important to remain firm on previous announcements regarding the overall PEPP envelope, which underpinned the Governing Council’s commitment to bring inflation back to levels in line with its aim.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that the pace of monthly purchases could be reduced as tensions in financial markets subsided.",
        "This would allow buffers to be built up in case market turbulence and fragmentation were to re-emerge.",
        "There was broad agreement among members that there was no room for complacency, as emphasised by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "There were key downside risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability, mainly related to the as yet uncertain economic and financial implications of the pandemic.",
        "Moreover, inflation had been persistently below levels consistent with the inflation aim and inflation expectations remained at subdued levels, which posed a risk to the perceived ability and determination of the ECB to deliver on its mandate.",
        "While there was an upward revision to inflation excluding energy and food in the latest staff projections, headline inflation was projected to be 1.3% in the final year of the projection horizon, thereby remaining below the projected pre-crisis path and some distance from levels in line with the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "In this environment, it was important for the Governing Council to underline its readiness to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner.",
        "While the PEPP was currently seen as the primary instrument for providing additional monetary policy accommodation, it was noted that further cuts in policy rates and changes to the conditions of the TLTROs were also part of the toolkit for providing additional monetary policy accommodation, if necessary.",
        "As regards communication, there was wide agreement among members with the communication proposed by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "It needed to be highlighted that the current environment was surrounded by elevated uncertainty, which required the Governing Council to carefully assess all incoming information, including developments in the exchange rate, with regard to the implications for the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In this context, it needed to be emphasised that while the euro exchange rate was not a policy target for the ECB, the external value of the euro was an important determinant of inflation developments in the euro area.",
        "In this regard, the recent appreciation of the euro exchange rate had had a material impact on the inflation outlook in the September ECB staff projections.",
        "There was broad agreement among members that in the current environment of elevated uncertainty the recent volatility in the exchange rate of the euro required careful monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "Reference was made to the language that had been used by the Governing Council on exchange rate volatility in 2017-18 and it was generally felt that the proposed communication was similar and appropriate at the current juncture.",
        "It was stressed that the Governing Council had to be ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner.",
        "This also included reiterating the continued determination of the Governing Council to use the PEPP in a flexible manner in order to address the possible threat of market fragmentation and to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy.",
        "In addition, it needed to be emphasised that the monetary policy stance would remain accommodative and that the Governing Council would not tolerate an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions that would put the ECB’s price stability mandate at risk.",
        "In the context of the announcement by the US Federal Reserve System of a revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, it was important to highlight that the ECB’s strategy review had been delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic and that it would resume shortly and would be an important focus of the Governing Council’s work over the next year.",
        "It was also viewed as important to highlight that, without pre-empting the ongoing strategy review deliberations, the Governing Council was not constrained in taking the necessary policy action in the pursuit of the ECB’s price stability mandate.",
        "In this context, it was also emphasised that the ECB’s inflation aim was symmetrical and that the Governing Council would respond with the same determination to sustained downside deviations as to sustained upside deviations from the inflation aim.",
        "Finally, it needed to be highlighted that fiscal policy continued to be critical to support the recovery of the euro area economy and to provide important funding support to those hardest hit by the pandemic.",
        "It was urged that fiscal support should not be withdrawn prematurely, but should be channelled towards enhancing productivity growth, fostering sustainable economic growth, bolstering innovation and strengthening the long-term growth potential of the euro area economy.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the following monetary policy decisions: The Governing Council continued to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Ms Schnabel reviewed the financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 3-4 June 2020.",
        "In both advanced and emerging market economies, financial conditions were approaching pre-pandemic levels at a slowing but steady pace, as also reflected in the strong recovery in global stock markets.",
        "In the euro area sovereign bond markets, pre-pandemic funding conditions had by and large been restored.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation expectations had also recovered further, albeit from very low levels, and risk premia on short-term funding for both banks and corporates had continued to decline.",
        "Optimism in financial markets had, however, gone hand in hand with surging coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in the United States and many emerging market economies, raising fears of a broader relapse in containing the spread of the virus.",
        "This divergence between the evolution of the pandemic and developments in financial markets, together with high uncertainty about the ultimate shape and pace of the economic recovery and the resurgence of global trade tensions, raised questions regarding the robustness and resilience of current investor sentiment.",
        "So far, market intelligence pointed to three main stabilising factors.",
        "The first related to changes in the expected policy response to contain the spread of COVID-19.",
        "Many market participants now expected the policy response to a further spreading of the virus to rely more heavily on less invasive and geographically more targeted restrictions on economic activity.",
        "The second factor related to investor positioning.",
        "Although stock prices had rallied since about mid-March 2020, assets under management in equity funds domiciled in the euro area remained below their pre-pandemic values.",
        "Continued inflows into money market funds suggested that many investors still preferred to keep liquid and cash-like positions.",
        "Monetary policy was the third factor that had likely contributed to preventing an increase in risk premia.",
        "By expanding and extending the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) at its meeting on 3-4 June, and by clarifying the horizon of the reinvestment period, the Governing Council had signalled that monetary policy would remain a supporting factor throughout the crisis.",
        "The announcement of the PEPP and its extension also seemed to have arrested the fall in market-based measures of medium-term inflation expectations.",
        "At the same time, current financial conditions still critically hinged on EU leaders delivering on the high expectations that had built up regarding the European recovery fund.",
        "Consequently, the signals coming out of the European Council meeting on 17-18 July 2020 would be very important for investors.",
        "The stabilising effects of the PEPP were being complemented by the significant take-up in the fourth operation of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III).",
        "Excess liquidity was projected to rise to new record levels over the next two years, which had likely contributed to the further easing in short-term unsecured funding conditions for banks and firms.",
        "The three-month EURIBOR, a critical benchmark for lending to firms, had returned to pre-pandemic levels and commercial paper rates, both for financial and non-financial firms, had fallen further.",
        "Traditional commercial paper investors, such as money market funds, were coming back to the market, especially at shorter maturities, which had contributed to restoring orderly market conditions.",
        "At the same time, rising excess liquidity would not necessarily increase the burden on banks overall, relative to the situation prevailing at the end of last year, owing to the offsetting effects of the generous conditions of the TLTROs.",
        "The significant take-up of liquidity in the latest TLTRO III operation, together with the impact of the PEPP expansion and extension on forward premia and future overnight interest rates, had also affected the EONIA forward curve, which had shifted downwards since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "Expectations of further adjustments to the key ECB interest rates seemed limited, however, as also confirmed by survey evidence.",
        "Overall, the evidence was increasing that the policy response in the euro area, with monetary policy and fiscal policy complementing each other, had succeeded in easing financial conditions and restoring confidence in a recovery of the euro area economy.",
        "This positive development was also increasingly reflected in the external value of the euro.",
        "Since about mid-May 2020 when the recovery fund proposal had taken shape, the euro had appreciated broadly against a wide basket of both advanced and emerging economy currencies, likely reflecting the removal of tail risks and the comparatively successful containment of the coronavirus in Europe.",
        "Mr Lane reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, developments in the global economy continued to be dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "The global economy was showing signs of a recovery after a sharp downturn in the second quarter of 2020.",
        "As containment measures continued to ease across the world, the global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) (excluding the euro area) had increased further in June and stood substantially higher than at the trough in April.",
        "The increase in June across almost all major advanced and emerging economies had been driven by a strong month-on-month improvement in services and, to a lesser extent, manufacturing.",
        "At the same time, the level of the global composite output PMI still pointed to a contraction in activity in June.",
        "Global trade was expected to recover after a steep fall in the second quarter.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s June monetary policy meeting, oil prices had increased by around 11%, to just over USD 42 per barrel, supported by a stronger than expected pick-up in demand for oil on the back of the easing of lockdown measures.",
        "Reductions in supply were also supporting a rebalancing in oil markets.",
        "The euro had appreciated somewhat against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms since the June monetary policy meeting.",
        "Turning to the euro area, real GDP had decreased by 3.6%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2020 and was expected to have contracted even further overall in the second quarter – broadly in line with the baseline scenario of the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "Incoming data and survey results suggested that economic activity had improved significantly in May and June from its trough in April, alongside the ongoing containment of the virus and the associated easing of the lockdown measures.",
        "At the same time, economic indicators remained well below the levels recorded before the pandemic, and the recovery was in its early stages and remained uneven across sectors and jurisdictions.",
        "Euro area activity was expected to rebound in the third quarter as the containment measures were eased further, supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a resumption in global activity, although uncertainty about the overall speed and scale of the rebound remained high.",
        "The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown measures taken by governments had caused a collapse of consumption growth in the first quarter of 2020.",
        "At the same time, government transfers, which had counteracted the fall in the growth rate of firms’ operating surplus and compensation of employees, had stabilised income growth in the first quarter of 2020, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019.",
        "This had led to a rise in savings, which were expected to have recorded a very strong further increase in the second quarter of 2020.",
        "Clear signs of a recovery in consumption had emerged since May, but spending remained far below pre-lockdown levels.",
        "Retail trade and new passenger car registrations had risen in May.",
        "Consumer confidence indicators available up to June suggested that consumption in May and June had increased strongly compared with April.",
        "Turning to investment, euro area business investment was expected to have declined sharply in the second quarter.",
        "At the same time, recent survey data, such as production expectations and business confidence, signalled the start of a recovery in the third quarter of 2020, as projected in the June 2020 projections exercise.",
        "Euro area real residential investment was expected to have declined sharply in the second quarter of 2020 as a result of the lockdown measures, and was expected to recover only gradually.",
        "Trade data, available up to March, showed that with respect to intra-euro area trade, intermediate goods had recorded the strongest impact as value chains within the euro area had become disrupted, but trade in capital goods, cars and fuels, as well as consumer goods, had also suffered.",
        "Partial data available for April highlighted that exports to all major economies had suffered severely.",
        "As regards the labour market, government support schemes such as short-time work had helped to protect jobs, as reflected in the limited decrease in total employment and the limited increase in the unemployment rate.",
        "These schemes were also an important driver of the pronounced fall in average hours worked.",
        "Looking ahead, the effects of the pandemic on euro area labour markets could increase further.",
        "In this context, unemployment rate expectations had been revised in the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) in the direction of a later impact of the pandemic on the labour market and the unemployment rate was now expected to peak in 2021, rather than 2020.",
        "High-frequency indicators of job postings and hiring rates also pointed to a more severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the euro area labour market.",
        "Turning to euro area price developments, euro area HICP inflation had increased slightly to 0.3% in June, from 0.1% in May, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, reflecting mainly less negative energy price inflation.",
        "This had more than offset the decline in food price inflation and in HICP inflation excluding energy and food, which had declined from 0.9% in May to 0.8% in June.",
        "On the basis of current and futures prices for oil and taking into account the temporary reduction in the German VAT rate, headline inflation was likely to decline again in the coming months before picking up in early 2021.",
        "Over the medium term, weaker demand was expected to put downward pressure on inflation, which would be only partially offset by upward pressures related to supply constraints.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation, which were largely only available up to May, had been weakening since February, with HICP inflation excluding energy and food showing the most pronounced decrease.",
        "That said, it needed to be kept in mind that these measures were still surrounded by high uncertainty as the share of imputed prices in the data was still considerable, especially for services.",
        "Turning to wages, compensation per employee (CPE) growth had declined sharply in the first quarter of 2020 and was being heavily affected by wage supplementation policies.",
        "Annual CPE growth had decreased from 1.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 0.3% in the first quarter of 2020, reflecting the initial impact of short-time work and temporary lay-off schemes towards the end of the first quarter, which had allowed workers to keep their employee status but had only partially offset remuneration losses.",
        "The impact of such schemes was also visible in annual growth in compensation per hour, which had increased to 3.1% in the first quarter of 2020, from 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019, owing to the sharp decline in actual hours worked per employee.",
        "Looking ahead, survey-based measures of inflation expectations had declined.",
        "In the latest ECB SPF for the third quarter of 2020, HICP inflation expectations stood at 0.4% for 2020, 1.0% for 2021 and 1.3% for 2022.",
        "Longer-term HICP inflation expectations averaged 1.6% for 2025, compared with 1.7% for 2024 in the previous round.",
        "At the same time, market-based indicators of inflation expectations in the euro area had continued to recover since the June Governing Council meeting, but remained at subdued levels.",
        "As regards fiscal policy, the euro area fiscal stance (net of the effect of automatic stabilisers) was assessed to be strongly expansionary in 2020.",
        "The national fiscal responses to the pandemic included state guarantees and equity injections, which were very heterogeneous across euro area countries.",
        "Most countries planned to withdraw the bulk of the expansionary discretionary measures in 2021, although automatic stabilisers would continue to operate.",
        "Additional sizeable national fiscal packages had recently been announced and the EU recovery instrument could also provide meaningful fiscal support in the period ahead.",
        "Financial conditions in the euro area had overall remained largely unchanged since the Governing Council’s June monetary policy meeting, but were tighter than before the crisis.",
        "The EONIA forward curve had become more inverted, implying that financial markets were pricing in low short-term rates for the time being.",
        "Overall, expectations were for no rate change for a considerable period.",
        "Longer-term risk-free rates had decreased in both the euro area and the United States since the June monetary policy meeting.",
        "While nominal long-term rates had edged down to a similar extent in both economies, the decrease in the real rate through an increase in the inflation component was significantly more pronounced in the United States.",
        "As a consequence, the long-standing gap between US and euro area real rates had essentially closed.",
        "Turning to money and credit, broad money (M3) growth had increased to 8.9% in May 2020, from 8.2% in April.",
        "Strong money growth reflected bank credit creation, which continued to be driven to a large extent by the acute liquidity needs in the economy.",
        "Moreover, high economic uncertainty was triggering a shift towards money holdings for precautionary reasons.",
        "In this environment, the narrow monetary aggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth.",
        "The dynamics of loans to firms had remained strong in May, driven by firms’ operational financing needs, in an environment of compressed cash flows – but with substantial variation across countries.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations had risen further to 7.3% in May 2020, from 6.6% in April, reflecting firms’ need to finance their ongoing expenditures and working capital.",
        "State guarantees played an important role in meeting the demand for loans by firms.",
        "However, the size, design and take-up of loans under state guarantee schemes differed significantly across countries.",
        "At the same time, the annual growth rate of loans to households had remained unchanged at 3.0% in May, after declining for two consecutive months, amid ongoing constraints on consumption.",
        "Despite the severe decline in economic activity in the second quarter of 2020, credit standards on loans to firms remained broadly unchanged according to the results of the latest euro area bank lending survey.",
        "Monetary and fiscal policy measures played a major role in keeping credit standards favourable for loans to firms.",
        "For the third quarter of 2020, however, euro area banks expected a net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms, reflecting concerns about borrowers’ creditworthiness and, in some countries, concerns about a foreseen end of state guarantee schemes.",
        "For loans to households for house purchase, credit standards had tightened in net terms in the second quarter of 2020, reflecting in particular a deterioration in households’ income and employment prospects in the context of the pandemic.",
        "Summing up, Mr Lane pointed out that, after a steep fall in the first weeks of the second quarter, the incoming data signalled an increase in the level of euro area economic activity, which was broadly in line with the baseline scenario of the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "However, the breadth and scale of the recovery remained uneven and partial.",
        "Both high-frequency and survey indicators suggested that activity had bottomed out in April.",
        "In tandem with the ongoing containment of the virus and the easing of the lockdown measures, there were signs of an initial recovery in consumption, while there had been a significant rebound in industrial output in some countries.",
        "However, a number of factors were holding back a more complete recovery.",
        "First, a resurgence in COVID-19 transmission rates in a number of major economies had led authorities to halt or reverse reopening plans, with a measurable impact on external demand for euro area exports.",
        "Second, surveys suggested that employment was lagging output, with actual and expected declines in employment and income, amid precautionary household saving, weighing on consumer spending.",
        "Third, exceptionally elevated uncertainty about the evolution of the pandemic and the economic outlook continued to dampen business investment.",
        "HICP inflation had increased marginally in June but remained close to zero, while measures of underlying inflation had weakened somewhat, driven by lower price pressures in services and non-energy industrial goods.",
        "Since the June monetary policy meeting, market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations had continued to increase from their mid-March historical lows, but they remained at very depressed levels.",
        "Although survey-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remained well above market-based measures, the longer-term inflation expectations reported in the latest SPF had edged lower to 1.6%, from 1.7% in the previous round.",
        "Euro area financial conditions had remained broadly stable since the June meeting, although significantly tighter than before the escalation of the pandemic.",
        "Moreover, while bank lending conditions remained favourable overall, the latest round of the bank lending survey signalled that banks expected a considerable net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms, in part related to the expected end of the state guarantee schemes.",
        "The ECB’s monetary policy measures were gradually making their way through to the economy, providing crucial support to underpin the recovery of the euro area economy and helping to offset the pandemic-related downward shift in the projected path of inflation.",
        "At the same time, the outlook was surrounded by high uncertainty and subject to downside risks, related in particular to the prospects of the global economy and the emergence of potential real-financial feedback loops.",
        "In this environment, the Governing Council had to await further data to better assess the future path of the economy and the extent to which inflation was returning to its pre-crisis trajectory within the projection horizon.",
        "Mr Lane therefore proposed leaving the overall monetary policy stance unchanged and reconfirming the full set of existing monetary policy measures.",
        "In addition, it was important to emphasise that, although economic activity was gaining momentum, there was no room for complacency.",
        "The extent of economic slack was extremely high, uncertainty remained elevated and market sentiment was exceptionally fragile.",
        "In this context, the outlook for economic activity and inflation embedded in the June staff projections was conditional on substantial monetary policy support, while any premature tightening of financial conditions could put the ongoing recovery at risk.",
        "In its communication, the Governing Council needed to: (i) stress that the incoming information signalled a resumption of euro area economic activity, although the level of activity remained well below the level prevailing just before the onset of the pandemic and the outlook remained highly uncertain; (ii) emphasise that inflation pressures were expected to remain very subdued on account of the sharp decline in real GDP and the associated significant increase in economic slack; (iii) highlight that, in the current environment of elevated uncertainty and significant economic slack, ample monetary policy stimulus would remain necessary to support the economic recovery and to bring inflation back to its pre-crisis trajectory within the projection horizon; and (iv) reiterate that it would do everything necessary within its mandate and continued to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the outlook provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Incoming data and survey results suggested that economic activity had improved significantly in May and June from its trough in April, alongside the ongoing containment of the virus and the associated easing of the lockdown measures.",
        "At the same time, economic indicators remained well below the levels recorded before the pandemic, and the recovery was in its early stages and remained uneven across sectors and jurisdictions.",
        "After decreasing by 3.6%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2020, euro area real GDP was expected to have contracted even further in the second quarter taken as a whole, broadly in line with the baseline scenario in the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Euro area activity was expected to rebound in the third quarter as containment measures were eased further, supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a resumption in global activity, although uncertainty about the overall speed and scale of the rebound remained high.",
        "In general, the extent of the contraction and the subsequent recovery would depend crucially on the duration and effectiveness of the containment measures, the success of policies to mitigate the adverse impact on incomes and employment, and the extent to which supply capacity and domestic demand were permanently affected.",
        "It was widely felt that, while uncertainty remained elevated, confidence in the baseline scenario of the June staff projections had increased on the whole.",
        "As regards the external environment, members broadly shared the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "Global activity had rebounded towards the end of the second quarter, while global trade had remained very weak.",
        "It was emphasised that developments in world trade were a critical factor in the recovery of the euro area economy and that evidence of trade improving from depressed levels had yet to become stronger.",
        "The subdued trade dynamics were seen to affect both intra- and extra-euro area exports, and while the contribution of trade had thus far been broadly proportional to the overall decline in euro area real GDP, the export sector remained exposed to developments elsewhere in terms of the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the policies adopted by trading partners.",
        "As the pandemic was affecting economies sequentially and to different degrees, this implied uneven recoveries and, at the global level, greater reliance on internal rather than external demand to support the recovery, and on domestic rather than global value chains.",
        "On euro area activity, members widely acknowledged that the latest data were more positive and that in some cases the improvement had been stronger than previously expected.",
        "Based on recent data and survey information, mechanical estimates for euro area real GDP now pointed to somewhat less negative quarter-on-quarter growth in the second quarter of this year than suggested in the June staff projections, but also to lower than expected growth in the third quarter.",
        "When considering these mechanical estimates, it was cautioned that a “technical” rebound was to be expected after a period of substantial containment measures and that this did not answer the question of how steady the recovery would be in the period ahead.",
        "It was also observed that most of the upward surprises in the incoming data had come from surveys and that more forward-looking indicators, such as new orders and business expectations, had remained well below their average levels.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that the mechanical estimates for the second quarter were based on observed data, while little information was available as yet for the third quarter.",
        "Hence, it could not be ruled out that more favourable dynamics in the second quarter might carry over into the third quarter.",
        "It was generally underlined that, by the time of the September ECB staff projections, more information would be available for a reassessment of this profile and any implications for the medium-term outlook for activity.",
        "Members reiterated that high uncertainty continued to surround the outlook for the euro area and that much of this uncertainty still related to the future course of the pandemic and the finding of a medical solution – both in the euro area and globally.",
        "The higher uncertainty after the outbreak of the pandemic remained visible in the flatter shape and fatter tails of probability distributions.",
        "At the same time, it was acknowledged that, on the whole, increased confidence could be placed in the baseline scenario of the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "The “severe scenario” described in the projections was now considered less likely, while more benign developments could also not be ruled out.",
        "It was underlined that, while the baseline scenario had become more plausible, it remained surrounded by elevated risks.",
        "Upside risks related to the possibility that households would unwind the “forced savings” accumulated during the lockdown period, leading to some “catch-up effects” in consumption.",
        "Upside risks also related to the impact of the EU recovery fund and of the fiscal package launched in the largest euro area economy, to the extent that these had not been taken into account in the June staff projections.",
        "At the same time, members referred to various downside risks to the growth outlook, especially when looking beyond the short term.",
        "In addition to risks emanating from the external economy, reference was made to possible “cliff effects” occurring when various policy support measures expired, especially with respect to the labour market.",
        "This could lead to increases in outright unemployment instead of the decreases in hours worked per person seen thus far, and concerns were expressed that protracted periods of unemployment could lead to “hysteresis” effects.",
        "A second set of risks was considered to be associated with the business sector, where weak business prospects and high uncertainty were dampening investment.",
        "While policy measures had mitigated acute liquidity shortages to some extent, there was now an increasing risk of solvency problems in the period ahead, which could impede a strong economic recovery.",
        "In this context, references were made to the risk of negative real-financial feedback loops.",
        "All in all, members assessed the balance of risks to the euro area growth outlook to remain on the downside.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, it was underlined that an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remained critical in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy.",
        "Measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should, as far as possible, be targeted and temporary in nature.",
        "The three safety nets for workers, businesses and sovereigns, endorsed in April by the European Council and amounting to a package worth €540 billion, should – once fully operational – provide important funding support to EU Member States wishing to draw on it.",
        "However, looking ahead, further strong and timely efforts to support the recovery were needed.",
        "Members therefore strongly welcomed the European Commission’s “Next Generation EU” proposal, designed to support the regions and sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, to strengthen the Single Market and to build a lasting and prosperous recovery.",
        "It was considered paramount that European leaders quickly agreed on an ambitious package.",
        "Members noted that the quantitative impact that could be expected from the “Next Generation EU” proposal depended on the time it would take to activate the funds and on how the funds would be spent.",
        "With regard to price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation had increased slightly to 0.3% in June, from 0.1% in May, mainly reflecting less negative energy price inflation.",
        "On the basis of current and futures prices for oil and taking into account the temporary reduction in the German VAT rate, headline inflation was likely to decline again in the coming months before picking up in early 2021.",
        "Over the medium term, weaker demand would put downward pressure on inflation, which would be only partially offset by upward pressures related to supply constraints.",
        "In their exchange of views, members highlighted a number of factors in the short-term inflation outlook.",
        "While oil price developments had led to a rebound in headline inflation, it was still close to zero and almost 30% of the items in the HICP basket had posted negative inflation rates.",
        "Moreover, underlying inflation was weak and would likely be well below 1% in the second half of 2020.",
        "It was warned that dynamics in underlying inflation, like those in economic activity, would only become clear once the temporary policy measures had expired.",
        "Current inflation developments also continued to be surrounded by uncertainty because the prices of some items in the HICP basket still needed to be imputed rather than collected.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the possibility that the reduction in the German VAT rate could temporarily push euro area headline inflation into negative territory and that such one-off effects would require appropriate communication.",
        "As regards inflation expectations, market-based indicators of longer-term expectations had continued to increase from the historical lows recorded in mid-March but, overall, remained at subdued levels.",
        "While survey-based indicators of inflation expectations had declined since the start of the pandemic, longer-term expectations had been less affected than short and medium-term expectations.",
        "With respect to market indicators, it was observed that, while the risk-neutral probability of very low or negative inflation rates derived from five-year zero-coupon inflation options had decreased, it remained relatively high.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction that strong money growth reflected bank credit creation, which continued to be driven to a large extent by acute liquidity needs in the economy.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations had risen further in May 2020, reflecting the needs of firms to finance their ongoing expenditures and working capital.",
        "Against this background, bank credit was seen as particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises, which lacked access to market-based funding.",
        "It was remarked that monetary transmission through the banking sector had been effective, partly because the balance sheets of banks had been stronger at the start of the pandemic than before the financial crisis of 2008.",
        "The role of government guarantee schemes for loans was also highlighted as underpinning loan growth, with some concern expressed about possible future “cliff effects” as such programmes expired.",
        "The results of the euro area bank lending survey indicated that banks expected a net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms in the third quarter of 2020, which signalled risks that the recent strong credit growth would not be sustained.",
        "Concerns were voiced about the emergence of real-financial feedback loops, in particular in the interaction between non-financial corporations and banks, notably if government guarantee schemes were withdrawn too early.",
        "It was also noted that credit standards for loans to households had tightened in the second quarter, reflecting primarily a deterioration in households’ income and employment prospects in the context of the pandemic.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that the expected net tightening of credit standards should not be over-interpreted against the background of the earlier considerable easing that had resulted from supportive policy measures.",
        "It was seen as necessary to monitor the transmission of monetary policy carefully, as the availability and cost of financing, notably through the banking channel, might become strained, which could adversely affect household consumption and business investment.",
        "The point was made that the effects of the pandemic on corporate balance sheets would only become evident over time since the pandemic was not yet under control globally and its full effects had still to materialise.",
        "An increase in non-performing loans and corporate insolvencies as a result of the pandemic could affect bank balance sheets and impair monetary transmission through the banking sector, which could also give rise to financial stability risks.",
        "In this context it was stressed that, while monetary policy was able to provide liquidity and support favourable lending conditions, it was up to fiscal policy to deal with solvency problems that could emerge in the financial and corporate sectors in the wake of the coronavirus shock.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members shared the assessments provided by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane in their introductions.",
        "While financial market conditions had continued to normalise since the June monetary policy meeting, they remained tighter and more fragile than before the pandemic, with some fragmentation in financial markets still evident.",
        "There had been further gains in equity markets and narrower bond spreads had been partly offset by an appreciation of the euro.",
        "It was underlined that monetary and fiscal policy measures, as well as the Governing Council’s stated willingness to stand ready to do more, had brought about a considerable improvement in financial conditions since the height of the coronavirus crisis.",
        "This improvement was considered to be especially noteworthy, as it had taken place against the backdrop of a significant increase in fiscal deficits and rising public and private debt levels.",
        "At the same time, the calmness of financial markets was considered to rest on the expected continuation of the supportive policy measures.",
        "It was also cautioned that the recent positive market developments were not fully backed by economic data and might be based on overly optimistic expectations about the European Council’s recovery package and about progress on developing a vaccine.",
        "Members agreed that a highly accommodative monetary policy stance continued to be appropriate on account of the subdued medium-term outlook for price stability, characterised by inflation expectations standing near historical lows and significant economic slack.",
        "It was emphasised that the Governing Council’s monetary policy had been effective in easing financial conditions from the tighter levels seen following the coronavirus shock and that part of the stimulus was still to be transmitted to the real economy over the coming months.",
        "Careful monitoring was warranted.",
        "At the same time, uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated.",
        "Against this background, the current monetary policy stance was seen as adequate and a recalibration was not deemed necessary at the current juncture.",
        "Accordingly, members agreed with the proposal by Mr Lane to leave the overall monetary policy stance unchanged and to reconfirm the current configuration of existing monetary policy instruments.",
        "While financial markets were calmer than at the peak of the pandemic crisis and incoming data signalled short-term activity that was broadly in line with the baseline scenario in the June macroeconomic projections, the situation remained fragile and risks were still on the downside.",
        "In particular, the risk of a persistent increase in the unemployment rate and uncertainty about the extent to which the corporate sector could face solvency issues were highlighted.",
        "Uncertainty continued to be elevated and the outlook for inflation remained subdued, underscoring the view that there was no room for complacency.",
        "While the prevailing uncertainty called for the present configuration of the monetary policy instruments to be kept in place at the current meeting, it was underlined that more information would be available in the autumn.",
        "A number of temporary fiscal measures were likely to expire then, and businesses would be more directly exposed to the impact of the pandemic shock.",
        "With regard to the PEPP, the flexibility of the programme was highlighted as a key element of its effectiveness and efficiency in supporting the transmission of monetary policy over time and across asset classes and jurisdictions.",
        "It was also recalled that, while flexibility in the implementation of the PEPP was essential to successfully ease market conditions in times of stress, the capital key provided the benchmark for the allocation of purchases.",
        "The argument was also made that the flexibility of the PEPP suggested that the net purchase envelope should be considered a ceiling rather than a target.",
        "The point was made that incoming data had surprised on the upside and some of the downside risks surrounding the outlook prevailing at the time of the Governing Council’s June monetary policy meeting had receded, increasing the possibility that the envelope might not have to be deployed fully.",
        "At the same time, it was recalled that the PEPP had been designed to achieve the dual objective of addressing risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy across the euro area and risks to medium-term price stability owing to the pandemic crisis.",
        "More specifically, it aimed to offset the pandemic-related downward shift in the projected path of inflation.",
        "Accordingly, under the baseline scenario in the June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, and in the absence of any significant upside surprises to the medium-term inflation outlook, the current presumption was that the PEPP envelope would have to be used in full.",
        "With regard to the TLTRO III programme, the point was made that the very strong take-up in the June 2020 operation was evidence of the programme’s effectiveness in providing very favourable funding conditions for the banking sector, while the pass-through to lending to the real economy was seen as calling for close monitoring.",
        "Caution was seen as warranted given that government guarantee schemes appeared to be playing a key role in supporting bank lending at present, as evidenced by the latest bank lending survey.",
        "Against this background, further analysis was viewed as necessary to get a better picture of the use made of TLTRO III funds, including the extent to which the liquidity provided translated into lending to firms and households.",
        "Looking ahead, additional information, including more hard data releases, new staff projections and news on fiscal measures, would become available by September.",
        "This would provide more clarity regarding the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that in terms of the flow of information over the summer, it would be unusually difficult to extract signals about the medium-term prospects for the economy and the inflation path, as the scale of the initial bounceback in activity was not necessarily a good guide to the speed and robustness of the recovery.",
        "In any case, at its September meeting the Governing Council would be in a better position to reassess the monetary policy stance and its policy tools.",
        "Members agreed that, although the monetary policy stance was being left unchanged, communication was of particular importance at present.",
        "Arguments were made in support of a steady hand regarding communication, as market expectations appeared to be well aligned with the Governing Council’s intentions.",
        "In this context, it was argued that some of the uncertainties prevailing at the time of the Governing Council’s June monetary policy meeting had receded, while the balance of risks still remained on the downside.",
        "At the same time, it was generally felt that communication should aim to strike a balance between acknowledging the improvements in incoming data and stressing the remaining risks.",
        "In this regard, there was broad agreement to retain the present communication.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the need for clear communication on the impact of the reduction in the German VAT rate, which would temporarily weigh on euro area headline inflation.",
        "Against the background of prevailing uncertainty, it was seen as important to reaffirm that the PEPP’s flexibility would be used as needed, depending on market conditions, and that the Governing Council stood ready to act, with all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure the necessary degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "It was stressed that the Governing Council should make clear that the full PEPP envelope remained available.",
        "While it was underlined that the Governing Council should avoid creating new expectations of further monetary policy action, it should also emphasise that it had the tools and policy space to take further action if needed.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the following monetary policy decisions: The Governing Council continued to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting."
    ],
    "2018": [
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 25-26 July 2018.",
        "Heightened volatility had been observed in the currencies of some emerging market economies, especially Argentina and Turkey, but also Brazil and South Africa.",
        "In fixed income markets, Argentina’s and Turkey’s sovereign bond spreads had widened proportionately more than those of other emerging markets, with only limited signs of spillovers.",
        "In advanced economies, the euro/US dollar exchange rate had exhibited some volatility, with the euro first falling to its lowest level in more than a year after the Governing Council’s July monetary policy meeting, only to reverse most of this movement thereafter.",
        "From around mid-April, and increasingly since mid-June, there had been a reduction in net long speculative positions in euro to broadly neutral levels, which might have contributed to amplifying movements in the euro/US dollar exchange rate.",
        "Turning to bond markets in the United States, domestic demand and monetary policy could be expected to continue putting upward pressure on the ten-year government bond yield.",
        "At the same time, increasing global risk and safe haven flows into US Treasuries had likely exerted downward pressure on yields, which roughly offset the upward pressure.",
        "Similarly, global risk aversion had likely amplified the upward pressure on the US dollar, exerted as a result of improved economic prospects and tighter monetary policy in the United States.",
        "In equity markets, the EURO STOXX 50 index had fallen by around 5% since the Governing Council’s July monetary policy meeting and was down by more than 10% from its peak in January 2018.",
        "One of the drivers of this decline had been European banks, as evidenced by the underperformance of the EURO STOXX Banks index.",
        "By contrast, US equity prices had increased continuously since the correction in spring 2018, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 index presently 8% above its level at the beginning of 2018.",
        "Finally, with regard to monetary policy expectations, the overnight indexed swap (OIS) curve had shown various episodes of flattening after the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 13-14 June 2018, which indicated that markets expected a slower pace of rate normalisation.",
        "The expected date of a first increase in policy rates had, however, not changed materially since 25-26 July.",
        "A first 10-basis point increase in the ECB’s deposit facility rate was currently priced in for the fourth quarter of 2019, while survey-based information suggested a somewhat earlier timing, which might in part reflect the presence of negative term premia in OIS rates.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, the global economic expansion was continuing at a steady pace, at rates close to potential but with substantial cross-country divergences.",
        "Inflation and wage dynamics had gained some momentum.",
        "At the same time, global trade had decelerated, while protectionist threats persisted.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had risen by 8% (in US dollar terms) since the Governing Council’s July monetary policy meeting, and non-oil commodity prices had fallen by 2.3%.",
        "The euro had appreciated somewhat in nominal effective terms but had depreciated slightly against the US dollar.",
        "Turning to the euro area, recent data indicated that the moderation in the first half of 2018 had reflected a pull-back from very high growth in the previous quarters, mainly on account of weaker export demand.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s July meeting, high-frequency indicators had stabilised and remained at elevated levels, underlining the overall robustness of economic activity.",
        "Private consumption had continued to grow at a robust pace in the second quarter of 2018, supported by the ongoing rise in labour income.",
        "Strong demand and earnings remained supportive of business investment.",
        "Surveys showed that capacity utilisation in the capital goods-producing sector had remained at all-time highs.",
        "At the same time, euro area trade momentum had continued to moderate in May.",
        "This weakening in momentum reflected mainly a deceleration in extra-euro area trade, especially with Asia, and was concentrated in the trade of intermediate goods.",
        "These developments were also reflected in the September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which projected real GDP growth at 2.0% in 2018, 1.8% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020, with real GDP growth revised down by 0.1 percentage point for both 2018 and 2019.",
        "The revisions were mostly attributable to a weaker than previously expected contribution from net trade, reflecting downward revisions to foreign demand and a stronger effective exchange rate of the euro.",
        "These effects offset the upward impact on domestic demand stemming from lower lending rates and some fiscal stimulus.",
        "The ECB staff projections stood at the lower end of other available forecasts for 2018 and 2019, and at the upper end of the range for 2020.",
        "Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.0% in August, down from 2.1% in July, with HICP inflation excluding energy and food edging down to 1.0%, from 1.1%, over the same period.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation remained muted but were on a gradually improving path.",
        "Incoming data supported the assessment that domestic cost pressures were strengthening and broadening.",
        "In the domestic supply chain, producer price inflation for both goods and services was increasing, and prices of imported consumer goods were again rising.",
        "As regards wage developments, the annual growth in compensation per employee had increased to 2.3% in the second quarter of 2018, up from 1.9% in the first quarter.",
        "In the September ECB staff projections, headline inflation was expected to stand at 1.7% in each year of the projection horizon, unchanged from the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "The stable path of annual average inflation rates continued to mask a decline in the annual growth rate of the energy component – as the impact of the past increases in oil prices faded – which was offset by gradually rising underlying inflation as supply constraints became increasingly binding.",
        "The September projections were in line with the forecasts of other international and private sector institutions.",
        "Market-based inflation expectations were largely unchanged since the Governing Council’s July monetary policy meeting.",
        "Financial conditions had tightened to some degree, while the cost of financing for non-financial corporations (NFCs) and households remained favourable.",
        "The expected timing of a first increase in ECB policy rates was largely unchanged.",
        "Euro area equity markets had declined since the Governing Council’s July meeting, with earnings expectations broadly unchanged.",
        "The overall cost of financing for euro area firms had remained very favourable by historical standards.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, M3 growth had moderated in July to 4.0%, partly reflecting volatility and base effects.",
        "At the same time, the sources of money creation had continued to shift from the asset purchase programme (APP) towards private credit.",
        "Euro area bank lending rates remained favourable and stood close to historical lows.",
        "The composite cost of borrowing for NFCs had decreased to 1.6% in July, while the composite rate on loans to households for house purchase had remained stable at 1.8%.",
        "Regarding fiscal policy, the euro area fiscal stance, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was projected to move from broadly neutral to mildly expansionary in 2019.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet concluded that, since the Governing Council’s July monetary policy meeting, financial conditions had tightened somewhat, while borrowing conditions for households and firms remained very favourable.",
        "The incoming information, including the September 2018 ECB staff projections, confirmed the previous assessment of an ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy at growth rates above potential.",
        "Growth projections for 2018 and 2019 had been revised down slightly, mainly reflecting weaker foreign demand.",
        "Risks to the growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced.",
        "At the same time, risks relating to the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility had gained more prominence recently.",
        "While measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, they had been increasing from earlier lows.",
        "Domestic cost pressures were strengthening and broadening, supported by the ongoing economic expansion, high levels of capacity utilisation and increasing labour market tightness.",
        "The September 2018 ECB staff projections foresaw inflation at 1.7% throughout the projection period, unrevised from the June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "On this basis, and in line with the anticipation expressed at the Governing Council’s June monetary policy meeting, Mr Praet proposed, first, to reduce, as of October, the monthly pace of the net asset purchases to €15 billion until the end of December 2018; second, to reiterate the anticipation that – subject to incoming data confirming the medium-term inflation outlook – the Governing Council would end its net purchases at the end of December 2018; and, third, to reassert all remaining elements of the forward guidance pertaining to the key ECB interest rates, including the expectation that they would remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, and the forward guidance on APP reinvestments.",
        "Accordingly, the external communication should: (a) emphasise that the incoming information confirmed the ongoing broad-based expansion in the euro area; (b) stress that risks to the growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced, and acknowledge that risks relating to the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility had gained more prominence recently; (c) underline that the strength of the euro area economy supported confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim would proceed and be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of its net asset purchases; and (d) reiterate that significant monetary policy stimulus was still needed for a continued and durable convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim and that this support would continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestment, and by the enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Real GDP growth had moderated in the first half of 2018, a pull-back from the strong growth in 2017 that was mainly related to weaker foreign demand.",
        "However, the latest indicators and survey results broadly confirmed the previous assessment of an ongoing broad-based expansion of economic activity in the euro area, at growth rates which were above potential, as broadly reflected in the September 2018 ECB staff projections.",
        "Considering the outlook and the risks for the external environment, members agreed that global activity continued to expand at a steady pace.",
        "The picture of a continued economic expansion was reflected in the September projections, which foresaw global activity excluding the euro area growing at 3.9% in 2018, before decelerating to 3.7% in 2020, with slight downward revisions in 2018 and 2019 compared with the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "At the same time, there had been some weakening in trade momentum, and members considered that uncertainties related to global factors had become more prominent, with risks to the external environment generally assessed to be tilted to the downside.",
        "Members discussed in greater detail the impact of trade protectionism on the global outlook.",
        "In addition to any direct effects arising from the imposition of tariffs, concerns were expressed about the possibility that trade tensions could generate a more general decline in confidence throughout the global economy.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that adverse confidence effects on trade and investment arising from trade tensions had hitherto been limited and that such effects were subject to considerable uncertainty.",
        "Attention was drawn to recent declines in global orders and export orders reported in purchasing managers’ surveys.",
        "Members also exchanged views about the implications of recent developments in emerging market economies.",
        "It was noted that the depreciation of these economies’ currencies had so far been relatively contained and was primarily focused on countries that had weak fundamentals, relatively high foreign debt levels and, in particular, exposure to the US dollar.",
        "More generally, the point was made that growth in emerging market economies had made a sizeable positive contribution to global activity in the past decade, and that a natural adjustment was taking place.",
        "At the same time, there were indications that the euro area was moving away from reliance on external demand towards more domestic sources of expenditure, which should increase its resilience.",
        "Turning to the euro area, members generally concurred with the outlook in the September ECB staff projections, noting that the current projections contained slight downward revisions but no significant change to the growth outlook from the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Together with the latest economic indicators and survey results, this provided further confirmation that the ongoing economic expansion in the euro area remained broad-based, proceeding at a pace above that of potential growth.",
        "While the pull-back in euro area growth in the first half of the year could largely be attributed to weaker external demand, after exceptionally strong external trade in 2017, the point was made that the moderation in annual rates of growth over the projection horizon reflected convergence towards growth in line with potential.",
        "It was underlined that the latest survey outcomes, including those from the European Commission and the Purchasing Managers’ Index, remained at high levels from a historical perspective.",
        "At the same time, some recent hard data had been less positive than soft indicators.",
        "Industrial production figures in July, for example, were down, especially for several large euro area countries.",
        "In part this related to lower orders from abroad, while in some cases it could be explained partly by sector-specific factors.",
        "On the whole, the euro area economy was seen to have shown a considerable degree of domestic resilience so far and to have become more robust in recent years, in the context of higher capacity utilisation rates and partly as a result of significant reforms undertaken by many euro area countries since the financial crisis.",
        "However, at the same time, caution was seen as warranted since heightened uncertainty in the global environment might yet impact the euro area more significantly over time.",
        "A number of points were raised regarding the latest ECB staff projections for euro area activity, which had maintained a robust outlook, with only small revisions to the projections for growth.",
        "It was recalled that there had now been two consecutive downward corrections to growth, with the outlook for 2018 having been revised down from 2.4% in the March 2018 projection exercise to 2.1% and to 2.0% in the June and September exercises respectively, largely reflecting the less favourable data on the current quarter, while quarter-on-quarter changes in real GDP were limited.",
        "In this context, a remark was made that some of the factors behind the revisions might not be entirely of a transitory nature.",
        "As regards the projection for euro area export growth, it was pointed out that export market shares were assumed to remain constant over the projection horizon, which could be considered a rather benign scenario.",
        "At the same time, it was acknowledged that a large part of the euro’s recent appreciation was due to developments in the Turkish lira, and that the effects were therefore likely to be more heterogeneous across euro area countries.",
        "It was also argued that there could be larger spillovers from weaker external demand to domestic demand.",
        "Although the effects on investment might have been limited so far, it was not certain that this would continue to be the case.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, remarks were made on the likelihood of a stronger upward impact on euro area growth from a more expansionary fiscal stance, which could be expected in several large countries.",
        "At the same time, there was a risk that procyclical fiscal policies could have a negative effect on resilience.",
        "The point was made that consideration should be given to the quality of public expenditure and to its impact on potential output.",
        "More generally, the current broad-based expansion called for rebuilding fiscal buffers.",
        "At the same time, the full and consistent implementation of the EU’s fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remained essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy.",
        "Against this background, risks to the euro area growth outlook were generally assessed to have remained broadly balanced overall, with risks relating to rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility having gained more prominence recently.",
        "While it was remarked that a case could also be made for characterising the risks to activity as now being tilted to the downside given the clear prevalence of downward global risks, it was agreed that the assessment that risks were broadly balanced should be maintained, also as the underlying strength of the economy was judged to be mitigating downside risks to activity.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Annual euro area headline inflation had been 2.0% in August 2018, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 2.1% in July.",
        "Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation were likely to hover around the current level for the remainder of the year.",
        "While measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, they had been increasing from earlier lows.",
        "It was observed that domestic cost pressures were strengthening and broadening amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, which were pushing up wage growth.",
        "Underlying inflation was expected to pick up towards the end of the year and to increase gradually over the medium term.",
        "Members considered that the outlook for inflation was broadly confirmed by the latest ECB staff projections.",
        "Although the headline rate was expected to remain somewhat below 2% over the projection horizon, the inflation outlook was assessed as remaining broadly on track.",
        "At the same time, uncertainty about the outlook appeared to be receding.",
        "Some encouragement was also taken from recent developments in OECD inflation, which seemed to be picking up.",
        "OECD core inflation was currently around the same level as in 2007, and the headline level of inflation slightly above, so that global inflation was also providing support to inflation in the euro area.",
        "In exchanging views about recent wage developments, members noted that there had been a pick-up in wage growth.",
        "This was evident in a range of measures, including negotiated wages, compensation per worker and compensation per hour, especially in those countries where the business cycle was more mature.",
        "This assessment was supported by evidence put forward for a number of individual countries.",
        "Higher wage growth was generally seen to reflect the tightening labour market and was considered a key factor in increasing confidence in the inflation outlook.",
        "However, it was also underlined that the transmission of higher wages to consumer price inflation remained uncertain and subject to time lags.",
        "In this regard, it was argued that high rates of capacity utilisation could lead to an increase in labour productivity, which might in turn mitigate the impact of wage growth on inflation.",
        "Some consideration was also given to the possible adverse impact of downside risks to growth on the outlook for inflation.",
        "In this context, members discussed the extent to which a negative supply shock arising from protectionist measures, with positive effects on inflation, might be more than offset by a negative demand shock, if there were sizeable confidence effects.",
        "Given the uncertainty surrounding possible trade diversion and disruptions along global supply chains, as well as broader confidence effects, the view was expressed that it was not clear ex ante which effects would dominate with respect to prices.",
        "As regards recent developments in inflation expectations, members noted that longer-term market and survey-based measures were broadly unchanged.",
        "The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had been relatively stable at around 1.7% for some time, showing little volatility.",
        "Longer-term inflation expectations seemed on the whole to be reasonably well-anchored.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) growth had declined to 4.0% in July 2018, from 4.5% in June.",
        "Apart from some volatility in monthly flows, M3 growth was increasingly supported by bank credit creation.",
        "The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth.",
        "It was noted that the recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 was proceeding.",
        "The growth of loans to NFCs and households was robust, remaining unchanged from June in both cases.",
        "Credit creation was seen to be supported by the overall improvement in banks’ balance sheets, which was also evidenced by the continued decline in the level of non-performing loans.",
        "Likewise, lending rates for households and NFCs remained at very favourable levels, supporting credit flows to the private sector.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that incoming information, including the September 2018 ECB staff projections, broadly confirmed the Governing Council’s previous assessment of an ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy, at growth rates above potential, and gradually rising inflationary pressures.",
        "The underlying strength of the euro area economy continued to support confidence in the sustained convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim even after a gradual winding-down of net asset purchases.",
        "At the same time, significant monetary policy stimulus was still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation over the medium term.",
        "There was broad agreement among members that financial conditions remained very supportive of a continued economic expansion and rising domestic price pressures in the euro area, although they had tightened somewhat overall since the Governing Council’s July monetary policy meeting.",
        "In particular, equity prices had fallen in the light of heightened geopolitical and trade tensions.",
        "Moreover, the euro’s nominal effective exchange rate had appreciated, although this was mainly due to a weakening of a few emerging market economies’ currencies.",
        "It was also highlighted that – taking a somewhat longer perspective – the euro had seen a significant appreciation of more than 10% since the beginning of 2017.",
        "At the same time, bond yields had generally been broadly unchanged or had moved slightly lower over most of this period.",
        "There was also broad agreement that the incoming information, despite remaining uncertainties, vindicated the Governing Council’s earlier assessments of progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation carried out at the previous monetary policy meetings in June and July 2018.",
        "In particular, inflation was projected to move along the trajectory already contained in the June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections and could be assessed as broadly in line with the ECB’s medium-term objective.",
        "Also, while measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, they had been increasing from earlier lows.",
        "Comfort was drawn from the strengthening and broadening of domestic cost pressures, which were supported by the ongoing economic expansion, high levels of capacity utilisation and increasing labour market tightness, which was leading to rising wages.",
        "Uncertainty around the inflation outlook was receding.",
        "In the light of the confirmation of the medium-term inflation outlook, members agreed that the June 2018 monetary policy decisions remained appropriate and called for a reaffirmation of the prevailing policy posture.",
        "Accordingly, all members supported the proposal made by Mr Praet in his introduction that, in line with the anticipation expressed at the Governing Council’s June monetary policy meeting, the monthly pace of net asset purchases would be reduced to €15 billion from October to December 2018.",
        "It was also seen as prudent to reiterate the Governing Council’s anticipation that – subject to incoming data confirming the medium-term inflation outlook – net purchases would then end.",
        "This was seen to be consistent with the Governing Council’s data-driven approach to monetary policy and fully in line with the decisions taken at the Governing Council’s June monetary policy meeting.",
        "It was underlined that uncertainties emanating from rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility had become more prominent recently, which continued to call for prudence in the formulation of the monetary policy stance.",
        "Against this background, members also agreed that a significant degree of monetary accommodation was still necessary to ensure a durable convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "This implied that all the other elements of the Governing Council’s forward guidance pertaining to the path of the key ECB interest rates and to its reinvestment policy should be reasserted.",
        "The view was widely shared that the decisions taken by the Governing Council at its June monetary policy meeting, regarding the anticipated phasing-out of the APP and the enhanced forward guidance, had been absorbed smoothly by markets and had been vindicated by the subsequent evolution of data and projections.",
        "It was highlighted that, in an environment still subject to a number of uncertainties, the current configuration of the monetary policy stance was robust to small changes in the outlook.",
        "Ample monetary policy accommodation remained in place, notably owing to the stock of assets on the ECB’s balance sheet and the associated reinvestments, as well as the enhanced forward guidance on interest rates.",
        "This continued to support a sustained convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, while the Governing Council retained sufficient flexibility to respond to possible future shocks, if needed.",
        "On communication, members widely concurred with the elements proposed by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "In particular, it was seen as appropriate to maintain a steady hand in communication, in line with the decisions and communication adopted at the Governing Council’s June and July monetary policy meetings.",
        "Accordingly, it needed to be emphasised that the incoming data confirmed the ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy.",
        "It was likewise important to stress that risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook could still be assessed as being broadly balanced, in line with earlier assessments, although it had to be acknowledged that risks relating to the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility had gained more prominence recently.",
        "Overall, however, it was important to highlight that the conditions remained in place for inflation to move sustainably towards the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "In the light of still prevailing uncertainties and only gradually rising underlying inflation, there was also broad agreement among the members that remaining patient, prudent and persistent with regard to monetary policy was still essential.",
        "Accordingly, it needed to be recalled that, even if the net flows under the APP were coming to an end, monetary policy would remain highly accommodative.",
        "In particular, an ample degree of monetary accommodation would continue to be provided by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, as well as the Governing Council’s enhanced forward guidance.",
        "Moreover, it was widely considered prudent to restate the Governing Council’s readiness to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continued to move towards the Governing Council’s aim in a sustained manner.",
        "Furthermore, it was seen as warranted to reinforce the call for other policy areas to contribute more decisively to raising longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities.",
        "This also included stepping up efforts in the fiscal domain towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances, notably via improvements in the quality of public investment.",
        "Moreover, the current environment of low interest rates and broad-based growth generally called for governments to rebuild fiscal buffers, especially in countries with high public debt.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council confirmed that it would continue to make net purchases under the APP at the current monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of September 2018.",
        "After September, the Governing Council would reduce the monthly pace of net asset purchases to €15 billion until the end of December 2018 and anticipated that, subject to incoming data confirming the medium-term inflation outlook, net purchases would then end.",
        "The Governing Council intended to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 13-14 December 2017, the German and the US government bond yield curves had steepened, led by long-term bond yields, after the flattening observed previously.",
        "Both real and nominal forces seemed to have contributed to an increase in the term premium, which likely reflected, in part, changes in the expected global supply of and demand for safe bonds, as well as investors’ cautious reappraisal of the risks surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "At the same time, inflation risk premia both in the United States and in the euro area remained in, or close to, negative territory.",
        "The marked and persistent rise in oil prices and the strong economic backdrop might have contributed to the recent repricing of inflation risk premia at the global level.",
        "The EONIA forward curve showed that there had been a reassessment of the monetary policy outlook in the euro area since mid-December 2017.",
        "From the December monetary policy meeting to the day before the release of the account of that meeting, the EONIA forward curve had steepened noticeably.",
        "The release of the account had further amplified this trend.",
        "The EONIA forward curve also signalled that market participants had brought forward expectations of the first ECB rate hike, although other indicators suggested that this could also be related to a change in market expectations about the end of the asset purchase programme (APP).",
        "In foreign exchange markets, a persistent and broad strengthening of the euro since the December monetary policy meeting prevailed.",
        "The current situation was characterised by a combination of a strengthening of the euro and a broad weakness of the US dollar.",
        "Regarding stock markets, the picture for the euro area contrasted somewhat with that for the United States.",
        "In the case of the euro area, staff estimates suggested that the cumulative gains over the past year fully reflected improvements in expected earnings associated with the strong economic expansion, while in the United States improved earnings prospects only accounted for a fraction of the gains in 2017.",
        "Turning, in conclusion, to a more structural issue, Mr Cœuré referred to the year-end developments on the repo and the forex swap market.",
        "Overall, the repo market had remained resilient, reflecting advance market preparations for the year-end balance sheet constraints.",
        "Contrary to the end of 2016, implied rates for transactions covering the 2017 year-end had been closely aligned with realised rates.",
        "Market participants had reported that the Eurosystem’s securities lending facilities had also played an important role in relieving tensions.",
        "Similarly, in the forex swap market, an increase in the implied US dollar rates covering the 2017 year-end had turned out to be visibly milder than in 2016.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "As regards the external environment, global activity had continued to firm, with signs of a cyclical upturn in investment.",
        "Growth in global goods imports had slowed in October 2017.",
        "However, trade indicators remained relatively buoyant, with the global Purchasing Managers’ Index for new export orders again at a high level in December and above its long-term average.",
        "Despite the increasingly synchronised global upturn, underlying price pressures remained subdued.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area had picked up from 2.2% in October to 2.4% in November, reflecting an acceleration in both energy and food prices.",
        "Excluding food and energy, OECD annual inflation had remained stable at 1.9%.",
        "Inflation remained subdued despite tightening labour markets across advanced economies.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s December monetary policy meeting, non-oil commodity prices had increased by 7%.",
        "Brent oil prices had risen by 7.5%, standing at USD 69.6 on 23 January 2018.",
        "Over the same period, the euro had strengthened both against the US dollar and, to a lesser extent, in nominal effective terms against the currencies of the euro area’s 38 major trading partners.",
        "The economic expansion in the euro area remained solid and broad-based.",
        "Euro area quarterly GDP growth in the third quarter of 2017 had been revised up from 0.6% to 0.7% in Eurostat’s third release.",
        "Incoming data since the December monetary policy meeting had generally surprised on the upside.",
        "Favourable financing conditions, steady income and profit growth, and a robust labour market remained the key factors supporting aggregate demand.",
        "Real private consumption had increased by 0.4% quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2017, after second quarter growth of 0.6%, continuing to benefit from solid growth in labour income and the low saving ratio.",
        "The strength of the labour market expansion was confirmed, with employment in the euro area increasing by 1.7% in the third quarter of 2017 in year-on-year terms.",
        "Since the trough in the second quarter of 2013, the number of people employed had increased by 7.4 million.",
        "Monthly trade data for extra-euro area goods exports suggested that the external impetus to euro area activity remained solid.",
        "Moreover, survey indicators also signalled ongoing strong export dynamics in the near term.",
        "A comparison of forecasts by other public and private institutions revealed that recent revisions to the euro area growth outlook had also been positive in the light of the buoyant data.",
        "Turning to euro area price developments, HICP inflation had decreased to 1.4% in December 2017, from 1.5% in November.",
        "This reflected mainly developments in energy prices.",
        "Meanwhile, most measures of underlying inflation had lately been lower than in mid-2017 and had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.",
        "Pressures along the pricing chain remained broadly stable and subdued.",
        "Regarding wages, annual growth in compensation per employee stood at 1.7% in the third quarter of 2017, unchanged from the previous quarter, but up from the low of 1.1% recorded in the second quarter of 2016.",
        "The inflation outlook, as contained in the December 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, was comparable with other major forecasts for 2018 but at the lower end of the range for 2019 and 2020.",
        "Inflation expectations in the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the first quarter of 2018 showed average inflation expectations of 1.5%, 1.7% and 1.8% for 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively.",
        "Compared with the previous survey round, this represented upward revisions of 0.1 percentage point for 2018 and 2019.",
        "Longer-term market-based measures of inflation expectations had increased further, in line with the gradual upward trend observed since the middle of 2017.",
        "The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead currently stood at 1.78%.",
        "Turning to financial conditions, EONIA forward rates had increased across maturities.",
        "At the same time, indices of financial conditions had not changed materially.",
        "While the rise in euro area equity valuations implied some loosening, this had been broadly offset by a simultaneous tightening from increases in interest rates and the euro exchange rate.",
        "Financing conditions for euro area non-financial corporations (NFCs) continued to be very favourable.",
        "The overall nominal cost of external financing for NFCs was estimated to have remained broadly constant at a level of around 4.4%.",
        "Robust monetary dynamics had continued in November, with annual growth in the broad monetary aggregate M3 hovering around 5% since the start of the APP.",
        "The gradual recovery in loan growth had also continued.",
        "This development had been driven mainly by an increase in the annual growth of loans to NFCs, while the growth of loans to households remained broadly stable.",
        "Credit developments continued to be supported by low bank lending rates for NFCs and households.",
        "According to the euro area bank lending survey results for the fourth quarter of 2017, credit standards had eased for loans to households, while they had remained broadly unchanged for loans to enterprises.",
        "Loan demand had continued to increase across all categories.",
        "Finally, regarding fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was expected to be mildly expansionary in 2018 and broadly neutral in 2019-20.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet remarked that, while financial conditions had not changed materially since the December 2017 monetary policy meeting, the expected path of short-term interest rates had moved upwards and exchange rate volatility had increased.",
        "This reflected, in part, heightened market sensitivity to perceived changes in communication regarding the ECB’s forward guidance.",
        "Borrowing conditions for firms and households remained very favourable, in particular in the light of improved macroeconomic prospects.",
        "Incoming information pointed to a further strengthening in the pace of economic expansion.",
        "Risks to the growth outlook remained broadly balanced, with some upside risks in the near term.",
        "Downside risks continued to relate primarily to global factors, including developments in foreign exchange markets.",
        "At the same time, the economic expansion had not yet translated into higher underlying inflation.",
        "Price pressures remained muted and measures of underlying inflation had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.",
        "However, the acceleration in the cyclical momentum and the ongoing reduction of economic slack strengthened the Governing Council’s confidence that inflation would converge to its aim.",
        "Overall, with inflation convergence proceeding only gradually, patience and persistence in monetary policy remained warranted.",
        "An ample degree of accommodation was still needed for inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation developments in the medium term.",
        "On the basis of this assessment, Mr Praet proposed, at this stage, to reconfirm the decisions taken at the October 2017 monetary policy meeting, including all elements of the ECB’s forward guidance.",
        "The strength of the forward guidance rested on the consistency of communication over time.",
        "The Governing Council’s communication therefore needed to: (a) acknowledge the robust pace of the economic expansion; (b) confirm confidence that the upswing would eventually lead to inflation converging towards the ECB’s aim; and (c) reiterate the importance of patience and persistence in monetary policy for inflation pressures to build up and support convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "Looking ahead, the Governing Council would continue to assess progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.",
        "As previously communicated, its assessment was based on three criteria: first, inflation should be on a path to reach levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, and there should be no doubt about the commitment to reach this aim; second, the range of likely outcomes around that path should be reasonably contained; and, third, the path should be maintained even in less supportive monetary policy conditions.",
        "Once the Governing Council judged that these criteria were met, net asset purchases would expire in line with the stated forward guidance.",
        "From that point in time, the evolution of inflation would remain conditional on the reinvestment of principal payments continuing for an extended period of time and on policy rates remaining at their present levels well past the end of net asset purchases.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "According to recent data and survey results, growth momentum continued to be solid and broad-based, supported by very favourable financing conditions, and pointed to a robust pace of economic expansion looking ahead.",
        "Incoming information was considered to have corroborated the positive outlook for growth embedded in the December 2017 Eurosystem staff projections, as also reflected in the latest update of the IMF’s outlook for the euro area, in which the forecast for euro area growth had been revised up substantially for both 2018 and 2019.",
        "As regards the outlook and risks for the external environment, members agreed that the latest indicators pointed to a further improvement in global activity and trade.",
        "The picture of a robust global economic expansion was supported by the latest IMF update, with global forecasts being revised up for the current year and for 2019.",
        "There was also strong momentum in global trade, which had recently been growing at rates above those of global activity.",
        "However, the balance of risks to the global economic expansion was considered to remain tilted to the downside.",
        "While the recent tax reform in the United States might have a greater than expected impact on economic growth in the short term, geopolitical uncertainties and uncertainty regarding the policy outlook in some major economies, including the risk of an increase in trade protectionism, continued to constitute downside risks.",
        "Moreover, although the past appreciation of the euro had so far had no significant negative impact on euro area external demand, volatility in foreign exchange markets represented a further risk that needed monitoring.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, members agreed that recent indicators had provided further evidence that the economic expansion was robust and broad-based, and was continuing to proceed at a pace above current estimates of potential growth.",
        "This strong cyclical momentum was leading to a reduction in economic slack and to increasing capacity utilisation rates.",
        "On the basis of the positive developments in short-term indicators, it was considered that quarterly real GDP growth around the turn of the year might again turn out to be higher than previously expected.",
        "In terms of the main components of demand, private consumption growth remained strong, supported by rising employment.",
        "Business investment was strengthening on the back of very favourable financing conditions, as well as improving corporate profitability and solid demand.",
        "Housing investment had also improved further in recent quarters.",
        "Domestic demand prospects were also underpinned by continued improvements in household and corporate sector balance sheets, facilitated by the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "Meanwhile, the broad-based global expansion was providing impetus to euro area exports.",
        "Members exchanged views about developments in the labour market and the degree of labour market slack remaining in the euro area.",
        "In particular, while further positive labour market developments were acknowledged – with employment and hours worked continuing to increase – attention was drawn to the fact that hours worked had not yet returned to their pre-crisis level.",
        "It was suggested that lower average hours worked relative to the pre-crisis period could be interpreted as evidence of continued labour market slack.",
        "A number of arguments were advanced to suggest that the decline in average hours since the crisis might, at least to some degree, have a more structural interpretation, reflecting for instance changes in the sectoral composition of the economy, such as the trend towards a larger services sector and increasing female participation rates.",
        "There were also indications that, in some countries, a sizeable proportion of part-time and temporary work could be considered as reflecting personal choices rather than underemployment.",
        "However, it was observed that long-term unemployment expectations had fallen to 7.5% in the SPF for the first quarter of 2018, from close to 8% in the previous round.",
        "This decline in expectations could be seen as confirmation of the positive results achieved by structural reforms.",
        "At the same time, as the actual unemployment rate in the euro area was currently 8.7%, the results might also be interpreted as suggesting that a still considerable degree of slack remained in the labour market.",
        "A number of remarks were made about recent exchange rate developments.",
        "While the euro exchange rate was not a target of ECB policy, movements in the exchange rate were deemed important insofar as they affected the outlook for growth and inflation in the euro area.",
        "It was also recalled from earlier Governing Council discussions that it was important to take into account the main factors behind the euro’s appreciation, as the impact on activity and prices of a change in the exchange rate differed depending on the underlying causes.",
        "Part of the exchange rate appreciation could be related to more positive sentiment towards the euro area, resulting from improvements in the euro area economy.",
        "It was argued that an exchange rate appreciation linked to positive developments in domestic demand could be expected to have a lower pass-through to inflation, as firms would likely use the strength of the economic situation as an opportunity to rebuild their profit margins, which they had reduced during the crisis.",
        "However, more recently the euro’s appreciation also reflected other factors, including communication on exchange rates and on the monetary policy outlook across major currency areas.",
        "In such cases, the pass-through to inflation could be stronger.",
        "It was also pointed out that the bilateral exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar had changed more than the euro’s nominal effective exchange rate.",
        "This had led market participants to attribute recent exchange rate volatility more to the weakness of the US dollar than to the strength of the euro.",
        "However, explaining the US dollar weakness was not straightforward, given the strength of recent data releases and the fiscal and monetary policy outlook in the United States.",
        "This also had to be taken into account when considering the consequences of the exchange rate appreciation for the euro area economy.",
        "In addition, an appreciation relative to an invoicing currency such as the US dollar could be more important for the strength of the pass-through than suggested by its weight in the effective exchange rate.",
        "The effect on the euro area economy would also depend on the extent and persistence of the exchange rate appreciation.",
        "In this context, it was remarked that the euro exchange rate had been subject to pronounced swings in the past and that the rather limited ability of economists to predict future developments in the exchange rate, including the risk of a further euro appreciation, needed to be recognised.",
        "Concerns were also expressed about recent statements in the international arena about exchange rate developments and, more broadly, the overall status of international relations.",
        "The importance of adhering to agreed statements on the exchange rate was emphasised, such as that included in the October 2017 communiqué of the 36th meeting of the IMF’s International Monetary and Financial Committee, which stated that excessive volatility or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse implications for economic and financial stability, and that members would refrain from competitive devaluations and would not target their exchange rates for competitive purposes.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement among members that the recent volatility in the exchange rate of the euro was a source of uncertainty which required monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "The risks to the euro area growth outlook were assessed to have remained broadly balanced, in line with the assessment made at the previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Annual euro area HICP inflation had declined to 1.4% in December 2017, compared with 1.5% in November.",
        "This decline mainly reflected developments in energy prices.",
        "Annual HICP inflation excluding food and energy had remained stable, at 0.9%, in December 2017, unchanged from the previous two months but slightly below the levels recorded in mid-2017, with the outlook for measures of underlying inflation considered to be broadly unchanged.",
        "Members agreed that measures of underlying inflation in the euro area had remained subdued, in part owing to special factors, and had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.",
        "Underlying inflation measures were, however, expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth.",
        "In particular, it was argued that the strong cyclical momentum, the ongoing reduction of slack and increasing capacity utilisation further strengthened confidence in the baseline outlook for inflation.",
        "The discrepancy, also observed in other major economies, between the ongoing expansion in economic activity and relatively subdued inflation dynamics was again highlighted.",
        "On a more positive note, it was pointed out that underlying measures of inflation had so far remained stable despite the appreciation of the exchange rate.",
        "It was furthermore noted that, according to the December 2017 Eurosystem staff projections, annual HICP inflation excluding food and energy would reach 1.8% in 2020, while in the period prior to the financial crisis its average increase had been around 1.5%.",
        "However, a remark was made that, in the absence of persistent positive contributions to price developments from food and energy components in the future, underlying inflation would need to be higher than its pre-crisis average if the ECB was to meet its inflation aim on a sustained basis.",
        "With regard to wage growth, it was observed that annual increases in compensation per employee had increased somewhat since the second quarter of 2016 and had stood at 1.7% in the third quarter of 2017.",
        "Although wage dynamics were still considered to be relatively subdued, it was expected that cost pressures would gradually increase as the economic expansion continued and slack in the labour market was absorbed.",
        "However, wage forecasts in the past had been too high and the pick-up in wages as embodied in the projections was still uncertain.",
        "Members also took note of recent developments in inflation expectations.",
        "Both market-based measures and survey-based measures were broadly unchanged for longer-term horizons.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) had continued to expand at a robust pace.",
        "The gradual recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector, visible since the start of 2014, was proceeding amid a further pick-up in the growth of loans to NFCs and households.",
        "The expansion in credit continued to be supported by very favourable borrowing costs for firms and households across the euro area.",
        "It was nonetheless noted that deleveraging in the non-financial private sectors had progressed further according to various measures.",
        "This was seen as reassuring for the credit outlook and also from a financial stability perspective.",
        "Reference was also made to evidence from the bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2017, which indicated that loan growth continued to be supported by increasing demand and a further easing in overall lending conditions.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The strong cyclical momentum and the associated ongoing reduction of economic slack further strengthened the confidence that inflation would converge to the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "At the same time, underlying price pressures remained muted overall and had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.",
        "Overall, this assessment confirmed the continued need for an ample degree of monetary accommodation to ensure a sustained adjustment of inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Accordingly, this suggested leaving the current policy configuration unchanged and reconfirming the decisions taken at the October 2017 monetary policy meeting.",
        "There was broad agreement among members that the current monetary policy stance remained broadly appropriate.",
        "With regard to financial market conditions, equity prices had further increased in the inter-meeting period, while there had been an upward move in the expected path of short-term interest rates and a rise in long-term government bond yields, together with an appreciation of the euro.",
        "It was noted that, while long-term yields had indeed increased somewhat overall, similar levels had already been observed in the course of last year.",
        "Moreover, these increases were unlikely to translate immediately into more restrictive borrowing conditions for households and firms, as bank lending rates, in particular, responded only with some lag to tighter capital market conditions.",
        "Several factors contributing to the limited tightening in some measures of financial conditions were discussed.",
        "While this could be seen as partly related to a further improvement in domestic fundamentals, spillovers from global financial conditions, as well as heightened sensitivity of financial markets to communication on exchange rates and monetary policy, also played a role.",
        "In this context, the point was reiterated that the monetary policy stance tended to become mechanically more expansionary in an environment of improving macroeconomic conditions and an unchanged policy configuration, other things being equal.",
        "The incoming information, while again more positive on euro area growth prospects, was seen as confirming the current policy posture, as the strong growth momentum was still accompanied by weak price pressures.",
        "Against this overall background, members widely agreed that, while there was reason to be increasingly confident about the path of inflation, patience and persistence with regard to monetary policy were still warranted for inflation to converge to the Governing Council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner.",
        "This called for maintaining the current monetary policy stance, which related to the full set of policy instruments.",
        "It also implied reaffirming the monetary policy decisions taken at the monetary policy meeting in late October with respect to net asset purchases and reinvestments, as well as key policy interest rates, together with the Governing Council’s forward guidance pertaining to those measures, including the established embedded sequencing of policy instruments.",
        "An ample degree of monetary stimulus was generally seen to be still needed to accompany the economic expansion and the corresponding build-up of price pressures in support of headline inflation developments over the medium term.",
        "It was recalled that, while the relative importance of policy rate guidance and of the accumulated stock of assets for the overall stance of policy was increasing over time, the path of inflation still remained contingent on the continued stimulus provided by the full set of the ECB’s policy measures, including the net asset purchases.",
        "In this context, a remark was made regarding possible implications of the current accommodative monetary policy stance for financial stability in specific market segments, such as high-yield corporate bonds and commercial real estate.",
        "It was, however, recalled that the evidence currently available suggested no significant side effects of the ECB’s monetary policy measures on financial stability on the whole and that, in any case, macroprudential policy tools were to be seen as the first line of defence in addressing potential financial stability risks.",
        "As regards communication, agreement was generally expressed with the proposal made by Mr Praet in his introduction, suggesting broad continuity in the Governing Council’s communication at the present stage.",
        "Members widely acknowledged the need for steadiness in communication, which entailed re-emphasising confidence in the inflation outlook, while maintaining a policy stance based on the broad spectrum of policy instruments in place and the established sequencing of policy instruments.",
        "In this context, it was remarked that communication on monetary policy would continue to develop according to the evolving state of the economy in line with the ECB’s forward guidance, with a view to avoiding abrupt or disorderly adjustments at a later stage.",
        "However, changes in communication were generally seen to be premature at this juncture, as inflation developments remained subdued despite the robust pace of economic expansion.",
        "Therefore, the Governing Council reiterated its steadfast commitment to its price stability objective and, specifically, to delivering on its promise to secure a sustained return of inflation rates to levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "It was emphasised that monetary policy had to remain patient and persistent, while prudence should be exercised with respect to the Governing Council’s communication.",
        "There was broad agreement among members to convey the Governing Council’s concerns about the recent volatility in the euro exchange rate, which represented a source of uncertainty that had to be monitored with respect to its implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "In this context, it was also seen as important to reaffirm the agreed G7 and G20 exchange rate language, which entailed the commitment to market-determined exchange rates and refraining from targeting them for competitive purposes.",
        "Finally, the ongoing need for decisive reform efforts by euro area governments to strengthen the longer-term growth potential and to reduce vulnerabilities was reiterated.",
        "In this context, it was stressed that the strengthening of Economic and Monetary Union remained a priority.",
        "Hence, the ongoing discussions on completing the banking union and the capital markets union, and on further deepening Economic and Monetary Union, were highly welcome.",
        "A remark was also made on the increasingly widespread prospects of a loosening of the fiscal stance in a range of jurisdictions, including some with no or limited fiscal space.",
        "This warranted reiterating calls for respecting the existing fiscal rules and for rebuilding fiscal buffers, in particular in countries where government debt remained high.",
        "Members broadly agreed that any further evolution of the Governing Council’s communication on monetary policy would be gradual and would proceed in line with improvements in the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Communication would evolve naturally in line with the ECB’s forward guidance should inflation make further progress towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim as set out in the established criteria for a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.",
        "The language pertaining to the monetary policy stance could be revisited early this year as part of the regular reassessment at the forthcoming monetary policy meetings.",
        "In this context, some members expressed a preference for dropping the easing bias regarding the APP from the Governing Council’s communication as a tangible reflection of reinforced confidence in a sustained adjustment of the path of inflation.",
        "However, it was concluded that such an adjustment was premature and not yet justified by the stronger confidence.",
        "It was also recalled – as on previous occasions – that even when net purchases were terminated, the monetary policy stance would remain highly accommodative, as the evolution of inflation would remain conditional on reinvestments continuing for an extended period of time and on policy rates remaining at their present levels well past the end of the ECB’s net asset purchases.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council continued to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.",
        "With regard to non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirmed that the net asset purchases, at the new monthly pace of €30 billion, were intended to run until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "If the outlook became less favourable, or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stood ready to increase the APP in terms of size and/or duration.",
        "The Eurosystem would reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary.",
        "This would contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the draft introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 7-8 March 2018.",
        "With regard to recent bond market developments, a gradual decline in the ten-year German government bond yield, which started in mid-February, had pushed yields back to levels not far from those observed for most of 2017.",
        "In the week leading up to the current meeting there had been a partial reversal of this downward trend.",
        "However, yields still remained well below the levels that had been observed earlier in 2018.",
        "By contrast, the ten-year US Treasury bond yield had resisted broad downward pressure and was approaching levels around 3% for the first time in more than four years.",
        "As a result, the yield spread between ten-year German Bunds and US Treasuries was at its widest since the late 1980s.",
        "Changes in both components of long-term yields, the term premium and average expected short-term rates, contributed to these developments.",
        "A model-based breakdown suggested that the decline in long-term rates up until the week before the current meeting could be attributed to a drop in the term premium on both sides of the Atlantic.",
        "However, while the expectations component of German yields had remained fairly stable, there had been a continued rise in the expected path of future short-term rates in the United States.",
        "This helped to offset the initial drop in the term premium in the United States and suggested that investors maintained a favourable view about the prospects for the US economy.",
        "As regards the causes for the decline in the term premium both in the United States and in the euro area, which had only recently come to a halt, two broad factors could be distinguished.",
        "The first related to incoming data that had been weaker than expected, in particular in the euro area.",
        "The second likely reflected global concerns about the current geopolitical environment.",
        "The increase in global uncertainty, as well as the recent weaker than expected economic data, had also contributed to expectations of a later first rate hike in the euro area.",
        "According to the EONIA forward curve, a 10-basis point increase was currently priced in for around June 2019.",
        "This was consistent with the evidence from market surveys on euro area monetary policy expectations, which suggested a growing conviction among market participants that a rate rise would take place in the second quarter of 2019.",
        "Turning to developments in stock markets, equities had, on the whole, benefited from the shifts in monetary policy expectations and the fall in long-term yields.",
        "The EURO STOXX 50 index had gone up by around 3% since the Governing Council’s March monetary policy meeting.",
        "The picture differed somewhat in the United States, where the Standard & Poor’s 500 index had lost around 2% over the same period, and in emerging markets, where stock markets had also declined.",
        "In foreign exchange markets, volatility remained close to record low levels.",
        "Some market participants saw technical factors as having contributed to the broad stabilisation of the US dollar, in particular the cost of hedging.",
        "Mr Cœuré noted that the stability of exchange rates also suggested that investors did not appear to have materially changed their views on the euro area or US economic outlook.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, global economic activity remained sustained, although recent indicators had pointed to some softening in momentum in the last couple of months.",
        "In March, the global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index had decreased, but it remained close to its long-term average.",
        "By contrast, consumer and business confidence indicators had held up well in February.",
        "Global financial conditions had remained supportive, sustained by accommodative monetary policies.",
        "Global trade indicators had been mixed, overall signalling some deceleration in the first quarter of this year.",
        "Inflation dynamics had continued to be modest and underlying price pressures remained subdued.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD countries had remained stable in February, while inflation excluding food and energy had edged up marginally.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s March monetary policy meeting, Brent oil prices had risen sharply and stood at USD 73.5 on 24 April 2018, their highest level since the end of November 2014.",
        "Over the same period, the euro had remained broadly stable against the US dollar and also in nominal effective terms.",
        "Turning to the euro area economy, euro area GDP growth had remained robust in the fourth quarter of 2017.",
        "Eurostat’s third estimate for the quarter put quarterly growth at 0.7%, implying that the euro area had grown for almost five consecutive years.",
        "However, recent incoming information had generally surprised to the downside and pointed to some moderation, following several quarters of higher than expected growth.",
        "Surveys had shown a broad-based decline in sentiment in the first quarter of 2018 across most sectors and countries.",
        "At the same time, sentiment indicators were still at high levels and well above their historical averages.",
        "Overall, although incoming survey data suggested slower growth in the short term, the data remained consistent with a solid and broad-based expansion across sectors and countries.",
        "The moderation in part reflected a pull-back from the high pace of growth observed at the end of 2017, while temporary factors and supply constraints in certain sectors in some countries might also have played a role.",
        "Concerns about trade protectionism could also have dampened business sentiment and expectations.",
        "The underlying strength in growth continued to be supported by favourable financing conditions, a robust labour market and steady income and profit growth.",
        "Euro area annual HICP inflation had stood at 1.3% in March 2018, up from 1.1% in February.",
        "This increase reflected mainly higher food inflation, which had continued to be driven by base effects.",
        "HICP inflation excluding food and energy had stood at 1.0% in March, unchanged from February and January but slightly up from the 0.9% recorded in December 2017.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation remained subdued and had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.",
        "Meanwhile, price pressures along the pricing chain had continued to be subdued, with no clear evidence as yet of the euro’s appreciation having had an impact on later stages of the chain.",
        "Recent developments in wage growth were signalling a moderate upward trend.",
        "The results of the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the second quarter of 2018 had shown slight downward revisions for HICP inflation expectations in 2019 and 2020.",
        "At the same time, average longer-term inflation expectations had remained broadly unchanged, at 1.9%.",
        "Expectations for inflation excluding food and energy were unchanged over the whole horizon.",
        "Similarly, market-based inflation expectations stood broadly unchanged.",
        "Compared with forecasts by other public and private institutions, which had become available since the Governing Council’s early March meeting, the inflation projection in the March ECB staff projections was on the low side for both 2018 and 2019, but well within the range for 2020.",
        "Financial conditions continued to be accommodative despite geopolitical uncertainties.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s March monetary policy meeting, the EONIA forward curve had flattened.",
        "Long-term rates were somewhat lower than in March, notwithstanding a very recent increase, while inflation expectations were broadly unchanged.",
        "Equities were still supported by solid earnings expectations.",
        "The overall cost of financing for euro area firms had declined marginally since the March monetary policy meeting.",
        "The annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 had moderated in February 2018, to 4.2%, but remained close to the narrow range of 4.5-5.5% observed since mid-2015.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector had overall remained on a path of moderate expansion.",
        "Credit developments continued to be supported by low bank lending rates for non-financial corporations (NFCs) and households and a favourable economic outlook.",
        "According to the euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2018, credit standards had eased considerably for loans to enterprises and loans for house purchase.",
        "At the same time, loan demand had continued to increase across all categories.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet recalled that financial conditions had remained broadly stable at accommodative levels amid increased uncertainties about the prospects for international trade relations, and that borrowing conditions remained very favourable.",
        "Incoming information since the Governing Council’s March monetary policy meeting had pointed to some moderation in the pace of economic growth, which, in part, reflected a pull-back from the high growth rates observed at the end of 2017.",
        "Temporary factors might also have been at work.",
        "It was thus important to monitor to what extent these developments also reflected a more prolonged softening in demand.",
        "Overall, growth could still be considered to remain solid and broad-based.",
        "Risks to growth continued to be broadly balanced, but those related to global factors, including the threat of increased protectionism, had become more prominent.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation had moved sideways since the March meeting and had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.",
        "At the same time, wages continued to edge higher and were expected to lend support to price pressures.",
        "All in all, the underlying strength of the euro area economy continued to support confidence that inflation would converge to the Governing Council’s inflation aim over the medium term.",
        "However, inflation convergence would likely proceed only gradually, remaining contingent on a highly accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "On the basis of this assessment, Mr Praet proposed, at this stage, to keep monetary policy unchanged and to reconfirm all elements of the ECB’s forward guidance, including the sequencing.",
        "Regarding communication, it was deemed important to highlight that, despite some moderation in the pace of growth, economic indicators had remained consistent with a solid and broad-based expansion in the euro area.",
        "Moreover, it needed to be emphasised that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remained broadly balanced, but those related to global factors, including the threat of increased protectionism, had become more prominent.",
        "Furthermore, the Governing Council could stress that the underlying strength of the euro area economy continued to support confidence that inflation would converge to its aim over the medium term, while reiterating the importance of prudence, patience and persistence in its monetary policy for inflation pressures to build up.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members agreed with the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Recent data and survey results pointed to some moderation in the pace of growth since the start of the year, but were so far considered to remain consistent with a solid and broad-based expansion, supported by very favourable financing conditions.",
        "It was underlined that this moderation in growth had come after a period of very strong growth and when incoming data had surprised on the upside.",
        "This moderation might therefore reflect in part an expected normalisation from last year’s exceptionally high growth rates, while unexpected temporary factors were also seen to have played a role.",
        "Hence, the underlying growth momentum was on the whole assessed to remain intact.",
        "At the same time, it was widely felt that uncertainty surrounding the outlook had increased and caution was seen as warranted in interpreting recent developments, also because the moderation in growth appeared to be broad-based across countries and sectors.",
        "A more pronounced weakening of demand, notably related to external factors, could therefore not be ruled out.",
        "Overall, the risks surrounding the outlook for economic growth were assessed to have remained broadly balanced, with downside risks related to the threat of trade protectionism having become more prominent.",
        "Regarding the outlook for the external environment, global economic activity was seen as remaining robust, although recent indicators suggested that momentum had weakened somewhat in the last few months.",
        "The picture of a sustained global economic expansion was supported by the latest IMF projections for world real GDP growth.",
        "In this context, it was remarked that the impact of the fiscal stimulus in the United States remained a major factor in the outlook for global activity.",
        "Overall, the balance of risks to the outlook for global activity, including a more prominent risk of increasing trade tensions and the uncertain implications of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, was considered to remain tilted to the downside.",
        "Members agreed on the importance of external risks to the economic outlook for the euro area.",
        "In particular, concern was expressed that trade conflicts might not only have an adverse impact on activity for the countries involved via reduced trade, but could exert broader effects as a consequence of increased uncertainty and diminished confidence.",
        "Some of this uncertainty was related to upcoming decisions on trade policies.",
        "It was also remarked that turbulent trade relations had the potential to give rise to disorderly movements in exchange rates and to heightened volatility in financial markets.",
        "The impact of trade protectionism and of possible retaliatory measures on global and euro area economic growth was considered as ranging from limited to having more substantial effects, depending on the scale of the imposed tariffs and on the diversion of trade flows and relocation of production in response to such measures.",
        "Reference was also made to evidence suggesting quantitatively large effects from the uncertainty associated with protracted tensions in trade relations.",
        "Some euro area economies might have been seeing such effects in recent months, for example in weaker export orders.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, members discussed in more detail the moderation in economic growth at the start of the year, which was suggested by the latest hard data and survey-based indicators.",
        "It was noted that euro area real GDP had previously increased at a strong pace – by 0.7% quarter on quarter in both the third and fourth quarters of 2017, well above current estimates of potential output growth.",
        "Members concurred that the underlying growth momentum in the euro area and its largest economies remained broadly intact, and expressed confidence in the continuation of the expansion at a solid pace.",
        "The observation was made that, while there had been a decline in hard data and survey-based indicators since the Governing Council’s March monetary policy meeting, which had been rather broad-based both across euro area countries and across economic sectors, the indicators remained at elevated levels and were still clearly above their long-run historical averages.",
        "In exchanging views about the interpretation of incoming information, members shared information on recent developments in the respective national economies and sought to provide an assessment of the factors behind the signs of weaker activity.",
        "A number of reasons of a temporary nature could in part explain a stronger than anticipated moderation.",
        "For many economies, reference was made to the possible impact of weather conditions earlier in the year, which implied a loss in value added in some sectors of the economy, such as construction or retail, but could equally imply gains in other sectors, such as those related to energy.",
        "Other temporary factors related to strikes affecting certain sectors of the economy and the unusually severe wave of seasonal influenza in some countries.",
        "For the euro area as a whole, it was underlined that the signs of a moderation in economic growth at the start of the year did not change the picture regarding the underlying pace of expansion.",
        "In some parts of the euro area and in some sectors, the moderation in growth could be attributed to capacity constraints becoming increasingly binding.",
        "This was seen as consistent with the survey evidence on increasing labour supply shortages, suppliers’ delivery times and order backlogs provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "It was argued that, in the absence of supply constraints, there would be an elastic response of output to changes in demand but, as capacity constraints were reached, growth in activity could be expected to slow down, with price pressures picking up instead.",
        "However, it was also argued that there were signs of softening demand, which warranted monitoring.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that, while the direction of change in the measures of slack was clear, the measurement of the level of the output gap was surrounded by considerable uncertainty, as had been discussed by the Governing Council at its March monetary policy meeting.",
        "Looking ahead, members agreed that the underlying strength of the economic expansion remained broadly intact.",
        "At the same time, uncertainty surrounding the outlook had clearly increased and data releases ahead of the June monetary policy meeting would need to be carefully scrutinised to better understand the sources of the recent moderation in growth.",
        "In this regard, it was also deemed important to gain a deeper understanding of the reasons behind the high degree of synchronicity in the downturn in indicators, which might point to a broader weakening of demand.",
        "The need to closely monitor and assess the incoming data was emphasised.",
        "More generally, it was necessary to distinguish between temporary and potentially more lasting influences and to determine the extent to which they reflected a softening in demand as opposed to the emergence of supply constraints.",
        "This latter distinction was seen as especially relevant, as supply constraints had opposite implications for price pressures.",
        "Overall, the risks to the euro area growth outlook were assessed to have remained broadly balanced.",
        "At the same time, the downside risks related to global factors had become more prominent.",
        "It was also emphasised that there was a risk of a more expansionary and pro-cyclical fiscal policy.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Euro area annual HICP inflation had increased to 1.3% in March 2018, from 1.1% in January.",
        "This increase mainly reflected higher food price inflation.",
        "On the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation were likely to hover around 1.5% for the remainder of the year.",
        "It was noted that higher energy prices were currently supporting the outlook for headline inflation, while the latest data for non-energy industrial goods price inflation had surprised on the downside, which was argued to possibly also reflect a delayed pass-through from past appreciation of the euro.",
        "On balance, the picture for headline inflation had not changed materially.",
        "At the same time, measures of underlying inflation in the euro area remained subdued and had moved mostly sideways since the March monetary policy meeting.",
        "Members observed signs in a number of euro area countries that wage dynamics continued to pick up gradually and thus would, over time, contribute to the expected rise in underlying inflation.",
        "It was noted that, in some cases, this might not only reflect a reduction in labour market slack and higher productivity, but also a stronger role of the inflation expectations component in wage settlements.",
        "At the same time, evidence for some euro area economies suggested that there was stronger dynamism in the labour costs of the self-employed, as reflected in the prices that they charged for their services.",
        "Reference was also made to emerging signs of labour shortages and capacity constraints in a number of euro area countries and sectors of the economy, which could be expected to lead to increased wage and price dynamism over time.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that the degree of pass-through of wage pressures to prices remained uncertain and the ability of firms to absorb higher costs via lower mark-ups, as well as the behaviour of margins more generally, deserved further analysis.",
        "As regards recent developments in longer-term inflation expectations, members noted that both market-based and survey-based measures had remained broadly stable.",
        "Expectations of inflation five years ahead in the SPF for the second quarter of 2018 were unchanged at 1.9%.",
        "Market-based inflation expectations, as measured by the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, stood at 1.70%, the same level as that observed at the time of the March monetary policy meeting.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) had continued to expand at a robust pace, although it had fallen slightly below the range observed since mid-2015.",
        "The slight moderation in the growth rate of M3 was seen to reflect mainly a decline in the contribution of credit to general government amid the reduction in monthly purchase volumes by the Eurosystem under the asset purchase programme (APP).",
        "The gradual recovery in the growth of MFI loans to the private sector, underway since the start of 2014, was proceeding.",
        "Growth in loans to NFCs, in particular, continued to be supported by the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, with the reference period for the second series having ended in January.",
        "Reference was also made to the bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2018, which indicated increasing loan demand across all loan categories and a further easing of credit standards for loans to enterprises and loans for house purchase.",
        "Against this background, it was remarked that the risk-taking channel had so far supported the effectiveness of monetary policy by encouraging bank lending to the economy and it was reiterated that, from a prudential perspective, the impact of very easy credit conditions and low bank lending rates needed to be monitored closely.",
        "It was noted that potential financial stability risks should be addressed by macroprudential measures, as had already been proposed or implemented in some jurisdictions.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The recent incoming information pointed to some moderation in activity but so far remained consistent with a solid and broad-based expansion of the euro area economy.",
        "The underlying strength of the euro area economy continued to support the Governing Council’s confidence that inflation would gradually converge to its inflation aim of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "At the same time, measures of underlying inflation remained subdued and had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.",
        "For underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and support the path of headline inflation over the medium term, patience, persistence and prudence with regard to monetary policy remained warranted.",
        "Members broadly agreed that financial conditions continued to be very accommodative overall, in spite of increased uncertainty and volatility in some markets.",
        "A remark was made that survey and analysts’ expectations regarding APP net purchases were unchanged, with market participants continuing to anticipate net purchases concluding towards the end of 2018.",
        "Overall, the pass-through of the ECB’s monetary policy measures was continuing to provide significant support to borrowing conditions for firms and households.",
        "With regard to the progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the incoming information had on the whole changed little compared with the assessment made at the previous meeting.",
        "Headline inflation was up slightly from its recent trough but remained some distance from the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Price pressures were still weak and measures of underlying inflation had moved sideways.",
        "Despite the observed moderation in activity, confidence in the underlying strength of the euro area economy and the eventual convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s inflation aim remained unchanged.",
        "While measures of underlying inflation continued to be subdued, some comfort was drawn from encouraging signs of a strengthening in nominal wage growth and the continued anchoring of long-term inflation expectations at levels consistent with the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "In this context, a remark was made that the Phillips curve relationship may be non-linear, and this could support a swifter rebound in inflation when capacity constraints became binding.",
        "At the same time, it was widely cautioned that the uncertainty around the outlook had increased since the March monetary policy meeting.",
        "In particular, risks related to global factors, including the threat of increased protectionism, had become more prominent and warranted monitoring with regard to their implications for the medium-term outlook for growth and prices.",
        "The June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections would provide the next occasion for a more comprehensive assessment of progress with inflation.",
        "Members broadly agreed that an ample degree of monetary policy accommodation remained necessary to accompany the economic expansion and secure the gradual convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "The remaining uncertainties and the still muted underlying inflation pressures continued to justify caution and underlined the need to maintain patience, persistence and prudence with regard to monetary policy.",
        "Overall, while a view was expressed that the Governing Council’s criteria for a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation could be considered as close to being satisfied over a medium-term horizon, there was broad agreement that the evidence remained insufficient at the current stage.",
        "Against this background, members widely agreed that a steady hand with regard to monetary policy was warranted at the current stage, in line with the elements proposed by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "This called for maintaining the current monetary policy stance in relation to the full set of policy instruments, which involved reconfirming the October 2017 monetary policy decisions on net asset purchases and reinvestments, the ECB key interest rates and the Governing Council’s forward guidance on those measures, including the sequencing of policy instruments.",
        "Looking ahead, there was consensus that the net asset purchases would continue to be guided by the Governing Council’s assessment of the progress made towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation according to the three criteria of convergence, confidence and resilience.",
        "With regard to communication, steadiness was seen as important and members widely agreed with the elements for communication put forward by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "This entailed highlighting the need for prudence, patience and persistence in monetary policy for inflation pressures to build up and to deliver on the Governing Council’s commitment to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "Despite some moderation in the pace of growth, economic indicators so far remained consistent with a solid and broad-based expansion in the euro area.",
        "The underlying strength of the euro area economy continued to support the Governing Council’s confidence that inflation would converge to its aim over the medium term.",
        "At the same time, while risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remained broadly balanced, it was acknowledged that risks related to global factors, including the threat of increased protectionism, had become more prominent and warranted monitoring with regard to their implications for the medium-term outlook for growth and prices.",
        "It was reiterated that, beyond the horizon of the net asset purchases, the monetary policy support still necessary for inflation to converge to the inflation aim would be provided by the stock of acquired assets, by reinvestments continuing for an extended period of time, and by policy rates remaining at their present levels well past the end of the net asset purchases.",
        "Finally, as on previous occasions, the continuing case for substantial reform efforts by euro area governments was made with a view to reinforcing the longer-term growth potential of the euro area economy, increasing its resilience and reducing vulnerabilities.",
        "It was argued that structural reforms in euro area countries needed to be substantially stepped up, including with regard to reforms of education and training with a view to reducing skill mismatches in labour markets and enhancing productivity.",
        "There was broad agreement among members that it was warranted to reinforce calls for existing fiscal rules to be respected and for fiscal buffers to be rebuilt, in particular with regard to those Member States with high government debt.",
        "In addition, calls for a swift and substantive completion of the banking union and of the capital markets union were reiterated.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.",
        "Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirmed that the net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of €30 billion, were intended to run until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "The Eurosystem would reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary.",
        "This would contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the draft introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 24-25 January 2018, despite a short-lived and concentrated spike in market volatility, valuations across broad asset classes had remained consistent with continued optimism about the outlook for global growth.",
        "Real long-term yields had risen by around 30 basis points in the United States and 20 basis points in the euro area since the start of the year.",
        "While part of this movement reflected adjustments in term premia, it also likely reflected investors’ views on growth prospects, including the expected impact of the fiscal stimulus package adopted by the US Administration.",
        "Ten-year break-even inflation rates in the euro area had barely moved since the start of the year.",
        "By contrast, in the United States they had increased by more than 20 basis points.",
        "Markets had also reappraised the near-term monetary policy outlook in the United States, in part reflecting recent US employment and inflation data releases.",
        "In the euro area, monetary policy expectations had changed very little since the Governing Council’s January meeting.",
        "Market participants’ expectations about the timing of a first 10 basis point hike in the deposit facility rate had shifted out slightly.",
        "Turning to equity markets, two underlying forces were being exerted in opposite directions: expected earnings were continuing to push stock valuations higher, while the increase in discount rates was pulling stock prices lower on both sides of the Atlantic.",
        "Export-oriented countries and sectors seemed to have been most affected by recent concerns over trade relations.",
        "However, the turbulence in equity markets had not generated a more general sell-off of other risk assets.",
        "Looking at asset swap spreads for debt securities in Europe, only those of high-yield non-financial corporations (NFCs) had increased somewhat.",
        "When looking at sovereign yield spreads vis-à-vis Germany, the resilience had been notable considering the substantial issuance activity seen recently.",
        "The overall limited spillovers of recent price movements in the equity markets to other markets could also be seen when looking at a comparison of implied volatility across different markets, which had remained at comparatively low levels, except in equity markets.",
        "The observed jump in volatility in equity markets had, in turn, been exacerbated by technical flows, such as those prompted by investors following risk-parity and short volatility trading strategies.",
        "However, the VIX volatility index had fallen back from the very high levels reached in early February 2018.",
        "As regards recent exchange rate developments, some factors had likely been supportive of an appreciation of the US dollar, such as positive inflation news, higher US yields and a surge in global uncertainty, which, given the US dollar’s status as a safe haven asset, typically contributed to a strengthening of the currency.",
        "Nevertheless, other factors, which had been weighing on the US dollar in recent months, are likely to have remained at work, such as improved economic growth expectations in the rest of the world and greater borrowing needs in the United States to finance a potential increase in the current account deficit.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, global activity and trade momentum remained sustained.",
        "Surveys pointed to steady and broad-based global growth momentum at the start of 2018.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had increased slightly in February.",
        "Global trade indicators pointed to sustained growth around the turn of the year.",
        "Global goods import growth had slowed in the fourth quarter but trade indicators were relatively buoyant, with the global PMI new export orders series standing at a high level in January and above its long-term average.",
        "Despite the global upturn, underlying price pressures had remained subdued.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD countries had ticked down slightly in January, to 2.2%, from 2.3% in December, but core inflation had remained steady, with inflation excluding food and energy standing at 1.8% in January.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had decreased since the January meeting but had increased slightly compared with the December projection assumptions, standing at USD 65.4 per barrel on 6 March.",
        "Over the same period, non-oil commodity prices had increased by 2.7%, largely driven by rises in food prices and, to a lesser extent, in metal prices.",
        "The euro had appreciated slightly against the US dollar and also in nominal effective terms since the January meeting.",
        "Turning to the euro area economy, incoming data since the Governing Council’s January monetary policy meeting confirmed the ongoing economic expansion.",
        "Favourable financing conditions and steady income and profit growth, together with a robust labour market, continued to be the key factors supporting aggregate demand.",
        "Risks to the growth outlook remained broadly balanced.",
        "The positive cyclical momentum pointed to some upside risks in the near term, while downside risks continued to relate to global factors, including developments in foreign exchange markets and protectionism.",
        "According to the latest data, economic activity had remained robust in the fourth quarter of 2017.",
        "Eurostat’s flash estimate had put euro area real GDP growth at 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter.",
        "The expansion had been broad-based across sectors.",
        "Real value added had increased by 1.2% in the industrial sector (excluding construction), by 0.4% in the services sector and by 1.1% in the construction sector.",
        "Incoming data since the January meeting also pointed to continued expansion in the first quarter of 2018.",
        "These positive developments were also reflected in the March 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which projected real GDP growth at 2.5% in 2017, 2.4% in 2018 ,1.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020, representing an upward revision for 2018 compared with the December 2017 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "The favourable growth outlook was supported by a number of factors, including a continued global expansion, the ECB’s very accommodative monetary policy stance, improving labour markets and diminishing deleveraging pressures for NFCs and households.",
        "Nevertheless, real GDP growth was projected to slow somewhat over the projection horizon as tailwinds were expected to fade gradually.",
        "Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation had stood at 1.2% in February 2018, down from 1.3% in January.",
        "HICP inflation excluding food and energy had been 1.0% in February, unchanged from January but slightly up from 0.9% in December.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation remained low by historical standards, although they had shown a marked improvement since the trough in 2016.",
        "Overall, these developments suggested that the strong cyclical momentum, the ongoing reduction of labour market slack and increasing capacity utilisation were translating into a steady, albeit slow, upward movement in inflationary pressures.",
        "As regards wages, recent developments had confirmed a gradual upward trend.",
        "This increase was mainly attributable to higher contributions from wage drift, which usually reacted to cyclical developments with a shorter lag than negotiated wages.",
        "According to the March 2018 ECB staff projections, growth in compensation per employee was expected to pick up from 1.6% in 2017 to 2.7% in 2020.",
        "In the March ECB staff projections, headline inflation was expected to reach 1.7% in 2020, driven by underlying inflation, after 1.4% in both 2018 and 2019.",
        "Compared with the December 2017 Eurosystem staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised down slightly for 2019.",
        "The outlook for HICP inflation excluding food and energy was unchanged compared with the December 2017 Eurosystem staff projections and was expected to rise from 1.1% in 2018 to 1.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020.",
        "Inflation expectations, based on longer-term market and survey-based measures, were largely unchanged since the Governing Council’s January monetary policy meeting.",
        "Financial conditions had tightened somewhat amid volatility in equity and foreign exchange markets.",
        "At the same time, the tightening observed over recent months had to be seen in the light of improving economic conditions.",
        "The overall cost of financing for euro area firms had increased somewhat, with both the cost of equity and the cost of market-based debt having risen marginally.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, growth in the broad monetary aggregate M3 had remained robust and within the narrow range of 4.5-5.5% observed since the launch of the expanded asset purchase programme (APP) in early 2015.",
        "In January 2018 the annual growth rate of loans to NFCs had continued its upward trend, while the consolidated gross indebtedness of NFCs had continued to fall.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households had remained unchanged in January, supported by favourable borrowing conditions and the expected further improvements in labour markets.",
        "At the same time, growth in loans to households was being dampened by loan repayments.",
        "Banks’ capital ratios had continued to strengthen in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting mainly an increased positive contribution from recapitalisation.",
        "Balance sheet de-risking had also continued to support capital ratios, as asset quality had been improving in line with macroeconomic fundamentals and balance sheet restructuring.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, the March 2018 ECB staff projections pointed to a mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance in 2018, turning broadly neutral over 2019-20.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet remarked that financial conditions had tightened somewhat amid volatility in equity and foreign exchange markets.",
        "Nonetheless, borrowing conditions for firms and households remained very favourable, in particular in the light of the improved macroeconomic prospects.",
        "The March ECB staff projections pointed to continued growth above potential, with an upward revision for 2018.",
        "Incoming information confirmed the strong and broad-based economic upswing.",
        "As regards inflation, the March projections confirmed the previous baseline outlook of headline inflation increasing gradually to the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "However, measures of underlying inflation remained subdued and had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.",
        "The cyclical momentum and the ongoing reduction of economic slack confirmed the confidence that euro area HICP inflation would converge towards the inflation aim.",
        "Yet inflation convergence was proceeding only gradually and remained dependent on an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "On the basis of this assessment, Mr Praet proposed to convey the Governing Council’s improving confidence by removing the “easing bias” attached to the APP, i.e.",
        "the reference to increasing the asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration should the outlook become less favourable, or should financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.",
        "This was a further step that followed earlier adjustments in the ECB’s policy stance, namely the past reductions in the pace of purchases and the removal of the easing bias on policy rates.",
        "At the same time, patience and persistence in monetary policy remained essential for inflation pressures to build up.",
        "Accordingly, Mr Praet also proposed reconfirming the earlier decisions on asset purchases and policy rates.",
        "Regarding communication, the Governing Council needed to reiterate its confidence that the economic expansion would eventually lead inflation to converge to its medium-term aim.",
        "It was also important to highlight prudence, patience and persistence in monetary policy for inflation pressures to build up and support the convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, as well as to stress that the Governing Council would continue monitoring developments in financial conditions with regard to their possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability.",
        "Looking ahead, the Governing Council would continue to assess progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.",
        "In line with its forward guidance on the APP, net asset purchases would expire once the Governing Council judged that the criteria for a sustained adjustment were met.",
        "The Governing Council’s assessment would continue to be based on three criteria: first, convergence of headline inflation to the medium-term aim; second, confidence in the materialisation of the expected inflation path; and, third, resilience of inflation convergence even after the end of the net asset purchases.",
        "Beyond the horizon of the net asset purchases, the monetary policy support still necessary for inflation to converge to the Governing Council’s aim would continue to be provided by reinvestments of principal continuing for an extended period of time and by policy rates remaining at their present levels well past the end of the net asset purchases.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "According to recent data and survey results, growth momentum, supported by very favourable financing conditions, had continued to be strong and broad-based.",
        "Looking ahead, this expansion was expected to continue in the near term at a somewhat faster pace than previously anticipated, as reflected in the March 2018 ECB staff projections, in which real GDP growth in 2018 had been revised up compared with the December 2017 Eurosystem staff projections, while the outlook for growth in 2019 and 2020 was unchanged.",
        "The risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity were assessed to have remained broadly balanced.",
        "Regarding the outlook and risks for the external environment, the latest indicators pointed to sustained momentum in global activity and trade.",
        "The picture of a robust global economic expansion was also reflected in the March 2018 ECB staff projections, with the outlook for global activity being revised up for both 2018 and 2019.",
        "A major factor underlying the upward revision was the impact of the additional fiscal stimulus in the United States.",
        "However, the balance of risks to the global economic expansion was still assessed to be tilted to the downside, as geopolitical uncertainties and uncertainty regarding the policy outlook in some major economies – including the risk of increased trade protectionism and the uncertain impact of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU – continued to constitute downside risks.",
        "In the wake of recent statements by the US Administration, members exchanged views on the risks arising from trade protectionism, on which the Governing Council had reflected before.",
        "There was widespread concern that the risk of trade conflicts, which could be expected to have an adverse impact on activity for all countries involved, had increased.",
        "The impact on the global economy and on the euro area would ultimately depend on the scale of import tariffs imposed by the United States, as well as the scope of any retaliatory measures.",
        "However, it was also cautioned that negative confidence effects could arise.",
        "The impact of increased trade protection on inflation was seen as being more ambiguous and uncertain.",
        "Reference was also made to the risks associated with volatility in global financial markets and foreign exchange markets.",
        "It was highlighted that, although the past appreciation of the euro had so far not had a significant negative impact on euro area external demand, developments in foreign exchange markets continued to be a significant source of uncertainty and a risk that needed monitoring.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, members noted that recent indicators had provided further evidence that the economic expansion was strong and broad-based, and was continuing at a pace above current estimates of potential growth.",
        "Euro area real GDP growth had increased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2017, following an increase of 0.7% in the third quarter.",
        "While the latest survey data were weaker, both the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator and the PMI remained at historically high levels.",
        "On the basis of developments in short-term indicators, near-term real GDP growth could turn out to be somewhat higher than previously expected.",
        "In terms of the main components of demand, private consumption growth remained strong, supported by rising incomes and employment and by historically low household savings.",
        "Business investment was strengthening on the back of very favourable financing conditions, as well as rising corporate profitability and solid demand.",
        "Housing investment had also improved further over recent quarters.",
        "In addition, the broad-based global expansion was providing impetus to euro area exports.",
        "Members exchanged views about the euro area’s potential growth rate and the remaining degree of slack in the economy.",
        "It was noted that estimates from international institutions such as the European Commission and the OECD suggested a closing of the euro area output gap in late 2017 or early 2018, while it was also acknowledged that there were significant variations in the assessment of the output gap across countries.",
        "The view was widely shared that there was considerable measurement uncertainty about the degree of slack remaining in the labour market and in the economy as a whole.",
        "A number of arguments were put forward suggesting that greater slack might remain in the economy than indicated in the baseline projections.",
        "It was recalled that measures of potential growth were typically derived from capital and labour inputs, as well as estimates of total factor productivity, all of which could be considered to some extent to have cyclical components.",
        "If only supply shocks were considered when estimating potential output, possibly resulting from the positive impact of past structural reforms, there could be more spare capacity in the economy than was currently implied by traditional measures.",
        "It was also recalled that favourable revisions had already been made to estimates of both the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) and potential output.",
        "It was noted that the assessment of slack in the labour market was in part based on broader measures of unemployment, which incorporated involuntary part-time or discouraged workers, putting additional downward pressure on wages.",
        "However, if there were significant hysteresis effects, labour market slack may be less than suggested on the basis of these broader measures.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that crisis-induced hysteresis might be reversed in a strong economic recovery.",
        "A further risk discussed by members was that of a more expansionary and procyclical fiscal policy over the projection horizon.",
        "Overall, the risks to the euro area growth outlook were assessed to have remained broadly balanced.",
        "On the one hand, the prevailing positive cyclical momentum could lead to stronger growth in the near term.",
        "On the other hand, downside risks continued to relate primarily to global factors, including rising protectionism and developments in foreign exchange and other financial markets.",
        "Members emphasised that deepening Economic and Monetary Union remained a priority and stressed the need to make progress on the completion of the banking union and the capital markets union.",
        "More generally, it was recalled that other policy areas needed to contribute decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential of the euro area economy and to reducing vulnerabilities, in order to reap the full benefits from the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "To increase the resilience of the euro area economy, the implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needed to be stepped up substantially and a full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and the macroeconomic imbalance procedure was necessary, over time and across countries.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Annual euro area HICP inflation had declined to 1.2% in February 2018, compared with 1.3% in January.",
        "The decline mainly reflected negative base effects in unprocessed food price inflation.",
        "Annual rates of headline inflation were likely to hover around 1.5% for the remainder of the year, inter alia on the basis of current futures prices for oil.",
        "It was noted that in recent projection rounds the outlook for headline inflation and for measures of underlying inflation had been relatively stable, while the growth outlook had been gradually revised upwards.",
        "Members considered that measures of underlying inflation in the euro area remained subdued, but were expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth.",
        "The stability of measures of underlying inflation, despite the appreciation of the euro, was again highlighted in the discussion.",
        "In this context, it was noted that non-energy industrial goods price inflation, which was considered the component most sensitive to exchange rate movements, had continued to increase despite the euro’s appreciation and, at 0.7%, stood now above its long-term average.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that recent movements in the euro exchange rate seemed to relate more to relative monetary policy shocks, including communication, and less to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook for the euro area.",
        "This suggested that the exchange rate appreciation could be expected to have a more negative impact on inflation.",
        "In addition, even though the effect of the euro’s appreciation on inflation had been limited so far, the pass-through could be stronger if the shocks turned out to be permanent.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement among members that volatility in the exchange rate of the euro continued to be a source of uncertainty, which required monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Members observed that wage dynamics were still relatively subdued, as reflected in annual increases in compensation per employee, which stood at 1.7% in the third quarter of 2017, although it was expected that cost pressures should gradually increase as the economic expansion continued and slack in the labour market was absorbed.",
        "As regards recent developments in inflation expectations, members noted that both market-based measures and survey-based longer-term measures remained broadly stable.",
        "Expectations of inflation five years ahead in the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the first quarter of 2018 stood at 1.9% and the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead currently stood at 1.71%.",
        "While this was still higher than at the December 2017 monetary policy meeting, it was slightly lower than the level observed at the time of the Governing Council’s January 2018 monetary policy meeting.",
        "It was remarked that evidence from both the SPF and option prices pointed to a shift towards higher inflation expectations since early 2015, after the start of the APP, with deflation scenarios clearly priced out.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) had continued to expand at a robust pace, reflecting the impact of the ECB’s monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid components.",
        "The gradual recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector, visible since the start of 2014, was proceeding amid a further pick-up in the growth of loans to NFCs and unchanged growth in loans to households.",
        "The expansion in credit continued to be supported by very favourable borrowing costs for firms and households across euro area jurisdictions.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that the incoming information, including the new staff projections, corroborated the strong and broad-based growth momentum in the euro area economy.",
        "This outlook for growth confirmed the increased confidence that inflation would converge to the Governing Council’s inflation aim of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "At the same time, measures of underlying inflation remained subdued and had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.",
        "Overall, while the increased confidence called for a gradual adjustment in the Governing Council’s communication, prudence, patience and persistence with regard to monetary policy remained warranted for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium term.",
        "Members also broadly concurred with the assessment by Mr Praet that financial conditions remained very favourable but had tightened somewhat since the January monetary policy meeting on account of weaker equity markets, an appreciation of the euro and an uptick in market interest rates.",
        "It was remarked that the tightening in financial conditions also had to be seen against the background of improvements in macroeconomic conditions and, hence, may not necessarily imply a more restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "Moreover, the pass-through of the ECB’s monetary policy measures continued to provide significant support to borrowing conditions for firms and households.",
        "At the same time, some caution was voiced, as the more recent developments in the euro exchange rate and in financial conditions in part reflected changing perceptions about monetary and fiscal policies, domestically and globally, as well as rising risks of protectionism and heightened market sensitivity to communication, rather than further improvements in domestic economic fundamentals.",
        "Against this background, developments in the exchange rate and financial conditions required monitoring with regard to their possible implications for the inflation outlook.",
        "There was broad agreement among members that the incoming information indicated ongoing progress on a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "The view was put forward that the Governing Council’s criteria for a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation could be assessed as close to being satisfied over a medium-term horizon.",
        "However, the broadly agreed conclusion was that the evidence for a sustained rise in inflation towards levels consistent with the Governing Council’s inflation aim was still not sufficient.",
        "In this context, the point was also made that the assessment regarding the achievement of a sustained adjustment in inflation was not binary, but rather multifaceted and probabilistic in nature.",
        "It was seen as encouraging that the latest ECB staff projections appeared to remain consistent with inflation converging to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, also confirming the outlook contained in previous projection exercises.",
        "Moreover, growth rates well above current estimates of potential growth and the corresponding increase in capacity utilisation were seen as strengthening confidence in the currently expected inflation path.",
        "At the same time, recent inflation outturns had remained some distance away from the Governing Council’s inflation aim and the incoming information continued to point to muted price pressures overall.",
        "Moreover, while confidence in the inflation outlook had increased, it was still seen as subject to a number of uncertainties, related mainly to the degree of remaining economic slack and risks emanating from the global environment as well as developments in foreign exchange and other financial markets.",
        "With regard to the criterion of resilience, which called for a self-sustaining adjustment in the path of inflation even after the end of the net asset purchases, it was widely agreed that an ample degree of monetary policy accommodation remained necessary to accompany the economic expansion and for price pressures to continue to build up and support a rise in inflation to the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "All in all, remaining uncertainties and muted underlying inflation pressures called for caution and underlined the need to maintain the prevailing policy posture of prudence, patience and persistence.",
        "This suggested that the monetary policy decisions taken at the meeting in late October 2017 on net asset purchases, reinvestments and policy interest rates should be reconfirmed.",
        "Against the backdrop of the ongoing improvements in economic prospects and the corresponding greater confidence in the inflation outlook, all members agreed with Mr Praet’s proposal to remove the “easing bias” on the APP from the Governing Council’s forward guidance.",
        "It was recalled that this language had been introduced at the time when net purchases had been scaled back from a monthly pace of €80 billion to €60 billion and that the economic environment had changed notably since then.",
        "In particular, its removal was seen as justified as the economic expansion had become more robust and scenarios of large negative economic surprises, leading to renewed deflationary risks, had become less likely.",
        "In this sense, the removal of the APP easing bias was consistent with the Governing Council’s data-dependent approach to policy and communication.",
        "As regards communication, there was broad agreement with Mr Praet’s proposal to highlight increased confidence in the inflation outlook while reiterating the importance of patience and persistence in monetary policy to support inflation convergence towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "It was widely stressed that the Governing Council’s communication needed to reflect the progressively improving economic environment and the corresponding greater confidence in the path of inflation.",
        "Accordingly, a further adjustment in communication in the form of removing the APP easing bias was seen as a natural step.",
        "Members also agreed that alongside the elimination of the easing bias, emphasis needed to be placed on the Governing Council’s firm commitment to its price stability objective, particularly as inflation had fallen short of its stated aim for a considerable period of time.",
        "Prudence, patience and persistence remained warranted and the key elements of the Governing Council’s forward guidance on policy rates and the APP needed to be confirmed, including the open-endedness of the APP.",
        "In this context, it was also remarked that the removal of the easing bias should not be misunderstood as restricting the Governing Council’s capacity to react to shocks and contingencies, if necessary.",
        "At the same time, it was reiterated that the monetary policy stimulus continued to be provided by the full set of policy instruments, namely the level of policy rates, the net asset purchases, the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the current and forthcoming reinvestments, and the forward guidance on interest rates.",
        "Finally, there was broad agreement on stressing the need for continued monitoring of developments in the exchange rate and financial conditions with regard to their possible implications for the inflation outlook.",
        "Looking ahead, there was broad agreement on the main elements put forward by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The course of monetary policy would remain firmly guided by the Governing Council’s continuous assessment of the progress made towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation based on the three criteria of convergence, confidence and resilience.",
        "In particular, once the Governing Council judged that the criteria for a sustained adjustment were met, the net asset purchases would expire in line with the conditionality expressed in the forward guidance on the APP.",
        "It was recalled, as on previous occasions, that, beyond the horizon of the net asset purchases, the monetary policy support still necessary for inflation to converge to the inflation aim would be provided by the stock of acquired assets, by reinvestments continuing for an extended period of time, and by policy rates remaining at their present levels well past the end of the net asset purchases.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council continued to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.",
        "The Governing Council confirmed that the net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of €30 billion, were intended to run until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until it saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "The Eurosystem would reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary.",
        "This would contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the draft introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 25-26 October 2017, a significant flattening of the US Treasury yield curve had been observed, while the German government bond yield curve had flattened to a much lesser extent.",
        "In the United States the yield curve was at its flattest in almost a decade, with the ten-year Treasury bond yielding less than 60 basis points above the two-year Treasury bond, whereas at the start of 2017 the spread between the yields of the two bond maturities had been 125 basis points.",
        "The spread between German government bond yields for the ten and two-year maturities had hovered around 100 basis points.",
        "Mr Cœuré noted that different explanations for these developments could be identified, depending on whether the flattening of the US Treasury yield curve stemmed from developments in current or future expected US short-term rates or from the term premium.",
        "A first explanation was related to the ongoing tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Open Market Committee at the short end of the US yield curve, which had not been fully translated into higher US long-term yields.",
        "The other explanation, put forward by market analysts, related to downward pressure on the term premium in the United States, stemming mostly from supply and demand factors in the Treasury market, including portfolio rebalancing across jurisdictions.",
        "A model-based decomposition of the ten-year US Treasury yield between expected average short-term interest rates and the term premium suggested that a rise in expected future short-term rates had been offset by a decline in the term premium.",
        "This fall in the US ten-year term premium could be the result of three factors.",
        "First, changes in international demand, with international investors buying more US Treasuries.",
        "Portfolio rebalancing towards US Treasuries had been recorded over the past few years and was also visible in the latest Treasury International Capital data release by the US Department of the Treasury for September 2017.",
        "The data showed a strong rebound in purchases of US Treasuries, with foreign private investors having bought USD 130 billion over the previous six months.",
        "Second, there was reduced outstanding duration risk in the market, as the public sector was holding a significant amount of long-term Treasury bonds.",
        "Third, the low volatility observed might also have impacted the term premium.",
        "Turning to the euro area, the interest rate spread between ten-year German government bonds and equivalent overnight index swaps, a gauge of the scarcity premium on German government bonds, which had receded in June, had again become more negative around the Governing Council’s October monetary policy meeting.",
        "This development underlined the effectiveness of the ECB’s asset purchases, including the last recalibration exercise, and might have prompted some euro area investors to rebalance their portfolios.",
        "The impact could be felt across the sovereign universe, as shown by the narrowing of ten-year yield spreads between German government bonds and those of Spain, Italy and Portugal.",
        "In the case of Greece, progress with the third programme review had been positive news, as well as the successful bond exchange to increase the liquidity of Greek government bonds.",
        "Since the late October Governing Council meeting, stock price increases had continued in the United States and Japan.",
        "This contrasted with Europe, where there had been some declines in equity prices.",
        "With regard to foreign exchange markets, some weakening of the euro had been observed around the October monetary policy meeting but overall the euro had remained broadly stable.",
        "US Commodity Futures Trading Commission numbers suggested that the market remained positioned for an appreciation of the euro.",
        "However, the appreciation had so far not materialised owing, inter alia, to the Governing Council’s decisions in October and possibly also to the aforementioned portfolio rebalancing flows out of Europe.",
        "The latest implied probability distribution for the EUR/USD exchange rate showed that the magnitude of the expected euro appreciation had diminished somewhat since the late October Governing Council meeting.",
        "Turning to developments on the money markets, the year-end was traditionally marked by volatility in short-term money market rates.",
        "Looking at the EONIA forward curve, there had been no material changes in market expectations for ECB policy rates since the late October Governing Council meeting.",
        "Money market transactions extending beyond 31 December 2017 were already trading at a premium.",
        "ECB internal analysis and market intelligence feedback suggested that, in contrast to 2016, markets had started preparing earlier for the year-end, after the spikes observed a year ago.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "The synchronised global upswing in economic activity had continued.",
        "Both survey-based and hard indicators of global activity pointed to steady and broad-based global growth momentum in the second half of 2017.",
        "The global output PMI had remained stable in November, at a level somewhat above that for the third quarter of 2017 and close to its long-term average.",
        "Meanwhile, trade had rebounded since the second half of 2016, supported by investment.",
        "Global trade indicators pointed to robust growth in the second half of 2017, following a dip in the second quarter of the year.",
        "Global goods imports had increased by 1.6% in the third quarter, compared with 0.4% in the previous quarter.",
        "Global inflation had declined slightly in October.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area had fallen to 2.2% in October, from 2.3% in September, largely on account of lower increases in energy prices.",
        "Core inflation had meanwhile ticked up slightly.",
        "Global producer price inflation excluding energy had risen further in October.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had increased further since the October monetary policy meeting, to stand at USD 64.8 on 12 December.",
        "Non-oil commodity prices had instead remained broadly stable.",
        "Over the same period, the euro exchange rate had remained broadly stable both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms.",
        "Incoming information pointed to a robust pace of economic expansion in the euro area.",
        "Favourable financing conditions continued to support domestic demand, while the drivers of growth were becoming increasingly self-supporting.",
        "In addition, the expansion had become increasingly broad-based across countries.",
        "According to Eurostat’s second estimate, euro area real GDP growth had been 0.6% in the third quarter of 2017, in line with the October flash estimate.",
        "A breakdown by components revealed that domestic demand had been the main driver of growth, while net exports had also made a positive contribution.",
        "Euro area export growth had been robust in the third quarter, supported by strong extra-euro area export momentum.",
        "As regards the fourth quarter, incoming data had generally surprised on the upside.",
        "Confidence indicators for all the main sectors covered by the European Commission’s survey stood above their average level, as well as above 75% of historical outcomes.",
        "In the December 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, real GDP growth was projected at 2.4% for 2017, 2.3% for 2018, 1.9% for 2019 and 1.7% for 2020.",
        "Compared with the September 2017 ECB staff projections, the outlook for real GDP growth had been revised up substantially over the projection horizon.",
        "Turning to price developments, euro area HICP inflation had been 1.5% in November according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, up from 1.4% in October.",
        "The slight increase reflected higher energy inflation, marginally offset by a small decrease in food price inflation.",
        "HICP inflation excluding food and energy had been 0.9% in November, unchanged from October but down from 1.1% in September.",
        "The decline in services inflation since September partly reflected the impact of large decreases in specific HICP services items.",
        "These negative surprises, to the extent that they had a negative impact on annual rates of services inflation, implied a downward shift in the path of underlying inflation over the short term.",
        "More generally, measures of underlying inflation had weakened overall and had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.",
        "Annual growth in compensation per employee had risen to higher levels since the trough of 1.1% recorded in the second quarter of 2016, driven mainly by a rising contribution from wage drift.",
        "More specifically, in the third quarter of 2017 the growth rate stood at 1.7%, while growth in the second quarter had been revised up from 1.6% to 1.7%.",
        "In the December 2017 Eurosystem staff projections, euro area HICP inflation was foreseen at 1.5% in 2017, 1.4% in 2018, 1.5% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020.",
        "Compared with the September 2017 ECB staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised up for 2018 and was unrevised thereafter.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation expectations had continued their slow but steady increase.",
        "The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead stood at 1.7%.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation expectations had also risen for shorter horizons.",
        "Compared with the October monetary policy meeting, financing conditions were broadly unchanged and remained very favourable overall.",
        "Euro area interest rates had fallen slightly since that meeting and the EONIA forward curve had flattened somewhat.",
        "The overall cost of external financing for non-financial corporations (NFCs), comprising bank borrowing as well as the issuance of both equity and market-based debt, was estimated to have declined slightly.",
        "Most of the decline since July 2017 was accounted for by the fall in the cost of equity.",
        "Turning to money and credit, the broad monetary aggregate M3 had continued to grow at a solid pace in October, with annual M3 money growth standing at 5.0%, where it had been hovering since the launch of the expanded asset purchase programme (APP) in early 2015.",
        "Domestic sources of money creation remained the main driver of M3 growth.",
        "The annual growth rates of loans to NFCs and of loans to households had increased further in the third quarter of 2017.",
        "Bank profitability had increased in the first half of 2017 but remained weak, while the gradual progress with balance sheet repair continued.",
        "Euro area bank funding costs had remained stable in October, at a historical low.",
        "Bank lending rates for NFCs and for households for house purchase had also remained broadly unchanged in October, standing at a historical low in the case of loans to NFCs.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, budget balances had continued to improve owing to favourable economic developments and lower interest payments.",
        "The euro area fiscal stance, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was projected to remain broadly neutral.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet remarked that, since the October monetary policy meeting, financial conditions had remained very favourable, particularly in light of improving macroeconomic prospects.",
        "Incoming information and the December 2017 staff projections indicated a significant improvement in the growth outlook and continued economic expansion at a pace exceeding potential.",
        "Risks to the growth outlook continued to be balanced, with some upside risks in the near term.",
        "Price pressures remained subdued and measures of underlying inflation had moderated recently, partly due to special factors.",
        "At the same time, the steady absorption of economic slack gave grounds for increased confidence that price pressures would gradually take hold.",
        "This was reflected in the December staff projections, which showed a gradual convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "At the same time, progress towards a durable and self-sustaining convergence of inflation remained conditional on a substantial degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "On the basis of these considerations, Mr Praet proposed, at this stage, to confirm the decisions taken at the 25-26 October 2017 meeting, including all elements of the forward guidance.",
        "In particular, communication should: (a) confirm the decisions taken in October; (b) stress that the steady absorption of economic slack gave grounds for increased confidence in a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation; (c) emphasize that an ample degree of monetary stimulus remained necessary for inflation to converge towards the Governing Council’s aim; and (d) indicate that the continued monetary support was provided by the additional net asset purchases, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and by the forward guidance on interest rates.",
        "Looking ahead, Mr Praet concluded that, as progress was made towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the relative importance of forward guidance on rates in the Governing Council’s policy package would increase.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally agreed with the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Recent data and survey results pointed to a solid, broad-based and increasingly self-sustaining economic expansion, supported by very favourable financing conditions.",
        "Looking ahead, this expansion was expected to continue, as reflected in the December 2017 Eurosystem staff projections, which entailed a significant upward revision in the outlook for real GDP growth compared with the September 2017 ECB staff projections.",
        "The risks surrounding the outlook for activity were assessed to have remained broadly balanced, with upside risks in the near term.",
        "As regards external demand, the outlook had improved further since the previous monetary policy meeting, with recent indicators pointing to an increasingly robust and broad-based global economic expansion.",
        "The improved prospects for external demand were a major factor behind the upward revisions to euro area real GDP growth in the December staff projections.",
        "The upward revision to the external demand outlook reflected a combination of better than expected incoming data, impacting growth figures in 2017 and, through carry-over effects, in 2018, as well as a revised assessment of the short-term outlook for global trade and activity.",
        "Some caution was expressed about the latter factor, since it was in part based on judgement and further evidence was needed for this positive assessment to be confirmed.",
        "The balance of risks to the global economic recovery was seen to remain tilted to the downside.",
        "Geopolitical uncertainties, as well as uncertainty regarding the policy outlook in some major economies, continued to constitute downside risks.",
        "However, it was also flagged that some risks identified in past discussions appeared to have diminished.",
        "For instance, the scenario of a trade war appeared less likely, the Brexit negotiations – while still subject to risks – had overcome an important first hurdle, and the risk of a significant negative impact of the past euro appreciation on euro area external demand had so far not materialised.",
        "Some upside risk could result from the US tax reform, which might have a greater than expected impact on economic growth and had only partially been taken into account in the December staff projections.",
        "Turning to the euro area, recent indicators pointed to a continued robust and increasingly self-sustaining economic expansion.",
        "Quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth had been 0.6% in the third quarter of 2017, further extending an already protracted period of growth above potential.",
        "Several survey indicators had improved further, reaching multi-year highs or, in some cases, absolute highs since the start of the time series.",
        "Labour markets had shown further improvement.",
        "In terms of the components of domestic demand, private consumption growth remained strong, supported by real disposable income growth on the back of employment gains and low inflation.",
        "Looking ahead, it was noted that the December staff projections assumed a rebound in the household saving ratio, driven by consumption smoothing and a desire to rebuild savings, even as uncertainty and precautionary motives appeared to be receding and the returns on savings remained low.",
        "Business investment was now expected to grow above historical averages, facilitated by favourable financing conditions and improved corporate profitability, with the first signs of a turnaround in the historically high level of corporate savings.",
        "The economic expansion continued to be supported by very favourable financial conditions.",
        "Some indices of financial conditions had softened slightly, consistent with, in particular, the recent flattening of the euro area yield curve, which had been highlighted by Mr Cœuré in his introduction.",
        "The monetary policy measures decided by the Governing Council in October 2017 and their communication appeared to have had a favourable market impact.",
        "On the basis of these considerations, members expressed confidence that the euro area economic recovery had now moved into expansionary territory.",
        "The outlook for growth had been revised upwards in a number of subsequent projection rounds, and the most recent upward revision was among the most significant in the history of the staff projections.",
        "It was remarked that the outlook for growth was very positive, with economic activity expected to continue expanding at rates above potential over a prolonged period.",
        "However, some caution was also expressed concerning long-term growth prospects.",
        "In particular, the continued flatness of the yield curve in the euro area and globally, while influenced by many different factors, could also be read as an indication that markets attached some likelihood to a scenario of protracted low nominal GDP growth.",
        "Risks to the outlook for economic activity were considered to be broadly balanced.",
        "On the upside, there was a possibility that the prevailing strong cyclical dynamics could lead to further upward surprises in the near term.",
        "On the downside, risks mainly stemmed from global factors, related to ongoing geopolitical and policy uncertainties.",
        "It was flagged that downside risks also stemmed from increasing leverage in some sectors in a few euro area countries and, more significantly, in other parts of the world.",
        "In addition, a repricing in global financial markets – in particular bond markets, but also equity and corporate credit markets – could have a negative impact on the outlook.",
        "It was emphasised that the stronger than expected economic expansion further strengthened the case for using the present window of opportunity to decisively address remaining fiscal and structural weaknesses across euro area countries.",
        "In addition, the importance of further progress towards strengthening Economic and Monetary Union was reiterated.",
        "With regard to price developments, members broadly shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Annual euro area HICP inflation had been 1.5% in November 2017, up from 1.4% in October, while measures of underlying inflation had retreated slightly.",
        "In the near term, headline inflation was expected to decrease somewhat, mainly owing to base effects in energy prices.",
        "Further ahead, the economic expansion and the associated significant absorption of economic slack were expected to contribute to a gradual convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "This was broadly reflected in the December 2017 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "During the discussion on recent developments in inflation, it was highlighted that, while headline inflation had increased somewhat, measures of underlying inflation, such as HICP inflation excluding food and energy, had been affected adversely by recent negative data surprises, in particular in services prices.",
        "This, in turn, was expected to have a downward impact on the near-term outlook for underlying inflation.",
        "It was remarked that some of these surprises appeared to be of a temporary nature, reflecting one-off factors, and should hence not affect the Governing Council’s confidence in the gradual return of inflation towards the ECB’s inflation aim over the medium term.",
        "It was also highlighted that staff projected HICP inflation excluding food and energy to reach 1.8% in 2020, a level significantly above the pre-crisis average for the euro area.",
        "However, it was also pointed out that recent downward surprises implied a continued gap between headline and underlying inflation for some time to come, which was seen as a matter of concern.",
        "Caution was expressed regarding the projected pick-up in underlying inflation over the projection horizon, in particular with respect to the assumed rebound in wage dynamics, which to date had remained subdued compared with historical regularities.",
        "However, the latest data for the third quarter of 2017, as well as an upward revision to the data for the second quarter of 2017, provided initial signs of an uptick in wage pressures.",
        "Some comfort could be drawn from the fact that these somewhat stronger wage dynamics were being observed across a number of countries.",
        "As regards inflation expectations, survey-based measures had remained broadly unchanged since the previous monetary policy meeting, while market-based measures had increased slightly.",
        "Overall, these developments suggested that inflation expectations remained broadly anchored.",
        "The risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations was briefly discussed.",
        "Some comments were made that this was unlikely, as inflation expectations had remained stable and the risk of a deflationary scenario had practically disappeared.",
        "At the same time, it was cautioned that inflation expectations based on the five-year and ten-year spot inflation-linked swap rates remained low and that expectations could become unanchored in an environment of prolonged low inflation, to the extent that price expectations were adaptive and responded to actual inflation.",
        "Several observations were made on the apparent disconnect between developments in the real economy and price dynamics.",
        "This disconnect appeared to have persisted or even increased over recent months, as growth had repeatedly been stronger than expected in the euro area and inflation dynamics had remained largely unchanged or surprised on the downside.",
        "This phenomenon was not limited to the euro area, since low inflation had been observed across many advanced economies in spite of strong global growth.",
        "Confidence was widely expressed that, ultimately, the further absorption of slack should lead to upward wage and price pressures.",
        "The latest staff projections foresaw that the output gap would close in the near future, earlier than previously projected.",
        "As economic activity was expected to grow consistently above potential over the projection horizon, it was seen as very likely that capacity constraints would become increasingly binding and lead to higher price pressures.",
        "It was also remarked that the positive feedback loop between economic growth and price increases could, once more firmly established, operate more rapidly than expected.",
        "However, as discussed in earlier meetings, it was also emphasised that output gap measures had to be viewed with caution.",
        "Equilibrium concepts – such as potential output or the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment – were subject to considerable measurement uncertainty.",
        "The degree of remaining spare capacity could be considerably larger than implied by traditional measures of slack.",
        "It was therefore seen as important to continue examining wider measures, taking into account, for instance, involuntary part-time or discouraged workers, which pointed to lower capacity utilisation than standard output gap or unemployment measures.",
        "Furthermore, it was mentioned that technological changes and globalisation could have diminished the pricing power of firms on a more lasting basis and also might have reduced the sensitivity of prices to economic activity.",
        "It was suggested that the share of the HICP basket that reacted to the output gap, as seen in “supercore” indicators of underlying inflation, might be shrinking.",
        "With regard to the medium-term outlook for prices, it was observed that staff projected headline inflation to be 1.7% in 2020.",
        "It was also recalled that the level of inflation was conditional on the technical assumptions underlying the projection exercise.",
        "In particular, the assumption for oil prices reflected an upwardly revised but declining path for futures prices.",
        "If constant prices were to be assumed instead, headline inflation would be somewhat higher in 2020.",
        "Overall, it was however underlined that caution remained warranted and that the projected upward path for inflation was subject to considerable uncertainty, with as yet insufficient signs of self-sustaining upward pressures in underlying inflation.",
        "All in all, members considered that the stronger than expected economic expansion, underpinned by favourable financing conditions and supported by the ECB’s monetary policy, increased the level of confidence in a sustained return of inflation towards the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "As underlying inflation was still subdued, it was however felt that patience and persistence remained essential for the continued absorption of economic slack to exert pressure on prices.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) had continued to expand at a robust pace.",
        "This reflected the impact of the ECB’s monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid components.",
        "Accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate M1 continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth.",
        "The gradual recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector, visible since the start of 2014, was proceeding amid a further pick-up in the growth of loans to NFCs.",
        "The expansion in credit continued to be supported by very favourable borrowing costs for firms and households across euro area countries.",
        "The survey on the access to finance of enterprises for the period April-September 2017 pointed to further improvements in the financial situation of firms and better availability of external finance, including for SMEs.",
        "It was remarked that loan growth in the euro area’s second largest economy had seen rather buoyant expansion, and that increasing leverage in conjunction with increased merger and acquisition and leveraged buyout activity raised concerns from a financial stability perspective.",
        "In addition, the view was expressed that the significant compression of market financing costs across the board needed to be monitored closely.",
        "It was, however, emphasised that potential financial stability risks had to be addressed through adequate macroprudential measures.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that the latest data and information, including the new Eurosystem staff projections, pointed to a strong pace of economic expansion and a significant improvement in the growth outlook.",
        "The strong cyclical momentum and the associated significant reduction of economic slack provided increasing confidence that inflation would converge to the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "At the same time, underlying price pressures remained muted overall and had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.",
        "Overall, the assessment vindicated the monetary policy decisions taken at the October meeting and confirmed the continued need for an ample degree of monetary accommodation to ensure a sustained adjustment of inflation towards the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "Members expressed satisfaction with the way the Governing Council’s rationale for the recalibration of the APP and the guidance provided in its communication had been understood.",
        "These decisions had succeeded in preserving the very favourable financing conditions that were necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "If anything, overall financial conditions had eased slightly since the October meeting and, in particular, borrowing conditions for firms and households had remained very favourable.",
        "In this context it was noted that, in the light of the improving macroeconomic environment, the favourable financial conditions were increasingly gaining traction, supporting investment spending and credit creation.",
        "The argument was put forward that, as the economy expanded further, an unchanged monetary policy setting would become increasingly expansionary, also in view of the stimulus arising from the still increasing stock of assets on the Eurosystem’s balance sheet.",
        "A remark was made that a gap appeared to be emerging between favourable economic conditions and a policy stance that remained in a crisis configuration.",
        "However, it was also recalled that the favourable economic and financial conditions were still dependent on an ample degree of monetary accommodation and that the medium-term outlook for prices was key to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement among members that the current monetary policy stance remained appropriate, with recent developments – while more positive than previously expected – generally seen to vindicate the decisions taken by the Governing Council at its meeting in late October.",
        "It was widely emphasised that confidence in the convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s aim had clearly strengthened since the previous meeting, as economic growth indicators had continued to be better than expected and the new Eurosystem staff projections embodied a material improvement in the growth outlook.",
        "Comfort was also drawn from the inflation path reflected in the projections, with inflation approaching levels in line with the Governing Council’s aim towards the end of the projection horizon.",
        "At the same time, while the significant absorption of economic slack was expected to ultimately generate the price pressures needed for inflation to move towards the Governing Council’s aim, this convergence was still subject to uncertainties surrounding, for example, the interpretation of the recent unexpected decline in measures of underlying inflation, the measurement of economic slack and the formation of inflation expectations after a prolonged period of low inflation.",
        "Importantly, convergence remained contingent on continued support provided by the full range of the ECB’s monetary policy measures currently in place.",
        "Against this background, members widely agreed that the Governing Council needed to remain patient and persistent with its monetary policy, maintaining the current monetary policy stance while emphasising the increased confidence in the achievement of its medium-term inflation aim.",
        "This implied confirming all the monetary policy decisions taken at the meeting in late October regarding the key ECB interest rates, the net asset purchases and reinvestments, as well as the forward guidance with respect to those measures.",
        "In this regard, the increased easing impact from the stock of acquired assets and from the Governing Council’s reinvestment policy was highlighted.",
        "With regard to the implementation of the APP, members welcomed findings indicating the effectiveness of the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) in easing market financing conditions and, hence, supporting the transmission of monetary policy.",
        "At the same time, these findings showed only limited evidence of distortions in market functioning or of a crowding out of bank lending, which had instead remained on an upward path, including for SMEs.",
        "Moreover, while risk premia in corporate bond markets had been compressed significantly, this applied both to corporate bonds eligible for purchase under the programme and to ineligible bonds, which suggested that the impact of the CSPP had been market-neutral and portfolio rebalancing had been effective across market segments.",
        "As regards communication, agreement was generally expressed with the proposals made by Mr Praet, suggesting broad continuity in the Governing Council’s communication at the present stage, while emphasising the greater confidence in the inflation outlook.",
        "While a few members recalled their reservations concerning some elements of the decisions taken at the October monetary policy meeting, the merits of a steady hand in communication were widely acknowledged.",
        "This implied confirming the October decisions and the associated communication, which had been well understood by market participants.",
        "Changes in communication were generally seen to be premature at this juncture, with caution still warranted.",
        "Signals that could trigger an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions needed to be avoided, as they could jeopardise progress towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that communication needed to evolve gradually in step with improving economic data and a further easing of financial conditions was not regarded as warranted.",
        "From this perspective, it was important for the forward guidance to be updated in line with evolving data, with a view to avoiding more abrupt or disorderly adjustments at a later stage.",
        "It should be highlighted that the stronger than expected expansion of the euro area economy had further reduced the likelihood of adverse economic outcomes and, hence, had bolstered the Governing Council’s confidence in the eventual attainment of its inflation aim.",
        "More generally, the Governing Council’s emphasis on data dependency in its approach to forward guidance was recalled.",
        "In this context, it had to be stressed that the improved economic environment was, in part, related to the ECB’s monetary policy measures, which continued to pass through to the real economy.",
        "Overall, it was seen as important to reiterate the October policy decisions, to underline the Governing Council’s commitment to its price stability objective and to reaffirm that an ample degree of monetary stimulus remained necessary for inflation to converge towards the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "It was again underlined that this stimulus was provided by the Governing Council’s entire policy package, notably the additional net asset purchases decided in October, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and by the forward guidance on key interest rates.",
        "Looking ahead, the view was widely shared among members that the Governing Council’s communication would need to evolve gradually, without a change in sequencing, if the economy continued to expand and inflation converged further towards the Governing Council’s aim.",
        "The language pertaining to various dimensions of the monetary policy stance and forward guidance could be revisited early in the coming year.",
        "In particular, as progress was made towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the relative importance of the forward guidance on policy rates would increase, as suggested by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "From this perspective, the Governing Council’s forward guidance framework would evolve naturally, in line with the established sequencing between the APP and interest rate guidance.",
        "It was suggested that the Governing Council’s communication should be adjusted gradually over time to avoid sudden and unwarranted movements in financial conditions.",
        "In this regard, it was also seen as warranted to reflect on how to transition gradually from the present conditionality focused on APP net purchases to a broader concept of forward guidance comprising various dimensions of the monetary policy stance.",
        "In any event, it was recalled that even when the net purchases ceased, the monetary policy stance would remain highly accommodative via the accumulated stock of acquired assets, future reinvestments and the forward guidance on policy rates, which would continue to accompany the economic cycle and the development of inflation along a sustained adjustment path.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council continued to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.",
        "Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirmed that purchases under the APP would continue at the current monthly pace of €60 billion until the end of December 2017 and that, from January 2018, it intended to continue to make net asset purchases at a monthly pace of €30 billion, until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "If the outlook became less favourable, or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stood ready to increase the APP in terms of size and/or duration.",
        "The Eurosystem would reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary.",
        "This would contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 13-14 June 2018.",
        "The slope of the US Treasury and German government bond yield curves, measured as the difference between the ten-year and two-year yields, had continued their flattening trend of recent months.",
        "In particular, between April and July 2018 estimates of the term premium in the United States had fallen deeper into negative territory despite factors which should have led, in principle, to a decompression of the premium, such as the gradual balance sheet wind-down by the Federal Reserve System and expectations of an increase in the supply of US Treasury securities based on a projected rise in the US fiscal deficit.",
        "The most recent decline in term premia, both in the United States and in the euro area, might partly be attributed to the growing uncertainty over the global economic outlook owing, among other factors, to escalating trade disputes.",
        "This may have affected confidence among investors and contributed to an increase in demand for US Treasuries and German government bonds, widening the negative term premia that also reflected the stock effect of large-scale asset purchases.",
        "Moreover, following the June Governing Council meeting, market participants’ expectations of a first rate increase by the ECB had been pushed further into the future, as suggested by market pricing and the latest analyst surveys.",
        "This partly reflected the Governing Council’s enhanced forward guidance on the future path of policy rates, which had also contributed to reducing interest rate uncertainty.",
        "In foreign exchange markets, the euro had traded in a very narrow range against the US dollar.",
        "However, in nominal effective terms, the euro had appreciated, in particular against the currencies of a number of developing and emerging market economies.",
        "Part of the depreciation of these economies’ currencies was likely related to the growing uncertainty over the impact of trade tensions.",
        "Trade tensions were also seen by market participants to have had a negative impact on stock market valuations, most notably in China.",
        "Since its peak in late January 2018, the China Securities Index 300 had declined by nearly 20%, while other stock market indices in the region had also fallen but to a lesser extent.",
        "These equity market sell-offs no longer affected only sectors that would be most hit by tariffs.",
        "Rather, they had become more broad-based, possibly reflecting increasing concerns among investors over the impact of protectionist measures on the global growth outlook.",
        "Credit spreads in emerging market economies had increased measurably, by around 80 basis points, since the start of 2018.",
        "However, they remained well below the levels observed in 2015 and early 2016.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, the global economic expansion had continued, while trade had weakened further.",
        "At the same time, inflation dynamics had gained some momentum.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area had edged up to 2.6% in May, with inflation excluding food and energy also increasing marginally.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had decreased by 2.2% (in US dollar terms) since the June monetary policy meeting.",
        "Over the same period, non-oil commodity prices had decreased by 7.4%, food prices by 6.7% and metal prices by 9.7% (all in US dollar terms).",
        "Looking at the euro area, the incoming data confirmed that the moderation in the first quarter of 2018 had reflected a pull-back from the very high growth levels of previous quarters, mostly on account of weaker export demand with some contribution from temporary and supply-side factors.",
        "The breakdown of first-quarter growth into its components showed that domestic demand and changes in inventories had contributed positively to the outturn, whereas the contribution of net exports had been negative.",
        "High frequency indicators released since the June meeting had confirmed the ongoing broad-based expansion.",
        "The flash composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index for July had decreased only slightly to 54.3, from 54.9 in June.",
        "Moreover, consumer confidence and confidence in the construction sector had remained at elevated levels, well above their historical averages.",
        "Favourable financing conditions, a robust labour market, and steady income and profit growth had continued to support private consumption and investment.",
        "The June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections for euro area real GDP growth were broadly aligned with, or slightly below, available forecasts from other international institutions.",
        "Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation had stood at 2.0% in June, up from 1.9% in May.",
        "The increase reflected higher inflation rates for the energy and food components, which had more than offset a decline in HICP inflation excluding energy and food.",
        "Meanwhile, measures of underlying inflation remained muted overall but had been increasing from earlier lows.",
        "Annual growth in compensation per employee had increased to 2.0% in the first quarter of 2018, up from 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017.",
        "In the first quarter of 2018, the impetus for this upward trend had come from stronger negotiated wage growth, rather than wage drift, as had previously been the case.",
        "This shift to negotiated wage growth as the main driver bolstered confidence that the pick-up in wage growth would be sustained.",
        "Both market and survey-based inflation expectations were largely unchanged since the June meeting.",
        "Compared with other forecasts, the June Eurosystem staff projections for euro area HICP inflation were at the upper end of the range for 2018 and in the middle of the range for 2019 and 2020.",
        "Financial conditions had remained broadly stable, in spite of some exchange rate appreciation in nominal effective terms and lower equity markets.",
        "The Governing Council’s June decisions had reduced interest rate uncertainty.",
        "In the weeks following the June meeting, EONIA forward rates had continued to decline, accompanied by a further flattening of the forward curve.",
        "Meanwhile, mounting global trade tensions weighed on euro area equity markets, while there were only modest changes in sovereign and corporate debt markets.",
        "The overall cost of financing for euro area firms had remained very favourable.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, the annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 had risen to 4.4% in June from 4.0% in May.",
        "From a counterpart perspective, domestic sources of money creation had remained the main driver of M3 growth.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector had continued its recovery, increasing to 3.5% in June, up from 3.3% in May.",
        "This acceleration had been mainly driven by loans to non-financial corporations (NFCs), which had stood at 4.1% in June.",
        "At the euro area level, the composite cost of borrowing for NFCs had fallen to a new historical low in May, while the borrowing costs of loans for house purchase had remained stable at 1.8%.",
        "Moreover, according to the July 2018 euro area bank lending survey, credit standards had continued to ease for NFCs and households in the second quarter of 2018.",
        "The main factors contributing to the net easing had been competition and risk perceptions reflecting solid economic growth in the euro area.",
        "Finally, with regard to fiscal policy, the euro area fiscal stance, measured as the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was projected to stay mildly expansionary in 2018.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet noted that, since the June monetary policy decisions, financial conditions had remained broadly stable and borrowing conditions for households and firms had continued to be very favourable.",
        "The Governing Council’s enhanced forward guidance on policy rates had struck a good balance between being sufficiently precise and maintaining adequate flexibility.",
        "Overall, the information received since the previous meeting had been broadly in line with the June assessment.",
        "The most recent economic indicators and survey results had stabilised and confirmed the scenario of solid and broad-based growth momentum in line with the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Risks to the growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced.",
        "Uncertainties related to global factors remained prominent.",
        "In addition, the risk of persistent heightened financial market volatility continued to warrant monitoring.",
        "The strength of the euro area economy supported confidence that the convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term would continue in the period ahead.",
        "This confidence was further bolstered by rising wages and increasing price pressures at the early stages of the pricing chain.",
        "At the same time, underlying price pressures were building up only gradually, which argued in favour of patience, prudence and persistence with regard to the conduct of monetary policy in the period ahead.",
        "On the basis of this assessment, Mr Praet proposed keeping monetary policy unchanged and reconfirming all elements of the Governing Council’s forward guidance.",
        "It was important for communication to emphasise that the incoming data confirmed that the euro area economy was proceeding along a solid and broad-based growth path and underlined that risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced, but uncertainties related to global factors remained prominent.",
        "It was furthermore important to highlight that the underlying strength of the euro area economy continued to provide confidence that the convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term would proceed in the period ahead, as well as to stress that a significant monetary policy stimulus remained necessary for the sustained convergence of inflation.",
        "Likewise important was for the Governing Council to reiterate that an ample degree of monetary accommodation would continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of 2018, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by the enhanced forward guidance.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The moderation in euro area real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2018 had reflected a pull-back from the very high levels of growth in 2017, relating mainly to weaker impetus from previously very strong external trade, as well as some temporary and supply-side factors.",
        "Moreover, the most recent economic indicators and survey results had stabilised and continued to point to ongoing solid and broad-based economic growth, in line with the June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area.",
        "Overall, the risks to this growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced, despite uncertainties related to global factors – notably the threat of protectionism – remaining prominent.",
        "Regarding the external environment, members concurred with the view that the global economic expansion was expected to continue, although trade momentum had weakened.",
        "They furthermore agreed that uncertainties related to global factors remained prominent, in particular with regard to the threat of protectionism and the risk of an escalation of trade tensions.",
        "It was remarked that these tensions could generate a more general decline in confidence throughout the global economy, beyond any direct effects from the imposition of tariffs.",
        "Concerns were also expressed about the implications for emerging market economies and the recent depreciation of their currencies, with developments in these economies discussed prominently in the IMF’s latest outlook for the global economy.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, members concurred with the view that the easing in quarterly real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2018, to 0.4%, had by and large reflected a pull-back from the very high levels of growth recorded in 2017, with activity still exceeding the rate of growth of potential output.",
        "While the most recent data entailed the prospect of real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2018 being somewhat lower than embedded in the June Eurosystem staff projections, the expectation was still that this would be largely temporary and that the outlook over the medium term continued to be consistent with solid and broad-based economic growth.",
        "Looking at the main demand components, support for the medium-term growth outlook continued to come from strong consumption fundamentals, notably ongoing employment growth.",
        "Reference was also made to the probable boost provided by expansionary fiscal measures in some countries.",
        "Business investment was expected to continue to benefit from favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand.",
        "By contrast, the momentum in export demand had eased after performing exceptionally well during 2017, explaining the pull-back observed in overall economic growth.",
        "In this context, the point was made that the weaker momentum in export growth and the associated losses in market shares might, in part, also reflect the past appreciation of the euro in conjunction with other determinants of export demand, such as global growth.",
        "Furthermore, a remark was made that supply factors might also be contributing to a “structural” levelling-off of economic growth, with a number of surveys pointing to labour market tightness becoming progressively more widespread across sectors and countries.",
        "Overall, members considered that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced, notwithstanding the uncertainties related to global factors, notably the threat of protectionism.",
        "The risk of persistent heightened financial market volatility also continued to warrant monitoring.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Euro area annual HICP inflation had increased to 2.0% in June 2018, from 1.9% in May, reflecting mainly higher energy and food price inflation.",
        "Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation were likely to hover around the current level for the remainder of the year.",
        "Moreover, while measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, they had been increasing from earlier lows.",
        "According to the June Eurosystem staff projections, underlying inflation was expected to pick up towards the end of the year and to increase gradually thereafter.",
        "Patience was hence required, given the uncertainties in the baseline inflation outlook.",
        "With respect to domestic cost pressures, increasing support for the inflation outlook was seen to come from the ongoing strengthening in wage growth, although it remained to be seen to what extent wage inflation would translate into price inflation over time.",
        "As regards developments in inflation expectations, comfort was drawn from the findings of the most recent ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), which confirmed that probability distributions were moving towards higher headline inflation outcomes.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that both survey-based and market-based measures indicated there was only a low probability of inflation exceeding 2% over the medium term.",
        "Members broadly shared the view that uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook had been receding.",
        "Developments since the previous monetary policy meeting had confirmed confidence in the continued convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, although expectations in the SPF for HICP inflation excluding energy and food in 2020 remained below those in the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "It was argued that uncertainties in the outlook for economic growth would not necessarily translate into corresponding risks to the inflation outlook.",
        "This held true, in particular, if such risks related to trade protectionism, in which case the impact on inflation was seen as being ambiguous.",
        "Turning to the monetary analysis, members agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The annual growth rate of broad money had risen in June, partly reversing the deceleration that had been observed between September 2017 and March 2018.",
        "While the somewhat weaker momentum in M3 dynamics over previous months had reflected the reduction in the monthly net asset purchases since the beginning of the year, this had been offset by an increase in the contribution of credit to the private sector and other counterparts.",
        "Overall, M3 growth continued to be supported by the impact of the ECB’s monetary policy measures and by the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits.",
        "It was noted that the recovery of credit to the private sector had continued in June, mainly driven by loans to NFCs.",
        "The origination of new loans for house purchase had also strengthened further, although, in net terms, housing loan growth had remained moderate owing to repayments of mortgages granted in the pre-crisis boom.",
        "The expansion of credit continued to be supported by very favourable borrowing costs for firms and households across the euro area, reflecting also the ongoing pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014.",
        "According to the July bank lending survey, loan developments had also benefited from some additional easing of credit standards across loan categories, in particular for households.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "While uncertainties, notably related to the global trade environment, remained prominent, the information available since the previous monetary policy meeting was seen to indicate that the euro area economy was proceeding along a solid and broad-based growth path.",
        "The strength of the economy was assessed to confirm the Governing Council’s confidence that the convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term would continue in the period ahead and be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of net asset purchases.",
        "Nevertheless, significant monetary policy stimulus was considered to be still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation over the medium term.",
        "Members widely expressed satisfaction that the communication of the June monetary policy decisions had been well understood by financial markets.",
        "Since the June meeting, financial conditions had remained broadly stable and borrowing conditions for households and firms had continued to be very favourable.",
        "The Governing Council’s enhanced forward guidance on the future path of policy rates had been effective in aligning market views about the future evolution of policy rates with the Governing Council’s expectation that the key ECB interest rates would remain at their current levels “at least through the summer of 2019”.",
        "This formulation was considered to have struck an appropriate balance between being sufficiently precise to provide effective forward guidance and maintaining a suitable degree of flexibility.",
        "In this regard, it was remarked that the Governing Council’s expectation was probabilistic in nature.",
        "There was broad agreement among members that an ample degree of monetary policy accommodation was still necessary to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation over the medium term.",
        "Overall, the uncertainties around the inflation outlook still called for caution and it was widely felt that monetary policy had to remain patient, prudent and persistent.",
        "It was considered essential to retain sufficient flexibility and optionality for monetary policy in the period ahead, and the importance of data dependency in determining the Governing Council’s monetary policy stance was stressed.",
        "Against this background, members unanimously agreed to maintain the current monetary policy stance and to reconfirm all elements of the Governing Council’s forward guidance.",
        "This involved reiterating that the Governing Council expected policy rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and, in any case, for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "It also meant reconfirming that the Governing Council would continue to make net purchases under its asset purchase programme (APP) at the present monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of September 2018 and that it anticipated that, after September 2018, subject to incoming data confirming its medium-term inflation outlook, the Governing Council would reduce the monthly pace of the net asset purchases to €15 billion until the end of December 2018 and then end net purchases.",
        "Finally, this included reconfirming the Governing Council’s intention to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "On communication, members widely concurred with all the elements proposed by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "It needed to be emphasised that the incoming data confirmed that the euro area economy was proceeding along a solid and broad-based growth path in line with the June Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "It was likewise seen as important to stress that risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced, although it also had to be acknowledged that uncertainties related to global factors remained prominent.",
        "Moreover, it should be highlighted that the underlying strength of the euro area economy supported confidence that the convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term would continue in the period ahead and would be maintained after a gradual winding-down of APP net asset purchases.",
        "There was also broad agreement among the members to highlight that a significant monetary policy stimulus remained necessary for the sustained convergence of inflation to continue, and to emphasise that monetary policy had to remain patient, prudent and persistent.",
        "Accordingly, it was felt that the Governing Council needed to reiterate that an ample degree of monetary accommodation would continue to be provided by the anticipated net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by the Governing Council’s enhanced forward guidance.",
        "Moreover, in the light of still prevailing uncertainties that could put the sustained convergence at risk, it was considered prudent to restate the Governing Council’s readiness to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continued to move towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and, in any case, for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council would continue to make net purchases under the APP at the current monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of September 2018.",
        "The Governing Council anticipated that, after September 2018, subject to incoming data confirming its medium-term inflation outlook, the monthly pace of the net asset purchases would be reduced to €15 billion until the end of December 2018 and that net purchases would then end.",
        "The Governing Council intended to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 25-26 April 2018, global bond markets had seen an increase in risk aversion, amid rising geopolitical tensions and political uncertainty, which was accompanied by some credit spread widening and a temporary increase in market volatility.",
        "Trade tensions had escalated further in the global economy, with some emerging market economies having come under pressure.",
        "The impact of trade issues on global financial markets had been visible in the reaction of equity markets to the announcements by the US Administration to initiate a Section 232 investigation into auto imports and to move ahead with tariffs on aluminium and steel imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union, ending a two-month exemption period.",
        "Nevertheless, stock markets in some jurisdictions had increased since late April, in part reflecting incoming data that confirmed solid economic growth.",
        "Following the April meeting, monetary policy expectations had evolved in a number of jurisdictions, including the euro area.",
        "With regard to the ECB, market participants’ expectations for a first rate increase had been pushed out in time somewhat.",
        "Looking at global interest rate differentials, the spread between two-year US Treasuries and their German equivalent had increased to over 300 basis points in May, its widest since July 1997.",
        "In the euro area government bond markets, lower-rated jurisdictions’ sovereign bond yields had increased measurably towards the end of May, amid heightened market volatility, but in most jurisdictions yields had reversed large parts of their initial rise over the following two weeks.",
        "The German ten-year government bond yield had fallen on the back of flight-to-safety investment flows.",
        "Funding conditions for euro area banks and non-banks remained favourable overall.",
        "In foreign exchange markets, the euro had depreciated against the US dollar, effectively reversing the strong appreciation observed earlier in the year.",
        "All in all, this period had coincided with a general strengthening of the US dollar, not only against the euro, reportedly explained by cyclical divergence between the United States and the rest of the G10, changes in relative equity performance and widening short-term interest rate differentials.",
        "Mr Cœuré concluded his introduction by recalling that changes in funding conditions in US dollars had been a very significant development at the end of 2017 and into 2018, but that the LIBOR-OIS spread had been narrowing more recently.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, global indicators remained consistent with a steady expansion of economic activity, despite some softening of global trade.",
        "At the same time, inflation dynamics continued to be modest.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area had remained stable in April, while inflation excluding food and energy had slowed marginally to 1.9%.",
        "Since the April monetary policy meeting, Brent crude oil prices had risen further – by 1.8% in US dollar terms – to stand at USD 74.8 per barrel on 12 June.",
        "Over the same horizon, non-oil commodity prices had remained broadly unchanged, while the euro had depreciated against the US dollar (-3.5%) and, to a lesser extent, in nominal effective terms (-0.9%).",
        "Turning to the euro area economy, following robust growth rates of 0.7% quarter on quarter in 2017, growth in euro area economic activity had slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2018, according to Eurostat’s latest release.",
        "This moderation had reflected a pull-back from the very high levels of growth observed in previous quarters, compounded by some temporary and supply-side factors, as well as weaker impetus from external trade.",
        "Incoming data since the April meeting had again surprised on the downside.",
        "In particular, declines in sentiment indicators – notably for the industrial sector – had continued in the second quarter of 2018, according to data available up to May, but were much smaller than the strong declines observed in the first quarter of the year.",
        "Levels were, however, still pointing to continued growth momentum.",
        "Accordingly, following a weaker than expected start to 2018, the economic expansion was expected to remain solid and broad-based, and to continue at a pace above potential.",
        "Favourable financing conditions, a robust labour market, and steady income and profit growth continued to support private demand.",
        "The euro area labour market remained strong, with employment growing by 0.4% quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2018 and the unemployment rate declining to 8.5% in April.",
        "Survey-based expectations pointed to continued employment growth in the second quarter, in particular in the services sector.",
        "These developments were also reflected in the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which projected real GDP growth at 2.1% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020.",
        "Compared with the March 2018 ECB staff projections, real GDP growth had been revised down for the first quarter of 2018 and was left broadly unchanged thereafter.",
        "The June projections were slightly below other available forecasts for 2018, probably reflecting the inclusion of up-to-date but weaker data releases, while falling within the range of forecasts for the remainder of the horizon.",
        "With regard to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate annual HICP inflation had stood at 1.9% in May, up from 1.2% in April.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food had been 1.1% in May, up from 0.7% in April.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation had remained generally muted but were on a path of gradual improvement.",
        "Recent declines in non-energy industrial goods price inflation were largely due to the volatile clothing and footwear component and did not provide clear signs of downward pressure from the exchange rate pass-through.",
        "The observed upward trend in wage growth reflected improved labour market conditions, while other factors that weighed on wage growth, including past low inflation, were beginning to fade.",
        "In the June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections, headline inflation was expected to stand at 1.7% in each year of the projection period.",
        "Compared with the March 2018 ECB staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised up notably, by 0.3 percentage point, for 2018 and 2019.",
        "HICP inflation excluding energy and food had been revised up slightly for 2019 and 2020.",
        "Compared with other forecasts, the inflation projection was above that of most other institutions for 2018-19, on account of the latest developments in oil prices, but broadly in line for 2020.",
        "Indicators of inflation expectations, based on various market and survey-based measures, were largely unchanged since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting.",
        "However, taking a longer-term perspective, since the start of the expanded asset purchase programme (APP) in 2015, the evolution in the risk neutral distribution of euro area inflation expectations as implied by option prices, for example over a two-year horizon, pointed to improved confidence among market participants in a return of inflation towards levels consistent with the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Developments in the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) showed similar patterns.",
        "Financial conditions had remained broadly stable, despite heightened bond market volatility in some countries.",
        "There had been material declines in euro area bank bond and share prices, but non-financial corporate debt and equity markets were little changed overall.",
        "Euro area equity markets had remained supported by robust corporate profitability.",
        "The overall cost of financing for euro area firms had remained very favourable.",
        "The nominal cost of external financing for non-financial corporations (NFCs) was estimated to have changed only marginally since the April monetary policy meeting, as a falling cost of equity was partly offset by an increase in the cost of market-based debt.",
        "Turning to money and credit, money growth had moderated in the first quarter of 2018 and stood at 3.9% in April, in the context of lower APP purchase volumes.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector had meanwhile remained on a path of moderate expansion.",
        "In April the annual growth rate of loans to NFCs had stood at 3.3%, unchanged from the previous month, while the annual growth rate of loans to households was also stable at 2.9%.",
        "Lending continued to be supported by favourable financing conditions, with the composite cost of borrowing for NFCs and for households remaining close to historical lows.",
        "Composite funding costs for euro area banks had remained broadly unchanged in April, close to their December 2017 historical lows.",
        "Banks’ capital ratios had continued to increase in the fourth quarter of 2017 as the gradual reduction in non-performing loans continued.",
        "Regarding fiscal developments, the June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections foresaw a mildly expansionary fiscal stance in 2018, measured as the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance.",
        "Moreover, additional fiscal loosening was seen as likely over the period 2019-20, amid substantial policy uncertainty.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet pointed out that, despite heightened bond market volatility in some countries, financial conditions had remained broadly stable.",
        "Furthermore, borrowing conditions for firms and households had continued to be very favourable.",
        "Economic conditions remained good, in spite of the recent moderation in economic activity.",
        "Risks to the growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced.",
        "At the same time, downside risks related to global factors, including the threat of protectionism, had become increasingly prominent.",
        "Moreover, the risk of persistent financial market volatility could further add to the downside.",
        "Headline inflation had increased significantly in May, primarily due to higher oil prices.",
        "While measures of underlying inflation remained muted overall, they had been increasing from earlier lows.",
        "The June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections foresaw inflation at 1.7% throughout the projection period, supported by the continuing economic expansion, high levels of capacity utilisation, labour market tightness and rising wage growth.",
        "With regard to progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, the Governing Council’s assessment was guided by the three criteria of convergence, confidence and resilience.",
        "First, on convergence, the staff projections foresaw headline inflation and inflation excluding energy and food reaching 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively, in 2020.",
        "This confirmed a pattern of convergence to levels closer to 2%, which had become increasingly evident over successive projection exercises.",
        "Second, on confidence, uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook had been receding significantly and the risk of deflation had effectively vanished.",
        "Measures of inflation expectations – both survey and market-based – had been gradually improving and were increasingly consistent with the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "Moreover, domestic cost pressures were strengthening amid high levels of capacity utilisation, tightening labour markets and rising wages.",
        "Finally, on resilience, the expected convergence of inflation to the inflation aim had become increasingly less reliant on further extensions of net asset purchases.",
        "This was also reflected in current market expectations.",
        "In summary, progress towards a sustained adjustment in inflation had been substantial so far.",
        "The underlying strength in the euro area economy, together with well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations, provided grounds to be confident that sustained convergence of inflation towards the inflation aim would continue in the period ahead, even after a gradual winding-down of net asset purchases.",
        "On the basis of this assessment, Mr Praet proposed that, at the current meeting, the Governing Council should express its anticipation that, after September 2018, subject to incoming data continuing to provide confirmation of the baseline medium-term inflation outlook, it would reduce the monthly pace of net asset purchases to €15 billion until the end of December 2018 and then end net asset purchases.",
        "At the same time, significant monetary policy stimulus was still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and to ensure durable stabilisation of inflation around levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Therefore, the Governing Council needed to remain patient, prudent and persistent, and should reconfirm its forward guidance on reinvestments and enhance its forward guidance on policy rates by adding an explicit date-based and state-contingent component.",
        "Accordingly, the Governing Council’s communication needed, first, to highlight that, despite the moderation in activity at the start of this year, the medium-term outlook for growth remained solid and broad-based.",
        "Second, it should emphasise that risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook continued to be broadly balanced and that risks related to global factors, including the threat of increased protectionism, had become more prominent.",
        "Moreover, the risk of persistent heightened financial market volatility warranted monitoring.",
        "Third, it should stress that progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation had been substantial and that the continued underlying strength in the euro area economy provided grounds to be confident that the sustained convergence of inflation to the inflation aim would continue in the period ahead, even after a gradual winding-down of the net asset purchases.",
        "In addition, the Governing Council’s communication should provide more guidance on the likely evolution of monetary policy over time, as follows.",
        "First, the Eurosystem would continue to make net asset purchases under the APP at the current monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of September 2018.",
        "Second, the Governing Council would express its anticipation that, after September, subject to incoming data continuing to provide confirmation of the baseline medium-term inflation outlook, it would reduce the monthly pace of the net asset purchases to €15 billion until the end of December 2018 and then end net purchases.",
        "Third, it intended to maintain its policy of reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after ending net purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Fourth, the Governing Council expected to keep the key ECB interest rates at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remained broadly aligned with its current expectations of a sustained adjustment path.",
        "Fifth, the Governing Council should reiterate that significant monetary policy stimulus was still needed for a continued sustained convergence of inflation towards its aim and that this support would continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by the enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates.",
        "Sixth, the Governing Council should emphasise that it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continued to move towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term in a sustained manner.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members generally shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Real GDP growth had moderated in the first quarter of 2018, following very high levels of growth in 2017.",
        "The latest indicators and survey results were also weaker, but remained consistent with ongoing solid and broad-based economic growth over the next few quarters.",
        "Looking further ahead, fundamentals remained in place for a continued expansion over the medium term.",
        "This outlook was broadly reflected in the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, which entailed a downward revision for real GDP growth in 2018 compared with the March 2018 ECB staff projections, while the outlook for 2019 and 2020 was broadly unchanged, entailing a gradual slowing of growth.",
        "The risks surrounding the outlook for activity were overall assessed to have remained broadly balanced, notwithstanding greater uncertainty related to global factors and risks of heightened financial market volatility.",
        "Regarding the external environment, members concurred that the outlook for global activity remained robust, even if recent global trade indicators pointed to a modest deceleration in the first months of 2018.",
        "The picture of a continued global economic expansion was also reflected in the June projections, which foresaw global activity (excluding the euro area) growing at a broadly unchanged pace compared with the March projections.",
        "While the expected upward impact of fiscal stimulus in the United States remained in place, geopolitical risks had not abated and trade tensions were considered to have become more likely.",
        "In particular, concerns were expressed about the possibility that such tensions could lead to a more general decline in confidence throughout the global economy, beyond any direct effects from the imposition of tariffs.",
        "Against this background, the balance of risks to the global economic expansion continued to be assessed as tilted to the downside.",
        "The impact of increased trade protectionism on inflation was seen as being more ambiguous and uncertain.",
        "On the one hand, higher tariffs and trade barriers should have a direct upward impact on the prices of the goods affected and along global supply chains.",
        "On the other hand, there were also indirect effects from protectionism through lower exports and diminished confidence, which implied weaker demand and lower prices.",
        "In this context, risks associated with heightened volatility in global financial markets were also highlighted more broadly.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, members generally concurred with the conjunctural outlook as embodied in the June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections, with the ongoing economic expansion in the euro area remaining solid and broad-based, and proceeding at a pace above that of potential growth, notwithstanding the weaker growth recorded in the first quarter of the year.",
        "At the same time, it was widely cautioned that there were signs that the slowdown identified in the first quarter was likely to extend into the second quarter in a number of countries and would imply downside risks regarding the near term, even though short-term fluctuations should be of limited relevance from a medium-term perspective.",
        "The view was also reiterated that the observed slowdown could, to some extent, be seen as a natural development in a maturing expansion after many years of growth above potential.",
        "An increasing number of countries and sectors were starting to run into capacity constraints and labour shortages, implying a “structural” levelling-off of growth, which was seen to differ from a negative demand shock.",
        "On this basis it was suggested that, over the medium term, the euro area economy remained broadly on track to achieve the growth trajectory foreseen in earlier projections.",
        "The medium-term outlook was seen to be still supported by strong consumption fundamentals, related to expanding employment, rising wages and consumer confidence remaining at high levels.",
        "In addition, business investment should continue to benefit from very favourable financing conditions, as well as rising corporate profitability and solid demand.",
        "At the same time, some softening of momentum in export performance was to be expected after the exceptional performance during 2017.",
        "Against this background, risks to the euro area growth outlook were generally assessed to have remained broadly balanced overall, notwithstanding indications of weaker momentum in the short term.",
        "Downside risks, which could also affect the medium-term risk assessment, continued to relate primarily to global factors, including the threat of increased protectionism.",
        "Upside risks were mainly seen to arise from more expansionary fiscal policies, both abroad and in the euro area.",
        "It was reiterated that other policy areas needed to contribute decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential of the euro area economy and to increasing its resilience by implementing structural reforms.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, the ongoing expansion called for the rebuilding of fiscal buffers.",
        "Furthermore, a full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure remained essential.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Annual euro area HICP inflation had increased to 1.9% in May 2018, after 1.2% in April.",
        "This reflected higher contributions from energy, food and services price inflation.",
        "Looking ahead, on the basis of current oil futures prices, annual rates of headline inflation were likely to hover around the current level for the remainder of the year.",
        "While measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, they had been increasing from earlier lows, and domestic cost pressures and wages were strengthening.",
        "Underlying inflation was therefore expected to pick up towards the end of the year and to increase gradually thereafter.",
        "This assessment was also broadly reflected in the June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections, which projected annual HICP inflation at 1.7% in each year of the 2018-20 projection horizon.",
        "Compared with the March 2018 ECB staff projections, this entailed an upward revision for 2018 and 2019, which mainly reflected higher oil prices.",
        "It was highlighted that the sequence of recent projections had either confirmed the outlook for medium-term inflation or shown an improvement, providing grounds for increased confidence that inflation would converge to the ECB’s medium-term aim of inflation below, but close to, 2%.",
        "It was, however, also underlined that the recent increase in headline inflation was mainly driven by energy prices and that further convergence towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim relied on an expected pick-up in underlying inflation.",
        "Members considered that measures of underlying inflation in the euro area remained muted, while having risen somewhat from previous low levels.",
        "Underlying inflation was expected to rise gradually over the projection horizon.",
        "According to the June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation excluding energy and food had been revised up slightly, by 0.1%, for both 2019 and 2020.",
        "As regards developments in inflation expectations, members noted that both market-based measures and survey-based measures had, progressively, been moving in a favourable direction.",
        "Longer-term inflation expectations seemed on the whole to be anchored.",
        "Reference was made to the aggregate probability distribution of two-years ahead expectations derived from the SPF, which had clearly moved in the desired direction.",
        "The mode of the distribution had shifted to the right and at present appeared broadly aligned with the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "At the same time, the narrower dispersion of the distribution around its modal value signalled that SPF respondents had on balance become more certain that inflation would indeed be close to these higher levels.",
        "The shift in the distribution also provided further confirmation that deflation scenarios had been practically priced out.",
        "The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had edged up since the April monetary policy meeting and had been relatively stable at around 1.7% for some time, showing little volatility.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "While the weaker momentum in M3 dynamics over recent months had mainly reflected the reduction in the monthly net asset purchases since the beginning of the year, M3 growth continued to be supported by the impact of the ECB’s monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits.",
        "The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 was proceeding, with growth in loans to NFCs and to households unchanged.",
        "The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continued to significantly support credit flows and favourable borrowing conditions for firms and households across the euro area.",
        "In particular, reference was made to the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), which had provided incentives for lending to the real economy and were seen to have contributed notably to the increase in credit growth, even exceeding initial expectations somewhat.",
        "In this context, it was remarked that credit growth in the second-largest euro area economy had reached rates of more than 5% for loans both to households and to NFCs, which had triggered the introduction of a counter-cyclical capital buffer for banks as a macroprudential policy measure in that economy.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that, in spite of the recent moderation in activity, the incoming information remained consistent with continued solid and broad-based economic growth in the euro area.",
        "However, the short-term growth outlook was widely regarded as subject to some downside risks and uncertainties, notably related to the threat of increased protectionism, geopolitical tensions and renewed financial market risks in the euro area.",
        "Nevertheless, risks to the growth outlook were still assessed to remain broadly balanced in the medium term.",
        "Overall, the underlying strength of the economy, together with well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations and increasingly emerging price pressures, provided grounds for confidence that inflation would continue to move along a sustained adjustment path in the period ahead, even after a gradual winding-down of the net asset purchases.",
        "In their assessment of the extent of progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation based on the three criteria of convergence, confidence and resilience recalled by Mr Praet in his introduction, there was broad agreement among members that substantial progress had been made, although some uncertainties continued to prevail.",
        "It was again underlined that the assessment was probabilistic in nature and that the likelihood of inflation being on a sustained adjustment path had clearly increased over time.",
        "As regards the convergence criterion, the staff projections indicated that headline inflation and inflation excluding energy and food would reach 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively, in 2020, a trajectory that had become increasingly entrenched over a number of projection exercises.",
        "This was seen to confirm that inflation was well on course to converge to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Confidence in the expected inflation path was bolstered by diminishing uncertainty around the inflation outlook, as reflected in the narrowing dispersion of distributions around inflation forecasts, surveys and market expectations, in an environment in which deflation risks had essentially disappeared.",
        "Moreover, while measures of underlying inflation remained muted overall, continued economic growth above potential – with high levels of capacity utilisation and a progressive tightening in labour markets indicating supply constraints might increasingly come into play – increased confidence that price and wage pressures would strengthen further over time, lending support to continued inflation convergence.",
        "Regarding the resilience criterion, it was widely noted that inflation convergence was becoming increasingly self-sustaining and its reliance on the contribution of the net asset purchases was gradually waning, although it continued to depend on an ample degree of monetary accommodation overall.",
        "In this context, it was underlined that the monetary policy stance remained very supportive of continued economic expansion and a gradual increase in inflation in the euro area.",
        "On the basis of this assessment, members expressed unanimous support for the monetary policy proposal put forward by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "This included confirmation of continued net asset purchases under the APP at the current monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of September 2018 and the anticipation that, after September, subject to incoming data confirming the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation outlook, the monthly net asset purchases would be reduced to €15 billion until the end of December 2018 and would then end.",
        "At the same time, it was also widely agreed that monetary policy accommodation had to remain ample, which called for confirming the forward guidance on the reinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities for an extended period of time, while providing greater clarity on the expected future course of policy interest rates by enhancing the forward guidance on rates through explicit date-based and state-contingent elements.",
        "This entailed the expectation that policy rates would remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remained aligned with the Governing Council’s current expectations of a sustained adjustment path.",
        "The anticipation of the end of the net purchases by the year-end was seen to be fully consistent with previous communication by the Governing Council, which had made the horizon of the net asset purchases conditional on the extent of progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.",
        "Accordingly, with the substantial progress achieved, as also reflected in the inflation outlook contained in the recent Eurosystem staff projections, announcing the end of net purchases was widely regarded as following the gradual and predictable pattern of past recalibrations of the monetary policy stance, including the removal of the APP easing bias and the previous gradual reductions in the monthly pace of net asset purchases.",
        "Furthermore, given prevailing uncertainty, it was considered prudent to leave the end of net asset purchases still conditional on incoming data confirming the medium-term inflation outlook and to highlight the Governing Council’s commitment to providing sufficient monetary stimulus for as long as necessary.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that a winding-down of net purchases by the year-end was fully reflected in prevailing market expectations.",
        "There was wide agreement among members that an ample degree of monetary stimulus was still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term.",
        "As remaining uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook still called for caution, it was widely felt that monetary policy had to remain patient, prudent and persistent.",
        "Accordingly, it was argued that credible and effective forward guidance should be provided on the use of the remaining policy instruments, notably reinvestments and the evolution of policy interest rates, in order to accompany the sustained convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "At the same time, it was considered necessary to retain sufficient flexibility and optionality for monetary policy in the period ahead, and the importance of data-dependency in determining the ECB’s policy stance was underlined.",
        "On this basis, members unanimously agreed with the proposal made by Mr Praet in his introduction to reconfirm the forward guidance on the Governing Council’s reinvestment policy, while enhancing the forward guidance on policy interest rates.",
        "On reinvestment, the Governing Council reiterated its intention to maintain its policy of reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary.",
        "It was highlighted that the future reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities would imply a continued sizable presence of the Eurosystem in euro area securities markets, thereby contributing significantly to favourable liquidity conditions and the overall accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "The enhanced forward guidance on policy rates via explicit date-based and state-contingent elements was seen to provide greater clarity on the future path of policy interest rates, thereby anchoring policy rate expectations more firmly to support the financial conditions underpinning a continued convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "The strengthening of the forward guidance on the ECB’s policy rates was viewed as underlining their pivotal role as the tool of choice for adjusting the monetary policy stance in the future.",
        "In this regard, reference was made to the developments in policy rate expectations over recent months, which already indicated the market’s perception of the predominant role of the policy rates as the instrument for steering and communicating the monetary policy stance.",
        "Overall, the proposed formulation, indicating the Governing Council’s expectation that policy rates would be kept at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remained aligned with a sustained adjustment path, was seen to strike a good balance between providing sufficiently precise guidance and maintaining adequate flexibility.",
        "The proposed state-contingent component of the forward guidance on policy rates was widely seen as underlining the gradual and data-dependent approach to policy normalisation.",
        "In this regard, explicitly linking a first policy rate rise to inflation evolving along a sustained adjustment path was seen as consistent with the ECB’s forward-looking and medium-term-oriented monetary policy strategy and would underscore the credibility of the Governing Council’s commitment to its price stability objective.",
        "Against this background, members agreed with the communication proposals made by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "It needed to be emphasised that, while the incoming data had been somewhat weaker than previously expected, the fundamentals remained in place for the medium-term growth outlook to remain solid and broad-based, as also embodied in the June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Accordingly, it needed to be highlighted that the underlying strength of the euro area expansion, together with rising price pressures, well-anchored inflation expectations and the continuing ample degree of monetary accommodation, provided grounds for confidence in the sustained convergence of inflation.",
        "At the same time, it had to be acknowledged that, although the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook had remained broadly balanced overall, the incoming information suggested some downside risks to the short-term growth outlook, while risks related to global factors, including the threat of increased protectionism, had become more prominent.",
        "All in all, communication had to strike a careful balance between anticipating a termination of net asset purchases by the end of December 2018 and highlighting the continued commitment to providing sufficient monetary stimulus for as long as necessary.",
        "This suggested a continued need for patience, prudence and persistence in monetary policy for inflation pressures to build up and for the Governing Council to deliver on its commitment to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "The anticipated winding-down of APP net purchases, subject to incoming data confirming the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation outlook, was seen to be fully in line with the forward-looking and probabilistic nature of the assessment of a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation and the corresponding need for monetary policy to preserve optionality and react flexibly to major deviations from the envisaged inflation convergence.",
        "More broadly, it needed to be reiterated that significant monetary policy stimulus was still needed for a continued and sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.",
        "It also deserved to be emphasised that, following the phasing-out of the remaining net asset purchases by the end of the year, ample monetary accommodation would still be provided by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, together with the enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates.",
        "In this context, it was important to highlight that, even after a termination of the net asset purchases under the APP, monetary policy would continue to be very accommodative.",
        "In particular, it could be stressed that the intention to reinvest principal payments from maturing securities for an extended period of time would still imply a very significant presence in euro area private and public sector bond markets.",
        "Regarding the enhanced forward guidance on policy interest rates, it was felt that the open-ended character of the state-contingent component should be emphasised, with policy rates expected to remain at their present levels for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remained aligned with the Governing Council’s current expectations of a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, thereby underlining the Governing Council’s consistent and predictable “reaction function” in the pursuit of its medium-term price stability objective.",
        "Finally, in the light of prevailing uncertainties that could put a sustained convergence of inflation at risk, it was widely considered prudent to stress the Governing Council’s continued readiness to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continued to move towards the Governing Council’s aim in a sustained manner.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remained aligned with the current expectations of a sustained adjustment path.",
        "With regard to non-standard monetary policy measures, first, the Governing Council would continue to make net purchases under the APP at the current monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of September 2018.",
        "The Governing Council anticipated that, after September 2018, subject to incoming data confirming the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation outlook, the monthly pace of the net asset purchases would be reduced to €15 billion until the end of December 2018 and that net purchases would then end.",
        "Second, the Governing Council intended to maintain its policy of reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s meeting on 12-13 September 2018, a continued rise in ten-year US Treasury yields had been observed.",
        "While US Treasury yields had initially also pulled euro area risk-free rates higher, the spillovers had remained relatively contained overall.",
        "A decomposition of the increase in nominal ten-year US Treasury yields into the break-even rate and the real component indicated that the recent rise reflected, by and large, a rise in real yields.",
        "The muted adjustment in ten-year break-even inflation rates was worth highlighting in view of the rise in commodity prices and the close relationship observed in recent years between changes in oil prices and long-term inflation expectations.",
        "As regards euro area bond market developments, since the Governing Council’s mid-September meeting, a notable upward shift had taken place in the Italian sovereign yield curve, where two-year and ten-year yields were currently 150 and 180 basis points above their early May 2018 levels.",
        "Turning to developments in equity markets, there had been a sharp correction in US markets in response to the rise in yields on US Treasuries that had spilled over to stock markets globally, including in the euro area.",
        "Other factors, such as the situation in Italy, trade tensions and growing fears over the global growth outlook, had likely amplified the correction.",
        "The overall impact of the trade disputes on the US equity market seemed to have remained limited so far, mainly because sectors exposed to trade had a relatively low share in total US stock market capitalisation.",
        "Conversely, for emerging market economies, a measurable impact of the trade tensions had been observed in the equity markets of those economies that were most open to trade.",
        "In China, escalating trade tensions had induced a marked drop in the equity market.",
        "Finally, with regard to interest rate expectations in the euro area, Mr Cœuré indicated that market pricing had exhibited an upward shift in the overnight index swap curve, while surveyed economists had somewhat scaled back their expectations regarding the pace of tightening.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Regarding the external environment, global growth was moderating and becoming less synchronised.",
        "Trade growth had stabilised.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area had remained unchanged in August at 2.9%, and inflation excluding energy and food had also stood broadly stable, at around 2.1%.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had decreased by 4.4% (in US dollar terms) since the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting.",
        "Over the same period, non-oil commodity prices had increased by 1.9% and metal prices had risen by 3.5%.",
        "Turning to the euro area, recent incoming data had been somewhat weaker.",
        "The October headline flash composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the euro area had declined to 52.7, from 54.1 in September.",
        "The latest PMI data had hinted at a slowing momentum in manufacturing growth looking ahead.",
        "In part, this was related to some sector-specific factors that were likely to dampen euro area real GDP growth only temporarily.",
        "The underlying growth momentum remained consistent with the baseline scenario of an ongoing broad-based economic expansion.",
        "Private consumption had continued to grow at a robust pace.",
        "Employment growth had remained the main driver behind dynamic household income growth.",
        "Business investment was expected to continue to grow, supported by favourable earnings expectations, solid domestic demand and favourable financing conditions.",
        "The deceleration of extra-euro area export growth registered since the beginning of the year had come to a halt.",
        "At the same time, uncertainties surrounding trade were affecting business.",
        "Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation had stood at 2.1% in September 2018, up from 2.0% in August, while HICP inflation excluding energy and food had remained stable at 0.9%.",
        "Overall, recent data were slightly higher than expected for headline inflation and wage growth, and slightly lower for services inflation.",
        "Meanwhile, measures of underlying inflation had moved sideways.",
        "Higher wage growth, as well as a recovery in producer and import prices, was expected to continue to support the upward adjustment in underlying inflation.",
        "The results of the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the fourth quarter of 2018 had shown average inflation expectations of 1.7% for 2018 and 2019, unchanged from the previous quarter, and identical with the September 2018 ECB staff projections.",
        "Market-based inflation expectations were also largely unchanged since the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting.",
        "Financial conditions had tightened somewhat on account of lower equity prices, but borrowing costs for households and firms had continued to be very accommodative.",
        "Equities of both non-financial and financial corporations had fallen since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "At the same time, earnings expectations had remained broadly unchanged.",
        "Meanwhile, there had been some renewed volatility in Italian markets, but so far with only limited spillovers to other euro area sovereign bond markets.",
        "Compared with the mid-September meeting, the markets’ expected timing of a first increase in ECB policy rates was largely unchanged.",
        "Turning to money and credit developments, M3 had grown by 3.5% in September.",
        "The increase in the growth of loans to the private sector, observed since the beginning of 2014, had continued.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations (NFCs) had stood at 4.3% in September, while loans to households had risen by 3.1%.",
        "The results from the latest euro area bank lending survey also confirmed that net demand for loans remained robust.",
        "As regards fiscal policy, the draft budgetary plans for 2019 pointed to a slightly looser euro area fiscal stance, measured as the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, compared with the September 2018 ECB staff projections.",
        "This was mainly on account of deficit-increasing measures in Italy and some additional expansionary measures in Germany.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet concluded that financial conditions had tightened somewhat since the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting, but borrowing conditions for households and firms continued to be highly accommodative.",
        "Incoming data, while somewhat weaker than expected, remained overall consistent with the baseline scenario of an ongoing broad-based economic expansion, supported by domestic demand and continued improvements in the labour market.",
        "Some recent sector-specific developments were having an impact on the near-term growth profile.",
        "There was evidence that uncertainties surrounding trade were affecting business.",
        "The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced.",
        "However, the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and persistent financial market volatility remained prominent.",
        "Headline inflation had increased to 2.1% in September and was likely to hover around the current level over the coming months.",
        "Measures of underlying inflation continued to be muted.",
        "Looking ahead, underlying inflation was expected to pick up, supported by the steady increase in wages and the build-up of pressures at the early stages of the pricing chain.",
        "This assessment called for patience, prudence and persistence in monetary policy.",
        "Accordingly, the Governing Council needed to maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance and therefore: (a) reiterate its anticipation that, subject to incoming data confirming its medium-term inflation outlook, it would end its net asset purchases at the end of December; and (b) reassert all elements of its forward guidance pertaining to the paths of interest rates and reinvestments.",
        "Regarding communication, it was important to emphasise that the incoming information, while somewhat weaker than expected, remained overall consistent with an ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation, and to highlight that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook could still be assessed as being broadly balanced, although the risks relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility remained prominent.",
        "Likewise, it was important to stress that the underlying strength of the euro area economy continued to support confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim would proceed and would be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of net asset purchases.",
        "Moreover, it was essential to reiterate that significant monetary policy stimulus was still needed for a continued and durable convergence of inflation to the inflation aim and that this support would continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by the enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates.",
        "In this connection, Mr Praet emphasised that the winding-down of net asset purchases was not tantamount to a withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Recent data and survey results had been generally somewhat weaker than expected, but were still considered consistent with an ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy, as had been embodied in the September 2018 ECB staff projections.",
        "It was underlined that the weaker growth momentum observed in 2018 pointed to an economy that was growing more in line with potential, following growth rates that had been well above potential in 2017.",
        "In particular, the weaker growth momentum in the current year reflected lower export growth, following the exceptionally strong export performance in 2017.",
        "In considering the outlook and the risks for the external environment, members noted that, while global growth had moderated and was becoming less synchronised, there had been a stabilisation in trade growth.",
        "Members reiterated their concern about the potential impact of trade protectionism, and an escalation of trade conflicts, on the global outlook.",
        "While it was argued that the impact of current trade tensions on the euro area had been fairly limited so far, it was also possible that an adverse impact from trade tensions on more open economies was being offset by the presently more buoyant imports, particularly in the United States.",
        "Members took note of the outcome of the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and of ongoing discussions between the EU and the United States.",
        "It was observed that trade tensions between the United States and China continued to linger.",
        "Reference was also made to the progress of negotiations on the terms of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that the risks from emerging market economies appeared to have receded somewhat, with countries such as Turkey and Argentina having stabilised.",
        "It was also pointed out that economic dynamics were very strong in a number of eastern neighbouring countries.",
        "Against this background, members considered that the uncertainties related to global factors remained prominent, and the risks related to the external environment were assessed to be tilted to the downside.",
        "Turning to the euro area, there was broad agreement that incoming information had generally been somewhat weaker than expected.",
        "However, real GDP growth in the second quarter had been confirmed at 0.4%, and the composition had been revised somewhat, notably showing a higher contribution from export growth, which appeared to have stabilised, together with more robust domestic demand.",
        "Moreover, the latest survey releases, although somewhat weaker, remained above historical averages, and available data for the third quarter were seen to have been affected by country and sector-specific factors.",
        "It was noted that now-casting tools, which were designed to take on board a wide range of data releases and indicators to provide an updated estimate of growth, suggested a downward revision to the short-term outlook.",
        "A weaker growth pattern in the second half of 2018 would have a mechanical impact, via the carry-over effect, on the estimate for annual growth in 2019.",
        "However, it was also acknowledged that little information was currently available for the fourth quarter, with the exception of the PMI for October, and consumer confidence, which had stabilised at a high level.",
        "Taking the role of temporary and sector-specific developments into account, overall it was judged that recent data and survey results had not significantly changed the outlook and that the baseline contained in the September 2018 ECB staff projections, of an ongoing economic expansion, remained broadly valid.",
        "The underlying strength of the economy was reflected by developments in the main demand components.",
        "Private consumption was underpinned by ongoing employment growth and rising wages.",
        "Business investment was supported by solid domestic demand, favourable financing conditions and corporate profitability.",
        "Housing investment remained robust.",
        "In addition, the expansion in global activity was expected to continue to support euro area exports, although at a slower pace.",
        "Looking ahead, a question was raised about the possible impact of higher and volatile oil prices on demand and supply, notably via terms-of-trade effects on household real disposable income and corporate profits.",
        "Members agreed that the December 2018 Eurosystem staff projections, which would be available at the Governing Council’s next monetary policy meeting, would provide an occasion for a more in-depth assessment.",
        "Further data and survey results were also expected to help to better identify the role of transitory versus more persistent factors affecting the growth outlook.",
        "Moreover, it was noted that, for the first time, the December projections would include the outlook for 2021.",
        "While there was broad agreement that at present the risks to growth could still be considered to be balanced overall, a remark was made that a number of arguments pointed towards risks to the growth outlook tilting to the downside.",
        "It was recalled that the September 2018 ECB staff projections had incorporated a small acceleration in quarterly growth rates in 2019, compared with the profile for 2018, which could be revisited.",
        "The December projections would provide an updated assessment of the impact of developments in trade on the outlook for euro area growth, which had been revised down successively in recent staff projection exercises, reflecting to a large extent the impact of external factors.",
        "Furthermore, it was recalled that the September projections had incorporated a limited impact of weaker trade on domestic euro area investment.",
        "Reference was made to some anecdotal evidence suggesting that the business decisions of firms were being affected by widespread uncertainty related to trade and political developments, with some firms postponing investment as a result.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, it was emphasised that the ongoing broad-based expansion called for the rebuilding of fiscal buffers.",
        "This was particularly important in countries where government debt levels were high and for which full adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact was critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions.",
        "The transparent and consistent implementation of the EU’s fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries also remained essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy.",
        "Although the more expansionary fiscal stance expected in several large countries with low public debt levels could have a positive effect on euro area growth, members also highlighted that the expansionary effect of procyclical fiscal policies was uncertain.",
        "This was particularly the case in economies where debt levels were already high and a looser fiscal stance could adversely affect confidence and have a negative effect on resilience.",
        "Overall, risks to the euro area growth outlook were generally still assessed to be broadly balanced.",
        "Although risks relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility remained prominent, it was considered that the underlying strength of the economy continued to mitigate downside risks to activity.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Annual euro area headline inflation had been 2.1% in September 2018, compared with 2.0% in August.",
        "This reflected higher contributions from energy and food price inflation, while HICP inflation excluding food and energy had remained stable, at 0.9%.",
        "Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation were likely to hover around the current level over the coming months.",
        "While measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, they had been increasing from earlier lows, and domestic cost pressures were strengthening amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets.",
        "Underlying inflation was expected to pick up towards the end of the year and to increase further in the medium term, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth.",
        "Members considered that the medium-term outlook for inflation, as contained in the September 2018 ECB staff projections, had been broadly confirmed.",
        "It was noted that the disappointing development in HICP inflation excluding food and energy was mainly due to services prices.",
        "However, it was recalled that there were a number of special factors underlying services price developments, which were mainly related to administered prices.",
        "An increase in underlying inflation for the euro area was to be expected when these base effects disappeared.",
        "It was observed that wage growth had continued to pick up in line with expectations, reflecting the tightening labour market and the reduction of slack, and that the main driver of higher wage growth was negotiated wages rather than wage drift.",
        "Developments in wages were considered a factor behind increasing confidence in the outlook for consumer prices.",
        "It was pointed out that euro area wage growth had accelerated to 2.3% in the second quarter, from 1.9% in the previous quarter.",
        "In countries that were already facing capacity constraints, wage growth was even higher.",
        "Evidence supporting this assessment was reported for a number of individual countries.",
        "At the same time, the point was made that wage indexation mechanisms had become significantly less important since the financial crisis in a number of countries.",
        "This suggested that second-round effects might now be less relevant than in the past.",
        "As regards developments in oil markets, it was argued that the likely response of oil supply in the current circumstances to an increase in demand was highly uncertain.",
        "Furthermore, it was argued that there had been a fundamental break in oil price dynamics, with the role of shale oil affecting the responsiveness of supply, which was not the case in the first decade of Monetary Union and in the preceding period.",
        "As a consequence, oil price movements were volatile but not particularly persistent.",
        "It was highlighted that, while higher oil prices might constitute a downward risk for growth, via the adverse terms-of-trade effect on consumption, a positive impact on inflation was to be expected, including from the second-round effects of past increases in oil prices.",
        "Members underlined that the transmission of higher wages to consumer price inflation was subject to lags.",
        "Questions were raised, in particular, about the behaviour of profit margins and mark-ups.",
        "It was noted that firms had so far accommodated higher wages by reducing mark-ups.",
        "It was also argued that mark-ups could not be squeezed indefinitely.",
        "Members also referred to the possible impact of trade tensions on the outlook for inflation.",
        "It was considered that the overall impact was ambiguous and would depend on the balance of demand and supply effects.",
        "As regards developments in inflation expectations, members noted that longer-term market and survey-based measures appeared to be reasonably well anchored.",
        "According to the latest ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), longer-term inflation expectations were unchanged at 1.9%, while the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had also remained stable, at around 1.7%.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) growth had remained broadly stable and was increasingly supported by bank credit creation.",
        "The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth.",
        "It was noted that the growth of MFI loans to the private sector had strengthened further, continuing the upward trend observed since the beginning of 2014.",
        "In the euro area, the growth of loans to NFCs had increased further in September, while the growth of loans to households had remained unchanged at robust levels, supported by the ongoing economic expansion and very favourable credit conditions.",
        "It was seen as encouraging that the latest bank lending survey continued to indicate increasing demand across all loan categories and positive readings on bank lending conditions for loans to enterprises and to households for house purchase.",
        "In this context, the remark was made that the maturity of some of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations would fall below one year in the course of the next year, which could impact the evolution of excess liquidity and might affect banks’ liquidity position.",
        "It was also argued that, from a prudential perspective, some caution was warranted as regards the potential implications of very easy credit conditions and low lending rates for banks’ capacity to appropriately price and account for credit risk.",
        "Reference was made to the recent increase in sovereign bond spreads in one euro area country, where it was noted that lending rates for firms and households had increased and market-based financing costs for NFCs had risen somewhat more markedly in that economy.",
        "Some tightening in lending conditions was also visible for that economy in the recent results of the bank lending survey, with in particular the terms and conditions on new loans to the private sector having tightened moderately.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members generally shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The incoming data, while somewhat weaker than expected, remained overall consistent with an ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation pressures.",
        "The underlying strength of the euro area economy and increased evidence of building wage pressures continued to support confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim would proceed and be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of net asset purchases.",
        "At the same time, uncertainties relating to rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility remained prominent.",
        "Significant monetary policy stimulus was still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term.",
        "This support would continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by the enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates.",
        "There was broad agreement that borrowing conditions for the real economy remained highly supportive of a continued economic expansion and a gradual increase in inflation pressures in the euro area, although financial conditions had tightened somewhat overall since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, mainly due to declining share prices.",
        "The euro had depreciated modestly against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms, while euro area risk-free interest rates had increased somewhat.",
        "Rising interest rates and the related decline in US stock market valuations had also weighed on equity prices in the euro area, with bank stocks particularly affected.",
        "In this context, it was noted that equity valuations still generally remained at high levels, notably for the United States, as evidenced for example by the level of cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratios.",
        "It was observed that sovereign bond spreads in one large euro area country had increased.",
        "Contagion to other financial market segments and other sovereign bond markets had so far remained limited.",
        "Against this background, members widely agreed that patience, prudence and persistence with regard to monetary policy remained warranted, as set out in the proposals made by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Maintaining the prevailing monetary policy stance in line with the decisions taken at previous meetings was seen to be consistent with the Governing Council’s data-driven approach to monetary policy, oriented towards the medium term.",
        "Continuity and steadiness with respect to monetary policy were particularly warranted in an environment that was still subject to a number of uncertainties and fragilities.",
        "Accordingly, the Governing Council would reiterate its anticipation that – subject to incoming data confirming the ECB’s medium-term inflation outlook – net asset purchases would be discontinued at the end of December 2018, and would reassert all elements of forward guidance pertaining to the ECB’s key interest rates and reinvestments under the asset purchase programme (APP).",
        "There was broad agreement among members that the overall monetary policy stance remained highly expansionary and would remain so even after the net asset purchases had ended.",
        "While the monthly amount of net purchases had been reduced, it was seen as important to highlight that the ECB’s balance sheet continued to grow and was still adding monetary policy stimulus, although at a slower pace.",
        "In this context, it was also stressed that, even after the net purchases had ceased, ample monetary policy accommodation would remain in place, notably owing to the stock of assets on the ECB’s balance sheet and the associated reinvestments, as well as to the forward guidance on interest rates.",
        "The very high degree of monetary stimulus was also seen to be reflected in various measures of the monetary stance, such as real interest rates, which at the short end still stood at exceptionally low levels.",
        "On communication, members widely concurred with the elements proposed by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "In particular, it was seen as appropriate to maintain a steady hand in communication, also in the light of prevailing uncertainties and fully in line with the previous decisions and communication adopted by the Governing Council.",
        "Accordingly, it needed to be emphasised that the incoming data, while somewhat weaker than expected, remained overall consistent with an ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation pressures.",
        "It was likewise important to stress that risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced, in line with earlier assessments, but that the risks relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility remained prominent.",
        "Overall, it was important to highlight that conditions remained in place for inflation to move sustainably towards the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim.",
        "In particular, it needed to be stressed that the underlying strength of the euro area economy, supported by high levels of capacity utilisation and a progressive tightening of labour markets, with the associated rise in wages, continued to support the Governing Council’s confidence that the convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term would continue in the period ahead and would be maintained after a gradual winding-down of the net asset purchases.",
        "In the light of still prevailing uncertainties and only gradually rising underlying inflation, there was also broad agreement among the members that it was essential to remain prudent, patient and persistent with regard to monetary policy.",
        "Accordingly, it was necessary to reiterate that significant monetary policy stimulus was still needed for a continued and durable convergence of inflation.",
        "At the same time, it had to be emphasised that monetary policy remained on a steady track in line with current market expectations and in full consistency with decisions taken at previous Governing Council meetings.",
        "In this context, it needed to be recalled that, even after the net purchases came to a close, monetary policy would remain highly accommodative.",
        "An ample degree of monetary accommodation would continue to be provided by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by the Governing Council’s enhanced forward guidance.",
        "Moreover, it was widely considered prudent to restate the Governing Council’s readiness to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continued to move towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council would continue to make net purchases under the APP at the new monthly pace of €15 billion until the end of December 2018.",
        "It anticipated that, subject to incoming data confirming the medium-term inflation outlook, net purchases would then end.",
        "The Governing Council intended to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting."
    ],
    "2016": [
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 20-21 July 2016, sentiment in the financial markets had improved and volatility had declined.",
        "Global equity indices had fully recovered from the decline seen at the time of the UK referendum and, by early September, had risen to stand close to their highest levels in 2016, supported by better than expected economic news in some of the main economic regions and by expectations of further monetary policy easing.",
        "While the European bank equity index had been supported by the generally positive market sentiment through July and August, it remained below the levels seen at the start of the year.",
        "The release of the European Banking Authority’s stress test results had not had any significant impact on the performance of bank equities.",
        "Turning to oil prices, Brent crude oil had recovered when OPEC members started suggesting that they were prepared to discuss stabilising prices at the forthcoming informal OPEC meeting in September.",
        "The implementation of the asset purchase programme (APP) across all components had continued in a satisfactory way in recent months.",
        "This was the case despite the usual lower market liquidity in summer, which had been factored in by lower targeted purchase volumes for July and August.",
        "The start of the implementation of the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) had been very smooth, underpinned by an active primary market and good liquidity conditions in the secondary market.",
        "As a result, the total portfolio size of the CSPP had already overtaken that of the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP).",
        "The total size of the Eurosystem balance sheet, at €3.35 trillion, now exceeded the peak of €3.1 trillion reached in July 2012, while overall market liquidity indicators did not point to emerging problems in the functioning of the cash bond market.",
        "However, the footprint of the purchase programmes in the market had increased, due to both the larger volume of monthly purchases since April and declining market activity over the summer months.",
        "In addition, borrowing rates for some government bond collateral had deviated from ECB policy rates, highlighting increasing scarcity of some bonds, which may be explained by several factors, such as higher demand for certain types of investment.",
        "While the implementation of the APP was continuing to progress smoothly overall, the present constellation of interest rates was posing increasing challenges to implementation in the future.",
        "The funding situation of European banks had remained robust in spite of market concerns.",
        "Regarding US dollar funding conditions, the spread between US dollar LIBOR and the US dollar overnight index swap rate had increased by 10 basis points since mid-July, as money markets were pricing in a lower availability of US dollar liquidity for banks, related to the implementation of the US money market fund reform in October 2016.",
        "There were no signs of US funding tensions for euro area banks and the recourse to the Eurosystem’s US dollar operations had remained limited.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Global growth continued to be sluggish.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had risen to 51.6 in August, from 51.5 in July, on the back of a slightly stronger expansion in both the manufacturing and services sectors, although developments had remained mixed both across and within advanced economies and emerging market economies.",
        "In the United Kingdom, following the referendum outcome in June, short-term indicators had been more resilient than previously expected, while uncertainty remained high as regards the longer-term economic outlook.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area had dropped slightly in July, to 0.8%, from 0.9% in June.",
        "Excluding food and energy, inflation had declined to 1.8% in July, from 1.9% in June.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had stood at USD 47 per barrel on 6 September, 3.1% higher than at the time of the 20-21 July Governing Council meeting.",
        "Over the same period, the euro had remained broadly unchanged in nominal effective terms vis-à-vis the currencies of 38 of the euro area’s major trading partners.",
        "Turning to the euro area, real GDP had increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2016, after 0.5% in the first quarter, with positive contributions from net exports and, to a lesser extent, domestic demand.",
        "The composite output PMI had stood, on average, at 53.1 in July and August, the same level as in the second quarter, while the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) had displayed a small decline as a result of a pronounced fall in August.",
        "Both indicators – the PMI and the ESI – remained above their respective long-term averages.",
        "Quarterly growth in private consumption had slowed in the second quarter, while labour markets had continued to improve and households’ real disposable income had increased further.",
        "Employment had risen by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter and the euro area unemployment rate, at 10.1% in July, unchanged from June, had remained at its lowest level since August 2011.",
        "Surveys up to August 2016 suggested further labour market improvements in the period ahead.",
        "Total investment had been flat in the second quarter, while domestic conditions remained, overall, supportive for investment.",
        "The latest quarterly European Commission Business Surveys that were released on 29 July showed that capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector had increased slightly and that demand had improved further to a level not seen since early 2012.",
        "However, falling confidence and export orders in total manufacturing suggested weaker business investment growth looking ahead.",
        "At the same time, low interest rates in the euro area significantly reduced debt servicing costs, thereby supporting the profitability of non-financial corporations (NFCs).",
        "Looking ahead, in the September 2016 macroeconomic projections ECB staff expected euro area real GDP to grow by 1.7% in 2016 and by 1.6% in 2017 and 2018.",
        "Compared with the June 2016 Eurosystem staff projections, the outlook for growth had been revised downwards slightly for both 2017 and 2018.",
        "Turning to euro area price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate annual HICP inflation had been 0.2% in August, unchanged from July.",
        "While annual energy inflation had continued to rise, services and non-energy industrial goods inflation had turned out to be slightly lower than in July.",
        "At the same time, underlying inflation was not yet showing any clear sign of an upward trend.",
        "Following an increase in the first half of 2015, the annual rate of the HICP excluding food and energy had been hovering around 1%.",
        "Producer price inflation for domestic sales of non-food consumer goods had remained unchanged at 0.0% in July.",
        "While some improvement in economic conditions had probably exerted upward pressure on producer prices, it had likely been offset by low commodity input prices.",
        "Looking ahead, signs of upward pressure came from the services sector.",
        "Moreover, selling price expectations had continued to show an upward trend, with the European Commission survey indicator standing above its long-term average since the beginning of 2016.",
        "Wage growth in the euro area had stabilised at a low level.",
        "Looking ahead, in the September 2016 macroeconomic projections ECB staff foresaw annual HICP inflation at 0.2% in 2016, 1.2% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018.",
        "These projections were broadly in line with those from the private sector and other international organisations.",
        "As regards longer-term inflation expectations, survey-based measures had remained stable since the beginning of the year.",
        "According to the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters for the third quarter of 2016, average longer-term expectations for inflation five years ahead continued to stand at 1.8%.",
        "By contrast, looking at market-based inflation expectations, the euro area five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had decreased further, from 1.36% on 19 July 2016, to stand at 1.26% on 6 September.",
        "Financial market participants continued to assume that medium-term inflation would stay low, with the probability of inflation remaining between only 0% and 1.5% increasing again since the UK referendum.",
        "At the same time, deflation fears in the market appeared well contained and had not returned to the levels observed in late 2014 and early 2015.",
        "With regard to financial conditions, the situation had remained broadly unchanged from the 20-21 July Governing Council meeting.",
        "The EONIA forward yield curve remained well below levels that had been observed in early June 2016, while the GDP-weighted average of ten-year euro area sovereign bond yields had mostly stayed between 0.5% and 0.6%.",
        "Moreover, financial market volatility had remained low and NFC equity indices were trading above levels that had prevailed at the beginning of June.",
        "At the same time, a further decline in corporate bond yields, amid rising monthly gross issuance of corporate bonds, had been observed since the announcement of the CSPP in March.",
        "The cost to euro area banks of debt funding had also continued to fall and to converge across countries towards very low levels.",
        "Moreover, banks had seen a further decrease in the cost of deposits and of Eurosystem funding, particularly via TLTRO-II.",
        "Bank lending rates to households and NFCs had continued to decline in the second quarter of 2016 and in July.",
        "At the same time, retail deposit rates across the euro area had stabilised at very low levels.",
        "Financing conditions for households and firms had improved slightly overall.",
        "The total annual flow of external financing to euro area NFCs continued to strengthen in the second quarter of 2016.",
        "Current levels were comparable with those of 2005 and 2009, being mainly driven by the ample issuance of market debt.",
        "Together with the ongoing recovery in loans to NFCs from banks and non-banks, these developments pointed to improved access to external financing by both larger and smaller firms and were expected to provide further support to the ongoing euro area recovery.",
        "Turning to money and credit, annual growth in M3 had remained broadly unchanged at 4.8% in July 2016 – now hovering close to 5% for over a year – while the annual growth rate of MFI loans to the private sector had continued its gradual recovery, reaching 1.7% in July, up from 1.5% in June.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to NFCs had risen to 1.7% in June, at the end of the second quarter of 2016, up from 1.1% in the previous quarter, reaching 1.9% in July.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households had also continued to increase from the first to the second quarter, standing at 1.8% in July.",
        "Bank profitability remained low, while bank equity prices had performed poorly over the past year, reflecting financial market uncertainty and low economic growth, also in a context of regulatory challenges.",
        "The gap between euro area banks’ cost of equity and return on equity was estimated to have widened further recently, while price-to-book ratios of euro area banks had remained stable and continued to stand significantly below 1.",
        "With regard to fiscal policies, the fiscal stance in the euro area, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was expected to be mildly expansionary in 2016 and to turn broadly neutral in 2017 and 2018.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet recalled that, at its meeting on 20-21 July 2016, the Governing Council had concluded that, following the UK referendum, more information would be needed to reassess the underlying macroeconomic conditions.",
        "Incoming data continued to point to the resilience of the euro area economy to global and political uncertainty, although downside risks remained.",
        "The ECB’s comprehensive monetary policy measures continued to ensure supportive financing conditions and were underpinning the euro area economic recovery.",
        "The September 2016 ECB staff projections continued to expect real GDP to grow at a moderate pace, albeit slightly slower than previously anticipated.",
        "The outlook for euro area HICP inflation was broadly unchanged, in line with the path already embodied in the June 2016 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Over the coming months HICP inflation was expected to pick up, in large part owing to base effects.",
        "Yet, underlying price pressures continued to lack a convincing upward trend and remained an ongoing source of concern.",
        "Importantly, the projected path of inflation remained conditional on exceptionally supportive financing conditions, which to a large extent reflected the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy.",
        "Developments in the bank lending channel deserved close monitoring.",
        "The pass-through of the ECB’s measures to borrowing conditions remained strong, but banks faced numerous challenges that might affect both their pricing and lending decisions.",
        "With these considerations in mind, and on the basis of available information, preserving the very substantial amount of monetary support embedded in the staff projections was necessary to secure a return of inflation rates to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "As regards implementation, there had to be no doubt about the Governing Council’s ability to act if needed.",
        "In this respect, the relevant committees should be tasked to evaluate options that ensured a smooth implementation of the APP.",
        "Potential revisions of the parameters had to take due consideration of their effectiveness from a monetary policy perspective.",
        "Against this backdrop, communication needed to emphasise that monetary policy measures had been instrumental in ensuring the resilience of the euro area economy to global and political uncertainty.",
        "It was also important to reiterate that the Governing Council continued to monitor economic and financial market developments very closely and that it was determined to preserve the required degree of accommodation, as appropriate, to secure a return of inflation to its inflation aim.",
        "Likewise, it was important to restate that the Governing Council stood ready to use all the instruments within its mandate to achieve its objective of price stability, and to re-emphasise that, to reap the full benefits from the ECB’s monetary policy measures, other policy areas needed to contribute decisively and in a timely manner.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, there was broad agreement among the members with the assessment, provided by Mr Praet in his introduction, of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area.",
        "Real GDP growth had continued in the second quarter, albeit at a lower rate than in the first quarter, in line with expectations.",
        "Recent data releases remained consistent with a continuation of the moderate economic recovery also in the third quarter.",
        "Looking further ahead, domestic demand in the euro area was expected to remain resilient, supported by still relatively low oil prices, as well as by the pass-through of the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "Growth prospects were seen to be dampened by continuing subdued foreign demand, partly related to the uncertainties surrounding the outcome of the UK referendum, as well as by the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms.",
        "This assessment was reflected in the outlook for growth in the September 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "Compared with the June 2016 Eurosystem staff projections, the growth outlook had been revised downwards slightly.",
        "Commenting in more detail on the outlook for and risks to the external environment, members noted that the latest staff projections did not contain a deterioration in the outlook for emerging market economies.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that the staff projections had incorporated a substantial downward revision to euro area foreign demand, which largely reflected a lower growth and trade outlook for the United Kingdom in the wake of the referendum vote to leave the European Union.",
        "Members took note that the financial market reaction to the outcome of the referendum had been contained.",
        "There was also some evidence, from recent UK data releases, to suggest that the immediate effect on activity of the referendum result might be less negative than had been widely expected.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the longer-term economic implications of the UK vote, as regards the impact both on the UK economy and on trade with the European Union.",
        "It was considered too early to say that the widely expected adverse effects on growth were overstated, while the monetary policy measures taken by the Bank of England, together with expectations of further policy measures, were seen as helping to buffer the adjustment of the UK economy.",
        "Thus, there remained a risk that, at some point, stronger downside effects of the UK decision to leave the European Union would manifest themselves.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement that the outlook for the external environment continued to be uncertain and subject to downside risks.",
        "Turning to the euro area, there was broad agreement with the growth outlook embodied in the September 2016 ECB staff projections.",
        "The latter confirmed that the moderate recovery in the euro area economy was ongoing, with only small downward revisions to the outlook for 2017 and 2018, which were related to external, rather than domestic, factors.",
        "It was noted that the latest data for the euro area were consistent with an ongoing economic recovery, with business and consumer confidence remaining robust over the summer months.",
        "It was highlighted that the euro area had recorded positive quarter-on-quarter growth rates for more than three years, starting in the second quarter of 2013, which was evidence of the resilience of the euro area recovery to global economic and political uncertainty.",
        "In considering the latest staff projections, members observed that the expected negative effect of the UK referendum outcome on the euro area economy via trade channels had been offset by other factors, notably a decline in government bond yields and a slightly lower effective exchange rate of the euro.",
        "It was underlined that the projections were based on exceptionally supportive financing conditions, which to a large extent reflected the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy.",
        "It was also noted that market expectations of additional monetary policy measures by the ECB were reflected in the technical assumptions underlying the September 2016 staff projections for growth and inflation.",
        "This limited the extent to which the baseline was revised downwards.",
        "However, overall, the positive impact of these expectations on the baseline was assessed to be contained and had to be viewed in the context of the high degree of uncertainty which, in any case, surrounded the outlook for growth and inflation, including uncertainty about the impact of non-standard measures.",
        "When discussing the components of domestic spending, members observed that consumption was being supported by higher real household disposable income, related to sustained employment gains and still relatively low oil prices, while favourable financing conditions, together with improvements in corporate profitability and in the outlook for demand, should support a recovery in investment looking ahead.",
        "However, some concern was again expressed about the prospects for a pick-up in investment, also taking into account its weakness in the second quarter.",
        "Members felt that the reasons behind the hesitant recovery in business investment needed to be better understood in conjunction with persistently high corporate savings, the role of uncertainty and other factors, such as technology and demographic developments.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that cross-country developments were uneven.",
        "It was pointed out that, while output growth in some countries had exceeded expectations, the level of GDP in other countries was still very low relative to pre-crisis levels.",
        "It was suggested that the structural reasons behind consistent sub-par performance should be further examined, and overall it was noted that there was still some way to go to reach sustainable convergence among euro area countries.",
        "Reference was also made in the discussion to the continued existence of savings and investment imbalances at the euro area and country levels.",
        "The euro area current account surplus, reflecting an excess of domestic saving over investment, was seen as an indication of weak domestic demand.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that in some small euro area countries stronger domestic demand had mainly led to higher import growth.",
        "Moreover, structural factors such as demographics were also deemed to play a role in explaining patterns in national savings and current account balances.",
        "Overall, the recovery in the euro area economy was expected to continue at a moderate but steady pace, while the risks to the growth outlook were assessed to remain tilted to the downside, related mainly to the external environment.",
        "Against this background, members again stressed that monetary policy on its own was not sufficient for a self-sustaining recovery, and that there was a need for other policy areas to contribute much more decisively in supporting economic activity and potential growth.",
        "Structural reforms were necessary in all euro area countries, and implementation needed to be stepped up substantially in order to reduce the level of structural unemployment and to raise potential growth.",
        "The focus should be on actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of adequate public infrastructure.",
        "Higher public and private investment was considered important to raise productivity growth.",
        "The swift and effective implementation of structural reforms would not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area, but would also make the euro area more resilient to external shocks.",
        "Turning to fiscal policy, members highlighted the need for compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union and reiterated that full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact over time and across countries remained crucial for confidence in the fiscal framework, which was increasingly being challenged.",
        "Concerns were expressed with regard to recent decisions at the European level that cast doubt on the functioning of the Pact.",
        "At the same time, it was also recalled that a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies could support the economic recovery, as could the use of fiscal space, where available.",
        "It was stressed that the composition of government expenditure was at least as important as its size.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to start rising in the coming months, owing to upward base effects from energy prices and assumed oil price increases embedded in the futures curve.",
        "Over the projection horizon, inflation was expected to pick up further, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures and in line with the projected economic recovery.",
        "This assessment was reflected in the September 2016 ECB staff projections, where the HICP inflation outlook was broadly unchanged in comparison with the June 2016 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "In discussing expected developments in inflation, members noted that there was still no clear upward trend visible in measures of underlying inflation, which remained low.",
        "According to the latest staff projections, HICP inflation excluding food and energy and headline inflation were expected to converge in early 2017, at rates slightly above 1%.",
        "With regard to the prospect of a further increase in inflation beyond this period, it was suggested that an important role would probably be played by services price inflation, as non-energy industrial goods prices were likely to continue to be affected by globalisation and could therefore be expected to remain subdued.",
        "The expectation of higher services price inflation was supported by evidence linking developments in services prices with wage growth, and by the expectation of more dynamic wage developments.",
        "It would thus be important to continue to follow developments in wages closely.",
        "In this context, it was noted that the projections expected a further decline in the unemployment rate to be only gradual, which might understate the cyclical effect on the labour market of the ongoing recovery in activity.",
        "A number of remarks were made in relation to the risks surrounding the increase in inflation expected in the September 2016 staff projections.",
        "In particular, reference was made to the past sequence of over-predictions in the inflation projections, which was seen as a downside risk to the baseline.",
        "Concern was expressed that the standard models used to produce inflation forecasts were typically subject to mean-reversion, and it was noted that analysis of the inflation outlook using a range of Phillips curves suggested that the projections, although within a plausible range, could be considered optimistic.",
        "The remark was also made that persistently low inflation in the euro area might start to affect expectations and make it harder for countries to regain competitiveness via relative price and wage adjustment, as well as contribute to higher real interest rates and a higher real debt burden, thereby dampening economic growth and inflation prospects.",
        "However, it was also argued that there were good reasons to think that the past projection errors for inflation might not be repeated in the future.",
        "The impact of labour market reforms, which might have dampened wage pressures in the past, would fade over time and the effect of nominal rigidities, which had prevented sharp corrections in wages during the crisis and led to a more protracted wage adjustment, should also diminish.",
        "Moreover, there was a composition effect on wages, linked to job creation in low productivity and low wage sectors, which was unlikely to continue.",
        "It was also noted that oil prices were subject to considerable volatility and it was not easy to predict where they would stand in 2018.",
        "According to oil price futures, oil prices in 2018 would still be below their 2015 level.",
        "It could thus be argued that there was a risk that oil prices would be higher than assumed in the projections and that energy price inflation might increase more than currently projected.",
        "Members also considered recent developments in inflation expectations.",
        "It was highlighted that survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, such as the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, were broadly unchanged for the period five years ahead, at around 1.8%.",
        "However, while the average of point forecasts was stable, the Survey of Professional Forecasters also provided a probability distribution around the point forecasts which remained tilted to the downside.",
        "There had been a further decline in market-based inflation expectations for the euro area since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead having fallen to around 1.3%.",
        "This warranted close monitoring.",
        "It was also noted, however, that the probability of deflation had not increased and that market expectations were affected by international, as well as domestic, developments.",
        "Moreover, it could not be ruled out that there might be some small positive effects on longer-term market expectations if actual inflation started to increase in the coming months.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement that euro area inflation was expected to rise over the months ahead and that the outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged compared with the path implied in the June 2016 staff projections.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) had continued to increase at a robust pace in July 2016.",
        "As in previous months, annual growth in M3 had been mainly supported by its most liquid components and loan dynamics had continued on the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014.",
        "Members stressed that the effects of the monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 were continuing to filter through to support borrowing conditions for firms and households and, thereby, credit flows across the euro area.",
        "In particular, the continued easing in market-based financing conditions, including banks’ funding conditions, together with strong competitive pressure among lenders, had all contributed to a further decline in bank lending rates, including vis-à-vis small and medium-sized enterprises.",
        "While the credit channel had continued to improve, bank loan dynamics still remained moderate overall despite the substantial degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Therefore, given the banking system’s crucial importance for the transmission of monetary policy to the broader economy, developments in the bank lending channel continued to deserve close monitoring, as had been pointed out by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Ongoing structural challenges related to banks’ balance sheets and the weakness in profitability continued to pose a risk to the transmission of monetary policy and the further recovery in credit dynamics.",
        "While bank earnings had been lower in the first quarter of 2016 than in the first quarter of 2015 (when banks had benefited from valuation gains associated with the launch of the expanded APP), net interest income had still been holding up relatively well.",
        "However, more recent indications pointed to a further decline in all three main revenue pillars, namely interest income, non-interest fee income and trading income.",
        "While this could, in part, be attributed to the low interest rate environment, lower bank earnings were also due to provisioning related to the still high level of non-performing loans in parts of the euro area banking sector and increased competition among banks.",
        "Looking ahead, further challenges could arise from regulatory and supervisory demands on banks in the coming months.",
        "At the same time, it was seen as important for the Governing Council to counter prevailing misperceptions regarding adverse implications for the banking sector of regulatory measures and supervisory action aimed at ensuring its stability and balance sheet sustainability.",
        "In this regard, it was of paramount importance to address the remaining structural weaknesses in the euro area banking sector, where in particular bank lending should benefit from dealing effectively with non-performing exposures.",
        "A healthier banking system should further support money and credit creation and enhance the effectiveness of the monetary policy measures in place.",
        "In this context, it was also highlighted that bank profitability depended crucially on the further recovery in the euro area economy supporting an increase in still sluggish credit demand.",
        "As had already been noted at the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, the continued underperformance of bank equity prices, also reflecting dampened earnings expectations, had kept the cost of bank equity at elevated levels and might contain a cautionary signal for future loan growth.",
        "While there appeared to be a close correlation between bank equity valuations and the growth rate of aggregate credit in the subsequent year, it was considered difficult, however, to establish a clear causal link, as a number of supply and demand factors played a role in determining bank equity prices and bank lending.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that the incoming data continued to point to the euro area economy’s resilience to global and political uncertainty.",
        "Accordingly, and based on supportive financing conditions, real GDP was expected to grow at a moderate but steady pace and euro area inflation to rise gradually in line with the path already embodied in the June 2016 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Yet, downside risks remained and underlying inflation was still not showing convincing signs of a sustained pick-up, which warranted continued close monitoring of price trends and of economic and financial market developments.",
        "Members widely agreed that policy action at the present meeting was not warranted and that the focus should remain on ensuring the full implementation of the policy measures so far decided.",
        "It was therefore seen as important to confirm the Governing Council’s commitment to the monthly asset purchases of €80 billion, which were intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "The comprehensive set of policy measures that had been adopted were seen as continuing to support favourable market and bank-based financing conditions.",
        "In particular, the recently commenced CSPP and TLTRO-II were providing further significant funding cost relief to both non-financial corporations and banks.",
        "Moreover, market fragmentation had, overall, diminished markedly, contributing to improvements in monetary policy transmission across the euro area.",
        "Reference was made to the ongoing reduction in emergency liquidity assistance to banks in vulnerable euro area countries and the continued decline in spreads across euro area credit markets.",
        "However, cross-country differences in spreads were also seen to reflect still prevailing differences in country-specific credit risk premia.",
        "While the substantial degree of monetary accommodation was swiftly reflected in financial market conditions, it had not yet completely filtered through to final variables such as growth and inflation.",
        "It was recalled, however, that transmission lags, with which policy passed through intermediate variables to the ultimate objective, had to be taken into account.",
        "Moreover, in view of the private and public sector imbalances that had built up previously, these lags were likely to be longer than usual, and it would still take more time for the effects of the ECB’s policy measures to unfold fully and reach the broader economy.",
        "Overall, confidence was expressed that the monetary policy measures were continuing to provide effective support to the cyclical recovery and the upward path in inflation.",
        "This was also reflected in the September 2016 ECB staff projections, in which the measures taken in December 2015 and March 2016 were estimated to have a cumulated upward impact on real GDP growth of 0.6 percentage point and on inflation of 0.4 percentage point over the projection horizon.",
        "In this context, it was highlighted that the projected path of inflation was conditional on exceptionally supportive financing conditions, which to a large extent reflected the current accommodative monetary policy stance and prevailing market expectations about the future course of monetary policy.",
        "Against this background, and given remaining downside risks and uncertainties relating, in particular, to the external environment, the view was widely shared that financing conditions had to remain supportive to underpin the recovery in growth and inflation.",
        "It was therefore of crucial importance to preserve the very substantial degree of monetary support that was embedded in the staff projections, while it was also cautioned that the Governing Council should not be unduly influenced by prevailing market expectations and that it had to remain fully focused on its commitment to achieve its price stability objective over the medium term.",
        "At the same time, members reiterated their full commitment to bringing inflation back to levels in line with the Governing Council’s medium-term aim without undue delay.",
        "While the Governing Council needed to stay the course at the present meeting and give existing measures time to unfold, it was important to reiterate its capacity and readiness to act, if warranted, to achieve its objective, using all the instruments available within its mandate.",
        "Members also discussed possible future challenges regarding the Eurosystem’s ability to source sufficient eligible bonds in the market under the APP and the request was made to the relevant Eurosystem committees to further evaluate the options to ensure smooth implementation of the programme.",
        "The view was widely shared that reassurance had to be provided about the Eurosystem’s ability to ensure the smooth implementation of the APP and its capacity to deliver on its commitment that the programme would run until March 2017, or beyond, if needed.",
        "It was underlined that the Governing Council could adjust the parameters of the programme at any time to achieve the intended amounts.",
        "There should be no doubt about the Governing Council’s determination to execute its asset purchases in line with its past decisions and to adopt further measures, if needed, to fulfil its price stability objective.",
        "Finally, a strong call was made for European policymakers to flank the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy measures with adequate fiscal policies and structural reforms to achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth in line with the G20 policy commitments.",
        "Monetary policy alone could not lead to sustainable growth but could only buy time for action to be taken in other policies areas.",
        "To reap the full benefits of an extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy in supporting growth and inflation, other policies needed to contribute decisively.",
        "As regards communication, members widely agreed with the proposals presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Confidence had to be conveyed in the effectiveness of the ECB’s monetary policy measures and the state of the euro area economy, its resilience to global uncertainty and the baseline scenario for growth and inflation.",
        "In the light of the prevailing uncertainties, it was also seen as important to reiterate that the Governing Council was monitoring economic and financial market developments very closely and that it was determined to preserve the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation that was necessary to secure a return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Finally, great emphasis had to be placed on the Governing Council’s willingness, capacity and ability to act, if warranted, to achieve its objective by using all the instruments available within its mandate.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided to keep the interest rates on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "The Governing Council continued to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.",
        "Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirmed that the monthly asset purchases of €80 billion were intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until it saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 20-21 January 2016.",
        "The global economic outlook had deteriorated further, accompanied by bouts of market volatility, particularly in markets for bank liabilities.",
        "Oil prices had rebounded in February after having fallen to their lowest level since 2003.",
        "The outlook for oil prices remained uncertain, however, as the oil market was still experiencing over-supply and global oil inventories remained at very high levels.",
        "The potential for a lasting rebound in the oil market was unclear, according to market participants.",
        "Market-based indicators of inflation expectations had continued to broadly follow the price of petrol, but not the recent rebound in the price of crude oil, and the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had reached a historical low of 1.36% on 29 February.",
        "Against the background of concerns about global growth and continued risk-off sentiment in global markets, monetary policy expectations had been re-priced across all major currency areas, becoming more accommodative, with less divergent monetary policy expectations among the different monetary areas.",
        "In the United States, market expectations for the next rate hike had been pushed back significantly, with a sharp re-pricing between January and February, followed by some correction in the light of recent better than expected indicators, in particular inflation.",
        "A 25 basis point rate hike in the United States was not fully priced in until December 2016, which was well beyond what had been expected at the beginning of the year.",
        "Similarly, in the United Kingdom, money market forward rates had shifted considerably lower, with the Sterling Overnight Index Average forward curve becoming inverted, fully pricing in a 10 basis point rate cut by the end of 2016.",
        "This was in stark contrast to what had been expected at the beginning of 2016.",
        "The euro nominal effective exchange rate, measured against 19 major trading partners, had remained broadly unchanged since the previous monetary policy meeting, with a brief interim episode of a 2.5% appreciation of the euro.",
        "This temporary move had resulted from the depreciation of the currencies of the euro area’s three main trading partners: the US dollar, the pound sterling and the Chinese renminbi.",
        "In the case of the pound sterling, the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the UK referendum on EU membership, scheduled for 23 June, had risen and investors in the foreign exchange options market were increasing their purchases of downside protection on the currency.",
        "The People’s Bank of China had decided on 29 February 2016 to cut the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points to counter the slowdown in economic growth and improve liquidity conditions.",
        "This was the fifth consecutive cut since February 2015, amounting to a cumulative decrease of 300 basis points, from 20% to 17%.",
        "The decision by the Bank of Japan on 29 January 2016 to adopt a negative deposit rate structure had reverberated through global financial markets, contributing to a sharp decline in global bank shares.",
        "Following the decision, the entire Japanese yield curve had shifted downwards by around 20 basis points.",
        "Price volatility had negatively impacted market liquidity and funding activities in most euro area bond market segments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "While liquidity for highly rated sovereign bonds had remained fairly stable, liquidity for the respective jurisdictions’ covered bonds and agency bonds was currently rather reduced.",
        "With regard to private sector debt, a widening of spreads, for instance measured by the ITraxx series, had been observed in the period to mid-February 2016, not only for banks but also for non-financial corporations (NFCs), owing to concerns over growth and deteriorating liquidity in the corporate bond market; thereafter, some correction had taken place.",
        "Supply in the corporate bond market had been very subdued, as NFCs had reduced their bond supply in spite of the low level of yields.",
        "Reportedly, corporations were cash rich and thus did not need to attempt to benefit from low yields, for instance by re-profiling their debt and extending maturities as sovereigns had done.",
        "At the same time, however, the overall debt supply was returning to higher levels, as covered bond issuers, sovereigns and agencies were again taking advantage of very attractive absolute low funding yield levels, in particular at the back end of the curve, to restructure their debt and issue bonds with longer maturities.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 20-21 January 2016, the EONIA forward curve had shifted downwards by between 7 and 10 basis points and had reached levels below those prevailing before the December 2015 meeting.",
        "The market was firmly pricing in at least a 10 basis point cut in the rate on the deposit facility at the current meeting.",
        "In addition, the one-year forward EONIA swap rate one year ahead had declined to a new all-time low, at -53 basis points (on 3 March), and the entire EURIBOR cash curve was now in negative territory for the first time ever.",
        "Finally, Mr Cœuré concluded that market participants remained attentive to a number of risks in the foreseeable future: the risk of a re-emergence of bank and/or sovereign risk in the euro area, volatility in commodity prices and its consequences for emerging market economies, and the risk of a further depreciation of the pound sterling after the referendum.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Global growth remained subdued, with some weakening across regions.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had decreased to 50.6 in February, from 52.6 in January and 53.1 in the fourth quarter of 2015.",
        "Global trade had also weakened somewhat further.",
        "The volume of world imports of goods had grown by 0.9%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2015, down from 1.7% in the third quarter.",
        "The contraction in the PMI for new export orders in February suggested continued weakness early in 2016.",
        "Global inflation had increased in January, with annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area standing at 1.2%, after 0.9% in December.",
        "Excluding food and energy, inflation had remained unchanged at 1.9%.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s meeting on 21 January Brent crude oil prices had increased by 39%, to around USD 40 per barrel.",
        "Non-oil commodity prices had also bottomed out after sharp decreases in the period to end-January.",
        "Over the same period the euro had depreciated by 1% in nominal effective terms vis-à-vis the currencies of 38 major trading partners.",
        "Turning to the euro area, real GDP had continued to grow in the fourth quarter of 2015, increasing by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, with domestic demand being the main driver.",
        "Incoming data since 21 January had been mixed overall.",
        "While euro area industrial production (excluding construction) had declined by 1%, month on month, in December, the volume of retail sales, taken together with new passenger car registrations, had risen in January to 1.3% above the average level recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015.",
        "At the same time, both the Economic Sentiment Indicator and the composite output PMI had declined in January and February to levels below their fourth-quarter averages, but still above their long-term averages.",
        "Annual growth in households’ real disposable income had decelerated to 1.7% in the third quarter of 2015, compared with 2.2% in the second quarter.",
        "At the same time, consumption growth had slowed to 1.5% in the fourth quarter, from 1.8% in the third quarter, while the savings rate had remained broadly unchanged.",
        "As regards investment, the stronger dynamics recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 appeared to have been partly driven by construction investment, which had benefited from the mild winter.",
        "The PMI for construction had risen in January 2016 into positive growth territory for the first time since 2008, and the European Commission’s construction confidence index had improved in February.",
        "Euro area labour markets had continued to gradually improve.",
        "Employment had risen by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2015.",
        "As a result, employment had been 1.1% higher than a year ago – the highest annual increase since the second quarter of 2008.",
        "The unemployment rate, which had been declining since mid-2013, had stood at 10.3% in January 2016 – the lowest rate since August 2011.",
        "Despite these improvements, labour market rigidities persisted and unemployment remained very high from a historical perspective.",
        "The March 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresaw annual real GDP increasing by 1.4% in 2016, 1.7% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2018.",
        "Compared with the December 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth had been revised downwards, by 0.4 percentage point in 2016 and by 0.1 percentage point in 2017, mainly reflecting the weakened growth prospects for the global economy.",
        "Turning to price developments in the euro area, according to the March staff projections the expected pick-up in HICP inflation had been delayed again, with the annual rate now reaching 1.6% only in 2018.",
        "Compared with the December projections, inflation had been revised down by 0.9 percentage point and 0.4 percentage point for 2016 and 2017 respectively.",
        "These downward revisions largely reflected considerably lower oil prices, the appreciation of the effective exchange rate of the euro and the weaker outlook for compensation per employee, as well as recent weaknesses in inflation in non-energy components of the HICP.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, HICP inflation had been -0.2% in February 2016, down from 0.3% in January, owing to lower annual rates in all main components.",
        "Underlying inflation, as measured by the HICP excluding food and energy, had fallen to 0.7% in February, based on the flash estimate, after 1.0% in January.",
        "Import prices remained the main source of upward pipeline pressure, although they had been growing less strongly recently, while domestic pipeline pressures had remained subdued.",
        "Looking at recent developments in long-term inflation expectations, market-based measures had fallen since December in a volatile market environment.",
        "By contrast, survey-based measures of long-term inflation expectations had been more stable.",
        "Regarding financial and monetary conditions, the euro area yield curve had flattened substantially and was currently much lower than at the time of the December 2015 monetary policy meeting.",
        "In addition, following the sharp tightening in financial conditions after that meeting, on the back of the euro appreciation and the decline in equities, some reversal had taken place since the second half of February.",
        "Moreover, both the equity risk premium and non-financial corporate bond spreads had shown an increasing trend since spring and summer 2015 respectively.",
        "This differed from developments in the market for risk-free assets, where sovereign debt had become scarcer, as reflected by the decline in the risk-free rate.",
        "Since equity financing dominated the balance sheet of NFCs, the weighted average nominal cost of NFCs’ external financing had not declined more sharply even though the cost of bank borrowing had been falling substantially since mid-2014.",
        "In January 2016 the composite MFI lending rates for NFCs and households had remained broadly stable at low levels.",
        "Turning to money and credit, annual growth in broad money (M3) had remained robust at 5.0% in January, after 4.7% in December, supported by the low interest rates, as well as the impact of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and the asset purchase programme (APP).",
        "In addition to the most liquid components contained in M3, purchases under the APP had been a major contributor to M3 growth.",
        "Euro area loan dynamics had continued to improve gradually in January, although growth rates remained subdued.",
        "The ongoing improvement was visible across countries and sectors.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to NFCs (adjusted for sales and securitisation) had increased to 0.6% in January, after 0.1% in December and 0.7% in November.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households had remained at 1.4% in January, unchanged from December and November.",
        "A re-pricing of subordinated bank bonds had taken place at the beginning of the year.",
        "While at present increases were at least partly linked to bank-specific problems in certain jurisdictions, they could have a non-negligible impact on bank funding conditions if market turbulence were to persist.",
        "With regard to fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was expected to be mildly expansionary in 2016 and 2017, before reverting to broadly neutral in 2018.",
        "All in all, Mr Praet concluded that since the start of credit easing policies in June 2014 and their reinforcement through public sector asset purchases half a year later, the ECB’s monetary policy measures had led to a substantial easing of financial conditions and improved access to finance in the euro area, thereby providing sizeable support to inflation and economic activity.",
        "The improvements not only pertained to overall financial conditions in the euro area, but also to reduced fragmentation.",
        "The dispersion of lending rates to borrowers domiciled in different jurisdictions had narrowed, remuneration of bank deposits had become much less diverse and, in most countries, NFCs were benefiting from more favourable conditions on loans.",
        "Furthermore, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) currently faced fewer obstacles to access financing.",
        "Nevertheless, the prospects for a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation had deteriorated once more, owing to worsening external conditions, despite the adoption of additional monetary policy measures in December 2015.",
        "Mr Praet recalled that at the January 2016 monetary policy meeting the Governing Council had communicated that “it will be necessary to review and possibly reconsider” its monetary policy stance in March, in particular when the new staff macroeconomic projections would become available.",
        "Since then, the external environment had weakened and downside risks to the medium-term price stability objective had clearly increased.",
        "The economic recovery had been losing momentum and headline inflation had declined again into negative territory.",
        "Medium-term market-based measures of inflation expectations had also moved further down, increasing the risks of second-round effects.",
        "Moreover, the March 2016 ECB staff projections for inflation had been revised downwards substantially, implying yet another postponement of the date by which inflation was projected to come back into line with the ECB’s objective.",
        "Overall, and also cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis, there was a strong case for the Governing Council to reconsider its monetary policy stance at the current meeting and provide further substantial monetary stimulus to counteract heightened risks to the ECB’s price stability objective.",
        "In addition, it was important that public communication reiterated that the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 were critical in supporting the euro area recovery and in arresting even stronger disinflation.",
        "A comprehensive package of measures that reinforced each other was hence proposed, calibrated to further ease financing conditions, stimulate new credit provision and thereby reinforce the momentum of the euro area’s economic recovery and accelerate the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "This package built on the following four complementary elements: Third, a credit easing component (TLTRO II).",
        "New TLTROs would reinforce the accommodative stance and strengthen the transmission of monetary policy by providing further incentives for bank lending to the real economy; Fourth, reinforcing the forward guidance on interest rates by communicating that, looking ahead, “taking into account the current outlook for price stability and the extra support that inflation and the economy will receive from today’s measures, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases”, which would link the interest rate forward guidance to the conditionality that applied to the APP.",
        "Mr Cœuré complemented Mr Praet’s introduction with remarks on implementation issues.",
        "Starting with the APP and the CSPP, a purchase target of €80 billion per month until March 2017 could be achieved with a reasonable degree of confidence with two parameter changes: first, an increase in the issuer limit and the issue share limit for eligible international organisations and multilateral development banks (henceforth “supranationals”) from 33% to 50%, and, second, a reduction in the share of EU supranational securities from 12% to 10% of purchases under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), starting in April 2016.",
        "Simultaneously, to keep the current 20% risk-sharing regime unchanged – in itself a key parameter of the programme – the ECB’s share of monthly PSPP purchases would need to be increased from 8% to 10%.",
        "The Eurosystem would have to monitor the ability to source bonds and propose new parameter changes as needed.",
        "As regards the proposed new CSPP, this would be included under the umbrella of the APP and would start by the end of the second quarter of 2016.",
        "The list of eligible assets under the CSPP would comprise investment-grade euro-denominated marketable debt instruments issued by euro area non-bank corporations, with the exact definition still to be specified.",
        "A starting point for the eligible universe under the CSPP would be bonds eligible under the Eurosystem collateral framework, following the same principle as used for the other asset purchase programmes.",
        "The CSPP would be subject to full income and loss-sharing, and the portfolio would be valued at amortised cost subject to impairment.",
        "With regard to the four TLTRO II operations to be launched at a quarterly frequency from June 2016 to March 2017, each operation would have a four-year maturity from the respective settlement date.",
        "Voluntary repayments would be possible two years after the settlement of each operation, at a quarterly frequency, and, in contrast to the first series of TLTROs, no mandatory early repayment was envisaged.",
        "Counterparties would participate individually or as part of a group in the same way as for the current TLTROs and with the same group definition, meaning that groups could be unchanged from the first series of TLTROs to the second.",
        "New groups could also be created for TLTRO II.",
        "Each participant could borrow an amount equivalent to 30% of its stock of eligible loans as at 31 January 2016, less any amount previously borrowed and still outstanding under the first two TLTRO operations conducted in 2014.",
        "The definition of eligible loans would be the same as for the first series of TLTROs.",
        "The applicable benchmark would be based on net lending in the 12-month period between 31 January 2015 and 31 January 2016.",
        "Regarding the incentive scheme, banks exceeding the benchmark would be rewarded with lower borrowing rates that could be as low as the rate on the deposit facility.",
        "More specifically, the interest rate for counterparties below the benchmark would be fixed at the MRO rate prevailing at the date of the allotment.",
        "Banks exceeding their benchmark would be retroactively charged at a lower rate for the entire term of the operation and that rate would also be linked to the interest rate on the deposit facility at the date of allotment.",
        "To encourage and facilitate the switch from the first series of TLTROs to the second series, an additional voluntary repayment option for all the current TLTROs would be introduced in June 2016, coinciding with the settlement of the first TLTRO II operation, so as to allow a roll-over from the first series of TLTROs.",
        "Finally, Mr Cœuré indicated that the package did not contain a proposal for an exemption scheme for the deposit facility rate.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, there was broad agreement among the members with the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area, as provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Real GDP had continued to expand in the fourth quarter of 2015 and recent data releases remained consistent with an ongoing moderate economic recovery.",
        "However, the recovery appeared to have lost some momentum.",
        "Domestic demand in the euro area was expected to remain relatively resilient, supported by lower oil prices and a more expansionary fiscal stance, as well as by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, while a weaker international environment, with notably slower growth in emerging market economies, was weighing on global activity and trade, leading to more subdued foreign demand for euro area exports.",
        "This assessment was reflected in the outlook for growth in the March 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "As expected, compared with the December 2015 Eurosystem staff projections, the growth outlook had been revised downwards.",
        "Members took note that the effects of the non-standard measures decided at the December 2015 monetary policy meeting had been incorporated into the March 2016 projections exercise.",
        "It was also recognised that the technical assumptions used in the March 2016 staff projections for growth and inflation had to some extent been positively influenced by expectations of additional monetary policy measures by the ECB, without which the downward revisions would have been larger.",
        "Regarding the outlook and risks for the external environment, the latest staff projections contained further downward revisions in the short term to global activity and trade.",
        "It was remarked that the downward revisions could to some extent be considered as the materialisation of risks which had already been identified by the Governing Council in September 2015.",
        "In this context, it was highlighted that the baseline projection for the euro area was predicated on the assumption of a rather swift rebound in world trade.",
        "While the baseline was generally supported, caution was also expressed about the projected strengthening in global activity.",
        "Overall, despite some better economic news emanating recently from the United States, there was broad agreement that the outlook for the external environment continued to be uncertain and subject to downside risks, largely related to vulnerabilities in emerging market economies.",
        "Turning to the euro area, there was broad agreement with the revised growth outlook in the ECB staff projections.",
        "The updated projections were generally viewed as confirmation that the ongoing recovery in the euro area economy remained weak and fragile.",
        "Against this background, it was observed that the euro area economy continued to be rather vulnerable to adverse shocks.",
        "At the same time, the importance of distinguishing between the baseline scenario and the risks surrounding this baseline was emphasised.",
        "Although the downward revisions to the outlook for growth were disappointing, the baseline scenario still incorporated a gradual acceleration in economic activity.",
        "Moreover, the downward revisions were mostly related to external, rather than domestic, adverse developments.",
        "Private consumption was expected to remain robust, based on continued real income growth, supported by low energy prices and a further gradual improvement in euro area labour markets, and business investment was expected to pick up, in line with increasing demand.",
        "A number of positive indicators were also mentioned, which could provide a basis for more optimism about the current economic situation, including the January industrial production data for the two largest euro area countries and the continued improvement in labour markets, which reflected some positive effects of past structural reforms.",
        "The view was put forward that, taking these factors into account, the outlook for the euro area should not be regarded as overly pessimistic and conveying an unduly gloomy assessment should be avoided.",
        "Commenting on the outlook for domestic demand in more detail, the balance of risks was mostly seen to be on the downside.",
        "While noting that wage dynamics were expected to be weaker than previously foreseen, members expressed the view that the outlook for income growth, as foreseen in the staff projections, might still be subject to downside risks given the past projection errors in wages, the degree of slack remaining in the labour market and the possible effects of past structural reforms.",
        "It was noted that labour market conditions in the euro area, although improving, were still far from those in other major economies, such as the United States and the United Kingdom.",
        "Reference was also made to the continued existence of savings and investment imbalances across both sectors and countries.",
        "The view was put forward that these might be exacerbated by elevated uncertainty and the low level of interest rates, which might in some cases adversely affect confidence as well as the expected return on savings, possibly leading to higher savings and lower growth in household consumption, notably in countries where private pension plans and life insurance played a large role.",
        "In addition, members expressed concern about the outlook for private investment.",
        "It appeared that, despite low borrowing costs and the availability of ample internal financing, firms continued to be cautious about undertaking investments, perhaps owing to the perceived high level of uncertainty and the low potential growth rate.",
        "In this context, the argument was made that, for countries with available fiscal space, public investment could be increased, while at the European level there was a need to see more results from the European Commission’s Investment Plan for Europe.",
        "Overall, the recovery in the euro area economy was expected to continue at a more subdued pace, while the risks to the growth outlook were mostly seen to remain tilted to the downside.",
        "These risks related in particular to the heightened uncertainties regarding the external environment and to broader geopolitical risks.",
        "Against this background, members reiterated the necessity for other policy areas to support sustained output growth and that monetary policy on its own was not sufficient.",
        "There was a need for both structural reforms and fiscal policy to also play their part.",
        "In particular, given the high level of structural unemployment in the euro area and the low growth in potential output, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies regarding both labour and product markets.",
        "In addition to leading to higher sustainable economic growth, structural reforms would help to improve the resilience of the euro area to global shocks.",
        "As regards fiscal policy, members highlighted the need to comply with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, while at the same time stressing that existing elements of flexibility should be used.",
        "A more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies could support the economic recovery, as could the use of fiscal space, where appropriate.",
        "With regard to price developments in the euro area, there was broad agreement with the assessment of the outlook and risks presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The return to negative headline inflation in February was due to lower annual rates in all the main components, including services and non-energy industrial goods.",
        "According to Eurostat’s flash release, the annual rate of HICP inflation excluding food and energy had also fallen back unexpectedly.",
        "In the short term, on the basis of current oil futures prices, headline inflation was expected to remain in negative territory for a number of months, before rising later in the year, linked to strong upward base effects and the assumed oil price increases embedded in the futures curve.",
        "Over the medium term, inflation was expected to pick up in line with the economic recovery in the baseline projection.",
        "A combination of factors, including lower energy prices and the appreciation of the effective exchange rate of the euro, were seen to be responsible for a substantial downward revision to the outlook for HICP inflation compared with late 2015.",
        "This assessment was reflected in the March 2016 ECB staff projections, where the HICP inflation outlook had been revised down significantly for 2016 and 2017 in comparison with the December 2015 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "It was also noted that the downward revisions to inflation would have been larger were it not for the fact that the March projections already incorporated, via the technical assumptions, some expectations by financial markets of further monetary policy measures.",
        "Members expressed concern about the prospect that it would now take longer to reach the inflation objective than previously expected.",
        "According to the latest ECB staff projections, which now incorporated projections for 2018 for the first time, headline inflation was expected to be only 1.6% in 2018, underpinning the assessment that the return of headline inflation to rates below, but close to, 2% would be further postponed.",
        "The sequence of downward revisions over time to both the growth and inflation projections was recalled.",
        "Against this background, it was felt that it had to be acknowledged that inflation would not return to the ECB’s inflation aim for some time to come, while keeping in mind that the ECB’s definition of price stability over the medium term was not tied to the horizon of the staff projections.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to the fact that inflation had already been well below 2% for most of the period since 2012.",
        "The adverse implications of persistently low inflation for the process of debt deleveraging and also for financial stability were pointed out, by comparing this profile for inflation with a counterfactual one in which inflation was close to 2% over the same period.",
        "Looking more closely at the evolution of the main components of inflation, it was noted that the dominant forces driving the headline inflation rate continued to be global factors, namely lower energy prices and the exchange rate.",
        "The volatility of oil prices and of exchange rates had increased recently.",
        "It was remarked that the importance of these factors in determining headline inflation could be illustrated by updating the projections with the higher oil price and weaker exchange rate developments after the cut-off date of 15 February 2016, which would result in somewhat higher inflation than in the baseline scenario.",
        "However, it was also mentioned that oil prices over the more recent past had been determined not only by supply factors but also by weaker demand, which, if persistent, would not be a positive signal for the outlook.",
        "Members exchanged views about the implications of the latest developments in measures of underlying inflation.",
        "In particular, concern was expressed about the lower rate of HICP inflation excluding food and energy in the February flash release.",
        "It was noted that, if the reasons for the decline were permanent, this would dampen the outlook for underlying inflation still further.",
        "However, the reasons behind the decline in HICP inflation excluding food and energy in the latest release had not yet been fully explored, and it was possible that a significant part of this decline was due to temporary factors.",
        "At the same time, it was mentioned that, although underlying inflation remained positive, the decline recorded in February was a new element, which raised questions about the outlook for inflation compared with the situation last year, when core inflation had been rising slowly, but steadily, by around 0.1 percentage point each quarter.",
        "On the one hand, the weakness in HICP inflation excluding food and energy could be read as a signal of the insufficient level of aggregate demand in the economy, which, it was argued, remained the main problem for the euro area.",
        "On the other hand, it was reasoned that there had also been deeper changes in the saving and spending behaviour of economic agents after the financial crisis, reflecting, among other things, rebalancing needs, including wage and price adjustments, and balance sheet repair in a number of sectors and countries.",
        "As a consequence of such, possibly structural, changes, past experience did not provide much guidance as regards the reaction of inflation to the closing of the output gap, which gave rise to increased uncertainty about the inflation outlook.",
        "Recent developments in euro area inflation expectations were also scrutinised by members.",
        "The further decline in market-based measures since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, and the risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations, continued to be a key concern.",
        "The importance of halting the decline in inflation expectations was emphasised.",
        "Wage increases had already turned out much lower than previously expected, albeit for a range of different reasons, including windfall gains in households’ real disposable income, and concern was voiced that second-round effects might be larger than those incorporated into the staff projections.",
        "It was important to avoid a pattern of low wages and low prices becoming entrenched in the expectations and behaviour of economic agents.",
        "At the same time, some caution was again expressed regarding the reliability of the information content of market-based measures of inflation expectations, for a number of reasons, including liquidity effects associated with the ECB’s APP.",
        "It was also noted that survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, such as the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, remained more benign.",
        "According to this view, while there was a danger that persistently low inflation outcomes might spill over into inflation expectations, the risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations and of deflation could still be considered to be low.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement that, while euro area inflation was expected to pick up, there had been a further downward revision of the inflation outlook, mainly reflecting lower oil prices in recent months, so that the return to inflation rates below, but close to, 2% would take longer than previously expected.",
        "The risks surrounding the outlook for HICP inflation were also assessed to remain on the downside.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction that the recovery in money and credit dynamics had continued.",
        "M3 growth had remained robust in January 2016, mainly supported by the most liquid components and reflecting the impact of the monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding monetary instruments.",
        "Loan dynamics had continued on the gradual recovery path observed since the beginning of 2014.",
        "Bank credit to both firms and households had continued to expand, with the annual rate of change of loans to NFCs (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) rebounding in January.",
        "Developments in MFI loans to enterprises continued to mirror the lagged relationship with the business cycle and credit risk, as well as ongoing balance sheet adjustments, which reflected still high levels of non-performing loans.",
        "Loan dynamics were also supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the pass-through of monetary policy measures in place since June 2014, which had improved borrowing conditions and credit flows across the euro area.",
        "Notably, fragmentation across euro area countries had declined, with a significant compression of loan spreads.",
        "The ECB’s monetary policy measures were thus seen to have contributed strongly to the turn in the credit cycle in the euro area since 2014.",
        "From a global perspective, economies could be considered to be at different stages of the financial cycle, with the United States being more advanced than the euro area and perhaps having even completed the associated process of balance sheet correction, while in the euro area this was still under way.",
        "It was also noted that there could potentially be more positive news for the credit outlook from the regulatory side, with indications of a forthcoming clarification by the European Commission on the nature of Pillar 2 requirements under the Capital Requirements Directive, which could be reflected in the implementation of these requirements by the Single Supervisory Mechanism and could help reduce some of the regulatory uncertainty weighing on euro area banks.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that, since the previous monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council in January, downside risks to the Governing Council’s medium-term price stability objective had increased overall, as also indicated by the downward revisions for inflation and growth in the March 2016 staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "Against this background, members widely agreed that there was a need to reconsider the Governing Council’s monetary policy stance with a view to providing further substantial monetary stimulus to counteract heightened risks to the ECB’s price stability objective.",
        "Accordingly, an adequately calibrated package of measures was seen as needed to secure the return of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% without undue delay.",
        "Members widely agreed that, while the recovery of the euro area economy was expected to proceed, euro area growth momentum would be slower and inflation lower for longer than previously anticipated.",
        "This implied yet another postponement of the date by which inflation was expected to return to rates in line with the Governing Council’s medium-term aim.",
        "While much of the downgrade in the inflation outlook was due to falling oil prices and their prevailing future path, measures of underlying inflation were also projected to be weaker than previously foreseen.",
        "Concerns were also voiced about the renewed decline in medium-term market-based measures of inflation expectations.",
        "Overall, risks of second-round effects appeared to have increased.",
        "Moreover, the prolonged volatility in financial markets, amid heightened uncertainty about the global environment and renewed concerns about the health of the euro area banking sector, was seen as a risk to the continued smooth transmission to the real economy of the monetary policy measures taken since June 2014.",
        "There was thus broad agreement among members that a strong policy response was required, which was best achieved by a comprehensive package of measures that exploited the synergies and complementarities between its different components.",
        "This package needed to be adequately calibrated to further ease financing conditions, stimulate new credit provision and thereby reinforce the momentum of the euro area’s economic recovery and accelerate the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "While, overall, members widely agreed on the need for comprehensive policy action, different views were expressed with regard to the individual components of the proposed package.",
        "There was very broad agreement among members that the proposed policy package would benefit from strong credit easing components, namely with regard to the launch of new TLTROs to provide support for the bank lending channel.",
        "TLTRO II should enhance the bank-based transmission of the monetary policy stance by providing further incentives for bank lending to the real economy.",
        "Very broad support was expressed for the view that TLTRO II would need to be equipped with strong price incentives to encourage new lending to the real economy.",
        "Attractive funding conditions for banks, in turn, were seen to further ease private sector credit conditions and to stimulate overall credit dynamics.",
        "Therefore, the proposed inbuilt price incentive scheme of TLTRO II, aimed at providing incentives for the creation of new credit to the private sector, was widely supported.",
        "It was argued that the pricing scheme of TLTRO II would also contribute to a further defragmentation in the money markets.",
        "While, in the current circumstances, some banks could already borrow at the EONIA rate, the TLTROs would ease funding conditions for a broader range of banks, provided they were able to increase lending to the real economy in excess of the respective benchmarks.",
        "However, a few members expressed concerns about central bank operations continuing to replace the functioning of private markets and perpetuating banks’ dependence on Eurosystem financing, as well as about the size of the proposed price incentive scheme.",
        "The price reduction of up to the level of the deposit facility rate seemed to be rather generous, could lead to market distortions and could contribute to the preservation of weak business models by some banks.",
        "Regarding the applicable interest rate over the life of TLTRO II, members generally felt that it was appropriate to charge a fixed rate upon allotment of the operation.",
        "This would be simple and attractive, as banks could lock in their TLTRO funds at very favourable funding conditions for four years.",
        "With respect to the definition of eligible loans, on the basis of which the borrowing allowance would be calculated, it was agreed that the practice applied in the first series of TLTROs should be maintained, whereby eligible loans were defined as those of euro area NFCs and households, excluding loans to households for house purchase.",
        "The assessment was widely shared that lending for house purchase was best excluded from the TLTROs to avoid fuelling housing price bubbles by channelling savings into the housing sector.",
        "On the calculation of the benchmark, there was broad support for maintaining the mechanism adopted for the first series of TLTROs.",
        "Accordingly, the benchmark net lending would be set at zero for those banks with positive net lending, while the benchmark would be set at a lower level for those banks that were undergoing deleveraging.",
        "For banks to fully reap the benefits of the attractive new conditions of TLTRO II, it was also agreed they should be given an extra repayment opportunity for the existing TLTROs, to allow them to switch to the more attractive conditions of TLTRO II.",
        "Turning to the APP proposals, members widely agreed to the proposed expansion of the monthly purchases from €60 billion to €80 billion.",
        "A sizeable expansion in the monthly volume of purchases was seen as substantially strengthening the effectiveness of the asset purchases, mainly by reinforcing the portfolio rebalancing channel.",
        "Wealth effects and a further compression of long-term yields should foster the effective pass-through of the asset purchases, whereby lending rates to the real economy should also benefit further.",
        "As regards the parameters of the APP, with a view to ensuring the smooth implementation of future asset purchases, there was wide support for the proposal to increase the issuer limit and issue share limit for securities issued by eligible supranational institutions from their current level to 50%.",
        "A few members restated their reservations concerning the APP, namely with respect to public sector bonds, and voiced concerns as on previous occasions about a further expansion of asset purchases, as purchases of sovereign securities were, more than other monetary policy instruments, associated with a number of specific challenges and side effects.",
        "The view was reiterated that recourse to broad-based asset purchases, including public sector paper, should therefore remain a contingency instrument, to be used only as an ultima ratio in an adverse scenario, such as a situation of imminent deflation, for which there was no evidence at present.",
        "In this regard, the costs and risks of engaging further in public sector asset purchases, particularly in the medium to long term, would outweigh their potential benefits, also considering diminishing returns of scale and taking into account that even deeper cuts in the deposit facility rate or strongly targeted lending operations could have more traction on the economy.",
        "Broad support was expressed for the proposal to include investment-grade euro-denominated bonds issued by non-bank corporations as a new asset class in the eligible universe of purchasable assets under the APP.",
        "The inclusion of corporate bonds was seen as strengthening the credibility of the overall expansion of the monthly purchase volume and more directly signalling the support provided by the APP for the financing of the real economy.",
        "It was also noted that the purchases could have important spillover effects on the financing conditions of SMEs in the light of international evidence indicating that the banking sector redirected lending to SMEs when large companies’ bond issuance substituted for bank borrowing.",
        "Nonetheless, there were also cautionary remarks concerning the possible effectiveness of the purchases of corporate bonds.",
        "It was noted that, in the euro area, the market for these bonds was generally not very liquid or large, and purchases in such a market could therefore raise level playing field issues and lead to market distortions.",
        "Moreover, the direct impact on corporate financing conditions and investment behaviour appeared doubtful, as the Eurosystem would mainly purchase bonds from highly rated, cash-rich corporations, whose financing costs were already very low and whose investment behaviour, in any case, was not constrained by the cost or availability of funding.",
        "Regarding some operational features of the corporate asset purchases to be established under the new CSPP, there was broad support for the inclusion of euro-denominated investment-grade bonds of corporations established in the euro area, while the more detailed features of the programme still had to be worked out.",
        "Robust and clear eligibility criteria needed to be spelt out further, also considering the treatment of smaller issuers and SMEs and fragmentation in the corporate bond market.",
        "Turning to interest rates, broad support was expressed for the proposal to lower all the key ECB policy interest rates further, whereby the rate on the MROs and the rate on the marginal lending facility would be cut by 5 basis points to 0.00% and 0.25% respectively, and the rate on the deposit facility would be cut by 10 basis points to -0.40%.",
        "Nonetheless, different views were expressed about the costs and benefits of moving further into negative territory and the respective implications for the formulation of the Governing Council’s forward guidance on policy interest rates.",
        "On the one hand, concerns were raised about possible undesirable side effects that could arise from moving further into negative territory, particularly in combination with fast-growing excess liquidity.",
        "A further cut in the deposit facility rate could unduly increase the pressure on banks’ profitability, which could have adverse effects on the stability of the banking sector.",
        "As rates on bank customers’ deposits were typically constrained at zero, a further decline in rates charged on the asset side would lead to a compression in banks’ margins.",
        "Moreover, the transmission of monetary policy via bank intermediation could be affected negatively, as banks could recoup part of the costs by increasing lending rates or increasing fees and other charges in their cross-selling activities.",
        "Cutting interest rates further, in a market environment where uncertainty about the impact of negative rates prevailed, could also further exacerbate financial market volatility and have direct, negative repercussions on the confidence of euro area households and firms, as well as weigh on the profitability of insurance companies and pension funds, including corporate pension schemes.",
        "Finally, caution was also expressed with regard to the effectiveness of further reductions in the deposit facility rate, both as regards domestic channels of transmission and the exchange rate channel.",
        "On the other hand, a number of arguments were put forward pointing to the benefits of a further cut in the deposit facility rate.",
        "Lowering the rate further into negative territory was seen as an effective tool for providing additional monetary easing, which also reinforced the impact of the other monetary policy measures in place by stimulating the “velocity of reserves”.",
        "Moreover, past cuts in the rate had not only led to lower short-term interest rates, but had compressed interest rates across the spectrum of the yield curve also at the longer end.",
        "As regards the possible impact on banks’ profitability, a general equilibrium perspective was warranted that went beyond the direct effects of negative interest rates on the profit and loss account of banks.",
        "Taking a broader view, on balance, the combination of all monetary policy measures taken, including negative rates, appeared to have contributed positively to banks’ profitability thus far.",
        "This was evidenced by overall increasing net interest income and banks’ return on equity in the course of 2015, the first full year of negative rates, as well as by rising lending volumes.",
        "Banks appeared to benefit from the low interest rate environment, as a decline in interest revenues was more than compensated for by lower costs of funding and an expansion in credit volumes, together with possible holding gains on assets.",
        "With regard to the possible external dimension of a policy rate cut, it had to be stressed that further monetary easing was aimed at improving domestic financing conditions.",
        "Against this background, overall, members broadly supported a further cut in the deposit facility rate.",
        "With respect to the envisaged size of such a cut, the importance of communication and the link to the formulation of forward guidance was underlined.",
        "On the one hand, a sharper rate cut could be considered, together with indications that the effective lower bound would have been reached for all practical purposes.",
        "On the other hand, the proposed limited rate cut could be judged as appropriate for now, given the current assessment, while it would also not rule out the possibility and prospect of further cuts if warranted by the outlook for price stability.",
        "Most members favoured the proposed cut of 10 basis points, in conjunction with maintaining the formulation of “at present or lower levels” in the Governing Council’s forward guidance.",
        "It was argued that, from today’s perspective, and taking into account the support provided by the policy measures to growth and inflation, policy rates would be expected to remain at very low levels and that further rate reductions would not be anticipated at this stage.",
        "Nonetheless, the Governing Council would not rule out future cuts in policy rates, as new shocks could change the outlook for inflation, which might warrant further monetary policy action, with policy rates remaining part of the Governing Council’s toolbox.",
        "Members also exchanged views on the possibility of introducing an exemption scheme for the deposit facility rate applicable to banks’ holdings of excess reserves.",
        "Such a scheme was, in principle, seen as an instrument for mitigating possible negative effects on bank profits and for ensuring the smooth transmission of monetary policy.",
        "However, doubts were expressed in view of the overall complexity of such a system from an operational perspective and considering that there was little evidence of negative side effects at the current juncture.",
        "Against this background, the introduction of an exemption scheme was not seen as warranted at this stage.",
        "Finally, as regards forward guidance, broad support was expressed for linking the forward guidance on the likely future path of policy interest rates to the forward guidance on the asset purchases in a hierarchical and sequential manner by adding “and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases” to the existing formulation on forward guidance.",
        "This would anchor expectations about the relative sequencing, thereby providing greater clarity about the Governing Council’s expectations with respect to the future path of policy interest rates.",
        "The envisaged formulation on policy rate forward guidance needed to be fully consistent with the ECB’s monetary policy strategy, to reflect the current forward guidance on asset purchases and to ensure interdependence of the APP and the policy interest rates.",
        "However, a remark was also made that keeping interest rates low well past the horizon of the APP could be perceived by the public as allowing inflation to overshoot in the future.",
        "In the overall assessment of the proposed policy package, some remarks were made on the effectiveness of the monetary policy measures taken previously and of the proposed policy package, also in view of recent market concerns about the limits of monetary policy.",
        "Members broadly agreed that the monetary policy measures taken since June 2014 had been critical in supporting the euro area recovery and in arresting even stronger disinflation.",
        "It was therefore seen as important to firmly reiterate that the monetary policy measures were working and had been delivering their intended effects, for which there was ample evidence.",
        "The combination of measures, such as the rate cuts, the forward guidance, the earlier credit easing measures and the APP, had led to a broad-based and significant easing in financing conditions for all sectors of the economy.",
        "In particular, the monetary policy measures taken since June 2014 were seen as having been instrumental in contributing to a reversal in credit dynamics.",
        "The measures had also helped to reduce fragmentation, with the pass-through of the ECB’s policy stance improving in countries most affected by the crisis, and declines in lending rates for NFCs following the ECB’s monetary policy measures taken since June 2014 being substantially greater in these countries.",
        "It needed to be emphasised that the monetary policy measures taken had proven to be effective and had delivered significant effects on growth in inflation.",
        "In a counterfactual scenario of the absence of monetary policy support, inflation would likely be significantly in negative territory and economic growth would be visibly lower.",
        "The current low inflation environment should not be attributed to ineffective monetary policy measures, rather it was largely the result of a succession of negative shocks stemming mainly from the external environment, but also from weaker than expected domestic price pressures.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that the possible risks and side effects of the monetary policy instruments in use, particularly with regard to financial stability risks, had to be better understood and required further careful analysis and assessment.",
        "Members generally expressed confidence in the effectiveness of the envisaged policy package, even though nuanced views were put forward on the relative merits of the various elements of the package.",
        "Overall, it was highlighted that the agreed policy package consisted of a comprehensive set of measures that largely complemented and reinforced each other.",
        "While the cut in policy rates would impact the whole spectrum of the yield curve, the asset purchases further flattened the curve, with the portfolio rebalancing effects being reinforced by the negative interest rates.",
        "At the same time, the new series of TLTROs and the purchases of non-bank corporate bonds would further ease the funding conditions of banks and firms, boosting the pass-through of the monetary policy stance to the borrowing conditions faced by the private sector.",
        "While monetary policy had to do whatever was needed to pursue its price stability objective, a strong call was reiterated for other policy areas to step up, decisively, their efforts to strengthen sustainable growth prospects in the euro area, also to avoid the risk of overburdening monetary policy.",
        "Against this overall background, and taking into account the views expressed by the members of the Governing Council, the President concluded that a large majority of voting members supported the proposed policy package, comprising a cut in the interest rates on the Eurosystem’s MROs and on the marginal lending facility of 5 basis points to 0.00% and 0.25% respectively, a cut in the interest rate on the deposit facility of 10 basis points to -0.40%, an expansion of the monthly purchases under the APP to €80 billion, starting in April, the inclusion of investment-grade euro-denominated bonds issued by non-bank corporations established in the euro area in the list of assets eligible for regular purchases, and the launch of a new series of four targeted longer-term refinancing operations, each with a maturity of four years, starting in June 2016.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 9-10 March 2016, developments in global markets had become more supportive of risk appetite.",
        "The outcome of the March Federal Open Market Committee meeting had been interpreted by market participants as implying that the future path of US rates would be both more gradual and less steep than previously expected.",
        "The US dollar had depreciated against major currencies over the five weeks since the March Governing Council monetary policy meeting.",
        "US equity indices had advanced further, with the S&P 500 rising by around 6%, and the ten-year US Treasury yield had edged lower, fluctuating in a 30 basis point range.",
        "At their meeting on 17 April 2016, OPEC and non-OPEC countries had not agreed on a freeze in crude oil production, which had led to a significant drop in oil prices following a previous upward trend.",
        "Market-based measures of inflation expectations in the euro area, as measured by the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, had remained broadly unchanged, showing a divergence since March 2016 from the slowly rising market-based inflation expectations in the United States.",
        "In foreign exchange markets, since the Bank of Japan’s decision to lower interest rates to below zero in late January 2016, the Japanese yen had appreciated by just over 10% against the US dollar.",
        "This appreciation in the first quarter of 2016 was attributed to safe haven and repatriation flows into the Japanese yen before the fiscal year-end in Japan.",
        "The pound sterling had depreciated against the euro and the US dollar since the beginning of the year.",
        "Commentators associated these developments with an increase in the uncertainty about the outcome of the 23 June referendum on UK membership of the European Union.",
        "Moreover, the UK banking sector was seen as impacted, since the cost of protection against default of the five largest British banks had continued to increase steadily compared with that of US and European banks.",
        "Finally, on 7 March 2016, the Bank of England had announced three additional liquidity-providing operations to take place around the date of the referendum.",
        "Turning to the euro area, the impact of the decisions taken by the Governing Council on 9-10 March 2016 had been positive across market segments.",
        "The announcement of the €20 billion increase in monthly purchases, to €80 billion, under the asset purchase programme (APP) and of the new corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) had led to sizeable changes in investors’ positioning.",
        "Some compression of intra-euro area government bond spreads had subsequently been observed amid a generally positive impact on yields.",
        "The ten-year German government bond yield had declined to within a few basis points of its all-time low, observed in April 2015.",
        "Market-implied volatilities for long-dated swaps on the German government bond curve seemed to imply that investors were pricing in a somewhat higher probability of a further decline in yields than of an increase.",
        "With regard to the APP, market liquidity conditions had so far remained broadly conducive to its smooth implementation.",
        "The recent changes to the parameters of the ECB’s securities lending arrangements, as of 4 April, had been welcomed by market participants.",
        "European corporate bond spreads had seen a general repricing.",
        "The narrowing of spreads had extended beyond the market segments expected by market participants to be eligible for the CSPP – notably, spreads on sub-investment grade bonds had also narrowed considerably.",
        "Exposure to corporate risk had increased.",
        "Position-taking in European credit default swap (CDS) indices for corporate bonds had more than doubled since the ECB’s announcement of the CSPP.",
        "A possible reason was that the CDS market for corporate bonds could also be used to hedge some macro risks.",
        "Counterparties had furthermore reported that the CSPP announcement had also marked a noticeable improvement in corporate issuance.",
        "Issuance volumes and announcements of new deals had increased substantially in recent weeks, although they remained low overall compared with last year.",
        "More evidence and analysis was needed to fully understand the determinants of the supply side.",
        "The purpose of such issuance also remained to be understood, whether related to funding investment projects, M&A financing or liability restructuring.",
        "One feature had been that issuers were issuing more bonds with longer maturities.",
        "Regarding developments in the money markets and ECB policy expectations, during the 10 March press conference markets had largely priced out expectations of further rate cuts, but some reassessment took place later on, following the 7 April release of the March monetary policy account and public statements by Governing Council members, both of which reaffirmed the Council’s willingness to take further action if needed.",
        "At the same time, judging from implied densities of future market rates, uncertainty about future moves had declined and the probability attached to significantly lower rates had noticeably diminished.",
        "The focus of attention had also very much shifted to the implementation details of both the CSPP and the second series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO II).",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Global indicators continued to suggest subdued global growth.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had increased to 51.3 in March, from 50.8 in February, although its average for the first quarter of 2016 had declined to 51.6, compared with 53.1 in the fourth quarter of 2015.",
        "The decline had been more marked in services than in the manufacturing sector, suggesting – at least based on survey indicators – that weakness was spreading from already weak manufacturing into the services sector, especially in the advanced economies.",
        "While not necessarily implying a generalised weakening in economic activity, these developments deserved close monitoring.",
        "Global trade in goods had remained modest early in 2016.",
        "Although growth in the volume of world imports of goods maintained momentum, rising by 1.2% in three-month-on-three-month terms in January, after 1.5% in December, the PMI for new export orders in March had fallen from 50.9 in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 49.8 in the first quarter of 2016.",
        "Global inflation remained low.",
        "For the OECD area, annual consumer price inflation had declined to 1.0% in February, after 1.2% in January.",
        "Excluding food and energy, inflation had remained unchanged at 1.9%.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s meeting on 9-10 March, commodity prices had risen, with Brent crude oil prices up by 6.5% to around USD 42 per barrel and non-oil commodity prices up by 2.5% in US dollar terms, while the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro had appreciated by 0.4% vis-à-vis 38 major trading partners.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, incoming hard data since the Governing Council’s 9-10 March meeting had been positive, with industrial production including construction and industrial production excluding construction 1.8% and 1.1%, respectively, above their average levels for the fourth quarter of 2015.",
        "At the same time, the Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) and the composite output PMI had declined from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2016.",
        "Looking into recent developments from a broader business cycle perspective, the ongoing economic recovery of the euro area remained predominantly driven by domestic demand, while net trade had contributed negatively to real GDP growth in the last two quarters of 2015.",
        "This was different from the previous, short-lived recovery from the second quarter of 2009 to the third quarter of 2011, when real GDP growth had been mainly driven by changes in inventories and net exports.",
        "The euro area net lending position, as a percentage of nominal GDP, had continued to increase over the last year and a half, despite the strong recovery in domestic demand.",
        "This had also been reflected in the increase in the euro area current account surplus since mid-2014, which could be mainly explained by the drop in oil prices.",
        "The increased contribution of non-financial corporations (NFCs) to the euro area total net lending position – which had reached a historical high – indicated that firms had been retaining windfall gains from lower energy prices, rather than investing them or distributing them to shareholders.",
        "Annual growth in households’ real disposable income had decelerated slightly to 1.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with 1.6% in the third quarter.",
        "Over the same period, consumption growth had slowed from 1.8% to 1.5%, partly due to temporary factors, while the savings rate had remained broadly unchanged.",
        "As regards investment, the stronger dynamics of the fourth quarter of 2015 had been driven by both construction and non-construction investment, with construction having benefited from the mild winter.",
        "Recent developments in the savings rate suggested that consumers had spent the windfall gains from lower energy prices without delay, resulting in a direct upward impact on consumption.",
        "The muted response of the savings rate possibly reflected the fact that consumers assessed the drop in oil prices as more persistent in nature.",
        "The domestic nature of the ongoing recovery was also reflected in further improving labour markets.",
        "Employment in the euro area had risen by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2015.",
        "As a result, employment stood 1.2% higher than a year ago – the highest annual increase since the second quarter of 2008.",
        "The unemployment rate, which had been declining since mid-2013, had stood at 10.3% in February 2016.",
        "Despite these improvements, labour market rigidities persisted and unemployment remained very high from a historical perspective.",
        "Retail sales to February and new passenger car registrations to March pointed to a pick-up in private consumption growth in the first quarter of 2016.",
        "While retail sales in January and February stood, on average, 0.8% above their average for the fourth quarter of 2015, new passenger car registrations rose, quarter on quarter, by 3.0% in the first quarter of 2016.",
        "At the same time, survey data for consumption had been on a declining trend since the second half of 2015, with a number of factors, such as the more recent rebound in oil prices, the refugee influx and the recent terrorist attacks, at work.",
        "Annual growth in real residential housing investment in the euro area had displayed a cyclical upswing since the beginning of 2013, as also reflected in an increase in building permits and production, although it still remained some 20% below 2007 pre-crisis levels.",
        "The non-financial quarterly sector accounts data indicated that euro area profits were on a recovery path.",
        "The ratio of net operating surplus to value added had increased further in the fourth quarter of 2015.",
        "NFCs’ retained earnings to value added had also significantly increased.",
        "The year-on-year growth of nominal NFCs’ gross fixed capital formation had accelerated to 5.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015, from 3.8% in the third quarter.",
        "Looking at overall investment, the recovery had been mainly driven by the non-construction sector, with rising capacity utilisation among the supportive factors.",
        "Looking ahead, non-construction investment should further benefit from the positive domestic demand dynamics, the continued accommodative monetary policy stance and improving financing conditions, while continued deleveraging needs, still low profit levels and institutional rigidities were expected to weigh negatively.",
        "Compared with recent forecasts from other institutions and the private sector, the March 2016 staff projections for euro area real GDP growth were at the lower end of the range for 2016.",
        "For 2017, the staff projections were comparable with other forecasts, while for 2018 they were at the upper end of the range.",
        "The IMF had just revised downwards its real GDP growth forecast for the euro area.",
        "For 2018, the latest IMF forecast was approximately 0.1 percentage point lower than the ECB staff projection for that year.",
        "According to the latest ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters, real GDP growth expectations had been revised down to 1.5% and 1.6% for 2016 and 2017 respectively, while they remained unchanged at 1.7% for 2018.",
        "Turning to price developments in the euro area, annual HICP inflation had increased from -0.2% in February 2016 to 0.0% in March, with the March figure having been revised upwards by 0.1 percentage point compared with the flash estimate.",
        "This increase in HICP inflation had been driven by an increase in the rates of the services and unprocessed food components.",
        "Over the same period, underlying inflation, as measured by the HICP excluding food and energy, had risen from 0.8% to 1.0%.",
        "Also taking into account seasonal factors, neither the annual rate of the HICP excluding food and energy – which had been hovering around 1.0% since summer 2015 – nor other measures of underlying inflation, showed clear signs as yet of a more dynamic upward development.",
        "Pipeline and import price pressures showed signs of renewed easing.",
        "Annual producer price inflation for domestic sales of non-food consumer goods, which had been unchanged at 0.2% from August to December 2015, had declined to 0.1% in January 2016 and further to -0.1% in February.",
        "Survey data for input and output prices to April also pointed to a continuation of subdued domestic price pressures at the producer level, particularly for the earlier stages of the production and pricing chain.",
        "At the same time, import price inflation for non-food consumer goods, which had so far been the main source of upward pipeline pressures, had decreased to 0.7% in February, down from 1.7% in January.",
        "Nominal wage growth had stabilised at a low level, with compensation per employee standing at 1.3% in both the third and fourth quarters of 2015.",
        "Wage growth had been subdued despite decreasing labour market slack.",
        "Looking deeper into the factors leading to low wage growth, weak productivity growth, low inflation and also the ongoing impact from labour market reforms implemented over the past few years appeared to be playing a role.",
        "The March staff projections for euro area HICP inflation in 2016 were lower than forecasts by private and international institutions.",
        "For 2017, the staff projections also remained at the lower end of the range, although the differences were more limited.",
        "For 2018, the ECB projections broadly stood in the middle of the range, although some institutional forecasters had yet to publish their forecasts at this horizon.",
        "The April Survey of Professional Forecasters, covering the second quarter of 2016, showed average inflation expectations of 0.3%, 1.3% and 1.6% for 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively.",
        "Looking at recent developments in long-term inflation expectations, market-based measures had broadly stabilised at low levels over the past few weeks, after some recovery in early March, while survey-based measures had been more stable.",
        "The April Survey of Professional Forecasters showed the average point forecast for inflation five years ahead at 1.8%, broadly unchanged from the previous round.",
        "All in all, financial market participants appeared to show little uncertainty that medium-term inflation would stay low, while deflation fears remained contained and visibly below the early-2015 peak.",
        "As regards financial and monetary conditions, the further flattening of the euro area yield curve since the early March meeting of the Governing Council had primarily reflected declines at the long end.",
        "In credit markets, risk premia had continued to decrease.",
        "Moreover, banks’ funding costs had declined further in the first quarter of 2016.",
        "Similarly, composite lending rates for NFCs had declined, to slightly below 2%, while composite lending rates for households for house purchase had remained broadly unchanged, at 2.2%.",
        "Turning to money and credit, annual growth in M3 had remained unchanged at 5.0% in February, supported by low opportunity costs and the impact of the asset purchase programme and targeted longer-term refinancing operations.",
        "M1 had remained the main contributor to growth in M3, although its annual growth rate had again moderated somewhat, easing to 10.3% in February.",
        "Euro area loan dynamics had continued to improve gradually in February, although growth rates had remained modest.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to NFCs (adjusted for sales and securitisation) had increased to 0.9% in February, after 0.6% in January.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households had increased to 1.6% in February, from 1.4% in January.",
        "The April 2016 bank lending survey for the euro area pointed to improving loan supply conditions for enterprises and improving loan demand across all loan categories.",
        "Credit standards had eased further for loans to enterprises and had returned to a net easing for consumer credit, while credit standards for housing loans had tightened in the first quarter of 2016.",
        "Moreover, banks had reported that the ECB’s negative deposit facility rate had had a positive impact on lending volumes while exerting a negative impact on banks’ net interest income and loan margins.",
        "With regard to fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was expected to be mildly expansionary in 2016 and 2017, before reverting to broadly neutral in 2018.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet recalled that, at the 9-10 March monetary policy meeting, the Governing Council had decided on a comprehensive package of measures to ease financing conditions, stimulate new credit provision and thereby reinforce the momentum of the euro area’s economic recovery and accelerate the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "Since then, broad financing conditions had improved, also in the context of receding risk aversion at the global level.",
        "The recent measures had been instrumental in avoiding adverse effects from the financial turbulences observed earlier this year on the pass-through of the ECB’s accommodative stance.",
        "The transmission of the monetary policy stimulus to firms and households, notably through the banking system, was strengthening further.",
        "Also, as the new measures were implemented, they would deliver additional accommodation.",
        "Incoming data on the economy pointed to ongoing output growth at a moderate, but steady, pace.",
        "However, risks to the growth outlook were still tilted to the downside, while having moderated somewhat.",
        "At the same time, HICP inflation remained subdued and was set to persist at low levels for the coming months before gradually picking up, initially due to base effects but later supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery.",
        "Against this background, there was no need to change the monetary policy stance decided at the last monetary policy meeting, while it was important to focus on the implementation of policy measures.",
        "Looking forward, and cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis, it was essential to preserve an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation for as long as needed, reiterating the forward guidance on interest rates and the APP.",
        "It was also important to reiterate that the Governing Council would continue to monitor closely the evolution of the outlook for price stability and, if warranted to achieve its objective, act using all the instruments available within its mandate.",
        "Finally, it needed to be emphasised further that, to reap the full benefits from the monetary policy measures, other policy areas had to contribute decisively and in a timely manner.",
        "Mr Cœuré complemented Mr Praet’s introduction with remarks on the operational parameters of the CSPP to be decided by the Governing Council, with a view to ensuring that the Eurosystem would be able to start the purchases before the end of the second quarter of 2016, i.e.",
        "CSPP purchases would be conducted both in the secondary market and in the primary market, except purchases of debt securities of public undertakings for which, by virtue of the provisions of Article 123 of the Treaty, primary market purchases were not allowed.",
        "Purchases of bonds issued by public companies would be subject to additional safeguards, in addition to the prohibition of primary market purchases, in a manner consistent with the practice followed under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP).",
        "The eligible counterparties would be those eligible for Eurosystem monetary policy operations and any other counterparty used by the Eurosystem for the investment of its euro-denominated portfolio, which was the rule applied for the other programmes under the APP.",
        "Securities issued by issuers residing in the euro area, including those with a parent company outside the euro area, would be eligible for CSPP purchases provided that they fulfilled the eligibility criteria.",
        "This broad approach was in line with the monetary policy objective of the CSPP, non-discriminatory and transparent, as well as being clear from a legal perspective and simple to implement.",
        "In terms of the sectoral definition, a relatively broad definition seemed to be appropriate, while excluding corporations that were credit institutions or had a parent company that was a credit institution, as well as asset management entities established to support financial sector restructuring and/or resolution.",
        "No minimum issue size would be applied, as a way to avoid distortions and ensure a level playing field across issuers and issues.",
        "A minimum maturity of six months would apply, curbing the magnitude of redemptions during the lifetime of the programme while having a limited impact on the eligible universe.",
        "A maximum maturity similar to that of the PSPP, i.e.",
        "30 years and 364 days, would be applied.",
        "As in other APP programmes, only purchases of securities with a yield to maturity exceeding the deposit facility rate prevailing at the time of purchase would be permissible.",
        "In line with the PSPP and CBPP3, the minimum first-best credit assessment would be set at credit quality step 3 provided by an accepted external credit assessment institution, i.e.",
        "An issue limit of 70% would, in principle, be set for the CSPP, like in the other programmes targeting private paper (i.e.",
        "the CBPP3 and the ABSPP).",
        "In the case of public sector entities eligible under the CSPP, these should be dealt with in a manner consistent with their treatment under the PSPP.",
        "A benchmark for guiding purchases would be defined at the issuer group level.",
        "It would be neutral in the sense that it would reflect proportionally all outstanding issues qualifying for the benchmark.",
        "This also implied that market capitalisation would provide a weighting for each of the jurisdictions of issuance within the benchmark.",
        "Issuer group limits would be based on the benchmark to ensure a diverse portfolio, while at the same time they would offer sufficient leeway to build up the portfolio.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, there was broad agreement among the members with the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area, as provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Euro area real GDP had expanded by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2015, supported by domestic demand, while being dampened by a slightly negative contribution from net exports.",
        "Recent incoming data for the first quarter of 2016 remained generally consistent with a continuation of the moderate economic recovery, although reference was made to evidence at the country level that pointed to somewhat stronger real GDP growth dynamics in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the March 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "Overall, the euro area had continued its moderate recovery.",
        "While risks to the growth outlook had moderated to some extent, they were assessed to still remain tilted to the downside.",
        "Recent monetary policy decisions by the Governing Council had improved broad financing conditions, which should support the outlook for consumption and investment.",
        "However, uncertainties persisted relating, in particular, to developments in the global economy and to geopolitical risks.",
        "Regarding the outlook and risks for the external environment, members exchanged views, taking into account the latest IMF World Economic Outlook which had been released after the March 2016 ECB staff projections.",
        "They took note that, in the latest IMF forecasts, growth prospects for the global economy in both 2016 and 2017 had been revised downwards compared with the update of the World Economic Outlook in January 2016, and that global trade growth, at 2.8%, was estimated to have been below global economic growth, at 3.1%, in 2015.",
        "The downward revision to global activity in the IMF’s forecasts was seen as a confirmation of the cautious view taken by the Governing Council in its previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "The latest IMF forecasts could also be seen as providing further support for the view that one of the main challenges facing advanced economies was to increase productivity.",
        "At the same time, the IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook could be considered rather pessimistic, since members saw some more positive features in the global environment, in particular the waning of the recent bout of turbulence in financial markets.",
        "Moreover, it had to be borne in mind that the economic situation varied significantly across advanced economies, with some recording close to full employment.",
        "Commenting further on the global risks discussed during the IMF annual meetings in Washington, reference was made to: a possibly stronger slowdown in emerging market economies, including China; the potential return of financial market turmoil; the risk that persistently slow growth would lead to weaker potential growth via hysteresis effects; and geopolitical risks at both the regional and the global level.",
        "Turning to the euro area, members concurred with the view that the economic recovery was ongoing.",
        "Growth dynamics were seen to be supported by the monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financing conditions, improvements in employment growth and the still relatively low price of oil, which supported consumption.",
        "Moreover, it was observed that, if growth for the first quarter of this year were to materialise in line with expectations, this would constitute the twelfth consecutive quarter of positive economic growth for the euro area and the seventh quarter in a row of growth above potential.",
        "As a consequence, the output gap was closing, albeit only very gradually.",
        "Such a slow speed of adjustment was not unusual in the context of a balance sheet recession, which implied some “leakage” in the virtuous circle that normally took place between income and consumption growth.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the updated IMF forecasts for growth in the euro area had been revised downwards, notwithstanding the inclusion of the latest monetary policy package announced in March 2016.",
        "In addition, some concern was expressed that the EuroCOIN indicator, which was often cited as a useful cyclical indicator of growth in the euro area, had in March seen its sharpest fall in over three years.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment of the outlook and risks presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Annual euro area headline inflation was reported by Eurostat to be 0.0% in March 2016, compared with -0.2% in the previous month.",
        "Thus, HICP inflation developments continued to be subdued.",
        "The improvement in headline inflation in March was mainly due to higher services price inflation.",
        "However, it had to be borne in mind that the rebound in services price inflation, from 0.9% in February to 1.4% in March, had been largely due to travel-related items, such as package holidays and accommodation services, as well as transport-related items, such as air transport, which were influenced by the timing of the Easter holidays.",
        "The annual rate of HICP inflation excluding food and energy had also increased, to 1.0%, from 0.8% in February.",
        "Looking ahead, on the basis of current oil futures prices, headline inflation was expected to return to negative territory in the next few months, before rising in the latter part of the year as a result of the upward impact of base effects together with assumed increases in oil prices, as embedded in the futures curve.",
        "In 2017-18 inflation was expected to pick up further, in line with the projected economic recovery and supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "Members also discussed recent developments in inflation expectations.",
        "It was noted that the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead currently stood at around 1.4% and that the latest round of the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters indicated that average longer-term inflation expectations remained at 1.8%, unchanged from the previous round.",
        "It was considered worrisome that, despite the stabilisation in oil prices, market-based inflation expectations had not picked up from their low levels.",
        "It appeared that there had been some decoupling of inflation expectations from oil price developments following the earlier correlation during the period when oil prices had fallen.",
        "While, in principle, a decoupling of inflation expectations from oil price developments was welcome, in the current context this was a matter of concern, as longer-term inflation expectations were not recovering in parallel with higher oil prices.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that expectations of future oil price increases and their contribution to HICP inflation could have fallen below past averages, which might in part explain the continued low level of market-based inflation expectations.",
        "In that regard, structural changes in the supply of oil, such as increased shale oil and gas production and Iran’s return to the market, could imply that low oil prices would, in the future, be a more persistent feature of inflation dynamics.",
        "On the other hand, geopolitical risks might have an impact on raw material and commodity prices, alongside other factors determining headline inflation in the next year or so.",
        "Members then reviewed recent developments in wage growth, which had stabilised at low levels, with growth in compensation per employee below 1.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015.",
        "On the one hand, this was seen as a possible indication of the prevailing risk of second-round effects, whereby low headline inflation might already have started to feed into core inflation via lower wage growth.",
        "On the other hand, however, it was noted that conclusive evidence was lacking and more analysis would be needed to assess whether second-round effects were present.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement that, while euro area inflation was expected to pick up, it was crucial to ensure that the very low inflation environment did not become entrenched via second-round effects on wage and price setting.",
        "Therefore, the Governing Council would continue to monitor closely the evolution of the outlook for price stability.",
        "Following the discussion of the economic outlook for growth and prices, a broader discussion took place on issues related to the interaction of various policy domains in the euro area, also in view of the low estimates for potential output in the euro area, weak productivity growth, still high unemployment and subdued business investment.",
        "Reference was made to various policy initiatives to increase public and private investment and to the role of the central bank in addressing and communicating on structural reforms in particular.",
        "Members strongly reiterated the need for other policy areas to contribute much more decisively, both at the national and the European levels, in order to reap the full benefits from the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "This echoed recent discussions at the European and global levels referring, inter alia, to the “three-pronged approach” proposed by the IMF in its World Economic Outlook.",
        "In particular, members judged that action to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, was vital to increase investment and boost job creation.",
        "The swift and effective implementation of structural reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, not only would lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area, but also would make the euro area more resilient to global shocks.",
        "As regards the role of monetary policy, it was important to recall that longer-term potential growth and structural unemployment were mainly determined by real factors, such as productivity and growth in the labour force.",
        "However, it was observed that monetary policy could help by supporting a swift cyclical recovery towards production potential, thereby avoiding a deterioration in the quality of labour that was generally associated with longer spells of unemployment.",
        "Likewise, higher investment, supported by monetary policy during the phase of cyclical recovery, could bolster the economy-wide capital stock, thereby increasing productive capacity.",
        "While there was no doubt that the structural policies set by governments ultimately had a key role to play in determining growth in the long run, and that the ECB was making a major contribution in the shorter run through its very accommodative monetary policy stance, the question was how to communicate most effectively about structural reforms from a monetary policy perspective.",
        "Generally, it was agreed that giving structural reform recommendations might prove challenging, as structural reform needs differed widely across euro area countries and it was not necessarily possible to generalise at the euro area aggregate level.",
        "Moreover, it was recalled that there were already country-specific recommendations in the context of the European Semester.",
        "Thus, a procedure already existed whereby the European Commission was responsible for supporting the coordination of economic policies in the euro area and, more broadly, in the European Union.",
        "It was to be regretted that these very detailed, country-specific recommendations were not being sufficiently followed up and implemented.",
        "That said, it also had to be acknowledged that there had been some progress in implementing structural reforms in the euro area.",
        "Many countries had implemented labour market reforms, although product market reforms did not seem to have kept pace.",
        "More product market reforms could be considered the highest priority at the current juncture.",
        "Overall, while it was considered useful for the ECB to discuss matters further and to focus on the adverse consequences for the euro area of a lack of reforms, establishing a detailed country-specific agenda was in the realm of national governments and other European institutions.",
        "When discussing structural reforms, the Governing Council would take a clear monetary policy perspective, assessing the impact of pending structural reforms and the environment in which the ECB conducted monetary policy.",
        "First and foremost, this entailed an assessment of the extent to which structural reforms affected developments in inflation, most notably with respect to their short and long-run effects, including possibly persistent disinflationary effects arising from too slow an implementation of structural reforms.",
        "Moreover, an assessment was needed of how, and to what extent, structural reforms would support convergence among euro area countries and improve risk-sharing for markets.",
        "In that context, it was recognised that major deficiencies remained at the European level.",
        "In focusing on EU priorities, the completion of the banking union was mentioned, as was the importance of fostering the capital markets union.",
        "In addition, completing the single market for services and establishing a common market for digital goods and services were also highlighted as areas which would have a positive impact on growth.",
        "It was suggested that the Five Presidents’ Report, “Completing Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union”, should be supported with greater resolve.",
        "In that respect, quantitative analysis that underlined the cost of an incomplete economic and monetary union in terms of welfare and employment would be useful.",
        "It was also pointed out that the ECB had its own responsibilities as regards the euro area banking sector following the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism in 2014.",
        "Finally, turning to fiscal policies, members highlighted the need to remain in compliance with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact in order to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework, while at the same time supporting the economic recovery.",
        "It was recalled that countries should strive for a more growth‑friendly composition of fiscal policies, including the reduction of the tax burden on households and firms, and should lower current government expenditure and increase the share of public investment within overall government expenditure.",
        "Moreover, fiscal space should be used where appropriate.",
        "It was suggested that more use should be made of incentives to stimulate investment and of programmes at the EU level.",
        "While it would be desirable to see results from the European Commission’s investment plan come to fruition quickly, the comment was also made that the plan might not go far enough.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) had continued to grow at a robust pace.",
        "Some encouraging signals were seen to come from recent data on credit growth and the evidence from the euro area bank lending survey.",
        "The bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2016 indicated further improvements in loan supply conditions for enterprises and in loan demand across all loan categories.",
        "Overall, the monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 had clearly improved borrowing conditions for firms and households, as well as credit flows across the euro area.",
        "In assessing credit developments, attention was drawn to the sizeable net lending position of non-financial corporations, which, taken together with subdued investment activity and strong retained earnings, suggested that credit demand by firms could remain weak.",
        "A call was made to continue analytical work on the state of the banking sector, including on remaining needs for balance sheet repair and for changes in business models, given that banks were a key vehicle for the effective transmission of monetary policy in the euro area.",
        "It was also underlined that the degree of leverage in the banking sector reflected high debt levels in the private and public non-financial sectors in some countries.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Based on incoming information, the ongoing moderate recovery could be expected to proceed, with domestic demand, in particular, continuing to be supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "At the same time, the risks to the euro area growth outlook still remained tilted to the downside.",
        "Inflation dynamics remained weak and annual HICP inflation could turn negative again in the coming months, before picking up in the second half of 2016 and recovering further in 2017 and 2018, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery.",
        "It was underlined that recent inflation figures remained very weak and vindicated the recent monetary policy decisions by the Governing Council.",
        "While inflation expectations had stabilised somewhat and financial market turbulence had receded, market-based measures of long-term inflation expectations remained at levels not far from the historical lows observed at the beginning of 2015.",
        "In such an environment, it was felt important for monetary policy to counter strongly any emergence of second-round effects in price and wage setting.",
        "There was broad agreement that the ECB’s monetary policy measures were being effective and that there were grounds for cautious optimism about the economy, as outlined by Mr Praet in his introduction, but that patience was needed for the measures to fully unfold over time in terms of output and inflation.",
        "It was highlighted that the monetary stimulus introduced since mid-2014 had led to a significant and broad-based easing in borrowing conditions for the economy as a whole.",
        "Further improvements in financing conditions had been seen following the adoption of the comprehensive measures at the early-March monetary policy meeting.",
        "In addition, the pass-through of the monetary policy stimulus appeared to be strengthening, notably through the banking system.",
        "The focus should now be on the implementation of the latest set of decisions, including the new series of TLTROs and the CSPP, which were geared towards enhancing monetary transmission by supporting credit creation and further strengthening the pass-through of the Eurosystem’s asset purchases to financing conditions in the real economy.",
        "It needed to be recalled that it was not just the announcement effects that had an impact, but also the implementation phase, which had not yet begun in the case of these latest measures.",
        "Hence, further monetary policy stimulus was still in the pipeline, notably from the CSPP and TLTRO II, which were set to start in June 2016.",
        "There was general agreement that there was a need to counter the perception that monetary policy could no longer contribute to a return of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim of below, but close to, 2%.",
        "In this context, counterfactual scenarios deserved emphasis, i.e.",
        "pointing out how the euro area economy would have fared had the ECB not acted.",
        "Monetary policy was geared towards achieving price stability over the medium term and remained effective via a number of channels, including asset purchases and negative interest rates.",
        "With respect to the time horizon needed for HICP inflation rates to return to levels below, but close to, 2%, it was recalled that the ECB’s monetary policy strategy, for good reasons, had not specified a precise definition of the medium term, as the policy horizon depended on the nature of the shocks affecting the economy and the length of the de facto variable transmission lags of monetary policy.",
        "In particular, the medium-term horizon should not be equated to the horizon of the staff projections, as outside observers sometimes appeared to do when characterising the Governing Council’s reaction function.",
        "In this regard, great care was needed when framing the Governing Council’s reaction function, also in the context of forward guidance, to avoid conveying the sense that monetary policy was mechanically focused on a specific time horizon.",
        "At the same time, taking into account the nature of shocks and transmission lags in the Governing Council’s medium-term orientation was not to be misunderstood as a way of postponing the required return of inflation to levels in line with the objective.",
        "On the contrary, it was felt that strongly reiterating the Governing Council’s commitment to bring inflation back to target without undue delay and sticking to its forward guidance was essential to anchor expectations and support effective monetary transmission.",
        "This was all the more important as inflation had been below the Governing Council’s inflation aim for a period of three years, which had raised issues regarding the notion of the medium term by outside observers.",
        "It was therefore underlined that it was essential not to leave any room for doubt about the Governing Council’s commitment to secure a return of the inflation rate towards its medium-term aim without undue delay.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement to reaffirm, following the proposal by Mr Praet in his introduction, the Governing Council’s forward guidance on both policy rates and the APP.",
        "This implied conducting asset purchases under the APP until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "Moreover, the Governing Council continued to expect policy rates to remain at their present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.",
        "Finally, it was underlined that the Governing Council was unanimous in its commitment to deliver on its mandate and on the appropriateness of an expansionary monetary policy stance.",
        "In the light of recent public criticism that had appeared to link the ECB’s decisions to developments in the political sphere in a Member State, it was viewed as important to reaffirm collectively the independence of the ECB in the pursuit of its mandate.",
        "Regarding the operational parameters governing the CSPP, broad support was expressed for the Executive Board proposal presented by Mr Cœuré.",
        "It was recalled that the inclusion of corporate bonds in the APP, as decided by the Governing Council on 10 March 2016, was intended to provide more direct support for the financing of the real economy.",
        "This called for a flexible and pragmatic approach to ensure efficiency and effectiveness when addressing implementation issues.",
        "At the same time, caution was advised with respect to a number of parameters in order to achieve an appropriate balance between the intended positive effects of the programme on activity and inflation and the reduction of relevant legal, economic, operational and reputational risks.",
        "On the main features governing the operational framework of the CSPP, it was underlined that the programme had a euro area-wide focus and was subject to full income and loss sharing.",
        "Turning to the parameters governing the geographical and sectoral scope of the CSPP, it was also argued that the effectiveness of the CSPP should not be gauged by the size of purchases per se but depended on the targeted transmission channels aimed at supporting credit to the real economy.",
        "It was stressed that the inclusion of resident corporate issuers with non-euro area parent companies would often allow companies with significant real economy presence and investment in the euro area to benefit from the programme, while the CSPP would in any case be transmitted across corporate bond markets, including non-resident issuers, via portfolio balance effects.",
        "With respect to eligible residual maturities, some remarks were made that the proposed upper limit of above 30 years seemed to be on the long side.",
        "However, overall, a preference for retaining long maturities was nonetheless expressed to avoid a weakening of the transmission impact, given the longer average duration of the bonds that would be excluded.",
        "Moreover, the potential for increased issuance at longer durations should also be taken into account.",
        "With respect to other risk control parameters for the CSPP, after an exchange of views on the relative merits of different limits, an overall preference for retaining the proposed issue share limit of 70% was expressed, consistent with the other private sector purchase programmes under the APP and the broad scope of the programme.",
        "Against this overall background, and taking into account the views expressed by the members of the Governing Council, the President concluded that the Governing Council had decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the focus was now on the implementation of the additional measures that had been decided on 10 March 2016.",
        "The main technical parameters of the CSPP were adopted by the Governing Council and scheduled for publication in a press release.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed recent financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 22 October in Malta, markets had mainly focused on the prospect of increased policy divergence between the Federal Reserve System and the ECB, as illustrated by several indicators; for instance, the spread between the euro and US dollar one-year forward overnight index swap (OIS) rates one year ahead had reached 140 basis points, a seven-year high.",
        "Furthermore, there had been a downward shift in the option-implied probabilities for the EUR/USD exchange rate for the end of the first quarter of 2016 following the Governing Council’s 22 October meeting.",
        "The shift in these option-implied probabilities also suggested that a further easing by the ECB had been priced into interest rate markets.",
        "In the very short term, however, the market had priced in the risk of a significant reversal of the recent sharp depreciation of the euro against the US dollar, if the ECB or the Federal Reserve were to act differently from prevailing market expectations.",
        "This risk was illustrated by the absolute level of one-month implied volatility for the EUR/USD exchange rate, which, at the end of November, was near its highest level since 2011.",
        "In the United States, market expectations of an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve in December 2015 had been reinforced following the October statement by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), along with subsequent remarks by FOMC members and a strong US labour market report for October.",
        "Moreover, the focus of analysts had already shifted to the expected path of the federal funds rate after an initial increase.",
        "While communication by Federal Reserve officials suggested a gradual path, the market – as indicated by the federal funds futures-implied curve – was pricing in a slower pace of rate increases by comparison with the path currently projected by FOMC members and with that observed in previous rate hike cycles.",
        "In the euro area, the EONIA forward curve had fully priced in a 10 basis point cut in the deposit facility rate at the current Governing Council meeting and an additional cut of 10 basis points (to -0.40%) by September 2016.",
        "While the 12-month EURIBOR remained positive, the six-month rate had now fallen into negative territory.",
        "The EURIBOR futures curve had priced in further declines in euro money market rates, with the three-month rate expected to reach its lowest level, at -28 basis points, in September 2016.",
        "In the euro area bond markets, government bond yields had declined since the previous Governing Council meeting.",
        "The German two-year benchmark government bond yield was now trading slightly below -40 basis points, around 20 basis points below the level before the Governing Council meeting on 22 October 2015.",
        "Meanwhile, ten-year German government bond yields had fallen by only 12 basis points, from 57 basis points to 45 basis points.",
        "According to some analysts, the steepening of the yield curve indicated that expectations of a deposit facility rate cut outweighed those of an enlarged asset purchase programme (APP).",
        "A second possible explanation was that some investors appeared reluctant to engage in purchases of longer-dated bonds at current low yields.",
        "Some market participants considered that the relationship between market-implied future inflation rates and current energy prices, displayed over previous months, might have loosened.",
        "Since early October, there had been an increase in the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, despite continued declines in fuel prices.",
        "This new feature suggested that market participants were recalibrating their longer-term inflation expectations in view of the expected monetary easing by the ECB.",
        "With regard to the execution of the APP, market liquidity had remained broadly steady, although some deterioration had been reported in certain market segments, such as agency bonds and covered bonds.",
        "No declining trend was observed in the trading volumes of German government bond futures, which, despite a brief dip at the end of November, had remained reasonably steady.",
        "In view of the expected decline in market liquidity around the year-end, there had been a frontloading of asset purchases since September 2015 to allow for lower purchases in December 2015.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "The world economy continued to recover at a moderate though uneven pace.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had risen slightly to 53.4 in October, from 52.8 in September.",
        "Global trade seemed to have stabilised at low levels, following weak data in the first half of 2015.",
        "The volume of world imports of goods had increased by 1.6%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2015, from -1.1% in the second quarter.",
        "At the same time, the global PMI for new export orders had declined slightly to 51.0 in November, from 51.2 in October.",
        "Global inflation had remained moderate.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area had risen to 0.6% in October, from 0.4% in September.",
        "Excluding food and energy, OECD inflation had been unchanged at 1.8%.",
        "Since the 22 October meeting of the Governing Council, Brent crude oil prices had fallen by 9% to USD 45 per barrel.",
        "Analysis of the recent behaviour of oil prices, taking into account the drivers of supply and demand as well as record global inventories, suggested that lower oil prices could prevail for a longer period of time.",
        "Non-energy commodity prices had weakened by 6% in US dollar terms, on the back of lower prices for industrial raw materials.",
        "Over the same period, the euro exchange rate had depreciated by 4% in nominal effective terms vis-à-vis the currencies of 38 major trading partners.",
        "Turning to the euro area, real GDP had increased, quarter on quarter, by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2015.",
        "While no breakdown was available as yet, existing information pointed to a continued positive contribution from domestic demand, with private consumption growth as the main driver.",
        "Industrial production (excluding construction) had declined further in September, by 0.3% month on month.",
        "By contrast, the Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) and the composite output PMI had improved in October.",
        "In November, the PMI had also improved further, while the ESI had remained unchanged.",
        "Looking ahead, private consumption should remain the key driver of the economic recovery, on the back of higher disposable income growth, while investment growth should also gain momentum, in line with available survey-based information.",
        "Labour market conditions had continued to improve gradually.",
        "Employment had risen by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2015.",
        "The unemployment rate had declined further to 10.7% in October, around 1½ percentage points below its 12.1% peak in May 2013.",
        "The December 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections expected euro area real GDP to grow by 1.5% in 2015, 1.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017.",
        "This was broadly unchanged from the September 2015 ECB staff projections.",
        "However, compared with the March 2015 projections, at the time when the expanded APP started to be implemented, real GDP growth had been revised down for both 2016 and 2017.",
        "Turning to price developments, euro area headline HICP inflation had stood at 0.1% in November, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from October, mainly owing to higher annual rates of change in the energy and, to a lesser extent, the processed food components, which had been offset by lower inflation in other components.",
        "Underlying inflation, as measured by the HICP excluding food and energy, had declined to 0.9% in November, from 1.1% in October.",
        "Import prices remained the main source of upward pipeline pressures, while domestic producer prices continued to be weak and nominal wages subdued.",
        "The December 2015 Eurosystem staff projections foresaw euro area annual HICP inflation at 0.1% in 2015, 1.0% in 2016 and 1.6% in 2017.",
        "In comparison with the September 2015 ECB staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised down slightly.",
        "Compared with forecasts by other international institutions and the private sector, the December 2015 projection for euro area HICP inflation remained at the higher end of the range for 2017, while for 2016 it was broadly in line with the forecasts of other international organisations.",
        "Risks to this outlook remained on the downside.",
        "Since the 22 October meeting, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had continued to increase.",
        "On 1 December, the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead stood at 1.8%, some 10 basis points higher than at the time of the Governing Council meeting of 22 October.",
        "The price of deflation protection, as derived from options, had decreased.",
        "Turning to financial and monetary conditions, the euro area yield curve had become somewhat steeper since the previous monetary policy meeting, with short-term EONIA forward rates declining to historical lows, while long-term rates had moved only a little.",
        "Moreover, the cost of external financing for non-financial corporations had decreased slightly in both October and November, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) had reported, on balance, an improvement in the availability of bank loans.",
        "According to the results of the latest survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE), which had been conducted between 21 September and 26 October 2015, euro area SMEs had become less concerned about access to finance as an impediment to their business compared with other factors relating to their business activity.",
        "Regarding money and credit, broad money growth was robust, supported by low interest rates as well as the impact of the APP and the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs).",
        "Annual M3 growth had increased to 5.3% in October, from 4.9% in September, mainly driven by strong M1 growth.",
        "The annual growth rate of MFI loans to the private sector (adjusted for sales and securitisation) had increased to 0.8% in October, from 0.4% in September.",
        "The gradual improvement in loan dynamics had been visible for both firms and households.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations had increased to 0.6%, up from 0.1% in September.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households had increased further to 1.2%, after 1.1% in September.",
        "These developments were supported by improvements in both credit supply and demand factors as well as by favourable bank financing conditions.",
        "According to the October 2015 bank lending survey, banks in the euro area had reported an overall neutral effect of the APP on their profitability, with capital gains offsetting the adverse impact of the flattening of the yield curve on net interest margins.",
        "Furthermore, the positive effects on credit quality due to the improvement of economic conditions related to the APP also needed to be taken into account.",
        "As regards fiscal policies, the government deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios, on average for the euro area, were expected to decline over the projection horizon, on account of the cyclical improvement in the euro area economy and declining interest expenditure.",
        "However, the euro area fiscal stance, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was currently expected to be mildly expansionary over 2015-16, partly owing to refugee-related government expenditure, before becoming broadly neutral again in 2017.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet recalled that, at its 22 October 2015 monetary policy meeting, the Governing Council had concluded that, in view of the persistence of weak price pressures and continued downside risks to growth and inflation, the degree of monetary policy accommodation would need to be re-examined in December.",
        "This assessment had shown that the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 had been critical in arresting a process of an unanchoring of inflation expectations and were an important factor supporting the economic recovery observed since then.",
        "At the same time, the December 2015 Eurosystem staff projections, which incorporated the favourable financial market developments following the 22 October Governing Council meeting, confirmed a moderate ongoing euro area recovery while indicating continuing weak price pressures, with slightly weaker inflation dynamics than previously expected, following downside revisions to both growth and inflation in earlier projection rounds.",
        "The most recent data had also confirmed earlier concerns that the adjustment of inflation to rates closer to 2% would take longer than envisaged in March 2015, when the expanded APP had been implemented.",
        "Moreover, while tail risks related to the international environment had receded, downside risks to both the growth and inflation outlook continued to prevail.",
        "Cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for a recalibration of the ECB’s monetary policy accommodation in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that were below, but close to, 2%.",
        "Against this background, a recalibration of the Governing Council’s monetary policy stance was warranted.",
        "Accordingly, the following measures could be foreseen: First, to cut the interest rate on the deposit facility by 10 basis points to -0.30%.",
        "This would further strengthen the effect of the APP by reinforcing the portfolio-rebalancing effects of the ongoing purchases, as the more negative returns on central bank deposits increased the incentives to buy other assets in place of the securities purchased by the Eurosystem.",
        "Second, to announce an extension of the intended horizon of the APP until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Third, to reinvest the principal payments on the securities purchased under the APP as they matured, for as long as necessary.",
        "This would contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "ECB staff and Eurosystem committees could be mandated to conduct related technical work.",
        "Fourth, to include euro-denominated marketable debt instruments issued by regional and local governments located in the euro area in the list of assets that were eligible for regular purchases.",
        "Finally, to indicate that a general review of the technical parameters of the APP could take place in spring 2016.",
        "Regarding external communication, the Governing Council could underline that these changes would ensure accommodative financial conditions and further strengthen the substantial easing impact of the measures taken since June 2014.",
        "They would also reinforce the momentum of the euro area’s economic recovery and strengthen its resilience against recent global economic shocks.",
        "The Governing Council could also reiterate that it would closely monitor the evolution in the outlook for price stability and, if warranted, was willing and able to act by using all the instruments available within its mandate in order to maintain an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "Furthermore, also in line with past communication, the Governing Council could recall that the APP provided sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting its size, composition and duration.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, there was broad agreement among the members with the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Recent data releases provided confirmation of the ongoing cyclical recovery in the euro area.",
        "Real GDP had continued to grow in the third quarter, while other incoming information, including the latest survey evidence available up to November 2015, remained consistent with a continued moderate economic recovery.",
        "The recovery was expected to proceed broadly in line with the somewhat weaker pace anticipated in the September 2015 ECB staff projections.",
        "This assessment was reflected in the outlook for growth in the December 2015 Eurosystem staff projections, which was broadly unchanged compared with the September 2015 projections.",
        "While there was more evidence that domestic demand in the euro area appeared to be relatively resilient, supported also by lower oil prices and a slightly looser fiscal stance, some further weakness had been evident in the international environment.",
        "In particular, the slowdown in activity in emerging market economies was weighing on global growth and trade, leading to lower growth in foreign demand for euro area exports.",
        "Regarding the external environment, it was stressed that the December 2015 projections had incorporated a further downward revision to global activity and trade, thereby continuing a sequence of downward revisions to the outlook for the external environment, which also underlined the importance for euro area exports of developments in emerging market economies.",
        "There was broad agreement that the outlook for the external environment continued to be uncertain and subject to downside risks, largely related to vulnerabilities in emerging markets.",
        "At the same time, it was mentioned that some indicators in the latest data suggested that the slowdown in emerging market economies was bottoming out and that world trade was starting to improve.",
        "Earlier concerns about developments in China in particular, following the stock market fall in August 2015, had not been borne out.",
        "Thus, a case could be made that the balance of risks had not deteriorated and had perhaps even become less negative.",
        "However, it was also argued that, even if the downside risk of developments in China was no longer considered to be acute, downside risks related to emerging markets more generally still needed to be taken seriously, both from a more medium-term perspective of the global financial and credit cycle and also in view of the vulnerability of some countries to increasing interest rates in the United States and related spillovers.",
        "All in all, external risks were therefore assessed to remain on the downside, and it was seen as necessary to continue to carefully monitor developments outside the euro area, including geopolitical risks with repercussions for the euro area.",
        "Members generally concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction that, while the moderate recovery in the euro area economy was expected to continue, the risks to the growth outlook were seen as remaining on the downside, in particular stemming from the external environment and broader geopolitical risks.",
        "These risks had the potential to weigh on global growth and foreign demand for euro area exports and on confidence more widely.",
        "It was underlined that the ongoing recovery in the euro area economy remained fragile as well as moderate.",
        "Although the December 2015 Eurosystem staff projections were broadly in line with those of the September exercise, it also had to be kept in mind that the technical assumptions that underpinned the December projections had been positively influenced by favourable financial market developments since the 22 October meeting of the Governing Council, which were in turn related to expectations of further monetary policy measures by the ECB.",
        "However, it was also mentioned that, apart from expectations regarding monetary policy in the euro area, the projections were also influenced by the anticipation of monetary policy tightening in the United States, as well as other exogenous variables.",
        "Overall, it was difficult to disentangle the effects of these different factors.",
        "It was also remarked that the Governing Council’s assessment had been evolving over a number of monetary policy meetings.",
        "Notably, the communication after the October monetary policy meeting had been motivated by the view that the outlook embedded in the ECB staff projections in September was already disappointing.",
        "Moreover, the recovery in the euro area was expected to be weaker than anticipated earlier in the year, in particular when compared with the March 2015 ECB staff projections, which had been the first to incorporate the impact of the monetary policy measures announced in January 2015.",
        "Members also referred to the large amount of slack that was estimated to remain in the euro area economy.",
        "The December 2015 Eurosystem staff projections pointed to the output gap not being fully closed over the projection horizon.",
        "They also indicated that the rate of unemployment would not fall below 10% even by the end of the projection horizon in 2017.",
        "Moreover, it was noted that – in contrast to consumption – investment remained very weak and had again disappointed recently, with the December projections showing a downward revision.",
        "This pointed to continued uncertainty and lack of confidence, which might be exacerbated by the ramifications of broader (geo)political risks both inside and outside the euro area.",
        "These risks were important because confidence was a key ingredient for growth, especially for business investment.",
        "The risk that business confidence might not improve in the coming months was thus a cause for concern.",
        "Some remarks were also made, however, which interpreted more positively the fact that the cyclical recovery was proceeding broadly in line with earlier expectations and that the December 2015 staff projections for activity were materially unchanged from those of September.",
        "This line of reasoning emphasised the resilience of euro area growth to weaknesses and uncertainty related to the external environment.",
        "Recent news, such as the latest surveys, was on balance either neutral or slightly positive, signalling confidence in the ongoing recovery despite worries about emerging market economies.",
        "In the third quarter of 2015 real GDP had recorded the tenth consecutive quarter of positive growth, with actual growth exceeding estimates of potential growth for the last five quarters.",
        "The recovery, although modest but still with growth rates above potential, remained intact.",
        "It was underpinned by lower oil prices and improvements in the labour market – both supporting disposable income – and by the lagged effects of the monetary policy measures taken in 2014 and 2015.",
        "Remaining impediments to more sustained growth, such as the ongoing adjustment processes and high levels of non-performing loans in a number of countries, required action in other policy domains, with an emphasis on structural measures to raise potential growth rates and on addressing the debt overhang and bank restructuring in some countries.",
        "Notwithstanding some differences in the business cycle assessment, there was broad agreement among members on the need for structural reforms and for action in other policy areas to support the economic recovery, also to avoid overburdening monetary policy.",
        "Monetary policy could not solve all of the problems holding back growth and unemployment in the euro area economy.",
        "There was an urgent need both for structural reforms by Member States and for institutional progress at the EU level.",
        "There was a risk that, amid other domestic priorities, the appetite for economic reform would diminish.",
        "Progress in structural reforms was also considered important for the banking sector.",
        "More generally, the point was made that the institutional and political framework of the euro area had so far not produced the kind of supply-side incentives that would be needed to spark private consumption and business investment in a significant way.",
        "In an exchange of views about fiscal policy, it was considered important to highlight the need to comply with the existing rules of the Stability and Growth Pact and to maintain fiscal goals and consolidation, while pursuing a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies.",
        "As a result of mistakes made in the past, there had been a failure to create the overall fiscal space that would be necessary at the current juncture to alleviate the burden on monetary policy.",
        "Further reflection was called for on the appropriate fiscal stance for individual Member States and for the euro area as a whole, bearing in mind the institutional setting, the disparity in cyclical positions and available fiscal space, as well as economic conditions and recent events, such as the large influx of refugees.",
        "Reference was also made in this context to the existence of large current account surpluses in some countries and to the importance of considering the influence of monetary policy on the fiscal stance in the Member States.",
        "With regard to price developments, members generally concurred with the assessment of the outlook and risks presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Annual euro area headline inflation was 0.1% in November 2015, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from the previous month, while the annual rate of HICP inflation excluding food and energy had fallen to 0.9%, 0.2 percentage point below the rate recorded in October.",
        "In the coming months, past volatility in oil prices would have a significant impact on energy prices and on overall inflation.",
        "In the short term, base effects linked to past developments in oil prices were expected to lead to an increase in headline inflation.",
        "Thereafter, energy-related base effects could lead to a renewed temporary decline in inflation in spring 2016 before inflation was expected to rise again.",
        "Owing to lower commodity prices and the past appreciation of the euro exchange rate, inflation was now expected to pick up more slowly than previously expected.",
        "This assessment was reflected in the December 2015 Eurosystem staff projections, in which the inflation outlook had been revised slightly down compared with the September ECB staff projections.",
        "Taking a longer perspective, the December 2015 projections also had to be compared with what had been expected in the March 2015 projection exercise, when the impact of the expanded APP had first been incorporated in the projection baseline.",
        "Compared with the March projections, inflation had been revised down by 0.5 percentage point for 2016 and by 0.2 percentage point for 2017.",
        "The latest staff projections thus constituted one of a series of downward revisions to the inflation outlook.",
        "Even if it was difficult to be precise, this downward revision would have been larger were it not for the fact that the December 2015 projections already incorporated some anticipated effects of monetary policy on interest rates and the exchange rate following the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 22 October.",
        "Attention was drawn, in particular, to the prospect that, according to the latest projections, it would take longer to reach the inflation aim than previously expected.",
        "In successive projection rounds, the time horizon over which staff expected inflation to reach a level close to 2% had been progressively pushed back.",
        "A further concern expressed by members was that downside risks to the outlook for inflation continued to prevail, in spite of the December 2015 projections having already incorporated financial market expectations of further measures.",
        "The prevalence of downside risks to inflation was supported by a number of arguments.",
        "First, it was noted that the December 2015 projections did not include the latest release of HICP inflation for November, which was lower than expected.",
        "Second, a downside risk to the pick-up in headline inflation to 1.6% in 2017 was seen to derive from the experience of previous projection errors; it was recalled that, since 2008, the inflation projections had often shown a rise in inflation that had subsequently failed to materialise.",
        "In this context, the possibility was mentioned that oil prices could turn out to be lower than expected.",
        "Third, an analysis of the risks to inflation based on a wide range of alternative specifications of the Phillips curve showed the mass of the distribution skewed to the downside.",
        "Fourth, measures of market-based inflation expectations were currently pointing to a rate of inflation of only around 1% in 2017, suggesting that markets doubted inflation would be close to the ECB’s inflation aim by then, even if it had to be taken into account that market-based measures were affected by risk and liquidity premia.",
        "Fifth, the longer inflation rates remained at low levels, the harder it would become for monetary policy to anchor inflation expectations.",
        "The longer inflation remained below the ECB’s inflation aim, the greater the challenge for monetary policy.",
        "At the same time, some remarks were made suggesting that there were encouraging developments in the inflation outlook that should not be overlooked, notably on the basis of measures of underlying inflation.",
        "It was pointed out that the December 2015 projections saw underlying inflation developing broadly in line with expectations in the September 2015 projections.",
        "Core inflation was now even a little stronger at the end of the projection horizon than in the September exercise.",
        "Moreover, despite the latest disappointment in Eurostat’s flash release for inflation in November, which extended also to the HICP excluding energy and food (following an upside surprise in the October release), the underlying inflation rate was nevertheless on the whole still creeping up gradually, and if this rate of increase were to be maintained over the coming year and a half, the underlying inflation rate would reach around 1.5%, which would be in line with its historical average.",
        "Some positive signs could also be observed with respect to the risk of deflation and the anchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "The argument was advanced that, as the cyclical recovery proceeded, the likelihood of extreme developments, such as outright deflation, diminished.",
        "This was supported by survey-based evidence on the distribution of inflation expectations.",
        "It was also remarked that, while market-based expectations for inflation were below the ECB’s inflation aim, this need not signal an unanchoring of expectations.",
        "It could also be due to the existence of negative and time-varying inflation risk premia, which could also explain the discrepancies between survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, which were stable at around 1.9%, and corresponding market-based measures, which were lower.",
        "This suggested that some caution was necessary in the interpretation of market-based measures of inflation expectations.",
        "Reservations were expressed, in particular about the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, given market focus on this specific measure for gauging ECB policy, which might in turn undermine its information content.",
        "It was also remarked that the sensitivity of inflation expectations to short-run inflation developments or to macroeconomic surprises had not significantly increased during the third quarter of 2015.",
        "Finally, it remained to be seen whether the impact of base effects on headline inflation in the next few months would have any consequences for market expectations of inflation.",
        "Overall, taking into account all views expressed, there was broad agreement that, while euro area inflation was expected to pick up, there had been a further deterioration in the outlook for inflation, so that the return to inflation rates below, but close to, 2% would likely take longer than previously expected.",
        "The risks surrounding the outlook for HICP inflation were also assessed, on balance, to remain on the downside.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction that money and credit dynamics had continued their recovery, supported by low returns on other assets and the monetary policy measures in place, in line with a gradually recovering economy and showing that monetary transmission was gaining traction.",
        "With regard to the impact of the APP on monetary aggregates, it was noted that the bulk of purchases to date seemed to have been from non-residents, suggesting that the impact on money creation within the euro area was muted while the exchange rate channel was relatively stronger.",
        "A remark was also made that in cases of low confidence among borrowers and lenders the interest elasticity of money demand tended to be very high, limiting the effectiveness of monetary transmission and calling for supplementary action in other policy domains.",
        "Loan dynamics had continued the gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014, with credit to both firms and households continuing to expand.",
        "This was supported by the prevailing accommodative monetary policy stance and the pass-through of the monetary policy measures in place since June 2014, which had contributed to favourable borrowing conditions and credit standards for firms and households.",
        "Credit supply constraints had receded on the part of banks.",
        "Reference was made to the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE) in the euro area, in which SMEs had signalled an improvement in the availability of external sources of finance and the willingness of banks to provide credit.",
        "This was also reflected in more favourable terms and conditions applied by banks when granting loans.",
        "Nonetheless, despite these improvements, bank lending developments continued to reflect still sluggish demand for credit, credit risk and a continued need for adjustments in financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, related in particular to still sizeable levels of non-performing loans.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members generally shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that the latest Eurosystem staff projections, which incorporated the favourable financial market developments following the previous monetary policy meeting in October, confirmed the moderate recovery, but still indicated continued downside risks to the inflation outlook and slightly weaker inflation dynamics than previously expected, also following the downward revisions in earlier projection exercises.",
        "Against this background, policy action was widely seen as warranted in order to recalibrate the monetary policy stance to support a return of inflation rates towards levels that were below, but close to, 2% and thereby to anchor medium-term inflation expectations.",
        "The set of proposed measures was widely seen to consolidate the prevailing accommodative financial conditions and add further to the substantial easing impact of the measures taken since June 2014 and, thereby, to reinforce the momentum of the euro area’s economic recovery and to strengthen its resilience against recent global economic shocks.",
        "In the context of the re-examination of the degree of monetary accommodation, there was broad agreement on the effectiveness of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014, which had had a significant easing impact on financing conditions and supported credit developments and the real economy.",
        "The monetary policy measures appeared to be gradually working their way through the transmission chain, as the pass-through to intermediate variables had been gaining traction.",
        "This was evidenced by the compression of very short-term interest rates due to increasing levels of excess liquidity, by improvements in financing conditions faced by firms – including SMEs – and households, as well as by favourable developments in money and credit.",
        "The impact of the measures was also visible in broader financial market variables, namely in bond and stock markets, where prices had risen since the introduction of the policy measures in June 2014, as well as in exchange rate developments.",
        "While more time was needed for the full pass-through of the policy measures, their impact was also already visible in final variables such as growth and inflation.",
        "The monetary policy stimulus that had been introduced was generally seen as a major factor behind the ongoing recovery and had helped to arrest further disinflation and stabilise inflation expectations.",
        "The view was widely shared that, in the presence of continued weak price pressures and a still moderate recovery, the prevailing degree of monetary accommodation was not sufficient to bring inflation back to levels below, but close to, 2%, over the medium term with sufficient confidence.",
        "It was recalled that, at the monetary policy meetings in early September and late October, the Governing Council had already expressed concerns about a slower increase in inflation rates and increased downside risks to both the growth and inflation outlook compared with earlier expectations in March 2015, when the APP had been launched.",
        "While, at the time, it had been concluded that it was premature to draw firm conclusions as to whether these developments would have a lasting impact on the medium-term price stability outlook and it had been agreed to re-examine the degree of monetary accommodation at the present meeting, the evidence accumulated since then indicated that inflation dynamics continued to be weaker than previously expected, with in particular sizeable economic slack and headwinds from the external environment still weighing on price pressures in an environment where inflation was close to zero and far from the Governing Council’s inflation aim.",
        "The December 2015 Eurosystem staff projections confirmed a somewhat weaker than expected continuation of the economic recovery and showed a further slowdown in the increase in inflation rates, constituting overall a sizeable revision of the inflation outlook compared with the outlook envisaged at the start of the APP, with continued downside risks.",
        "Against this background, most members were of the view that a recalibration of the prevailing monetary policy stance was warranted to secure the return of inflation rates to levels below, but close to, 2% and thereby to anchor medium-term inflation expectations.",
        "The renewed deterioration in the inflation outlook had further prolonged the period over which inflation remained distant from the ECB’s inflation aim and, hence, had further pushed back the horizon over which this was expected to be achieved.",
        "Reinforcing monetary policy at the current meeting was therefore warranted to firmly reassert the Governing Council’s forward guidance and its symmetric commitment to do what was necessary to achieve its price stability objective.",
        "It was also argued that at the current juncture the risk of policy inaction clearly outweighed the risk of action.",
        "In particular, a possible downward drift in inflation expectations could prove difficult to reverse and a lack of policy action at the current meeting could instil doubts about the Governing Council’s determination to implement the APP until a sustainable adjustment in the path of inflation was achieved.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that taking policy action was not to be misunderstood as being unduly influenced by prevailing market expectations.",
        "Instead, it was seen to be in line with recent communication by the Governing Council and with its reaction function in response to the inflation outlook.",
        "Some members did not see sufficient evidence in support of a recalibration of monetary policy at the current meeting, as proposed by Mr Praet, particularly when assessing the need for further accommodation on the basis of the incoming data, its potential effectiveness and its possible side effects.",
        "The balance of risks had not deteriorated materially compared with the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting in October and no marked shift in the inflation outlook was visible that would warrant urgent policy action.",
        "Recent data on sentiment, employment and unemployment had provided more positive than negative news, on the whole, pointing to a continued and resilient cyclical recovery.",
        "While inflation was indeed low and set to rise only gradually, indicators of underlying inflation were on a steady upward trend, while inflation expectations had stabilised.",
        "Against this background, it was argued that the existing policy measures were working in the right direction and more time should be given for them to unfold their full effect, considering the usual long and variable lags of monetary policy transmission which may not have been fully captured by the December 2015 Eurosystem staff projections, before adopting further monetary policy measures.",
        "While policy inaction carried the risk of disappointing market expectations, in part financial conditions also reflected expectations of policy tightening in the United States and care needed to be taken to avoid circularity between monetary policy actions and expectations by the market.",
        "A material further extension of asset purchases at the present time appeared premature and could be reconsidered at a later stage, allowing for additional analysis and assessment still well ahead of the currently intended end of the programme in September 2016.",
        "Some of these members also cautioned that the judgement on the need to act could not be separated from the nature of the remaining available instruments.",
        "In particular, purchases of sovereign debt, while considered to be a legitimate monetary policy tool, were seen to be associated with significant risks and side effects, and should therefore be kept in reserve as a contingency measure in case of extremely adverse developments, such as deflation, and should not be used as a means to fine-tune the inflation outlook.",
        "Therefore, the effectiveness of further monetary policy action had to be weighed against its potential costs and side effects.",
        "While the benefits of non-standard monetary policy action were seen to be subject to decreasing returns, this was not true for its side effects, including the impact on incentives for appropriate fiscal, financial and structural reforms.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that the decision to engage in asset purchases in January 2015 had been accompanied by a strong call for complementary action in other policy domains.",
        "It appeared that such policy support had so far not materialised sufficiently.",
        "In sum, most members supported the set of policy measures proposed by Mr Praet, while some members did not, on balance, see a sufficient case for further policy action or were only prepared to support some of the elements put forward.",
        "Among the latter, a few members expressed a preference, if further accommodation was seen as warranted, for limiting policy action at the current meeting to a cut in the deposit facility rate, possibly going beyond the 10 basis point reduction that had been proposed and possibly also including the prolongation of fixed rate full allotment tender procedures.",
        "As regards the instruments of further monetary policy action, most members agreed that the set of policy measures put forward by Mr Praet in his introduction constituted an appropriate recalibration of the degree of monetary policy accommodation needed to secure a return of inflation rates to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "The proposed set of policy measures was considered to be well balanced and, while at the lower end of market expectations, it was generally felt that the measures were adequately calibrated to achieve the ECB’s price stability objective.",
        "There was broad agreement that a further cut in the deposit facility rate by 10 basis points, to ‑0.30%, would provide a significant enhancement to the APP by reinforcing portfolio rebalancing effects, as lowering the rate further into negative territory, in conjunction with the ongoing increase in excess liquidity, should increase incentives to buy other assets in place of the securities purchased by the Eurosystem.",
        "A further cut could also support banks’ willingness to lend without causing any undue adverse impact on their lending margins.",
        "There was agreement to leave the interest rates on the marginal lending facility rate and on the main refinancing operations unchanged.",
        "A cut in the deposit facility rate of 10 basis points was seen as unlikely to trigger material negative side effects and was also seen as having the advantage of leaving some room for further downward adjustments, should the need arise.",
        "However, the further cut into negative territory would need to be accompanied by close monitoring of the transmission to financial markets, banks and the overall economy, also with regard to possible adverse effects on banks’ liquidity management and their demand for central bank reserves.",
        "Going beyond the proposed 10 basis point cut would, in the view of some members, raise issues about increasing side effects over time.",
        "In this context, the experience of other central banks in smaller jurisdictions would only partially apply.",
        "It would, in particular, raise issues regarding the profitability of banks and other financial institutions, whereby banks could try to recoup possible losses by increasing lending margins, leading to a tightening instead of a further easing in financing conditions – as well as issues regarding the implementation of the APP and the TLTROs.",
        "At the same time, some members expressed a preference for a 20 basis point cut in the deposit facility rate at the current meeting, mainly with a view to strengthening the easing impact of this measure and reflecting the view that, to date, no material negative side effects on bank margins and financial stability had emerged.",
        "With respect to the proposed extension of the APP, there was broad support for shifting the intended end date of the purchases from September 2016 to March 2017.",
        "This extension was regarded as an appropriate measure for additional monetary policy stimulus, as measures directly affecting the yield curve provided strong potential for monetary easing, when operating at the lower bound.",
        "Such an extension of the horizon of the APP would be firmly in line with the Governing Council’s forward guidance, as previous communication had made this horizon conditional on the achievement of a sustained adjustment in inflation consistent with its inflation aim, which, on the basis of the available evidence, was not in sight by the intended end date of September 2016.",
        "When extending the programme, it was viewed as important to retain both the calendar-based and contingency-based elements of forward guidance, which included not only extending the intended end date to March 2017 but also reaffirming that the Governing Council would continue to add monetary accommodation via continued purchases for as long as needed to achieve a sustained adjustment in inflation.",
        "The possibility was also raised of expanding the monthly volume of purchases or, alternatively, of frontloading purchases within the envisaged envelope so as to strengthen the impact in the short term.",
        "Moreover, the option was raised of extending the horizon beyond the suggested six months, so as to increase the overall volume of purchases above the level suggested by Mr Praet.",
        "However, there was broad agreement that such measures would not be warranted at this juncture, while a reassessment could be made in future.",
        "It was widely agreed to announce the reinvestment of the principal payments of the securities purchased under the APP as they matured, for as long as necessary, which was seen to contribute to favourable liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "This measure was taken without prejudice to the modalities for phasing out the programme, which was not warranted at present but needed to be considered at a later date.",
        "Announcing a reinvestment policy at the current meeting would provide an important element of forward guidance regarding the envisaged amount of purchases and the size of the APP portfolio in the future, whereby the bonds purchased under the APP would remain on the balance sheet of the Eurosystem and the size of the portfolio would be kept at the level that would be reached at the end of the programme for as long as the reinvestment policy was in place.",
        "There was also broad agreement on including regional and local government bonds in the list of assets eligible to be purchased by the national central bank of the country in which the respective regional or local government was located.",
        "It was felt that this measure would contribute to avoiding any possible strains on the availability of securities, especially in view of the extension of the programme beyond September 2016.",
        "The eligibility of these bonds would be subject to the usual credit rating floor foreseen for bond purchases.",
        "It was remarked that the implementation of this measure would not require a long lead time and the purchase of regional and local government bonds could start early in 2016 after the amendment of the relevant legal acts.",
        "It was envisaged that the Governing Council could review the technical parameters of the APP again in spring 2016, as had been suggested by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Finally, it was agreed to extend the fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment at least until the end of the last maintenance period in 2017, as a further element of forward guidance and in order to facilitate the implementation of the interest rate policies in conditions of abundant excess liquidity.",
        "A remark was made, however, that further extending the provision of full funding insurance to counterparties, which had already been in place for a protracted period, would further prolong the suspension of market discipline and contribute to preserving the status quo in the banking system.",
        "Turning to communication, there was wide agreement among the members that additional monetary policy measures were warranted, as the latest information had confirmed concerns raised in September 2015 that the adjustment in inflation to rates closer to 2% would take longer than had been envisaged in March 2015 and that downside risks to both growth and inflation continued to prevail.",
        "At the same time, it was viewed as important to recognise the ongoing improvements in the economic and monetary environment, which also argued against a more pronounced change in the course of monetary policy.",
        "The proposed set of policy measures would ensure appropriate monetary policy accommodation and further strengthen the substantial easing impact of the measures taken since June 2014, consistent with the achievement of price stability.",
        "It would thus reinforce the momentum of the euro area’s economic recovery and, ultimately, secure a return of inflation rates to levels that were below, but close to, 2% over the medium term and anchor inflation expectations accordingly.",
        "It was also felt that confidence needed to be placed in the effectiveness of the existing monetary policy measures.",
        "It needed to be stressed that the policy measures taken since June 2014 had shown a number of tangible benefits, most notably in terms of the cost and availability of credit for firms and households, supporting the recovery of growth and inflation in the euro area.",
        "However, the current degree of monetary accommodation, which had been calibrated on the macroeconomic conditions prevailing at the start of 2015, was overall judged insufficient in view of the deterioration in the outlook for inflation and the prevailing downside risks to the ECB’s price stability objective.",
        "There was broad agreement that communication needed to underline that the monetary policy measures taken were adequate at the current juncture.",
        "It also needed to be reaffirmed that the monetary policy stance would remain accommodative for as long as necessary to ensure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "The Governing Council would continue to closely monitor the evolution of the outlook for price stability and, if warranted, continued to be willing and able to act by using all the instruments available within its mandate in order to maintain an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "In particular, the Governing Council recalled that the APP provided sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting its size, composition and duration.",
        "Finally, a call was made to remind governments forcefully about their responsibility to contribute decisively to rebalancing the euro area economy and to supporting the euro area recovery with appropriate measures.",
        "The concern was raised that the euro area growth strategy relied excessively on accommodative monetary policy transmitted, inter alia, via the exchange rate channel.",
        "In this environment, it was viewed as important that fiscal policies should support the economic recovery where possible, while remaining in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.",
        "The swift and effective implementation of structural reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, would not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but would also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes and accelerate the benefits of reforms, thereby making the euro area more resilient to global shocks.",
        "Taking into account the views expressed by the Governing Council, the President concluded that a large majority of voting members supported a decision to recalibrate the degree of monetary accommodation in view of the ECB’s price stability objective, with the proposed set of measures, and had decided: First, as regards the key ECB interest rates, to lower the interest rate on the deposit facility by 10 basis points to ‑0.30%.",
        "The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the rate on the marginal lending facility would remain unchanged at their current levels of 0.05% and 0.30% respectively.",
        "Second, as regards non-standard monetary policy measures, to extend the APP.",
        "The monthly purchases of €60 billion under the APP were now intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Third, to reinvest the principal payments on the securities purchased under the APP as they matured, for as long as necessary.",
        "This would contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "The technical details would be communicated in due time.",
        "Fourth, to include, in the public sector purchase programme, euro-denominated marketable debt instruments issued by regional and local governments located in the euro area in the list of assets that are eligible for regular purchases by the respective national central banks.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 20-21 April 2016.",
        "Euro area markets had, overall, been rather calm, while global financial markets had focused their attention on several specific risk events.",
        "In the United States, market expectations of a rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had firmed since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting.",
        "A 25 basis point rate hike was fully priced in by the end of the year.",
        "US Treasury yields had remained relatively stable at the long end of the curve, while the nominal effective exchange rate of the US dollar had strengthened.",
        "US equity markets had continued to perform well, with the S&P 500 trading slightly below its all-time high.",
        "The Bank of Japan had kept its monetary policy stance unchanged at its meeting on 27-28 April 2016.",
        "With financial markets having expected a rate cut into more negative territory, the Japanese yen had appreciated temporarily, by 5%, against the US dollar in the week following the Bank of Japan’s decision.",
        "Against the US currency, the yen was currently back to around its level before the Bank of Japan’s meeting and its nominal effective exchange rate was similar to the level seen at the time of the Governing Council’s April meeting.",
        "The Chinese renminbi had continued to depreciate against the US dollar, having fallen by around 2% since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting.",
        "The Chinese authorities had outlined a new plan to open the onshore interbank bond market to foreign investors.",
        "According to market estimates, the Chinese bond market could attract as much as USD 155 billion in capital inflows from funds passively tracking global bond indices should Chinese bonds be included in these indices.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had risen markedly, to levels around USD 50 per barrel, since the April meeting.",
        "However, recent increases in oil prices had so far had no significant impact on market-based inflation expectations for the euro area.",
        "Concerns over a possible leave vote in the forthcoming UK referendum had abated somewhat until the day before the current meeting.",
        "Currency option markets had reflected some reduction in uncertainty through declining implied volatilities.",
        "Euro area bond markets had seen strong issuance of investment grade corporate debt over the previous month.",
        "Cumulative gross issuance of Eurosystem eligible debt from January until May 2016 was, compared with the corresponding period in the previous two years, higher than in 2014 but lower than in 2015, when the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) had been seen as fostering asset reallocation from sovereign and agency bonds into corporate credit.",
        "The difference compared with 2015 also reflected the fact that, in 2016, the period between February and April had seen somewhat muted issuance activity because of domestic and global uncertainties leading to a “risk-off” mode in the markets.",
        "Another notable trend was a substantial lengthening of duration in the supply of government bonds, reflecting, on the demand side, not only search-for-yield considerations but also technical factors related to portfolio hedging.",
        "Euro area monetary policy expectations had been very stable since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting in March.",
        "Money market forward rates had continued to price in a likelihood of around 60% for a 10 basis point cut by early 2017.",
        "Meanwhile, market attention had shifted to expectations regarding the potential demand in the upcoming second series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO II), the first of which would be conducted on 22 June.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Global growth remained subdued.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had edged up slightly to 51.6 in April, from 51.5 in March, mainly driven by the services component, while the indicator remained below its long-term average.",
        "At the same time, incoming trade data had been weak, mainly driven by developments in emerging market economies.",
        "The volume of world imports of goods had decreased by 1.8%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2016, following an increase of 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2015.",
        "While trade growth remained marginally positive among advanced economies, momentum had fallen markedly in emerging market economies, notably those in Asia.",
        "Global inflation remained low in March.",
        "For the OECD area, annual consumer price inflation had declined to 0.8%, down from 1.0% in February, although excluding food and energy, inflation remained unchanged in March, at 1.9%.",
        "Since the Governing Council meeting on 20-21 April, Brent crude oil prices had increased markedly to levels of around USD 50 per barrel.",
        "Over the same period, non-oil commodity prices had increased by 1.8% in US dollar terms, while the euro had remained broadly unchanged in nominal effective terms vis-à-vis the currencies of 38 of the euro area’s major trading partners.",
        "Turning to the euro area, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate real GDP had risen by 0.5%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2016, exceeding expectations.",
        "Private consumption and stronger investment growth had been the main drivers, supported by the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy stance, improving labour markets and still low oil prices.",
        "The most recent incoming data had been mixed.",
        "While industrial production and construction had continued to decline on a month-on-month basis in March, by 0.8% and 0.9% respectively, survey-based indicators up to May, such as the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) and the composite output PMI, were more positive.",
        "Labour income, the largest and most stable component of gross disposable income, had been supporting consumption since the onset of the recovery.",
        "Private consumption growth was expected to remain robust in the short term, supported by still low oil prices.",
        "In 2015 as a whole, growth in durable goods consumption had risen to rates not seen since 2006.",
        "This, in part, reflected pent-up demand generated during the crisis, particularly among the more stressed countries.",
        "Housing construction was recovering on the back of increasing demand.",
        "Strengthened confidence in the sector pointed to a continuation of strong growth in residential investment over the coming quarters.",
        "The developments observed in building permits granted confirmed this outlook.",
        "While the gross indebtedness of non-financial corporations (NFCs) in relation to their gross operating surplus had remained at a relatively high level, firms had increased their retained earnings and improved their access to external financing.",
        "At the same time, corporate debt-to-equity ratios had declined strongly since early 2009, driven by the sharp increase in equity prices and the weak growth in debt in recent years.",
        "In addition, NFCs’ net interest payments had declined from 9% to 2% of gross operating surplus between the end of 2008 and the fourth quarter of 2015.",
        "The weakening in euro area exports in 2015 had been less pronounced than could have been expected on the basis of developments in foreign demand, reflecting gains in euro area market shares that benefited mainly from the past depreciation of the euro.",
        "Looking ahead, the June 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area saw real GDP growing by 1.6% in 2016 and by 1.7% in both 2017 and 2018, broadly in line with recent forecasts from other international institutions and the private sector, including the OECD forecasts for the euro area, which had just been released.",
        "Compared with the March 2016 ECB staff projections, the growth outlook had been revised upwards for 2016 and had remained broadly unchanged for 2017 and 2018.",
        "Turning to price developments in the euro area, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate annual HICP inflation had remained negative in May, at -0.1%, slightly up from its April level of -0.2%, mainly reflecting higher energy and services price inflation.",
        "Annual HICP inflation excluding food and energy had risen to 0.8% in May, up from 0.7% in April, although most measures of underlying inflation did not show a clear sign of an upward trend.",
        "Producer prices for domestic sales had not changed significantly.",
        "While past rises in import prices for non-energy goods and a slight improvement in economic conditions should, in the meantime, have exerted upward pressure on producer prices, available data suggested that these factors could have been countered by lower commodity prices and subdued wage growth.",
        "It appeared that producers were content to maintain prices at their current levels, possibly facilitating some recovery in profit margins if, on balance, input costs had declined.",
        "Survey data also pointed to continued subdued price pressures.",
        "According to the June Eurosystem staff projections, HICP inflation was expected to rebound from 0.2% in 2016 to 1.3% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, broadly in line with recent forecasts from other international institutions and the private sector, including the OECD forecasts for the euro area, which had just been released.",
        "In comparison with the March 2016 ECB staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised slightly upwards for 2016, reflecting recent oil price increases, and had remained unchanged for 2017 and 2018.",
        "Looking at recent developments in long-term inflation expectations, market-based measures had increased slightly across horizons since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting, but had remained at low levels.",
        "At the same time, deflation fears remained contained and visibly below the early-2015 peak.",
        "As regards financial and monetary conditions, the EONIA forward yield curve – which had been almost unchanged from just before the 20-21 April meeting of the Governing Council – remained significantly below the levels observed just before the Governing Council’s December 2015 and January 2016 monetary policy meetings.",
        "In addition, bank lending rates for NFCs had remained broadly unchanged in March, at 2.0%, close to their historic low.",
        "At the same time, the lending rates for households for house purchase had decreased further, to stand at 2.1% in March.",
        "Turning to money and credit, annual growth in M3 had remained robust at 4.6% in April, after 5.0% in March and 4.9% in February.",
        "M1 had remained the only positive contributor to growth in M3, with an annual growth rate of 9.7% in April, after 10.1% in March and 10.3% in February.",
        "Euro area loan growth had continued to recover gradually.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to NFCs (adjusted for sales and securitisation) had been 1.2% in April, up from 1.1% in March 2016.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households had remained broadly unchanged in March and April, at around 1.5%.",
        "According to the latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE), conducted from 10 March to 21 April 2016, for the third consecutive time since early 2015 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) had signalled an improvement in the availability of external sources of finance and in the willingness of banks to provide credit at lower interest rates.",
        "However, cross-country differences were still sizeable.",
        "Recent developments in price-to-book ratios of euro area companies pointed to a marginal decline since the 20-21 April Governing Council meeting.",
        "In the case of euro area banks, those ratios had remained relatively low compared with NFCs and insurance companies.",
        "The underperformance of banks could relate to the perceived need for the banking sector to consolidate and to concerns over non-performing loans.",
        "At the same time, the ECB’s monetary policy measures were expected to support funding conditions for banks while also strengthening their profitability through higher demand for loans.",
        "With regard to fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was expected to be mildly expansionary in 2016 and turn broadly neutral in 2017 and 2018.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet recalled that the June 2016 Eurosystem staff projections were broadly in line with the March ECB staff projections.",
        "They confirmed the moderate, but steady, recovery that had been embedded therein and that the additional March policy package had been instrumental in avoiding a severe deterioration in financial conditions after the turbulences around the end of 2015 and in supporting the economic recovery.",
        "At the same time, the June Eurosystem staff projections confirmed the persistence of weak underlying price pressures.",
        "The outlook for HICP inflation had been revised up slightly for 2016, on the back of higher oil prices, but was unchanged for 2017 and 2018.",
        "Staff also saw HICP excluding food and energy somewhat lower over the projection horizon.",
        "The protracted period of very low inflation thus remained a matter of continued concern.",
        "Looking ahead, some upside potential, beyond what was already embedded in the staff projections, could be expected from the implementation of the new series of TLTROs and the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP).",
        "In particular, TLTRO II could further ease the borrowing costs of the private sector and provide an additional impulse to credit creation.",
        "Overall, it would tilt the balance of risks surrounding the staff baseline projections to a more balanced configuration than was the case for the March exercise.",
        "Cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need to preserve an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% without undue delay.",
        "Against this background, it was key to continue focusing on the full implementation of the measures decided.",
        "As regards communication, it was important for the Governing Council to reiterate its forward guidance on the future path of its policy rates and on its monthly asset purchases, with the same formulations that had been used earlier in March and April 2016.",
        "It also needed to be stressed that additional stimulus, beyond the impetus already taken into account, was expected from the monetary policy measures still to be implemented, which would contribute to rebalancing further the risks to the outlook for growth and inflation.",
        "Likewise, it needed to be reiterated that it was crucial to ensure that the very low inflation environment did not become entrenched in second-round effects on wage and price setting.",
        "Accordingly, the Governing Council would state again that it would closely monitor the evolution of the outlook for price stability and, if warranted to achieve its objective, act by using all the instruments available within its mandate.",
        "Finally, it was appropriate that the Governing Council should continue to stress that, in order to reap the full benefit from its monetary policy measures, other policy areas had to contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the European levels.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "The recovery of the euro area economy was expected to continue, led by domestic demand and supported by the pass-through of the ECB’s monetary policy measures, as well as by still relatively low oil prices and a slightly expansionary fiscal stance in 2016.",
        "In particular, investment continued to be supported by favourable financing conditions together with improving corporate profitability, while consumption was supported by higher real household disposable income, related to sustained employment gains and low oil prices.",
        "Growth prospects were seen to be still dampened by headwinds stemming from the external environment, as well as by balance sheet adjustments in the non-financial and financial sectors.",
        "This assessment had also been reflected in the outlook for growth in the June 2016 Eurosystem staff projections, which broadly confirmed the outlook embedded in the March ECB staff projections.",
        "As regards the risk assessment, additional stimulus, beyond the impetus already taken into account, could be expected from the monetary policy measures still to be implemented, while a number of uncertainties persisted.",
        "On balance, the risks to the growth outlook were considered to remain tilted to the downside, but the balance of risks had improved.",
        "Considering the arguments in more detail, members discussed the outlook and risks for the external environment.",
        "It was noted that, in the latest Eurosystem staff projections, the prospects for both global growth and global trade throughout the projection horizon had been revised downwards compared with the March 2016 ECB staff projections.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that this marked the continuation of a long sequence of downward revisions to the external outlook.",
        "It was also observed that global trade was again expected to grow less than global activity in 2016, as in 2015, and that in the past a rate of growth of global trade below that of global activity had been a precursor to a downturn in global economic activity.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that there were important composition effects behind the weaker developments in trade growth observed since the financial crisis.",
        "In particular, it was underlined that stronger growth in emerging market economies relative to advanced economies in recent years was an important factor accounting for the lower trade elasticity seen since the crisis, as the trade openness of emerging market economies was lower than that of advanced economies.",
        "As regards developments in advanced economies, the increased prospects of an interest rate hike in the United States were seen as a positive signal for the global economy.",
        "If, on the basis of incoming data, the FOMC were to raise interest rates at one of its forthcoming meetings, this would suggest that the US economy was experiencing a stronger recovery, which in turn could be expected to have a positive effect on “animal spirits” and confidence globally.",
        "Members also exchanged views on the possible impact on the euro area of the upcoming June UK referendum on its membership of the European Union.",
        "There was general agreement that this was an important source of uncertainty as regards the economic outlook, and in the event that the United Kingdom voted to leave, i.e.",
        "a “Brexit”, there could be significant, although difficult to anticipate, negative spillovers to the euro area via a number of channels, including trade and the financial markets.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that there might also be an upside risk to the euro area outlook if the United Kingdom voted to remain part of the European Union.",
        "Turning to the euro area, members concurred with the view that the economic recovery was broadly proceeding as expected, at a steady pace, driven mainly by domestic demand, also as a result of the monetary policy measures that had been taken.",
        "As a consequence, the output gap was closing, albeit only gradually, as was to be expected after a balance sheet recession.",
        "The latest incoming information provided confirmation of a moderately improving economic situation and of the recovery becoming more robust.",
        "Notably, the outcome for real GDP growth in the first quarter of the year had been better than generally expected.",
        "In particular, the pick-up in euro area investment, mainly driven by non-construction investment, was considered to be an encouraging development.",
        "Likewise, recent indications of stronger construction investment, after a prolonged period of weak construction activity since 2008, were seen as a positive sign.",
        "Reference was also made to some recent improvements in economic sentiment and to increasing growth in consumer durables, supported by real income growth, even though stronger oil prices recently, if sustained, could be expected to moderate the recovery in output growth, owing to their adverse impact on disposable income.",
        "Financial market conditions remained supportive overall.",
        "Employment figures had also recently recorded further improvements.",
        "Altogether, the Governing Council considered that the risks to the euro area growth outlook remained tilted to the downside.",
        "Some important downward risks were still looming, relating, in particular, to developments in the global economy, the outcome of the forthcoming UK referendum and other geopolitical risks.",
        "At the same time, there was broad agreement that the balance of risks to the euro area growth outlook had improved on the back of monetary policy measures taken and the stimulus still in the pipeline.",
        "Members again emphasised strongly the need for other policy areas to contribute much more decisively, both at the national and the European levels, in order to reap the full benefits from the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "Structural policies were considered essential, given the continued high structural unemployment and low potential growth in the euro area.",
        "In particular, members judged that actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, were vital to increase investment and boost job creation.",
        "Although specific reform needs differed across countries, the swift and effective implementation of structural reforms, in line with the country-specific recommendations recently published by the European Commission, would lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area and make the euro area more resilient to global shocks.",
        "It was emphasised that, with the economic situation improving and demand increasing, it was an opportune time to strengthen investment in the public and private sectors.",
        "The enhancement of the current investment initiatives, including the extension of the Juncker plan, and the importance of making progress with the capital markets union were both mentioned.",
        "The role of the euro area banking sector was also considered critical.",
        "In particular, dealing with non-performing loans was seen as an important contribution to strengthening the euro area economic recovery.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, members highlighted the need for full and consistent implementation of the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, both over time and across countries, in order to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework.",
        "At the same time, fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery.",
        "It was recalled that all countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies and that fiscal space should be used where appropriate.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment of the outlook and risks presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "HICP inflation developments continued to be subdued.",
        "Looking ahead, on the basis of current oil futures prices, headline inflation was expected to remain very low or in negative territory for the next few months, before picking up in the second half of the year largely as a result of the upward impact of base effects in the annual rate of change of energy prices.",
        "Inflation was expected to pick up further in 2017 and 2018 in line with the projected economic recovery and supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "This assessment was broadly reflected in the June 2016 Eurosystem staff projections, where the inflation outlook had been revised up slightly for 2016 compared with the March ECB staff projections, reflecting recent oil price increases.",
        "For 2017 and 2018, upward revisions of the energy and food components had been broadly offset by downward revisions in the HICP excluding food and energy.",
        "A number of comments were made regarding expected developments in headline inflation.",
        "It was noted that, in the projections, a significant increase in overall HICP inflation, from 0.2% to 1.3%, was expected between 2016 and 2017.",
        "The increase in inflation largely reflected the path of energy prices.",
        "It was suggested that oil prices might rise even more than assumed in the projection baseline, as it could be argued that the impact of changes in the supply of oil would take some time to be reflected in oil prices.",
        "At the same time, it was recognised that the factors affecting the production of oil included some temporary supply disruptions, which could imply that there might also be some downside risks to oil prices.",
        "With regard to recent developments in underlying measures of inflation, while there had been some increase in the annual rate of HICP inflation excluding food and energy in May, it remained at quite a low level and disappointed expectations of a somewhat stronger increase.",
        "So far, most measures of underlying inflation had yet to show clear signs of an upward trend, and members agreed that there was a need to analyse further the recent fall in core inflation rates.",
        "In this context, it was noted that there had been a significant downward impact on the services component of inflation in recent months owing to statistical changes in the measurement of rental prices in one large euro area economy.",
        "However, overall, inflationary pressures continued to be weak, also reflecting the amount of slack remaining in the economy.",
        "Members also discussed recent developments in and the outlook for nominal wage growth, which remained at low levels and was expected to pick up only modestly, to just over 2% in 2018 for the euro area as a whole, according to the June 2016 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "One element which warranted further analysis was the extent to which labour market reforms might have reduced the level of structural unemployment in the euro area.",
        "Structural reforms should have had a downward impact on the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) but it was difficult to quantify the impact.",
        "As the reforms were relatively recent, their effects might not yet be fully reflected in various NAIRU estimates.",
        "On the other hand, if the actual rate of unemployment were to fall below the NAIRU over the course of the projection horizon, there could be an upside risk to nominal wage growth.",
        "Another possible reason mentioned for low nominal wage growth was related to persistently low inflation expectations, with risks of second-round effects emerging.",
        "More generally, it was suggested that output gap measures were performing better than labour market measures as an indication of inflation.",
        "Members exchanged views on the latest developments in inflation expectations.",
        "Market-based inflation expectations for the euro area had remained low, but the slight increase since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting was noted, with the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead currently standing just below 1.5%.",
        "However, the decoupling of inflation expectations from oil price developments and the fact that market-based inflation expectations had not picked up from their low levels despite the increase in oil prices remained a matter of concern.",
        "At the same time, it could be argued that the projected pick-up in headline inflation would help to avoid second-round effects.",
        "Moreover, doubts were again expressed about relying too much on market-based measures of inflation expectations, which had deviated strongly from survey-based measures.",
        "Overall, there was broad agreement that euro area inflation was expected to pick up, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures and the expected recovery.",
        "While there remained some downside risks to inflation, given that inflation had been low for a protracted period of time, and it remained crucial to avoid second-round effects on wage and price setting, there were also some upside risks, with additional stimulus beyond that already taken into account in the projections to be expected from the monetary policy measures still to be implemented.",
        "Moreover, the monetary policy measures taken into account in the projections could potentially have a stronger impact than assumed in the baseline.",
        "This would contribute to further rebalancing the risks to the outlook for growth and inflation.",
        "In any case, the Governing Council would continue to monitor closely the evolution of the outlook for price stability.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) had continued to grow at a robust pace in April 2016, which, as in previous months, was supported by growth in its most liquid components.",
        "Loan dynamics had followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014, with the annual rates of change of loans to non-financial corporations and of loans to households (adjusted for loans sales and securitisation) both having remained broadly stable in April 2016.",
        "The favourable impact of the ECB’s measures was deemed to be clearly visible in the pass-through of policy rates to bank lending rates.",
        "This was also supported by a greater role played by competition among banks, in line with evidence from the bank lending survey, where risk perceptions and other factors had become less important compared with two years ago.",
        "As regards volumes, it was underlined that they had recovered gradually and continuously for more than two years and that loan growth had continued to edge higher, with lending to non-financial firms growing at an annualised rate of more than 2% for the latest three-month period.",
        "At the same time, some concerns were expressed with regard to monetary transmission via quantities and bank balance sheets.",
        "A number of factors were weighing on the still relatively weak pick-up in credit volumes, which was assessed to continue to relate, overall, more to the demand side than to the supply side.",
        "Reference was made, in particular, to the low price-to-book ratios in the banking sector, which reflected market perceptions of a continued need to deal with non-performing loans across banks and countries, pressures on bank business models and profitability, as well as remaining regulatory uncertainty.",
        "In addition, notwithstanding the presence of subdued domestic loan demand, there appeared to be little appetite among banks to exploit opportunities for cross-border lending in the face of inadequate compensation for perceived credit risks.",
        "A call was made to address non-performing exposures comprehensively at all levels, also with a view to avoiding renewed fragmentation of the financial systems in the euro area.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that the process of balance sheet repair was laborious and required careful management, also with regard to financial stability.",
        "It was recalled that most enterprises in Europe, and particularly SMEs, relied on bank credit.",
        "Hence, the health of the banking system remained key for the effective transmission of monetary policy in the euro area.",
        "Comfort could be drawn from the results of the latest SAFE survey, which had recorded a further improvement in lending conditions, including for SMEs, and an increase in the perceived willingness of banks to lend.",
        "However, the use of borrowed funds by large and small firms needed to be better understood, as there seemed to be only a weak correlation with business investment.",
        "It was also noted that, in the wake of the financial crisis, a protracted period of balance sheet repair in the financial and non-financial sectors and subdued investment, coupled with sizeable cash holdings by large corporations, seemed to be a global phenomenon, with some of the funds used for the acquisition of shares.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Based on recent data and projections, the previous outlook for the euro area was broadly confirmed with regard to both activity and prices.",
        "The economic recovery was expected to proceed at a moderate but steady pace, underpinned by the comprehensive package of monetary policy decisions taken in early March 2016.",
        "At the same time, price pressures continued to be weak, with inflation rates likely to remain very low or negative in the next few months, before picking up in the second half of 2016.",
        "Going forward, some additional stimulus, beyond the impetus already taken into account, was expected from the monetary policy measures still to be implemented, which would contribute to further rebalancing the risks to the outlook for growth and inflation.",
        "At the same time, the Governing Council would continue to monitor closely the evolution of the outlook for price stability to ensure, in particular, that the very low inflation environment did not become entrenched in second-round effects on wage and price setting.",
        "Broad agreement was expressed with the main monetary policy conclusions and the line of communication put forward by Mr Praet.",
        "These comprised an unchanged monetary policy, reiteration of the Governing Council’s forward guidance and a continued focus on implementing the measures adopted and on the need to continue to monitor closely the outlook for price stability, affirming the Governing Council’s readiness to act by using all the instruments available within its mandate, if warranted, to achieve the ECB’s objective.",
        "This assessment of the monetary policy stance and the line of communication reflected consideration of a number of key elements.",
        "First, the view was widely shared that the ECB’s monetary policy measures were effective and that the focus should now be firmly on the implementation of the comprehensive new package adopted in March 2016, including the forthcoming launch of the CSPP on 8 June 2016 and the first operation under TLTRO II, which was set to start on 22 June 2016.",
        "The positive impact of the March decisions could already be observed in improved financial conditions across a number of markets, including for government and corporate bonds, which continued to translate into lower bank lending rates and strengthened credit creation.",
        "Second, time was needed for the effects of all the measures to fully unfold on the euro area economy and to pass through to price developments, taking into account the likely effects in the pipeline of the measures still to be implemented and the transmission lags of monetary policy via intermediate variables to the ultimate objective.",
        "It was also reiterated that the size and nature of shocks affecting the economy had to be taken into account for the policy relevant time horizon.",
        "Third, confidence was expressed that the effects of the monetary policy measures undertaken – including on rates, lending operations and outright asset purchases – were mutually reinforcing via a variety of channels.",
        "In particular, while financial prices were impacted by expectations about the future path of policy rates as well as by the extraction of term and credit premia, the injection of liquidity in the presence of negative rates on the deposit facility was further reinforcing the portfolio rebalancing effects.",
        "Fourth, additional stimulus was expected from the measures still to be implemented, beyond the impetus already taken into account.",
        "Both TLTRO II and the CSPP were seen as important measures that could be expected to impact the real economy directly.",
        "With regard to the series of TLTRO II operations, it was recalled that the earlier operations had been instrumental in turning around the credit cycle in the euro area and in reducing fragmentation, and that the new operations should also help to support lending and, ultimately, inflation expectations.",
        "It was underlined that both the gross and the net take-up would matter from a monetary policy perspective, as TLTRO II allowed banks to substitute more expensive shorter-term financing with cheaper long-term funds, over and above any net impact on excess liquidity, which also mattered in conjunction with the negative deposit rate.",
        "However, the actual take-up was not to be seen as the sole measure of success, as the TLTROs also contained an important “insurance” element to cater for uncertainty and adverse contingencies.",
        "Fifth, as regards the asset purchase programme (APP), a continued smooth implementation could be observed overall, although a remark was made that markets appeared to foresee future challenges in sourcing sufficient volumes of public bonds for some jurisdictions under the present limits, which could contribute to increased price volatility.",
        "With respect to the composition of purchases under the APP and the associated portfolio balancing effects operating via close substitutes across markets, it was pointed out that, if assets were indeed close substitutes, it should not matter much which precise assets were being purchased under the APP, but rather the overall purchase volume and associated money creation.",
        "However, since many investors remained closely tied to specific market segments, the composition of purchases still mattered.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, on 8 June 2016 the Eurosystem would start making purchases under the CSPP.",
        "Moreover, starting on 22 June 2016, it would conduct the first operation in its new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO II).",
        "Further information on the implementation aspects of the CSPP would be released on the ECB’s website after the press conference.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 7-8 September 2016, the most significant developments had taken place outside the euro area, but had affected the euro area via spillovers.",
        "After the meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the Bank of Japan on 21 September, the yield curves of US and, to a lesser extent, Japanese government bonds had steepened, with the yield on ten-year US Treasury bonds reaching 1.79% on 14 October 2016.",
        "This had been driven mainly by four factors, which were interacting with each other: The first factor was the Bank of Japan’s announcement on 21 September of a shift in its monetary policy towards “quantitative and qualitative monetary easing with yield curve control”, together with some considerations on overshooting the inflation target.",
        "The second factor related to the recent strong US economic data together with statements by some FOMC officials, which had led to a slight increase in the probability derived from money market interest rates of a rate hike at the 13-14 December FOMC meeting.",
        "These expectations had provided further support to the US dollar, which had appreciated broadly against other major currencies, by 8% against the pound sterling (mainly influenced by developments in the United Kingdom), by 2% against the euro and by 1% against the Japanese yen, since the previous monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council.",
        "The US dollar had also strengthened against most emerging market currencies.",
        "Over the previous three months, the funding premium for the US dollar had been fairly volatile and had steadily increased, in the context of the reform of US money market funds that came into force on 14 October 2016.",
        "Recourse to the Federal Reserve System’s reverse repo facility, which allows cash to be deposited against collateral, had reached a one-year high of USD 413 billion.",
        "The third factor underpinning the global yield curve steepening related to the increase in oil prices.",
        "Brent crude oil prices had risen to a 15-month high, trading temporarily above USD 52 per barrel when OPEC agreed on 28 September 2016 on a modest, but unexpected, output cut of 700,000 barrels per day.",
        "This was the first concerted cut in OPEC production since 2008.",
        "The increase in Brent reference prices of more than 15% since mid-September had contributed to an increase in inflation expectations globally.",
        "The fourth factor was related to developments in the United Kingdom, as the pound sterling had depreciated continuously since the UK referendum on EU membership on 23 June 2016.",
        "During the night of 7 October the pound had depreciated by up to 6% against the euro in the Asian trading session, before closing around 1.5% lower.",
        "Market participants attributed this sudden sell-off to illiquid market conditions during Asian trading hours, which had triggered large stop-loss orders.",
        "Notably, the value of the pound had not reverted to its initial level, unlike the patterns typically observed in previous flash-crash events.",
        "The depreciation of the pound had had a sizeable effect on UK government bonds, with a sharp increase in bond yields and a steepening of the yield curve by 20 to 35 basis points at the five-year maturity and beyond.",
        "Euro area government bond yields had followed the global steepening trend.",
        "Moreover, idiosyncratic domestic factors had had an impact on some lower-rated government bond yields.",
        "With regard to the implementation of the asset purchase programme (APP), overall purchases had increased again to €85 billion in September after a seasonal decline to €60 billion in August.",
        "The implementation of the programme remained smooth overall amid generally satisfactory market liquidity, notwithstanding increased market concerns over emerging scarcity in some segments.",
        "Securities lending of APP holdings had been gradually increasing, especially as regards government bonds held under the public sector purchase programme.",
        "Moreover, September had brought an increase in the issuance of private sector securities, which had had a positive impact on the implementation of both the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) and the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP).",
        "Since the announcement of the programme in March 2016, monthly issuance in the CSPP universe had exceeded that seen in the same months of the previous year, and the weighted average maturity of the corporate bonds issued had been around 1.5 years longer.",
        "Specifically, more than €20 billion of euro-denominated investment grade non-financial corporate bonds had come to the market in September, and the relatively strong issuance had continued in October.",
        "Despite the strong primary market activity, the yield spreads of euro-denominated investment grade non-financial corporate bonds had remained broadly stable.",
        "Primary issuance in the asset-backed securities (ABS) market had also picked up, although not on the same scale as the CSPP market.",
        "ABS issuance had also been broad-based in terms of both jurisdictions and types of ABS.",
        "Finally, turning to monetary policy expectations, market participants were not anticipating a rate cut at the present meeting.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Global activity and trade growth remained subdued.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had increased slightly to 51.7 in September and to 51.5 in the third quarter of 2016.",
        "The global PMI for new export orders had also increased, to 50.5, in the third quarter of 2016.",
        "At the same time, the volume of world imports of goods had declined by 0.4% in the period from May to July compared with the period from April to June.",
        "In the United Kingdom, economic data for the third quarter had surprised on the upside, while the longer-term economic consequences of the UK referendum remained uncertain.",
        "Looking at global consumer price developments, annual OECD inflation had risen slightly to 0.9% in August 2016, up from 0.8% in July, while inflation excluding food and energy had remained unchanged from July, at 1.8% in August.",
        "Brent crude oil prices stood at USD 50.4 per barrel on 18 October, 6.1% higher than at the time of the Governing Council meeting on 7-8 September.",
        "Over the same period, both non-oil commodity prices and the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the euro area’s 38 major trading partners had remained broadly unchanged.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, in the second quarter real GDP had increased by 0.3% quarter on quarter.",
        "At the same time, consumption had continued to grow on the back of stronger than expected employment growth in the second quarter, at a rate of 0.4% quarter on quarter, while wage growth remained moderate, reflecting temporary factors such as pent-up wage restraint and continued slack in the economy in a low-inflation environment.",
        "The unemployment rate declined to 10.1% in the second quarter, remaining at that level in July and August.",
        "Sectoral accounts data for the second quarter of 2016 – based on the advance release from 11 October, with the full release to follow on 28 October – indicated that the savings rate for euro area households had remained flat overall since the EONIA had become negative in the third quarter of 2014.",
        "Available survey-based evidence suggested that low interest rates support aggregate consumption to the extent that borrowers tend to have a higher propensity to consume than savers.",
        "Real growth in total housing investment had been 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter, down from 0.5% in the first quarter, confirming overall the ongoing recovery in the housing market in the first six months of the year.",
        "At the same time, real non-construction investment had recovered to its pre-crisis peak, while investment in machinery and equipment remained below pre-crisis levels.",
        "The net operating surplus of euro area non-financial corporations (NFCs) had rebounded in year-on-year terms in the second quarter.",
        "However, recent increases in profitability had only partially translated into higher investment, resulting in a further increase in retained earnings and the net lending position of NFCs.",
        "The September 2016 ECB staff projections for economic growth remained broadly in line with the latest forecasts from the private sector and other international institutions over the projection horizon 2016 to 2018, although they were slightly more optimistic than the latest ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), which was scheduled for release on 21 October 2016.",
        "As regards euro area price developments, HICP inflation had risen to 0.4% in September, up from 0.2% in August, while underlying inflation had still not shown clear signs of an upward trend.",
        "Since mid-2015 annual HICP inflation excluding food and energy had been hovering around 1%.",
        "Annual import price and producer price inflation for non-food consumer goods had remained broadly unchanged in August, at -1.4% and 0.1% respectively.",
        "At the same time, selling price expectations of services producers three months ahead had continued to increase in tandem with a rise in capacity utilisation in the services sector, while PMI data provided tentative signals of emerging upward pipeline pressures for services prices.",
        "Wage growth remained subdued.",
        "Annual growth in compensation per employee had declined slightly to 1.1% in the second quarter of 2016, from 1.2% in the first quarter.",
        "The September 2016 ECB staff projections for inflation remained broadly in line with the latest forecasts from the private sector and other international organisations for 2016 and 2017.",
        "The SPF for the fourth quarter of 2016 showed average inflation expectations of 0.2%, 1.2% and 1.4% for 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively, i.e.",
        "marginally lower than in the survey for the third quarter, while expectations five years ahead remained unchanged at 1.8%.",
        "At the same time, inflation-linked swap rates had recovered somewhat following the decline that had taken place around the time of the UK referendum, with the five-year forward rate five years ahead standing at 1.42% on 18 October.",
        "As regards monetary and financial conditions, EONIA forward rates had shifted upwards since the 7-8 September Governing Council meeting, especially beyond the one-year horizon, while financial conditions indices had remained broadly unchanged.",
        "The overall nominal cost of external financing for euro area NFCs had remained low, while bank equity indices remained depressed, despite a more recent slight recovery, reflecting a number of factors, such as non-performing loans, the outcome of the UK referendum and the weakness of business models in the current environment.",
        "Bank lending rates to NFCs and households had further declined in August, amounting to an overall reduction of around 100 basis points since the announcement of the credit easing package in early June 2014.",
        "Turning to money and credit, the annual growth rate of M3 had stood at 5.1% in August, after 4.9% in July, hence remaining at a level of around 5% since April 2015.",
        "The growth in M3 had mainly been driven by its most liquid components, with annual M1 growth edging up to 8.9%, from 8.4% in July.",
        "As regards loan dynamics, both the annual growth rate of loans from monetary financial institutions (MFIs) to NFCs and that of MFI loans to households had remained unchanged, at 1.9% and 1.8% respectively, in August.",
        "According to the October 2016 bank lending survey for the euro area, credit standards for loans to enterprises had remained unchanged in the third quarter of 2016 after nine consecutive quarters of easing, while those for loans to households had eased further.",
        "Competitive pressures continued to exert an easing impact on credit standards.",
        "With regard to fiscal policies, the fiscal stance in the euro area, as measured by the change in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance, was expected to be broadly neutral in 2017.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet noted that the information that had become available since the Governing Council’s meeting on 7-8 September confirmed an ongoing moderate but steady economic recovery in line with previous expectations.",
        "The recovery continued to show resilience in the face of global economic and political uncertainty, but remained subject to downside risks.",
        "Headline inflation was set to rise further over the coming months, mainly on account of base effects and higher energy prices.",
        "Underlying inflation, however, continued to lack clear signs of a convincing upward trend.",
        "The pass-through of the ECB’s measures to borrowing conditions remained strong.",
        "At the same time, banks continued to face numerous challenges that might affect both their pricing and lending decisions.",
        "Looking ahead, in December 2016 the Governing Council would be in a better position to take a more complete perspective on the inflation outlook and thereby evaluate the likelihood of inflation not only converging to levels that were closer to 2% but also stabilising around those levels with sufficient confidence.",
        "This evaluation needed to take into account the extent to which the inflation outlook depended on the very favourable financing conditions, which largely reflected the present monetary policy stance, and the state of transmission to the broader economy.",
        "In December the Governing Council would also benefit from the new Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections covering the period up to 2019 and would be able to draw on the work of the Eurosystem committees on options that would ensure a smooth and efficient implementation of the APP until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary.",
        "Changes to the technical parameters of the APP should not be separated from an assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook and the implications this might have for the appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "Against this backdrop, it was important for the public communication to confirm the Governing Council’s forward guidance on the path of the key ECB interest rates and of its monthly purchases.",
        "It was also important to reiterate the commitment to preserve the very substantial amount of monetary accommodation that was necessary to firm the pace of inflation convergence towards levels below, but close to, 2% – and the Governing Council’s determination to act, if warranted, by using all the instruments available within its mandate.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment, presented by Mr Praet in his introduction, of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area.",
        "Recent data and survey results confirmed a continued moderate but steady recovery of the euro area economy, which had so far shown some resilience to adverse external shocks and a range of uncertainties.",
        "Looking ahead, domestic demand growth was seen to continue along the previously expected path, supported by growth in private consumption and improvements in investment.",
        "Short and medium-term growth prospects were seen to be dampened by uncertainty pertaining to political and economic developments, both globally and in the euro area, which could weigh, in particular, on the outlook for private investment.",
        "The balance of risks to the euro area outlook was considered to remain tilted to the downside.",
        "Concerning the global environment, external demand remained subdued as global activity and trade continued to grow at a moderate pace.",
        "While global economic growth was expected to pick up gradually, risks were assessed to remain on the downside, in part related to geopolitical developments.",
        "Turning to the euro area, recent data and survey indicators confirmed a continued moderate recovery in line with the assessment at the previous monetary policy meeting and with the September 2016 ECB staff projections.",
        "Consumption and production survey indicators, as well as data on employment growth, continued to suggest that the growth momentum of domestic demand remained broadly intact.",
        "This pointed to a relative resilience of the euro area economy to recent shocks, including the uncertainty following the UK referendum vote to leave the European Union.",
        "That said, the pace of the recovery remained moderate and the point was made that available indicators did not show signs of an acceleration in the growth momentum.",
        "In considering the components of domestic demand, members underlined that private consumption was supported by higher real disposable income, benefiting from labour income growth and still relatively low energy prices.",
        "As had been observed by Mr Praet in his introduction, labour income growth during recent quarters reflected a mix of higher than expected employment growth and lower than expected wage growth.",
        "Looking ahead, it was important to assess whether this combination of dynamic employment growth and subdued wage growth would continue.",
        "Some concern was expressed that employment growth could lose traction, especially if investment were to develop less dynamically then expected in a climate of uncertainty.",
        "This could dampen labour income growth and act as a drag on private consumption.",
        "Private investment was expected to continue to recover, supported by improvements in corporate profitability and supportive financing conditions.",
        "However, it was also noted that investment was being held back by continued uncertainty, both globally and in the euro area.",
        "Anecdotal evidence pointed to a very cautious attitude by large companies, which – among other uncertainties – cited fears of a rebound in protectionism, while particularly smaller companies preferred to wait for clear signals of improvement.",
        "High corporate savings, reflecting strong retained earnings and contributing to the large positive net lending position of NFCs, was a major factor behind the widening savings-investment imbalance for the euro area as a whole, as mirrored in the increasing current account surplus.",
        "It was noted, however, that this imbalance was driven as much by a lack of investment as by a high level of precautionary savings.",
        "At the same time, low investment could also partly be explained by firms’ assessment that their increased retained earnings reflected, in part, temporary windfall gains in the terms of trade on account of exchange rate and oil price developments.",
        "As regards risks to the recovery, it was highlighted that, besides political uncertainties, further downside risks stemmed from remaining balance sheet weaknesses in the euro area financial sector.",
        "Determined efforts to address financial fragilities were, accordingly, seen as important.",
        "Reference was also made to residential house price developments, which did not appear to be a matter of concern for the euro area as a whole but could become a source of financial stability risks in certain countries or regions in the future.",
        "Members also recalled that the outlook for a continued cyclical recovery was based on exceptionally supportive financing conditions, which benefited to a large extent from the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "They also re-emphasised that the accommodative monetary policy was, in itself, not sufficient for a self-sustained recovery and that other policy areas had to make more decisive contributions.",
        "Structural reforms were seen as essential to enhance competition, lay the foundations for sustainable growth and provide a more favourable investment climate by improving the medium to long-term return on capital.",
        "The point was also made that further progress was required in the necessary intra-euro area rebalancing across countries.",
        "Turning to fiscal policy, the euro area fiscal stance was expected to be broadly neutral in 2017.",
        "This was confirmed by the draft budgetary plans that had recently been submitted to the European Commission.",
        "With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement among the members with the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Annual euro area HICP inflation had increased from 0.2% in August 2016 to 0.4% in September 2016, mainly on account of a further increase in energy price inflation.",
        "HICP inflation excluding food and energy had remained unchanged at 0.8%.",
        "Looking ahead, headline inflation was expected to pick up further, initially largely on account of base effects and later supported by the expected gradual economic recovery and the accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "Looking in more detail at the short-term outlook for prices, headline inflation was expected to pick up over the coming months to exceed 1% in early 2017, broadly converging with measures of underlying inflation.",
        "While this was, in part, a sign of the effectiveness of the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the very near-term developments in headline inflation were largely driven by base effects, as the negative drag from past energy price declines would fade away over the coming months.",
        "It was also pointed out that this projected pick-up in headline inflation was contingent on the short-term outlook for energy prices, which was highly uncertain.",
        "In that context, it was recalled that past short-term inflation projections had been subject to considerable errors.",
        "Members noted that measures of underlying inflation had remained broadly stable at low levels.",
        "Looking ahead, it remained to be seen whether the low energy prices that had been observed until some months earlier might still exert second-round effects and pass through to core inflation.",
        "While lagged effects could not be excluded, the risk of second-round effects from low energy prices in the past was now diminishing given the more recent uptick in energy prices.",
        "The extent of the pass-through critically hinged also on the price-setting behaviour of firms.",
        "Evidence suggested that firms had not fully passed on improvements in terms of trade to unit prices, and it was important to monitor whether firms would adopt a symmetric price-setting behaviour in response to the more recent increases in oil prices.",
        "In a discussion on developments in euro area wages, several references were made to the relatively subdued wage dynamics, as compensation per employee was growing at historically low rates, falling to 1.1% in year-on-year terms in the second quarter of 2016.",
        "Overall, wage dynamics appeared to have surprised on the downside.",
        "Low wage growth was explained by a number of country-specific factors, such as employment-oriented wage bargaining in some countries and the need to catch up on competiveness in others, as well as low productivity growth, which was affecting the euro area as a whole.",
        "It was also recalled in this context that the pattern of downside surprises on wage growth mirrored upside surprises in employment creation, which was to be seen as a positive element in the euro area recovery.",
        "Members recalled the importance of a good understanding of the relationship between wages and inflation, in conjunction with the margin behaviour of firms, as had recently been highlighted in discussions concerning the US economy, where a similar lack or delay of pass-through had been observed for some time.",
        "The relationship between the output gap and inflation was seen as subject to great uncertainty and as warranting continued monitoring and analysis.",
        "The point was made that the Phillips curve relationship merited closer examination at the level of individual countries, using not only HICP numbers but also other price indicators, as the link between inflation and slack appeared to be unstable and rather diverse even across relatively similar neighbouring countries.",
        "As regards the risk assessment, the prevalence of downside risks to the outlook for economic activity was seen to entail downside risks to the inflation outlook.",
        "Some upside risks to inflation were also mentioned, related to energy prices and exchange rate developments, which in turn depended, among other things, on monetary policy decisions in other jurisdictions.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) had continued to increase at a robust pace in August 2016, mainly supported, as in previous months, by its most liquid components.",
        "Loan dynamics had continued on the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014, with the growth of loans to NFCs and households in August progressing at levels unchanged from July.",
        "Members stressed that the transmission of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continued to be effective in ensuring very favourable borrowing conditions for firms and households.",
        "In this context, the TLTROs were mentioned, which had led to substantial funding cost relief that banks were able to pass on to their customers, despite a diverse take-up across euro area countries.",
        "Bank lending rates had continued their broad-based decline to new historic lows, supporting the recovery of lending to the private sector.",
        "This was also confirmed by the results from the recent bank lending survey for the third quarter, with banks reporting further improvements in both supply and demand conditions for loans to the non-financial private sector overall and, in particular, net loan demand increasing across all loan categories.",
        "Credit conditions had also remained very favourable, mainly on the back of increasing competitive pressures in the banking sector.",
        "Credit standards had eased further for loans to households and, after nine months of continued easing, had been unchanged for NFCs, although they were expected to tighten somewhat in the next quarter.",
        "Furthermore, banks continued to report that the ECB’s APP and the negative deposit facility rate had contributed to more favourable terms and conditions on new loans, which overall saw a further net easing.",
        "At the same time, continued monitoring of the state of policy transmission to the broader economy, the bank lending channel and the outlook for loan developments appeared warranted.",
        "In addition, the future evolution of credit standards and credit terms and conditions had to be monitored carefully.",
        "Ongoing structural challenges to banks’ balance sheets, notably arising from still high levels of non-performing loans in parts of the euro area banking sector, in conjunction with regulatory challenges, and the weakness in profitability were seen to pose a risk to the transmission of monetary policy and a further recovery in credit dynamics.",
        "In this context, the possible side effects of the low interest rate environment and the range of non-standard measures in place on the longer-term intermediation capacity of banks and other financial institutions had to be further examined.",
        "Regarding the outlook for credit growth, some caution was warranted in view of the recent levelling-off of the growth of credit to NFCs.",
        "It was remarked that while the overall cost of external financing for NFCs had continued its steady decline, particularly with regard to the cost of debt financing, the cost of equity financing remained at high levels owing to elevated equity risk premia.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that the significance of recent monthly figures should not be overstated, as the levelling-off was only evidenced by one monthly observation, and incoming data over the coming months should provide a clearer picture of the trajectory of euro area credit looking ahead.",
        "To date, the recovery in the growth of loans to NFCs appeared to be broadly in line with the current moderate growth prospects of the euro area economy and the typical lags in the corporate lending cycle.",
        "Moreover, some slowdown was perhaps to be expected in economies approaching full employment, where loan demand was likely to be dampened by the availability of ample internal funds as well as very favourable market-based financing conditions.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that the information that had become available since the monetary policy meeting in early September confirmed a continued moderate but steady recovery of the euro area economy and a gradual rise in inflation, in line with the Governing Council’s previous expectations.",
        "The euro area economy had continued to show resilience to the adverse effects of global economic and political uncertainty, aided by the comprehensive monetary policy measures.",
        "At the same time, the baseline scenario remained subject to downside risks.",
        "There was wide agreement among members that it was premature to make a firm assessment of the outlook for price stability and to discuss its implications for the monetary policy stance at the current meeting.",
        "While the recovery of the euro area economy appeared to be on track, underlying inflation still lacked a convincing upward trend and the scenario for growth and inflation continued to be predicated on the prevailing very favourable financing conditions, which to a large extent reflected the current accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that patience continued to be warranted as the full effects of the monetary policy measures were still unfolding, given the transmission lags with which policy was feeding through to the ultimate objective, and which, in the wake of private and public sector balance sheet adjustments, were likely to be longer than usual.",
        "Members widely agreed that in December the Governing Council would be in a better position to form a firmer view on the inflation outlook and the progress being made in achieving a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, with a view to considering the appropriate implications for the monetary policy stance.",
        "In December the Governing Council would have the benefit of the latest incoming data, the new Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections extending through to 2019 and the results of the work of the Eurosystem committees on the options to ensure the smooth implementation of the APP until March 2017, or beyond, if necessary.",
        "The view was widely shared among members that a discussion on the changes to the technical parameters of the APP should not be separate from an assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook and the implications this might have for the appropriate monetary policy stance.",
        "The questions of how to ensure the smooth implementation of the APP until March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and how to preserve the very substantial monetary support that was necessary in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% were seen to be closely linked.",
        "Members took note of the ongoing technical work of the committees that was designed to ensure a smooth execution of the programme until March 2017, or beyond, if necessary.",
        "All in all, members widely shared the view that it was imperative to remain fully committed to preserving the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation that was necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "Financing conditions had to remain supportive to underpin the recovery in growth and inflation, also in the face of weak underlying price pressures and prevailing uncertainties.",
        "The Governing Council had to remain fully determined to execute its asset purchases in line with its past decisions and to adopt further measures, if needed, to put inflation back on a sustainable path towards levels compatible with its inflation aim.",
        "As regards communication, members broadly agreed with the proposals put forward by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "A balanced communication was warranted which would provide reassurance about the Governing Council’s commitment to preserve the very substantial amount of monetary support that was necessary to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% without undue delay, while at the same time being mindful not to trigger undue expectations in financial markets about future monetary policy action.",
        "Accordingly, the Governing Council should, fully in line with its previous communication, reiterate its forward guidance on asset purchases and policy rates, whereby the monthly asset purchases of €80 billion were intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "Moreover, policy rates continued to be expected to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.",
        "To this end, it was important to underline the Governing Council’s ability and readiness to act, if warranted, to achieve its objective by using all the instruments available within its mandate.",
        "Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided to keep the interest rates on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.",
        "Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirmed that the monthly asset purchases of €80 billion were intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until it saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "Mr Cœuré reviewed recent financial market developments.",
        "Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 2-3 December 2015, developments in China had reverberated across global markets.",
        "Among other indicators, the Chinese Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had been weaker than expected, which had fuelled further concerns among market participants about growth prospects in China and had led to capital outflows.",
        "Chinese equity markets had also experienced significant declines on 4 and 7 January 2016.",
        "Oil prices had reached 12-year lows and were still declining, with the Brent crude oil price standing at USD 27.9 per barrel at the close of 20 January 2016.",
        "This decline seemed to have been triggered by continued imbalances between supply and demand.",
        "Euro five-year forward inflation-linked swap rates five years ahead appeared to be moving in line with commodity prices again.",
        "Following the tight correlation recorded over 2014-15 between the five-year forward rates and the spot oil price, some signs of decoupling had been observed at the end of 2015.",
        "The recent decoupling appeared to have come to a halt and the five-year forward rates had moved downwards again in the wake of lower oil prices, warranting further analysis.",
        "The combination of developments in China and in the oil market had contributed to increased risk aversion globally, particularly in emerging market economies.",
        "The impact on emerging market economies was evident first in terms of the pressure on their currencies, either prompting a downward trend in the case of floating currencies or creating downward pressure in the case of pegged currencies.",
        "The currencies of oil-producing countries were also under pressure because of market participants’ perception that currency devaluation was a way for those economies to adjust to lower oil prices and to align prices expressed in local currencies with the costs of oil production.",
        "Global equity and government bond markets had also been affected.",
        "Since early December the EURO STOXX 50 index had declined by around 17% and the Standard & Poor’s 500 index by close to 11%.",
        "At the same time, increased risk aversion had translated into markedly lower yields in the United States, Japan and the euro area.",
        "Until mid-January yields on lower-rated euro area government bonds had also benefited from safe-haven flows.",
        "The implementation of the expanded asset purchase programme (APP) had resumed smoothly after the Christmas season.",
        "Since the early December 2015 Governing Council meeting, market expectations of monetary policy action had evolved.",
        "Starting with the United States, expectations of monetary policy tightening had declined and, by 20 January, the market was pricing in only one rate hike in 2016.",
        "The entire expected interest rate path had been repriced significantly downwards, shifting the timing of subsequent policy actions by around six months.",
        "In the euro area, EONIA forward rates on 20 January 2016 had reverted to the levels prevailing before the Governing Council’s meeting on 2-3 December 2015 for most contracts, pointing to expectations of additional ECB measures in the first half of 2016.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Global growth remained modest and uneven, amid heightened uncertainty, with continued moderate growth in advanced economies and weak developments in emerging market economies.",
        "The global composite output PMI had declined slightly in December, while remaining in expansionary territory.",
        "Global trade had continued to recover from low levels, though at a somewhat slower pace.",
        "Quarter-on-quarter growth in global goods imports had weakened from 2.3% in September to 1.8% in October.",
        "The global PMI for new export orders had also declined in December, but remained above the threshold of 50, suggesting continued, albeit modest, trade growth for the period ahead.",
        "Global inflation remained low, with annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area standing at 0.7% in November, after 0.6% in October.",
        "Excluding food and energy, inflation had been unchanged from October, at 1.8%.",
        "Since early December 2015, Brent crude oil prices had fallen by 36% to around USD 28 per barrel, while non-oil commodity prices were only slightly lower than in early December, by around 3%.",
        "Over the same period, the euro had appreciated by 4.6% in nominal effective terms vis-à-vis the currencies of 38 major trading partners.",
        "In the euro area, real GDP had continued to grow at a moderate pace, rising by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2015, largely driven by private consumption on the back of higher real disposable income for households, while investment dynamics remained weak.",
        "Industrial production (excluding construction) had also been weak in November, although remaining slightly above its third-quarter average, while survey-based information had been more positive.",
        "Both the composite output PMI and the Economic Sentiment Indicator had been slightly higher on average in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter and remained above their long-term averages.",
        "Looking ahead, private consumption was expected to remain the key driver of the economic recovery, while investment dynamics should over time benefit from gradual improvements in demand, from higher profit margins and sizeable accumulated corporate savings, as well as from continued favourable financing conditions.",
        "According to the January 2016 bank lending survey for the euro area, loan supply conditions had improved, both for households and enterprises, and loan demand had been on the rise, especially for loans to enterprises.",
        "Real GDP growth forecasts from the private sector and other international institutions remained broadly in line with the December 2015 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "For instance, in the January 2016 update of the World Economic Outlook, IMF staff had revised their outlook for euro area growth for 2016 upwards, by 0.1 percentage point, to 1.7%, in line with the December Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "In addition, the results of the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the first quarter of 2016, scheduled for release on 22 January 2016, had remained unchanged from the previous quarter’s results and were thus also broadly consistent with the December Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Turning to recent price developments, euro area HICP inflation had stood at 0.2% in December 2015, after 0.1% in November, which was significantly lower than expected.",
        "This reflected the renewed sharp decline in oil prices and lower food price inflation that had largely offset the anticipated upward base effect stemming from the energy component.",
        "Underlying inflation, as measured by the HICP excluding food and energy, had been unchanged in December from November, at 0.9%, continuing to hover between 0.9% and 1.1% since August 2015.",
        "Import prices had remained the main source of upward pipeline pressure, while domestic producer prices and nominal wages remained subdued.",
        "The sharp decline in oil prices and the downward shift in the oil futures curve had significantly dampened the inflation outlook for 2016 in the euro area, possibly increasing the risk of second-round effects.",
        "Concerning inflation expectations, survey and market-based indicators had declined since early December 2015.",
        "The latest SPF implied average inflation expectations of 0.7%, 1.4% and 1.6% for 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively.",
        "This represented a downward revision of 0.3 percentage point for 2016 and of 0.1 percentage point for 2017.",
        "These downward revisions from the previous SPF round mainly reflected oil price developments and continued subdued labour costs.",
        "Average longer-term inflation expectations for 2020 had been revised down from 1.86% to 1.80%.",
        "The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead was 1.6%, around 20 basis points lower than in early December 2015.",
        "This decline partly reflected the weaker inflation dynamics which had been driven by the renewed sharp fall in oil prices.",
        "In the same vein, the price of deflation protection in the options markets had increased slightly compared with early December.",
        "Regarding financial and monetary conditions, the euro area yield curve, which had shifted upwards after the early December 2015 Governing Council meeting, had again declined across maturities.",
        "At the same time, the EONIA forward curve had become steeper than a year ago and markets appeared to price in a rise in the EONIA starting as early as the first half of 2017.",
        "Indices of broad financial conditions covering movements in euro area government bond, stock and foreign exchange markets had tightened and euro area stock prices, in particular for financial sector equities, had declined sharply, in an environment of increased global uncertainty.",
        "The composite cost of bank borrowing for non-financial corporations had remained broadly unchanged in November 2015.",
        "Overall, between August 2008 and November 2015 the decline in bank lending rates had been broadly similar across the large euro area countries, indicating a considerable improvement in monetary policy transmission.",
        "Moreover, the spread between the interest rates charged on very small loans and those charged on large loans in the euro area had decreased further in November.",
        "The overall nominal cost of external financing for euro area non-financial corporations was estimated to have increased somewhat since the early December 2015 meeting.",
        "Turning to money and credit, annual M3 growth had remained robust at 5.1% in November 2015, after 5.3% in October, supported by low interest rates as well as the impact of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations and the APP.",
        "In addition to the most liquid components contained in M3, purchases under the APP were a major contributor to M3 growth.",
        "At the same time, there was evidence that in the period from March to November 2015 non-residents and, to a lesser extent, banks – rather than money-holding sectors – had carried out the majority of net sales related to the public sector purchase programme.",
        "Euro area loan dynamics had continued to improve gradually in November 2015 for both firms and households.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for sales and securitisation) had increased to 0.9%, up from 0.6% in October.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to households had increased further, to 1.4%, after 1.2% in October.",
        "Regarding fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was expected to become mildly expansionary on average over the projection horizon 2015-17, partly on account of projected increases in government expenditure in response to the strong refugee influx, the longer-term economic effects and broader policy implications of which were difficult to assess at the current juncture.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet recalled that, at its December 2015 monetary policy meeting, the Governing Council had decided to recalibrate its monetary policy stance in view of continued weak price pressures and renewed downside risks to growth and inflation.",
        "The decisions to extend the monthly net asset purchases of €60 billion to at least the end of March 2017, and to reinvest the principal payments on maturing securities for as long as necessary, had been fully appropriate.",
        "Since then, incoming information had confirmed that the euro area economic recovery was continuing and there was good evidence that the monetary policy measures in place were working.",
        "However, downside risks had increased again since the beginning of the current year, amid heightened uncertainty about the growth prospects of emerging market economies, volatility in financial markets and geopolitical risks.",
        "To some extent, the risks that the Governing Council had already identified in September 2015 and recalled at the December meeting might at present be materialising.",
        "Inflation had continued to be weaker than expected, mainly owing to the renewed sharp fall in oil prices, but also to persistently subdued underlying price pressures.",
        "Weaker than anticipated growth in wages, in conjunction with declining inflation expectations, could also signal increased risks of second-round effects.",
        "At the same time, financial market conditions in the euro area had clearly deteriorated since the early December Governing Council meeting, although the magnitude and persistence of these developments were still uncertain.",
        "Cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the monetary policy measures that were in place, but also the need to review, and possibly reconsider, the monetary policy stance at the next monetary policy meeting in early March when the new ECB staff macroeconomic projections would be available, in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "In the meantime, work needed to be carried out to ensure that all technical conditions were in place to allow the full range of policy options to be available for implementation, if needed, and to assess the effectiveness of potential measures.",
        "Moreover, to strengthen the language on the readiness to act, if needed, but also to offset some of the tightening of financial conditions that had been observed since the December monetary policy meeting, the Governing Council could reaffirm its forward guidance on interest rates, highlighting that it expected its key policy rates to remain at current or lower levels for an extended period of time.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly supported the assessment of the outlook and risks for euro area economic activity, as provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Recent data confirmed that the economic recovery was proceeding, supported mainly by resilient domestic demand but faced with growing uncertainty about the global economic outlook.",
        "Risks were considered to remain on the downside and related, in particular, to heightened volatility in financial and commodity markets and increased uncertainty about the economic outlook for emerging market economies.",
        "While some recent hard data had been slightly below expectations, employment growth had remained robust and some sentiment indicators had surprised on the upside, showing some resilience to the heightened global uncertainty.",
        "Overall, these recent data suggested that real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016 was still expected to be close to the level foreseen in the December 2015 Eurosystem staff projections and to remain above estimates of potential growth.",
        "The impact of the recent sharp decline in energy prices on the outlook for euro area economic activity was highlighted.",
        "Lower energy prices were generally considered to be a supporting factor for euro area demand growth, in particular through their positive impact on household real disposable income and corporate profits.",
        "However, it was also cautioned that, from a general equilibrium perspective, the recent decline in oil prices had to be seen against a backdrop of a slowdown in global growth and heightened volatility and uncertainty, hence the net impact could be less positive.",
        "Looking at the medium term, the baseline scenario for real GDP growth in the euro area was generally considered to have remained broadly unchanged.",
        "In addition to the impact of lower energy prices, the recovery was expected to continue to be supported by the monetary policy measures taken by the ECB since mid-2014 and their pass-through to lending conditions for households and firms, as well as by a slightly accommodative fiscal stance.",
        "Concerns were nevertheless expressed that some of the downside risks to growth, as identified in the previous monetary policy meeting, in particular related to emerging market economies, had already partly materialised and were likely to affect negatively the outlook for euro area growth.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the continuing, or even deepening, dichotomy between relatively resilient domestic demand and weakening external demand.",
        "Looking ahead, it remained to be seen whether robust growth in domestic demand could continue to offset weakness in external demand.",
        "Commenting in more detail on the outlook for external demand, concerns were expressed that global economic growth and global trade growth were decelerating in a context of heightened volatility in global financial and commodity markets and weaker global confidence.",
        "The environment had deteriorated in emerging market economies in particular.",
        "The recent volatility in emerging market financial conditions, including sharp declines in local stock and bond markets, was partly related to expectations of a more pronounced slowdown in these economies.",
        "In China, the ongoing economic rebalancing, which was in itself desirable and in line with past calls from the international community, could turn out to be more pronounced than expected and trigger a hard landing.",
        "In addition, global geopolitical uncertainties remained elevated and had increased further since the December 2015 monetary policy meeting, in particular in the Middle East.",
        "Concerning the advanced economies, some positive developments were highlighted regarding the US economy, where incoming data had continued to improve over the past few months.",
        "In particular, employment data pointed to continued robustness of the US economic recovery.",
        "At the same time, the recent improvements in US employment appeared to be largely concentrated in low wage segments of the labour force and could therefore have a limited impact on disposable income and consumption, notwithstanding a relatively higher propensity of low wage earners to consume.",
        "Additional factors weighing on US growth were the nominal effective appreciation of the US dollar and the uncertainty regarding the outcome of the US presidential elections.",
        "Some market economists had recently started to discuss the possibility of a recession in the United States during 2016.",
        "Euro area net export demand was also seen to be influenced by developments in the euro exchange rate.",
        "Since the last monetary policy meeting the euro exchange rate had been relatively stable against the US dollar, but it had appreciated against other currencies, in particular those of emerging market economies.",
        "Relevant factors in this context were heightened uncertainties about emerging market developments and potential changes in monetary policy expectations across the globe, as well as idiosyncratic factors such as market concerns about a “Brexit” and its impact on the pound sterling.",
        "Turning to euro area domestic demand, relatively resilient private consumption was seen as the main driver of growth in the period ahead.",
        "Real disposable income was benefiting from low inflation and favourable terms of trade effects following the sharp decline in oil prices, as well as from improvements in labour market conditions.",
        "In addition, euro area households appeared to have a relatively high propensity to use their recent real disposable income gains for consumption, as suggested by the broad stability of the household savings rate observed over past quarters.",
        "At the same time, it was flagged that low inflation and high real incomes could in turn lead to lower wage demands and could thus dampen the growth of real disposable income in the period ahead, thereby acting as a drag on consumption.",
        "Data on investment growth were generally considered to remain weak.",
        "Concerning business investment, it was argued that the conditions for a pick-up were largely in place, as external borrowing costs were low and ample internal financing was available.",
        "The latter was supported by the recent recovery in profit margins and by the increasing net lending position of the non-financial corporate sector, reflecting the excess of strong savings over weak investment, which was unusual at the current stage of the economic recovery.",
        "Furthermore, advances in structural reforms across the euro area should be laying the foundation for future investment growth.",
        "Nevertheless, despite these favourable conditions, private investors still appeared to be cautious, possibly owing to uncertainty and the subdued outlook for potential growth.",
        "With regard to public investment, it was remarked that national authorities were making insufficient use of available fiscal space to increase public investment.",
        "At the European level, the European Commission’s Investment Plan for Europe may not yet be yielding sufficient results.",
        "Overall, the risks to the outlook for economic growth were generally seen as remaining tilted to the downside and as having increased since the December 2015 monetary policy meeting.",
        "Risks mainly stemmed from the external environment and included the possibility of a stronger than expected slowdown in global growth, in particular in emerging market economies, and of renewed increases in financial and commodity market volatility.",
        "Concerns were voiced that the policy space was relatively limited at the global level to counter a scenario of a protracted growth slowdown accompanied by market instability.",
        "At the same time, it was also highlighted that emerging market economies still had a wide array of available instruments to counter any further deterioration in economic or financial conditions.",
        "Views were exchanged on the resilience of the euro area to potential negative shocks from the global economy.",
        "On the one hand, the euro area had thus far demonstrated a relatively high degree of resilience, as reflected in confidence indicators available up to the year-end.",
        "On the other hand, euro area financial markets had been affected by the recent increase in global risk aversion and some concern was voiced that global shocks could again have different effects on the financial markets of individual euro area countries.",
        "Members underlined that, in order to strengthen the prospects for sustained output growth, determined policy action was needed at the national and European levels.",
        "In particular, available fiscal space should be used to promote productive investment and it was important to recall that fiscal consolidation should follow a growth-friendly course.",
        "A suggestion was made that the relevant authorities could examine the potential for tax shifts away from labour and towards consumption.",
        "With regard to structural reforms, continued progress was seen as important to strengthen potential growth and encourage private investment.",
        "Finally, at the European level, progress in further deepening governance reforms was flagged as important to bolster confidence and counter potential negative external shocks.",
        "Broad support was expressed for the assessment of the outlook and risks for euro area prices, as presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Annual HICP inflation was 0.2% in December 2015, well below the path implied by the December 2015 staff projections, mainly owing to a sharp decline in oil prices and lower than expected services price inflation.",
        "The recent oil price developments were likely to imply a significantly lower path of annual HICP inflation in 2016, which could turn negative for a number of months.",
        "Over the medium term inflation was expected to pick up in line with the baseline scenario of a continued economic recovery.",
        "The balance of risks to the inflation outlook was seen as tilted to the downside, as the prolonged period of low headline inflation could affect underlying inflation and trigger second-round effects, which had to be monitored closely.",
        "A more complete analysis would become available with the March 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections and the quarterly monetary assessment by staff.",
        "To assess the outlook for prices, it was seen as important to better understand the drivers of energy price developments.",
        "On the one hand, it was highlighted that the low price elasticity of oil supply implied that production capacity was not adjusting quickly to lower demand, suggesting that a prolonged period of low oil prices, or even a further drop, could not be ruled out.",
        "A structural break in the relationship between volumes and prices had been observed, which could be due to geopolitical factors, the increasing importance of shale oil and the reduced pricing power of OPEC.",
        "On the other hand, the point was made that the current supply overhang had already started to decline according to some indicators and could dissipate more quickly than expected, even if anecdotal evidence of a significant adjustment in investment and employment in the oil industry had not yet appeared to translate into significant supply reductions.",
        "This implied that a later upward correction could also not be ruled out.",
        "Finally, the question was raised of whether there would be a technical floor to oil prices, reflecting cost structures on the supply side.",
        "Another element requiring further analysis was the impact of persistently low headline inflation on underlying inflation.",
        "Concerns were expressed that measures of underlying inflation had remained subdued and the pick-up had stalled since the summer of 2015.",
        "This was explained by direct and indirect effects of low energy prices, among other factors.",
        "In the December 2015 HICP data, for instance, lower than expected services price increases were largely driven by lower transportation costs.",
        "In the period ahead it was to be expected that such direct and indirect effects of lower energy prices would be further transmitted through various components of the HICP and could thus also have an impact on core inflation.",
        "At the same time, a few arguments were also advanced supporting the relative stability of, or a renewed pick-up in, underlying inflation in the period ahead.",
        "Reference was made to producer price inflation, which had rebounded somewhat despite the recent decline in energy prices, as well as to the GDP deflator, which indicated somewhat higher underlying inflation and suggested upward potential for future HICP inflation if the two measures converged over the medium term, as had typically been the case in the past.",
        "Underlying inflation should also recover as the corporate sector regained pricing power over time and further rebuilt margins.",
        "In addition to the direct and indirect effects of low energy prices, members discussed the risk that the protracted period of low headline inflation in the euro area could alter wage dynamics and trigger second-round effects.",
        "On the one hand, it was argued that relatively subdued wage growth in recent months should in itself not be taken as direct evidence of second-round effects, but could also reflect the lagged impact of past and ongoing necessary adjustments in relative prices and wages across euro area economies to regain competitiveness and support employment.",
        "In this context, wage moderation was seen to reflect the impact of past structural reforms, as well as an increased focus by social partners on the need to preserve employment growth, which also had to be viewed in conjunction with the associated slowdown in labour productivity that needed to be taken into account in assessing the price outlook.",
        "On the other hand, concerns were expressed that recent wage dynamics could point to incipient signs of second-round effects, whereby wage dynamics might become increasingly driven by past inflation rates.",
        "Reference was made to evidence from recent wage contracts in one euro area country.",
        "Moreover, while recent wage-setting behaviour was still compatible with a range of estimations of the Phillips curve, it also seemed that outcomes were at the lower end of the spectrum of estimations.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the evolution of inflation expectations, which had declined since the last meeting according to both the survey-based measures from the latest round of the SPF and market-based measures, as reported in the introductions by Mr Cœuré and Mr Praet.",
        "In this context, it was noted that measures of inflation expectations had recently been strongly influenced by oil prices again.",
        "It was, however, also recalled that caution was needed when using market-based measures of inflation expectations, as they appeared to be heavily influenced by risk premia and liquidity premia.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) had recorded a solid annual growth rate, which continued to be mainly supported by its most liquid components.",
        "Recent data were seen to confirm positive signals from monetary developments, supported by low opportunity costs and the monetary policy measures in place.",
        "It was recalled that the analysis undertaken under the monetary pillar traditionally provided information on the outlook for consumer prices, but was also relevant for assessing developments in asset prices and residential property prices.",
        "The dynamics of loans to both non-financial corporations and households had firmed further, according to the latest data from November 2015, and lending conditions had continued to improve, supported by the effective pass-through of the monetary policy measures taken since June 2014 to the cost of borrowing.",
        "The January 2016 bank lending survey for the euro area pointed to further improvements in demand for bank loans, supported by the low level of interest rates, financing needs for investment purposes and housing market prospects.",
        "Credit standards had eased further on loans to enterprises, notably owing to increasing competitive pressures in retail banking, and had reverted to a net easing on loans to households for house purchase.",
        "It was underlined that credit developments had been on a continuous gradual recovery path since the beginning of 2014 and, while money and credit growth were not yet at levels that would signal inflationary pressures, indicators were pointing in an upward direction.",
        "Against the background of recent market concerns over parts of some euro area countries’ banking sectors which might have implications for their lending capacity in the period ahead, a remark was made that in large measure these concerns had been triggered by misperceptions about ongoing supervisory activities regarding bank practices for management of non-performing loans and the banking sector’s need to adapt to the new regulatory environment.",
        "In this context, it was seen as important to counter the misperception that this would result in additional provisioning or capital requirements.",
        "All actors at the European and the national level were called upon to cooperate closely and to communicate clearly, in line with the respective responsibilities assigned under the new regulatory and supervisory framework.",
        "A call was also made for euro area governments to take the necessary steps to achieve the full completion of the banking union.",
        "In this context, it was recalled that the comprehensive assessment in 2014 had been instrumental in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in the banking sector, had helped to build confidence and had strengthened banks’ balance sheets, thereby supporting overall lending conditions and the provision of credit.",
        "Nonetheless, it was noted that stock adjustments in financial sector balance sheets, related to remaining levels of legacy debt, were still ongoing and that the healing of the banking sector would take time to complete.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "While incoming information had confirmed the ongoing moderate recovery and had provided solid evidence that the monetary policy measures were working as intended, downside risks had increased again amid heightened uncertainty about the growth prospects of emerging market economies, volatility in the financial and commodity markets and geopolitical risks.",
        "Moreover, inflation dynamics had continued to be weaker than expected, which, in conjunction with declining inflation expectations, had increased the risk of second-round effects.",
        "It was, therefore, recommended to review and possibly reconsider the monetary policy stance at the next monetary policy meeting in early March, when the new ECB staff macroeconomic projections would be available.",
        "In addition, it needed to be reaffirmed that policy rates would remain at current or lower levels for an extended period of time.",
        "In the meantime, work needed to be carried out to ensure that all the technical conditions were in place to make the full range of policy options available for implementation, if needed.",
        "Taking stock of the evidence available at the beginning of 2016, members widely agreed that the latest data had been consistent with a continued and effective pass-through of the monetary policy measures that had been adopted since mid-2014.",
        "The stimulus introduced had contributed to an improvement in financing conditions and credit provision, supporting the real economy, and had strengthened the euro area’s resilience to recent global economic shocks.",
        "In particular, the measures had helped to ease borrowing conditions for the private sector and had promoted loan creation.",
        "The exchange rate channel was viewed as also playing an important role in the transmission of the monetary policy measures to the broader economy.",
        "It was noted that more recently, however, this channel had weakened owing in particular to the depreciation of the currencies of emerging market economies.",
        "The decisions taken by the Governing Council in early December 2015 to extend the intended end date of the monthly net asset purchases of €60 billion to at least the end of March 2017 and to reinvest the principal payments on maturing securities for as long as necessary were seen as appropriate.",
        "Reference was made to the figure quoted by the President in his speech in New York in early December, whereby the extension of net purchases to at least March 2017 and the reinvestment policy would add about €680 billion in liquidity to the system by 2019, amounting to about two-thirds of the original size of the expanded APP as decided in January 2015.",
        "This would contribute to ample excess liquidity conditions in the euro area money market for an extended period of time and, thus, strengthen the Governing Council’s forward guidance on interest rates.",
        "There was broad agreement among members that, since that start of the current year, downside risks had increased again.",
        "Although the recovery of the euro area economy was holding up well and financing conditions remained favourable overall, the external environment was characterised by heightened uncertainty about the growth prospects of emerging market economies, volatility in the financial and commodity markets and geopolitical risks.",
        "In this environment, euro area inflation dynamics had continued to be weaker than expected.",
        "There were stronger signs again that repeated downward revisions of the inflation outlook were feeding through to inflation expectations, which had again increased the probability of the euro area economy remaining in a low inflation environment for an extended period of time.",
        "In the light of prevailing uncertainties and volatility, members considered it premature to conclude on policy action at the current meeting and to discuss precise policy options that could be taken, if needed.",
        "Instead, further thorough analysis was required by early March when the new macroeconomic projections, including those for 2018, and an updated quarterly monetary assessment would be available from staff.",
        "The discussion would then benefit from a more comprehensive picture of the economic situation and of the medium-term price outlook, including a deeper analysis of potential second-round effects.",
        "In this context, views were exchanged about the appropriate way of dealing with increased risks and uncertainty.",
        "The point was made that, in a situation in which risks were predominantly on the downside and new downside risks were emerging, it would be preferable to act pre-emptively, taking emerging risks into account, rather than to wait until after risks had fully materialised.",
        "However, a remark was also made cautioning against adopting an explicit risk-based approach to monetary policy, driven mainly by “insurance” motives, given the difficulties in assessing, commonly agreeing and communicating on tail risks.",
        "Against this background, it was considered necessary to review and possibly reconsider the monetary policy stance at the Governing Council’s next monetary policy meeting in early March, as had been suggested by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "In this context, the commitment needed to be reinforced that the Governing Council was willing and able to take further monetary policy action, if warranted, reaffirming that the Governing Council had a broad range of instruments and tools at its disposal.",
        "In this regard, further technical analysis was called for to deepen the Governing Council’s understanding of the effectiveness of the available instruments and to take into account possible side effects.",
        "It was concluded that work needed to be carried out to ensure that all the technical conditions were in place to make the full range of policy options available for implementation, if needed.",
        "There was wide agreement among members that emphasis needed to be placed on appropriate communication.",
        "This pertained to conveying the Governing Council’s assessment in a way that avoided complacency on the deteriorating price outlook while also avoiding conveying an unduly gloomy message that, in turn, could contribute to self-fulfilling dynamics.",
        "The Governing Council needed to strike a balance between signalling clearly its full capacity, willingness and determination to act and, at the same time, not implying that policy action had already been decided when the economic environment remained very fluid.",
        "In this regard, the President’s New York speech in early December 2015 was mentioned as covering important messages which could become part of a common communication, while taking into account changing conditions.",
        "The Governing Council needed to reiterate that monetary policy was firmly committed to achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "It should emphasise the effectiveness of the instruments that had been activated since mid-2014, and recall that a substantial degree of accommodation was still in the pipeline, which would take time to fully unfold and pass through to the euro area economy.",
        "Moreover, it needed to be reaffirmed that, if the Governing Council had to intensify the use of the available range of policy options in order to achieve its price stability mandate, it would not hesitate to do so.",
        "Reassurance needed to be given that the Governing Council had a variety of instruments at its disposal to respond to circumstances and that there was no limit to how far it was willing to deploy instruments within its mandate to achieve the objective of inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "This would help to anchor inflation expectations and underline the significant differences in the monetary policy cycles between major advanced economies.",
        "At the same time, it had to be avoided, by means of appropriate communication, that markets developed undue or excessive expectations about future policy action, bearing in mind the market volatility experienced around the December 2015 monetary policy meeting.",
        "The ECB’s monetary policy should be predictable but – while conveying that the Governing Council was active and alert – should not be seen as being pre-committed or geared to fulfilling prevailing undue market expectations.",
        "It was underlined that the ECB’s monetary policy was data driven and that further analysis and information had to be gathered for a comprehensive review of the monetary policy stance at the Governing Council’s next monetary policy meeting.",
        "Members concurred with Mr Praet that the forward guidance on interest rates needed to be reaffirmed in the Governing Council’s communication.",
        "This would reassure markets about the need to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy stance for a long time to come and, thereby, contribute to ensuring favourable financial conditions beyond the shorter term, also supported by the reinvestment policy decided in December 2015.",
        "It was therefore agreed to refer again expressly to the forward guidance formulation that had been last used in this form in the President’s introductory statement in May 2014, when the Governing Council had expected the ECB’s key policy rates to remain at current or lower levels for an extended period of time.",
        "In order to underpin the ECB’s commitment to its price stability objective, it was seen as warranted to reassert firmly the Governing Council’s faithfulness to its monetary policy strategy and the symmetry of its commitment to do what was necessary to attain its stated aim of achieving HICP inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.",
        "While inflation could deviate from this aim owing to short-term developments and economic shocks, more lasting deviations could be misinterpreted as a lack of willingness to act or as a lack of effectiveness of monetary policy.",
        "A view was put forward in this regard that, in order to counter misperceptions of an asymmetric interpretation and to underline the symmetry of the ECB’s mandate, it appeared logical from a medium-term perspective for the Governing Council, after a prolonged period of undershooting of its inflation aim, to consider a limited period of overshooting in future.",
        "The view was shared that, in the present circumstances, the Governing Council needed to reaffirm forcefully its commitment to do what was necessary to attain its stated aim of achieving HICP inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, as communicated following the Governing Council’s monetary policy strategy evaluation in 2003, reflecting a number of reasons that remained valid.",
        "These reasons pertained to the need for a safety margin to guard against possible risks of deflation, the possible existence of a small, but positive, bias in the measurement of inflation and the need to allow for a margin that would facilitate price adjustments in a currency union.",
        "While monetary policy had to focus continuously on delivering on its price stability objective, a strong call was made for other policy areas to step up, decisively, their efforts to strengthen sustainable growth prospects in the euro area, which was outside the realm of monetary policy.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that the different policy domains had to contribute in their respective areas of responsibility in a consistent manner and that a concerted policy effort was needed.",
        "It was underlined that an environment with a very accommodative monetary policy stance had favourable effects on government budgets and that fiscal policy could play a role in supporting the economic recovery via a growth-friendly composition, budgetary rebalancing and increased public investment, while remaining in full compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.",
        "Similarly, the ECB’s monetary policy also provided governments with a supportive environment in which to make progress with structural reforms to boost job creation and increase growth potential in the euro area.",
        "The swift and effective implementation of these reforms, in an environment of an accommodative monetary policy, would not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but would also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes and accelerate the benefits of reforms, thereby making the euro area more resilient to global shocks.",
        "Finally, it was important that euro area governments made further progress on common, and more integrated, European economic governance, working towards the completion of EMU as set out in the proposals made in the five Presidents’ report.",
        "Taking into account the views expressed by the members of the Governing Council, based on the regular assessment of the economic and monetary analyses underlying the medium-term outlook for price stability, the President ascertained that the Governing Council was unanimous in concluding that the monetary policy stance needed to be reviewed and possibly reconsidered at the Governing Council’s next monetary policy meeting in early March 2016, when the new ECB staff macroeconomic projections would be available, in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2%.",
        "In addition, it was reaffirmed that policy rates would remain at current or lower levels for an extended period of time.",
        "In the meantime, while the asset purchases were proceeding smoothly, work needed to be carried out to ensure that all the technical conditions were in place to make the full range of policy options available for implementation, if needed.",
        "On a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.30% respectively.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting.",
        "The Vice-President reviewed the latest financial market developments, in the absence of Mr Cœuré.",
        "The most significant event since the previous monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council on 1-2 June 2016 had been the outcome of the UK referendum on membership of the European Union on 23 June.",
        "Although the outcome had led to a significant decline in government bond yields, overall the consequences had thus far been less marked than many had anticipated.",
        "In the foreign exchange market, market turnover had peaked for GBP/USD around the time of the UK referendum, but the level of stress had been contained, with no evidence of disorderly price movements.",
        "The outcome of the referendum had been immediately reflected in currency valuations, via a sharp decrease in the effective exchange rate of the pound sterling.",
        "The euro had depreciated initially vis-à-vis the US dollar but overall had shown resilience and, in nominal effective terms, was trading at around the same level as in early June.",
        "The Japanese yen had appreciated, whereas the depreciating trend of the Chinese renminbi vis-à-vis the US dollar, which had prevailed over the past three months, had gathered pace following the UK referendum.",
        "In the foreign exchange swap market, EUR/USD swaps had only been temporarily affected, as reflected in a short-lived contraction in trading volumes.",
        "Turning to equity markets, broad stock market indices had fallen initially on 24 June 2016, but most had recovered quickly, with the exception of the indices for UK domestic corporates and European banks.",
        "In the bond market, yields on US, Japanese and German government bonds had fallen to all-time lows after the referendum, but had recovered slightly in the days before the current meeting on the back of improved risk sentiment.",
        "The observed decline in yields on higher-rated government bonds was mainly related to strong safe-haven flows, but also to expectations of lower growth and of ensuing expansionary monetary policy measures, which had been triggered by the outcome of the UK referendum.",
        "Money markets had continued to function smoothly, in spite of the increase in uncertainty as a result of the UK referendum.",
        "Semester-end tensions had also remained relatively contained, supported by the environment of high excess liquidity.",
        "Turning to the implementation of Eurosystem monetary policy measures, the net liquidity effect of the first in the new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-II) had been €38 billion, as banks had largely replaced TLTRO-I funding with the more attractive TLTRO-II funding.",
        "Additional demand could be expected for the forthcoming TLTRO-II operations, as counterparties could take the opportunity to diversify the maturity profile of their TLTRO participation and tap one of the later operations for additional funding.",
        "Implementation of the asset purchase programme had proceeded smoothly, notwithstanding market reports of emerging scarcity in some market segments.",
        "The initial purchases under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) in June 2016 had gone well.",
        "Finally, monetary policy expectations had been repriced significantly in the aftermath of the UK referendum.",
        "The most significant revisions had occurred for the United Kingdom.",
        "In the United States, market expectations for the timing of a rate increase had initially been scaled back following the UK referendum, although this had since reverted somewhat.",
        "Mr Praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.",
        "Global growth and inflation remained subdued.",
        "The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) was unchanged at 51.1 in June, with an increase in manufacturing being offset by a slower expansion of services.",
        "However, looking at quarterly developments, the PMI in the second quarter of 2016 was slightly below the level that had been recorded in the first quarter, at 51.3, down from 51.6.",
        "At the same time, the PMI for emerging market economies suggested some further stabilisation in activity, while the PMI for advanced economies remained below the level seen towards the end of 2015.",
        "The July update of the IMF’s April 2016 World Economic Outlook (WEO) pointed to slight downward revisions to the global growth outlook, with the main revision relating to the growth outlook for the United Kingdom.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area had remained unchanged from April, at 0.8% in May, while inflation excluding food and energy had edged up to 1.9%, from 1.8%.",
        "On 19 July 2016 Brent crude oil prices had stood at USD 47 per barrel, around 4% lower than in early June, while non-oil commodity prices had increased by 3%.",
        "Over the same period the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro vis-à-vis 38 major trading partners had remained broadly stable.",
        "Turning to the euro area, the underlying growth momentum had remained moderate and broad based in the first quarter of 2016.",
        "Real GDP had increased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter, mainly driven by private consumption and investment.",
        "In May industrial production excluding construction had declined by 1.2%, month on month, and its average level in April and May had been 0.2% lower than in the first quarter.",
        "Looking at survey-based indicators, the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator had edged down in June, following strong increases in both May and April.",
        "The composite output PMI was 53.1 in June, unchanged from May, leading to a quarterly average in the second quarter of 2016 that was marginally below the average seen in the first quarter.",
        "Consumer confidence had declined somewhat in July, compared with June.",
        "However, it continued to point to strong consumption dynamics.",
        "Encouraging signs had come from euro area labour markets.",
        "Employment had increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2016, with positive growth across all major sectors and large euro area countries.",
        "Survey-based measures of employment expectations had also improved.",
        "In addition, the unemployment rate had decreased further, from 10.2% in April to 10.1% in May, the lowest level since August 2011, continuing a trend decline seen since mid-2013.",
        "Youth unemployment had also been declining since 2014 and, although it was still very high, at around 20% in the euro area, it had been falling rapidly in those countries that had been particularly hard hit by the crisis.",
        "Reflecting higher employment growth, nominal labour income had risen further in the first quarter of 2016, to 2.9%, year on year.",
        "Investment had also continued to strengthen in the first quarter of 2016 in both construction and non-construction sectors, notably in machinery and equipment.",
        "The recent recovery in the construction sector had mainly been driven by the improvement in housing markets, which, in turn, was linked to higher demand for housing.",
        "Housing demand had been supported by improving labour markets and favourable lending conditions, as well as fiscal incentives in some euro area countries.",
        "Turning to external factors, the annual growth of total goods exports had declined to 2.9% in the first quarter of 2016, down from 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2015, while total services exports had grown by 3.8%, year on year, in the first quarter of 2016, down from 7.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015.",
        "In addition, while monthly export growth had displayed some momentum in April 2016, it had weakened again in May and average annual extra-euro area goods export growth for April and May was -0.2%.",
        "The July update of the IMF’s WEO had revised down the outlook for euro area real GDP growth in 2017 by 0.2 percentage point, to 1.4%, while for 2016 there was a slight upward revision of 0.1 percentage point, to 1.6%.",
        "This compared with 1.6% and 1.7% for 2016 and 2017 respectively in the June 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.",
        "The ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the third quarter of 2016, which would be released on 22 July, also revealed downward revisions to euro area real GDP growth, following the UK leave vote, of 0.2 percentage point to 1.4% in 2017 and 0.1 percentage point to 1.6% in 2018.",
        "Following the UK referendum outcome the European Commission expected euro area real GDP growth to moderate somewhat, to 1.5-1.6% in 2016 and to 1.3-1.5% in 2017, compared with 1.6% and 1.8% respectively in its spring forecast.",
        "Turning to euro area price developments, headline HICP inflation had increased slightly in June to 0.1%, up from -0.1% in May, mainly reflecting higher energy and services price inflation.",
        "Underlying inflation, as measured by the HICP excluding food and energy, had risen from 0.8% in May to 0.9% in June, thus continuing to hover around 1%, as it had done since July 2015, and failing to show clear signs of an upward trend.",
        "Looking ahead, headline HICP inflation was expected to remain very low over the coming months, before starting to pick up later in 2016 mainly reflecting upward base effects in the annual rate of change of energy prices.",
        "Various inflation forecasts from the private sector and international organisations ranged from 0.2% to 0.3% for 2016, from 1.1% to 1.4% for 2017, and from 1.2% to 1.7% for 2018, with the June 2016 Eurosystem staff projections at 0.2%, 1.3% and 1.6% respectively.",
        "Updated forecasts that had become available after the UK leave vote saw only a limited effect on the outlook for inflation in the euro area.",
        "Looking at longer-term inflation expectations, survey-based measures had remained stable since the beginning of the year, according to the SPF for the third quarter of 2016, with five-year-ahead expectations continuing to stand at 1.8%.",
        "By contrast, market-based measures had declined in the run-up to the UK referendum and continued to do so thereafter – although they had recently rebounded somewhat, with the euro area five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead standing at 1.36%, compared with 1.48% at the time of the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "Inflation swap rates had also declined across all other maturities, reflecting, among other things, technical factors.",
        "In addition, it appeared that financial market participants continued to expect with some certainty that inflation would be low in the medium term, with the implied probability of inflation remaining only between 0% and 1.5% having increased again since the UK referendum.",
        "As regards financial and monetary conditions, the situation had remained broadly unchanged overall since the Governing Council’s meeting on 1-2 June.",
        "The EONIA forward yield curve had shifted downwards for all horizons and the euro area yield curve had flattened further.",
        "The GDP-weighted average of ten-year euro area sovereign bond yields had fallen considerably, from 1.1% in January 2016 to around 0.6% on 19 July.",
        "Sharp initial declines in equity prices after the UK leave vote had been reversing.",
        "Financing conditions had been favourable overall, with increasing financing flows to non-financial corporations (NFCs).",
        "For euro area banks, the UK leave vote came at a time when earnings expectations were already low.",
        "Since the previous monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council euro area bank equities had under-performed the overall stock market index by a wide margin.",
        "At the same time, the stock market index for NFCs had remained broadly unchanged compared with early June.",
        "Euro area corporate bond yields had been less affected by the referendum outcome than equity prices.",
        "While bank bonds had performed significantly better than bank equities, the resumption of the downward trend in bond yields recorded since January 2016 had been less pronounced for financial corporations than for NFCs.",
        "The overall cost of external financing for NFCs had declined slightly further since the Governing Council’s meeting on 1-2 June.",
        "At the same time, access to market-based funding had improved further overall, while bank lending remained important for the external financing of small and medium-sized enterprises.",
        "Bank lending rates to NFCs and households had declined further in May 2016, while retail deposit rates had stabilised at very low levels across euro area countries.",
        "Turning to money and credit, annual growth in M3 had remained robust at 4.9% in May 2016, after 4.6% in April, having hovered around 5% since mid-2015.",
        "The annual growth rate of M1 also remained solid, despite a further decline in May to 9.1%, down from 9.7% in April.",
        "The gradual recovery in bank lending to the euro area private sector continued to proceed at a modest pace.",
        "The annual growth rate of loans to NFCs (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) had recovered further in May to 1.4%, up from 1.2% in April, while the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 1.6% in May, thus remaining broadly stable since February 2016.",
        "According to the July 2016 bank lending survey for the euro area, the ongoing recovery in loan growth was supported by a further improvement in loan supply conditions for enterprises and households, as well as a continued increase in demand for all loan categories in the second quarter of 2016. Credit standards applied to the approval of loans to enterprises had eased further in the second quarter, notably driven by enhanced competition, while risk perception as a hampering factor, relevant during the crisis, had almost disappeared.",
        "The further easing of credit terms and conditions for loans to enterprises during the second quarter of 2016 reflected a narrowing of margins on average loans, whereas margins on riskier loans remained broadly unchanged.",
        "Net demand for loans to enterprises continued to increase.",
        "Looking at bank equity and credit supply, a close correlation between lagged developments in bank stock prices and loans to NFCs could be observed.",
        "However, it was not clear to what extent this correlation reflected leading indicator properties of stock markets for GDP, which was a fundamental driver of lending.",
        "With regard to fiscal policies, the fiscal stance in the euro area, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was expected to be mildly expansionary in 2016 and to turn broadly neutral in 2017 and 2018.",
        "Summing up, Mr Praet made the following points.",
        "First, incoming data since the Governing Council’s meeting on 1-2 June continued to point to moderate growth, supported by domestic demand.",
        "Inflation had turned positive in June 2016, mainly reflecting higher energy and services inflation.",
        "Yet, underlying price pressures continued to lack a convincing upward trend and remained an ongoing source of concern.",
        "This assessment was also confirmed by the signals coming from the monetary analysis.",
        "Overall, this pointed to the need to preserve an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay.",
        "Second, although difficult to assess at this juncture, the outcome of the UK referendum implied the materialisation of a downside risk countering the improvement in the balance of risks assessed by the Governing Council in early June.",
        "Third, nevertheless, financial markets had weathered the initial spike in volatility, following the UK referendum, with encouraging resilience.",
        "The readiness of central banks worldwide to provide liquidity, if needed, and a stringent regulatory and supervisory framework, as well as the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy measures, had all contributed to keeping market stress contained.",
        "Revised market expectations about future monetary policies in major jurisdictions might also have contributed to the aforementioned resilience.",
        "Fourth, developments in the bank lending channel warranted close monitoring.",
        "The latest bank lending survey confirmed that loan dynamics continued to improve, reflecting both improving loan supply conditions and increased loan demand.",
        "However, euro area banks were confronted with a number of challenges hampering the ability to generate capital, with potential adverse effects on the supply of credit.",
        "Finally, in terms of communication, Mr Praet recommended reiterating the following messages.",
        "First, given prevailing uncertainties, the Governing Council would continue to monitor economic and financial market developments very closely and would safeguard the pass-through of the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy to the real economy.",
        "When more information became available over the coming months, including the new ECB staff projections, the Governing Council would be in a better position to reassess the macroeconomic outlook.",
        "Second, the Governing Council should reiterate that, if warranted to achieve its objective of price stability, it would act by using all the instruments available within its mandate.",
        "With regard to the economic analysis, there was broad agreement among the members with the assessment, provided by Mr Praet in his introduction, of the outlook and risks for economic activity and price developments in the euro area.",
        "While it was too early to assess the impact of the outcome of the recent UK referendum, the latest data releases had confirmed that the recovery of the euro area economy was proceeding, supported by resilient domestic demand and an external environment which was still weak but showing signs of bottoming out, as well as by low oil prices.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to rise towards the end of this year, mainly on account of base effects, and to continue to increase over the coming years owing to the ongoing economic recovery, supported by the pass-through of the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "Overall, the outlook remained broadly in line with the June 2016 Eurosystem staff projections.",
        "Considering the outlook for the external environment, members noted that global growth continued to be weak, although there were signs of stabilisation.",
        "Growth in emerging market economies, in particular, showed signs of levelling off at rates that were still low by historical standards.",
        "Relatively stable oil prices had helped commodity-exporting economies to overcome the weakness that had started last year, while growth in China had increased recently, in part owing to policy measures.",
        "As regards advanced economies, the second quarter in the United States was expected to be stronger than the first, but signs of further weakness persisted in Japan.",
        "As for the United Kingdom, prospects for the economy would remain uncertain for some time after the referendum.",
        "Global trade showed continued signs of weakness, affected by a number of cyclical and structural factors.",
        "With regard to risks for the global economy, there was agreement among members that the impact of the outcome of the UK referendum on global financial markets had been contained following an initial bout of volatility, in part owing to perceptions of possible policy reactions and to the robust regulatory and supervisory frameworks in place.",
        "Most exchange rates were only modestly affected and generally saw a confirmation of previous trends, except for a sharp depreciation of the pound sterling.",
        "Looking ahead, the impact of the referendum was perceived to be geographically confined and to affect mainly the United Kingdom, and Europe more broadly.",
        "The recent forecasts published by the IMF supported this view.",
        "There was, nevertheless, a great deal of uncertainty about the transmission channels of the shock and their relative importance.",
        "In particular, it was noted that the uncertainty of the situation itself could affect the global economy in deeper and less predictable ways than through the direct trade channel.",
        "Furthermore, other geopolitical risks could erode economic sentiment and add to the drag on growth.",
        "Turning to euro area activity, the second quarter was expected to be weaker than the first, mainly because first quarter growth was seen as having been affected by a number of special factors that had since faded away.",
        "It was expected that domestic demand would continue to be the main factor driving growth in the euro area, while exports showed signs of less dynamism.",
        "In terms of domestic demand components, both consumption and investment were seen as contributing to growth across euro area countries.",
        "One factor underpinning consumption was the favourable development in household disposable income, in part owing to employment growth, which continued to be relatively strong in most euro area economies, particularly in services.",
        "Over time, investment should also be supported by favourable financing conditions and a recovery in profits.",
        "All in all, the euro area recovery seemed to remain on track.",
        "In particular, it was noted that the resilience of domestic demand had shielded the euro area from the recent global slowdown and that there was little evidence that this resilience had weakened.",
        "Nevertheless, there was wide agreement that downside risks to the economic outlook for the euro area had increased, mainly owing to the outcome of the UK referendum.",
        "In this respect, available estimates of the impact on euro area growth over the coming years were noted, but it was also recognised that such estimates were subject to a great deal of uncertainty and that the situation called for caution in assessing future developments.",
        "At the same time, it was perceived that the reaction of financial markets in the euro area had been more contained than could have been expected, both in the initial responses and in the partial reversals that took place afterwards.",
        "Members remarked that the uncertainty following the UK referendum was, in large part, of a political nature and due to the lack of clarity about the new relationship between the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union in the aftermath of the referendum.",
        "This uncertainty would only decrease gradually in line with future negotiations.",
        "In terms of the impact of the referendum on the euro area economy, which was the main concern for the Governing Council, it was too early to draw firm policy conclusions.",
        "When discussing price developments, members noted that headline HICP inflation had turned positive in June but no clear upward trend in inflation was as yet visible.",
        "The main factor driving headline inflation up had been the energy component, as the impact of past decreases in oil prices was fading away.",
        "These base effects were expected to lead to a significant increase in headline inflation towards the end of 2016.",
        "As regards underlying inflation, signals had been mixed: while services price inflation had risen slightly, prices of non-energy industrial goods had surprised on the downside.",
        "Looking beyond the end of this year, inflation was expected to increase further over the coming years owing to stronger domestic demand, tighter labour markets and improvements in corporate profitability, supported by the pass-through of the ECB’s monetary policy measures.",
        "One element in the price outlook that members felt required further analysis was the divergent development of long-term inflation expectations, depending on whether they were extracted from surveys or market-based.",
        "It was pointed out that survey-based measures had shown greater resilience, with the latest SPF pointing to long-term expectations (five years ahead) of 1.8%, having remained stable since the beginning of 2016.",
        "In this respect, it could be argued that there was, so far, little sign that the anchoring of inflation expectations had diminished.",
        "By contrast, market-based measures of long-term inflation expectations, such as the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, had been steadily declining for some time and remained close to record lows.",
        "While acknowledging that their low level was a source of concern, members also pointed to a number of technical factors that might currently distort market-based indicators, which called for prudence in their interpretation.",
        "Turning to fiscal policies, members noted that the fiscal policy stance was expected to be neutral in 2017, after being slightly expansionary in 2016, and also highlighted the need for full and consistent implementation of the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, both over time and across countries, in order to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework.",
        "At the same time, fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery and it was recalled that all countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies and that fiscal space should be used where appropriate.",
        "With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Broad money (M3) had continued to grow at a robust pace in May 2016.",
        "As in previous months, annual growth in M3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 expanding at a solid rate.",
        "Loan dynamics had followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014, and the annual rate of change of loans both to NFCs and to households had increased in May 2016.",
        "There was broad agreement that the monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 continued to contribute to favourable bank lending conditions for firms and households and to a strengthening of credit growth.",
        "This was also seen to be confirmed by the latest evidence from the bank lending survey, which had indicated a further improvement in conditions for loans to enterprises and households and a continued increase in demand across all loan categories.",
        "In the light of the prevailing uncertainties, including with respect to the post-UK referendum environment for banks and to the upcoming publication of the results of the European Banking Authority (EBA) stress test, it was seen as essential to safeguard the smooth transmission of monetary policy through the banking system, which played a crucial role for the real economy in the euro area and was key to supporting the ongoing economic recovery.",
        "In this context, it was noted that the equity prices of euro area banks had fallen following the UK referendum.",
        "While this could, in part, be associated with the likely direct impact of the outcome of the referendum, it also reflected the continued underlying weakness in bank profitability, related, inter alia, to a more prolonged period of only moderate growth and low interest rates, as well as legacy issues stemming mainly from still high levels of non-performing exposures in some parts of the euro area banking system, which continued to weigh on banks’ balance sheets.",
        "It was argued that such vulnerabilities appeared to resurface with new shocks that posed a risk to the recovery of the euro area economy.",
        "Reference was made to the apparent link between bank stock price valuations and bank lending volumes, as presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "While equity price volatility was not necessarily a concern, it warranted attention in case it weakened the functioning of the bank lending channel and the effective transmission of monetary policy to the real economy in the euro area.",
        "It was argued that the cost of equity was a critical component of the cost of lending for banks, whereby a high cost of capital could lower the net return on bank lending and thereby lead to more conservative lending behaviour by banks.",
        "At the same time, the euro area banking system was seen to be in much better shape than at the time of the comprehensive assessment of bank balance sheets undertaken in 2014.",
        "On the basis of a more robust regulatory and supervisory environment, capital positions had been strengthened, provisioning against non-performing exposures had increased and banks’ liquidity buffers were ample.",
        "Moreover, bank intermediation was supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, contributing to better funding conditions, increased lending and the economic recovery more broadly.",
        "With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that the incoming data continued to support the baseline scenario of an ongoing moderate economic recovery and an increase in inflation rates.",
        "While uncertainty had risen following the outcome of the UK referendum on EU membership, it was considered premature to assess the possible economic implications for the euro area economy.",
        "Over the coming months, as more information became available, including new staff projections, the Governing Council would be in a better position to reassess the underlying macroeconomic conditions and risks.",
        "In the meantime, the Governing Council needed to continue to monitor closely economic and financial market developments and reaffirm its readiness to act, if warranted, to achieve the ECB’s price stability objective.",
        "There was wide agreement among members with the assessment provided by the Vice-President and Mr Praet in their introductions that financial markets had coped well with the uncertainty and volatility in the aftermath of the UK referendum on EU membership.",
        "The initial financial market reaction following the outcome of the referendum had, to a large extent, been reversed and markets had continued to function in an orderly manner throughout.",
        "The euro exchange rate had also remained broadly stable overall, trading in nominal effective terms at almost unchanged levels.",
        "However, equity valuations, in particular for financial institutions, had continued to be more volatile and remained below pre-referendum levels.",
        "Overall, it appeared that the announced readiness of central banks to provide liquidity, if needed, and the accommodative monetary policy measures in place, as well as the robust regulatory and supervisory frameworks, had helped to keep market stress contained.",
        "Financial conditions had loosened on the whole, as market interest rates had declined further, in part related to market participants’ anticipation of further monetary policy easing – or postponement in the timing and pace of expected tightening – in a number of jurisdictions.",
        "Moreover, financing conditions remained highly supportive for credit creation, the ongoing economic recovery and, ultimately, an upward movement in inflation rates to levels closer to 2%.",
        "However, new headwinds had emerged from the outcome of the UK referendum and uncertainty had risen, relating also to other geopolitical developments and the financial market situation.",
        "Yet, it was considered too early to assess with any certainty the possible implications of these headwinds for the euro area economy and, ultimately, for the inflation outlook.",
        "Therefore, it was widely felt among members that it was premature to discuss any possible monetary policy reaction at this stage.",
        "More time was needed to assess the incoming information over the coming months, although downside risks had clearly increased.",
        "Against this background, it was widely agreed that the immediate policy focus should remain on implementing the comprehensive set of policy measures decided in early March and on preserving an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% without undue delay.",
        "There was solid evidence that the policy measures that had been adopted were effective and were working their way through to the broader economy over time.",
        "Their impact was visible in improved financial conditions, lower bank lending rates and strengthened credit creation, which all helped to raise both growth and inflation in the euro area, although inflation continued to be significantly below the Governing Council’s policy aim.",
        "It was recalled that transmission lags had to be taken into account, as monetary policy passed through intermediate variables to the ultimate objective and it would still take time for the effects of the ECB’s policy measures to fully unfold.",
        "Moreover, further stimulus could still be expected from the CSPP, which had just been launched in June, and the three additional operations under TLTRO-II, which were seen to be highly supportive of banks’ funding conditions.",
        "At the same time, the uncertain environment called for the continued very close monitoring of economic and financial market developments.",
        "In this context, it was seen as important to closely monitor the transmission process of the policy measures, which had worked well so far, to ensure that the pass-through of the accommodative monetary policy stance to the real economy was not jeopardised, taking into account risks to bank-based transmission and implications for the cost of borrowing and the availability of credit.",
        "Overall, the view was widely shared that the Governing Council needed to reiterate its capacity and readiness to act, if warranted, to achieve its objective, using all the instruments available within its mandate, while not fostering undue expectations about the future course of monetary policy.",
        "In the current environment of heightened uncertainty, a still high level of economic slack and weak wage and price pressures, future discussions were called for regarding wage trends, inflation expectations, the medium-term orientation of monetary policy and the time horizon over which a very accommodative monetary policy stance would remain warranted.",
        "Moreover, the need for other policy areas to contribute more decisively to a sustained recovery in the euro area had to be addressed, as the resolution of medium-term risks and remaining structural problems in the euro area economy were largely outside the reach of monetary policy.",
        "In this context, as emphasised repeatedly on past occasions, in order to reap the full benefits from the Governing Council’s monetary policy measures, the implementation of structural reforms needed to be substantially stepped up to reduce structural unemployment and boost potential output growth in the euro area.",
        "The focus should be on actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, which were vital to increase investment and boost job creation.",
        "Fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, striving for a more growth-friendly composition while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union.",
        "Finally, a strong call was made for European policymakers to contain political uncertainty surrounding the UK exit negotiations and to provide a clear vision for the future path of the European Union and its integration process.",
        "Moreover, adequate policy action and measures needed to be put in place to address weak profitability and the remaining structural weaknesses in the euro area banking sector.",
        "As regards communication, members widely agreed with the proposals presented by Mr Praet in his introduction.",
        "Cautious optimism had to be conveyed on the state of the euro area economy and the effectiveness of the ECB’s monetary policy measures, which had also contributed to the thus far resilient reaction of financial markets to the UK referendum outcome.",
        "It was also seen as important to emphasise that the Governing Council was monitoring economic and financial market developments very closely and that it was committed to safeguarding the effective pass-through of the monetary policy measures to the real economy.",
        "Moreover, given the prevailing uncertainties, it was considered appropriate to point out that, over the coming months, more information, including new staff projections, would become available, putting the Governing Council in a better position to reassess the underlying macroeconomic conditions.",
        "Finally, the Governing Council should reiterate its readiness, willingness and ability to act, if warranted, to achieve its objective, by using all the instruments available within its mandate.",
        "With regard to interest rates, taking into account the foregoing discussion and on a proposal from the President, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and ‑0.40% respectively.",
        "Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirmed that the monthly asset purchases of €80 billion were intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until it saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.",
        "The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the introductory statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the end of the current Governing Council meeting."
