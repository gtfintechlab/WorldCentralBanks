In general terms, the economy had evolved in line with forecasts in the September Monetary Policy Report (MP Report), and the inflation outlook continued to point to its convergence to the 3% target in the second half of 2024. Compared to 2022, inflation had fallen from a peak of 14.1 % in August of that year to 4.8% last November. This had been a rapid decline, in which monetary policy action had played a significant role. Activity was back to slightly positive quarterly growth rates, and projections were that in the quarters ahead it would continue to gradually approach growth rates in line with its trend. In this context, the economy was expected to clase 2023 with zero growth, with the usual heterogeneity across sectors. Towards 2024 and 2025, the growth ranges of the previous Report were maintained at 1.25%-2.25% and 2%-3%, respectively. As for expenditure, no majar changes were observed in aggregate numbers. However, private consumption had shown an incipient increase in the third quarter, while investment remained subdued. In the labor market, job creation remained sluggish, with demand for workers still weak, consistent with the evolution of the economic cycle. The unemployment rate had reached 8.9% in the moving quarter ending in October, outpacing its historical average. Real wage growth had risen to 3.5% annually, favored by lower inflation.
