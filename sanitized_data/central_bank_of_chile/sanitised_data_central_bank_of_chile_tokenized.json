    "2022": [
        "Inflation rose to 7.2% annually in December, exceeding market expectations and forecasts in the last MP Report.",
        "The increase in prices was widespread among the different items of the CPI basket.",
        "Worth noting was again the increase in the core component (CPI without volatility) which reached 5.2% annually.",
        "The latter combined the increase in both the goods component which exceeded expectations and the — — services component, especially when excluding indexed prices and administered utility rates.",
        "In the volatile component --also unexpectedly high--, the contribution of fuels and some specific items, such as tourist packages, continued to stand out.",
        "These developments occurred in the midst of still high cost pressures, as confirmed by preliminary data for the Business Perceptions Report (IPN) of February 2022, where the persistence of procurement and product availability problems were widely mentioned by the companies consulted and continued to put pressure on margins, while still facing high demand.",
        "Private inflation expectations remained above 3% in the two-year term.",
        "Aggregate activity and demand indicators led to estimate that GDP growth would be at the upper part of the December Report’s projected range for 2021.",
        "The November Imacec had increased 14.3% annually (0.3% '/ The Spanish original prevails.",
        "The contribution of services stood out, with annual growth of 20%, driven by personal services in particular, reflecting the consolidation of eased sanitary restrictions and the boost of the remaining resources from household support measures.",
        "Trade followed with +16.7% annually in November.",
        "Retail trade sales (INE) maintained high dynamism, as did imports of consumer goods, reflecting the strong momentum of this spending component, especially durable goods.",
        "Consumer confidence (IPEC) remained in pessimistic territory, although with some rebound at the margin.",
        "In investment, the good performance of capital goods imports stood out, suggesting a favorable performance of the machinery and equipment component.",
        "This contrasts with the outlook for construction and works, where several indicators, such as the Imacec or the sectoral IMCE, showed a deterioration in incoming figures.",
        "Most of the firms surveyed in the IPN indicated that the performance of their businesses had remained stable or had declined slightly in recent times, in the context of still strong demand and where some businesses had ended 2021 at new highs.",
        "One exception was the construction sector, where several respondents reported a somewhat gloomier outlook, coinciding with tighter credit constraints.",
        "Although less so than at the end of last year, the high degree of political-legislative uncertainty at the local level maintained certain reluctance regarding investments or the results of the companies going forward.",
        "In general, however, performance was expected to remain largely unchanged.",
        "The labor market continued its gradual recovery, with labor supply still tight on the part of households and high demand from companies.",
        "According to INE data, in the moving quarter ending in November, the number of employed persons had increased by 102 thousand (+8.1% annually), with notable advances in the self-employed and formal wage-earning categories.",
        "Nevertheless, total employment nationwide still remained below pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Although certain elements again pointed to improvements on the labor supply side, such as the increase in the participation rate, its mismatch with demand was still evident.",
        "This had continued to have an upward effect on wage growth, especially in less skilled positions.",
        "Feedback from the IPN confirmed this picture.",
        "One of the main concerns was the difficulty in filling vacancies.",
        "This had led, in many cases, to the payment of higher salaries to new hires, while others were adjusting to operate with less staff on a more permanent basis.",
        "The evolution of the local financial market had been marked by external and internal factors, with the latter predominating, possibly related to reduced local uncertainty.",
        "Since the previous meeting, the stock market had shown a 5% advance and the country risk (CDS) had fallen by 10 basis points (bp).",
        "The peso had appreciated close to 5%, with more moderate volatility.",
        "Nominal long-term interest rates, with ups and downs, were at similar levels, while maintaining a significant differential with their external counterparts.",
        "In particular, the 10-year term bond yield outperformed its U.S. counterpart by around 390bp, versus 160bp in the 2021 account.",
        "This discrepancy was in line with domestic uncertainty levels that remained high by historical standards.",
        "Fixed-income interest rates for shorter maturities had risen, in response to increased headline inflation and rising expectations for the monetary policy rate (MPR).",
        "In the corporate bond market, in both the financial sector and the rest of the companies, there were fewer transactions and lower amounts traded, with spreads fairly constant.",
        "Lending activity by local banks remained sluggish in all portfolios.",
        "As of December, in real terms, the annual growth of consumer loans remained negative (-6.7%) despite continuing to rise, for mortgage loans — — it had not changed much (5.9%) and for commercial loans it had resumed positive values (2%).",
        "This weak performance of credit was mainly influenced by demand factors.",
        "This was reflected in the preliminary information for the February IPN, in a scenario in which financing conditions were also seen as tighter by a significant group of respondents.",
        "Similarly, the fourth-quarter Bank Lending Survey had reported tighter supply and demand conditions than in the quarter before for most portfolios, with special emphasis on mortgages and real estate.",
        "Meanwhile, interest rates had risen across all portfolios, but mainly in the consumer segment.",
        "In this same category, there was an incipient rise in delinquency rates, which however remained contained in the system at large.",
        "Expectations for the level that the MPR would reach this year had been revised upwards.",
        "The Economic Expectations Survey (EES) and the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) took it up to 6% and 6.5%, respectively, while financial asset prices pointed to a slightly higher level.",
        "Thus, all these measures were around the upper limit of the MPR corridor in the December MP Report.",
        "The world economy had lost some dynamism, but the outlook for the year was largely unchanged.",
        "The rise in Covid-19 infections had been significant in many countries, pushing some of them to new records.",
        "Although mobility had been affected, the impact on activity looked rather limited, mainly in countries with high booster vaccination rates.",
        "However, the situation had been more complex in China, where delays in the application of the booster jab, as well as the zero-Covid policy, had led to tighter restrictions.",
        "These posed greater risks to economic activity and the potential effects on the persistence of bottlenecks around the world.",
        "The latter had continued to put pressure on supply chains, which reinforced the view that their impact would last longer than previously expected.",
        "Global inflation had continued to accelerate, particularly with increases in the United States and Latin American countries.",
        "In the U.S., the most recent data had been surprising again, with record-high figures that this high inflation was a persistent phenomenon across the board.",
        "This had led to an increase in inflationary expectations at different horizons, coupled with concerns about wage cost pressures in the face of a still tight labor market.",
        "In Latin America, inflation had also risen sharply, driven by higher food and energy prices.",
        "The oil price had climbed to around US$85 per barrel (+19% since the last meeting, for the WTI-Brent average).",
        "This increase was related to the low impact of the Omicron variant on the global demand for crude oil and the existence of some supply constraints in this market.",
        "The increase in geopolitical tensions, particularly in Europe, raised the risk of further increases in energy prices.",
        "Copper prices were around US$4.5 per pound, amid favorable demand expectations and stock market inventories that remained low from a historical perspective.",
        "Accordingly, several central banks had intensified the shift towards the withdrawal of monetary stimuli.",
        "The U.S. Federal Reserve had begun to signal the need to accelerate this process, given the greater persistence of inflation, while the Bank of England had surprised with a rate hike.",
        "The European Central Bank was one of the few that had not yet adopted this more contractionary stance.",
        "With a greater degree of volatility, the financial markets reported a widespread increase in long-term interest rates, the appreciation of a significant number of currencies against the dollar, and stock market declines, particularly in developed countries.",
        "The data known since the publication of the December Report pointed to somewhat higher than expected inflationary pressures.",
        "Headline inflation had been a little above expectations, and this surprise was not expected to disappear anytime soon.",
        "In fact, the monthly dynamics of inflation showed that in the last six months it had been significantly above historical patterns.",
        "Moreover, no significant deceleration was expected for the following six months, especially in the core component.",
        "In terms of activity, GDP growth would have been at the high end of the estimated range for 2021.",
        "Thus, inflationary inertia, a gap that remained positive, a depreciated real exchange rate, and significant external cost pressures continued to exert upward pressures on inflation.",
        "In the financial markets, the exchange rate had fallen in recent weeks, but its expected trajectory was not perceived to be very different from the one foreseen in the Report.",
        "There were a number of factors at work here.",
        "On the one hand, the markets had undoubtedly taken the recent political scenario in stride.",
        "But on the other, the more fundamental elements that had kept uncertainty high were still present, and coupled with growing tension in the external environment.",
        "The Board agreed that the risks to the evolution of inflation were still significant and their possible materialization was particularly relevant in a context in which both the annual change in the CPI and its outlook were already high.",
        "There was consensus that the relevance of risk management argument in the policy rate decision had intensified most recently.",
        "In fact, both activity and inflation were somewhat higher than expected in December, while inflationary pressures stemming from abroad had increased.",
        "All things considered, the Board members agreed that it seemed reasonable to follow, in the short term, a monetary policy path around the upper edge of the MPR corridor of the last Report.",
        "In this context, the Board evaluated the options of raising the MPR by (i) 125bp, (ii) 150bp, or (iii) 175bp.",
        "All the Board members agreed that the option of raising the MPR by 150bp best addressed the greater intensity of the risks to inflation.",
        "One Board member noted that, while such a hike would marginally surprise the markets, it had the advantage of addressing the fact that inflation had been higher than expected, that the macroeconomic imbalances underlying the higher inflation persisted, and also that two-year inflation expectations were above 3%.",
        "Another member added that, if greater weight was given to risk management and the asymmetry of its costs, the 150bp option was the best, as it signaled more decisively the idea of going faster in raising the MPR and positioning it near the upper edge of the corridor.",
        "They all agreed that a 125bp raise was a valid option.",
        "In fact, it was also consistent with being on the upper bound of the MPR corridor and provided continuity to the process of upward moving MPR of previous months.",
        "However, it had the counterpoint that further surprises in inflation, or in the evolution of inflation fundamentals, could force a further acceleration of increases in the policy rate at later meetings.",
        "Finally, all the Board members agreed that the 175bp increase seemed inappropriate at this time.",
        "One Board member pointed out that such a decision could cause confusion and, in this opinion, the current differences between expectations and projections did not warrant a surprise of that magnitude.",
        "Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Naudon, and Costa voted for raising the monetary policy interest rate by 150bp, to 5.5%.",
        "Global inflation had continued to rise, showing signs of increased persistence.",
        "Central banks had further raised their benchmark rates, notably the European Central Bank, which had begun its monetary normalization process in July, and the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), which had adopted a more restrictive policy stance to rein in inflation.",
        "The outlook for global growth had deteriorated, amid still unfavorable conditions, especially for emerging economies.",
        "The central scenario of the September Monetary Policy Report considered that our trading partners would grow by an average of 2.6% in 2022 and 2023, i.e., less than expected in the previous Report.",
        "Global financial markets maintained high volatility, due mainly to uncertainty regarding the Fed’s future monetary policy path and its impacts.",
        "Long-term interest rates had generally risen in recent weeks and the dollar had continued to appreciate globally.",
        "Commodity prices had shown declines for some weeks, as had the prices of foods.",
        "At home, after the Central Bank had announced a foreign exchange intervention, tensions in the forex market had subsided.",
        "Volatility had decreased and the peso had appreciated.",
        "Credit continued to be weak, in a context in which banks and companies felt that financial conditions were restrictive.",
        "Activity and demand were still in their adjustment process after the strong imbalances accumulated in 2021, with second-quarter data showing declines in both investment and consumption.",
        "The labor market was losing strength, with weak job creation and a decline in vacancies.",
        "The unemployment rate showed no major changes, while the annual change in real wages remained negative.",
        "Consumer and business confidence indicators remained in pessimistic territory.",
        "Headline inflation had risen again, touching 13.1% annually in July, while core inflation —the CPI without volatiles — had been 10% annually in the same month.",
        "Surveyed inflation expectations —EES and FTS— had adjusted upwards in the two-year horizon.",
        "High inflation was having a significant impact on the incomes and expectations of economic agents.",
        "The projections contained in the September MP Report revised upwards the inflation forecast for the end of 2022 and all of 2023, estimating that by the turn of 2024 it would return to values closer to the 3% target.",
        "The reduction in inflation from its current high levels to 3% was based on the assumption that the economy would continue to adjust the imbalances accumulated in 2021, which considered a slowdown in activity and demand for several quarters.",
        "The Central Bank’s objective was to achieve inflation convergence via an adjustment in economic activity that would be brief, orderly, and at the lowest cost possible.",
        "For this to occur, a necessary condition was for inflation not to become more persistent.",
        "The upside risks to inflation remained high, in particular because, in a high inflation scenario, such persistence could increase.",
        "The details of the central scenario, sensitivities, risks and future evolution of the MPR were included in the September Report, which served as the basis for the discussion at this Meeting.",
        "The discussion focused on the evolution of the international scenario, especially the increase in inflation at the global level, the challenges that this entailed and, especially, the tightening of monetary policy in developed countries.",
        "Although this change seemed entirely appropriate, it undoubtedly posed a challenge to the Chilean economy.",
        "For one thing, it would imply receiving a lower external impulse, in terms of both its effect on global activity and its negative impact on commodity prices and the tightening of financial conditions.",
        "In addition, the risks in the external scenario were high and more drastic adjustments of interest rates in the developed world could not be ruled out, which, if materialized, would further deteriorate the external impulse relevant for Chile.",
        "About the domestic economy, it was pointed out that activity was adjusting in line with expectations and that the central scenario of the September MP Report projected that the economy would see negative growth rates for several quarters.",
        "The importance of not losing sight of the fact that this reduction in activity, that should translate into a negative activity gap, was an unavoidable condition for the convergence of inflation to the target was emphasized.",
        "With respect to the labor market, it was pointed out that, despite stagnant job creation and contained real wages, it was unclear how much of this evolution was related to the business cycle and how much was due to structural aspects.",
        "For this reason, there was no conclusive information that would allow judging that the beginning of a potential cycle adjustment in the labor market was underway.",
        "Regarding inflation, it was pointed out that, although its core component had been in line with expectations, the volatile component had surprised strongly, placing total inflation above 13% annually.",
        "It was added that, normally, the Board might have reacted with little intensity to such a surprise, especially in a context where medium-term demand and activity expectations had been deteriorating.",
        "However, in the current circumstances, marked by inflation well above the 3% target, with upside surprises for several months and where everything indicated that inflation had become more persistent, it was very difficult for the Bank not to respond strongly to this news.",
        "The Board felt that these impacts should not be downplayed and, therefore, had been factoring them into its projections, communications, and decisions for several quarters ago.",
        "The implications of the outcome of the constitutional plebiscite were discussed, noting that, although this was an important milestone in the process, the road to a new institutional framework was long and would not be free of challenges.",
        "In this sense, it was to be expected that uncertainty would remain relatively high, beyond some reduction.",
        "For this reason, it was necessary for the Bank to remain very vigilant of the evolution of the process and its effects on the markets.",
        "All the Board Members agreed that there were very important risks to future inflationary dynamics.",
        "Particularly relevant were the impact that high inflation was having on inflationary persistence, the way this phenomenon was extending, and the worsening of inflationary expectations indicators.",
        "Regarding the latter, the increase in the different measures of expected inflation in the two-year horizon was emphasized, together with the fact that businesses had sped up the frequency of price adjustments in the last few quarters.",
        "In this context of more persistent inflation, all the Board members agreed that it required a more restrictive monetary policy —in both nominal and real terms— than had been anticipated in the June MP Report.",
        "Part of this tightening had already begun at the July Meeting and was to continue this time around.",
        "The central scenario of the September Report assumed that the MPR would reach a maximum level of close to 10.75%, so the evaluation of the different options had to take into account the speed with which that level was to be attained, the need to reinforce the Board’s concern about the inflation dynamics and the option of making a substantial adjustment that would open more possibilities for a future pause.",
        "The Board evaluated the options of raising the rate by: (i) 75 basis points (bp); (ii) 100bp; and (iii) 125bp.",
        "Some Board members considered that the 75bp option was plausible, because it was within the upper range of market expectations and was evaluated in a context in which monetary policy had already made a very significant adjustment, while activity and demand were showing the expected weakness, as evidenced by the evolution of consumption, investment, and real wages.",
        "In addition, the outlook was deteriorating, particularly due to the worsened external scenario.",
        "One Board member mentioned that this option was plausible only if it was considered as part of a monetary tightening to be continued later.",
        "Other Board members mentioned that this option was less efficient if the intention was to give clear signs of concern regarding the evolution of inflationary dynamics and expectations.",
        "About the option of raising the MPR by 100bp, several Board members noted that it had the value of being a decision consistent with the central scenario and easier to communicate, as it did not require the Board to commit to a closure of the rate-increasing process.",
        "Some Board members said that the message of closing down under uncertain conditions seemed too risky in a scenario as complex as the current one, with a lot of unfolding events.",
        "Therefore, such an option was consistent with the idea of assessing the evolution of economic variables over some months and then making adjustments where necessary.",
        "Several Board Members considered that the option of raising the MPR by 125bp could be understood as being more consistent with risk assessment in terms of inflationary dynamics, while signaling more clearly the concern about the persistence of the deviation of two-year inflation expectations from 3%, the concern about a change in the dynamics of price adjustment by firms and the obvious need for the economy to adjust activity.",
        "Some Board Members mentioned that this option had the disadvantage of taking the market by surprise and meant that the message of closing the upward cycle had to be delivered more strongly.",
        "All five Board Members agreed that a necessary condition for the resolution of the inflationary problem was a reduction in activity — as expressed in the September MP Report projections—, which was costly for the economy, but a requisite to bring down inflation.",
        "There was agreement that the MPR would stay high until there was clear evidence of inflation converging to 3% over the two-year policy horizon.",
        "Accordingly, it was emphasized that the Board’s main concern was that a scenario would arise in which the inflationary phenomenon would become much more persistent.",
        "Given the high inflation levels and two-year expectations above 3%, the realization of this risk would require significantly more restrictive monetary actions, sharply increasing the cost of bringing inflation back to target.",
        "Governor Costa and Board members Naudon and Céspedes voted in favor of raising the MPR by 100bp to 10.75%.",
        "Vice-Governor García voted for raising it by 125bp.",
        "Board member Novy voted for raising the MPR by 75bp.",
        "Headline inflation had reached 13.7% annually in September, slightly less than in August, while core inflation —the CPI minus volatiles— had risen to 11.1% annually.",
        "Cumulative inflation in the last two months had exceeded the forecast in the September MP Report, owing mainly due to sharp price increases in some foods and, though not as sharp, in some services, mainly for administrated and indexed items.",
        "Cost pressures were giving mixed signals.",
        "On the one hand, nominal wages and the exchange rate had risen again, while, on the other hand, commodity prices had declined and global supply problems had been moderating.",
        "The business cost outlook (IMCE) remained near record highs.",
        "Inflation expectations taken from the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) and the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) remained above 3% in the two-year horizon and had been adjusted downward in the one-year term.",
        "The non-mining Imacec for August (+1.3% annually; +0.7% monthly seasonally adjusted) had surpassed the forecast in the September MP Report, mainly because of greater activity in some services.",
        "In all other sectors, however, the expected drops in activity were confirmed, as was the case in trade, manufacturing and construction.",
        "In domestic spending, private consumption indicators had continued to consolidate the expected adjustment path.",
        "Those linked to investment remained weak, although in some sectors —energy, transportation and telecommunications— there was a certain resilience that had favored the import of machinery and equipment.",
        "The consumer confidence index (IPEC) remained in the pessimistic zone, but with some recent rebound.",
        "The same behavior was observed in the case of firms (IMCE) across the different economic sectors.",
        "In the labor market (INE), job creation remained stagnant, while the participation and unemployment rates showed no material changes, the latter standing at 7.9% in August.",
        "Labor demand had continued to lose strength, as reflected in the steady decline of the Internet Job Postings Index since the end of 2021 and of business expectations for employment (IMCE).",
        "Real wages continued to post negative annual variations in their different measurements.",
        "The local financial market had aligned itself with the lower risk appetite of global markets.",
        "Compared with the previous meeting, the exchange rate had depreciated by around 5%, long-term interest rates had risen —especially UF-denominated—, the sovereign risk premium (5-year CDS) had increased and the IPSA stock index had lost close to 7%.",
        "Bank credit continued to decelerate in all portfolios.",
        "Commercial and consumer loans had been falling further, with real annual contractions of 2.2% and 3.0% in September, while the annual variation of mortgage loans was at an all-time low, at 1.8% in the same month.",
        "These developments were in line with the latest Bank Lending Survey (BLS), which reported that supply conditions remained tight, driven by factors such as a perception of increased risk and a worsening economic environment.",
        "The BLS also pointed to a weaker demand, which for individuals was especially noticeable in the housing segment.",
        "Lending interest rates had seen further hikes in the margin.",
        "The market outlook for the monetary policy rate (MPR) had increased.",
        "The various measures of expectations available (i.e., taken from surveys and financial asset prices) placed it at 11.25% at the October meeting, and then peaked between 11.25% and 11.5% at December.",
        "Global inflation had continued to show signs of greater persistence, central banks had further raised their benchmark rates and market expectations pointed to a prolonged monetary tightening in developed economies.",
        "At its September meeting, the Federal Reserve had again raised the Fed funds rate range by 75 basis points (bps) and the FOMC’s rate outlook suggested future rate hikes outpacing market expectations.",
        "The European Central Bank had raised its monetary policy rate by 75bp and signaled additional increases due to persistent inflationary pressures and the risk of expectations becoming unanchored.",
        "The Bank of England had added 50 bps to its benchmark rate, amid high pressures from wages.",
        "In the U.K., the announcement of a fiscal stimulus package and tax cuts had sharply depreciated the pound and raised interest rates, which had prompted the Bank of England to establish a temporary purchase of long-term bonds in view of the increased risk of financial instability.",
        "In Latin America, monetary authorities had kept on raising their monetary policy rates; however, some had surprisingly made more moderate increases than expected in the face of early signs that inflation had reached a peak in several economies.",
        "Brazil was a case in point, where the central bank had paused last September its rate hike cycle begun in March 2021, without ruling out new increases in the months ahead.",
        "The market outlook for global growth had continued to adjust downward, mainly for 2023.",
        "In the United States, the combination of high inflation, tighter monetary policy and worsening financial conditions had contributed to a deterioration in next year’s outlook, although projections for 2022 had remained stable, amid still resilient consumer indicators and a still strong labor market.",
        "In the Eurozone, uncertainty surrounding the war in Ukraine continued to affect expectations about energy availability.",
        "Meanwhile, the real-income decline and the drop in confidence augured weak consumption.",
        "Furthermore, the tightening of financial conditions, the persistence of the negative supply shock and the worsening economic outlook continued to anticipate an erosion of investment dynamism.",
        "In China, adding to the weakness of the real estate sector and the uncertainty regarding the strategy for controling the spread of Covid-19, there were the effects of the deteriorated world demand for goods on the country’s exports.",
        "In Latin America, activity had shown greater resilience than expected; however, there were signs of moderation in the pace of growth.",
        "Thus, the revisions of the projections for 2022 went in opposite directions among the different economies, but for 2023 they continued to deteriorate, amid the worsening global outlook, tighter financial conditions, lower commodity prices and risks of internal tensions in different countries.",
        "In this scenario, global financial markets had remained highly volatile and risk appetite had declined.",
        "Since the last Meeting, the dollar had continued to strengthen globally, stock markets had fallen and long-term interest rates had risen.",
        "Commodity prices, in general, had continued to adjust downward, in line with the stronger dollar and the worsening outlook for world activity.",
        "The oil price had shown high volatility, with sharp declines and a subsequent recovery in the face of less favorable news on the supply side.",
        "Thus, in the days prior to the Meeting, the oil barrel was trading around US$90 (WTI-Brent average).",
        "Similarly, the copper price had shown fluctuations and was close to US$3.5 per pound, virtually unchanged from the last Meeting.",
        "The price of European natural gas had dropped significantly, despite disruptions in Russian supplies.",
        "Food prices had shown mixed movements.",
        "Edible oils prices had fallen, while cereals had risen, influenced by the uncertainty about new interruptions in grain exports from Ukraine.",
        "Regarding the external scenario, there was agreement that it had worsened in recent weeks.",
        "It was pointed out that inflationary pressures remained high in both developed and emerging economies and, if anything, the phenomenon had become more persistent than expected.",
        "Consequently, monetary policies were becoming more contractionary in most countries, most notably in the U.S.",
        "It was pointed out that, although the markets had been adjusting to the change of scenario without major and generalized disruptions, global financial conditions had been tightening, growth projections were being downgraded again and commodity markets were becoming weaker.",
        "There was consensus that not only would the external impulse to the Chilean economy diminish, but also that the probability of seeing negative risk scenarios had increased.",
        "Both the possible impacts of a more contractionary U.S. monetary policy on the rest of the world and the vulnerabilities in some important financial markets, such as developments in the United Kingdom were noted.",
        "The development of other sources of uncertainty already present was added, such as the war between Russia and Ukraine and the weakness of the Chinese economy and the consequences of its real-estate sector adjustment.",
        "Regarding local conditions, there was general agreement that there were no substantial differences with respect to forecasts in the September MP Report.",
        "On the activity side, beyond surprises in some sectors, activity had evolved in line with expectations.",
        "The sectors most closely linked to the business cycle showed a clear adjustment and consumption was in line with expectations.",
        "Also noteworthy was the presentation to Congress of the fiscal budget for 2023, which, in general terms, seemed consistent with the Report assumptions, especially the importance of fiscal consolidation and the absence of other macroeconomic stimuli aimed at efficiently achieving the convergence of inflation to 3%.",
        "The trajectory of inflation was noted, with its slight decline in the annual variation rate after many months of sharp rises.",
        "It was added that, in any case, in line with expectations, core inflation continued to rise, which maintained the alerts about the consolidation of a downward inflationary trend.",
        "It was mentioned that the depreciation of the peso would drive up inflation in the short term, as was reflected in prices and market expectations.",
        "In any case, being the outcome of a global movement of the dollar, this increase in the exchange rate had different impacts on inflation than had previous ones, in which the depreciation responded more to factors from within.",
        "In addition, it had to be considered that, although the deterioration of the external scenario would put greater pressure on prices in the short term, mediumterm inflationary pressures would be lower due to the negative consequences on economic activity.",
        "The behavior of inflation expectations was also noted, which despite somewhat higher inflation in the short term, showed downward adjustments at longer horizons, probably reflecting the medium-term impact of a more deteriorated macroeconomic scenario.",
        "All in all, there was consensus that two-year expectations were still well above 3% and their evolution was a matter of concern.",
        "Regarding local financial conditions, the weak growth in credit was observed, with its low or negative annual variation rates in its different categories.",
        "It was emphasized that this behavior was consistent with the rise in interest rates and with the evaluation of the third-quarter Bank Lending Survey, which reported that supply conditions remained constrained and demand was perceived as weak for all segments.",
        "The discussion focused on the behavior of shorter-term UF-denominated interest rates —typically more closely linked to the business cycle—, which had risen significantly in recent months, the origin of which was unclear, but which could end up having a significant impact on the economy.",
        "All five Board members agreed that the information gathered since the publication of the last Monetary Policy Report outlined a central scenario in which medium-term inflationary pressures would gradually ease in line with expectations.",
        "In their view, this was a major change from several of the previous Meetings, where, in general, the data were showing the need for an increasingly contractionary monetary policy to ensure the convergence of inflation to 3% in the two-year horizon.",
        "There was also consensus that the inflationary problem was still present, inflation remains at high levels, persistence was high and the medium-term inflation expectations of different agents remained well above the 3% target.",
        "In this context, all the Board members agreed that, in line with the September Report, the MPR was already near its maximum level.",
        "Therefore, an adjustment of the rate should be evaluated in order to reach a sufficiently contractionary degree to maintain it for the time needed to assess the impact of the changes in the macroeconomic scenario and ensure the achievement of the inflation target within the two-year horizon.",
        "The Board discussed two options: to raise the MPR by 25bp or by 50 bp.",
        "In the Board’s view, the option of raising the MPR by 25bp gave more time to assess the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario, particularly in terms of external developments and their impact on activity and medium-term inflationary pressures.",
        "It could also be evaluated positively if the weight assigned to external risks was very high.",
        "On the other hand, adopting this option could give the wrong signal regarding the Board’s reading of the risks to inflation, particularly with respect to inflationary persistence.",
        "Regarding the option of raising the MPR by 50bp, there was agreement among the Board members that adopting such a decision placed the policy rate at the level necessary to ensure the convergence of inflation to 3%, given the current macroeconomic environment.",
        "At the same time, it gave a signal consistent with the Board’s concern about the persistence of inflation and reduced the risks associated with significant changes in external conditions.",
        "They also favored this option because it made it easier to give a clearly neutral bias to the next rate movements and allowed emphasizing that it would be kept unchanged for as long as necessary to ensure the convergence of inflation to 3% within the two-year policy horizon.",
        "Governor Costa, Vice-Governor García, and Board members Naudon, Céspedes and Novy voted for raising the MPR by 50bp, to 11.25%.",
        "Inflation in Chile had been escalating further, to its highest level in decades.",
        "The main factor behind its rise continued to be the significant increase in demand during 2021.",
        "However, in recent months the impact of strong global cost pressures resulting from higher prices of commodities, energy, and foods had intensified, in a context of ongoing difficulties in global supply chains, and where the peso remained depreciated and the activity gap was still positive.",
        "The short-term inflation outlook was steadily rising in response to this combination of factors.",
        "In line with expectations, activity had begun to adjust in the first quarter, although in a composition of demand where private consumption remained strong while investment weakened.",
        "Over the medium term, the reassessment of the macroeconomic scenario suggested that the commodity and food price shock would be more persistent than thought before, which had implications for inflation.",
        "In any case, the resolution of macroeconomic imbalances remained the central element for inflation to converge to 3% within the two-year horizon.",
        "This process would occur in large part through the adjustment of private consumption and investment, in a context where the vision of a significant contraction in fiscal spending was maintained.",
        "However, the high level of inflation and the greater persistence associated with its main determinants called for a more contractionary monetary policy to ensure such convergence.",
        "Risks continued to be high in the macroeconomic scenario, particularly because of how high and persistent inflation was at the time.",
        "In general terms, incoming news in recent weeks tended to confirm the view of the macroeconomic scenario adopted at the May Meeting, including the change in the monetary policy rate (MPR) trajectory anticipated at the moment.",
        "On the one hand, it was noted that inflation had been clearly above the forecast in the last Monetary Policy Report.",
        "On the other, although a moderate fall in activity and a more significant drop in investment were confirmed, private consumption remained dynamic due to a greater use of household liquidity, delaying its adjustment with respect to earlier projections.",
        "It was commented that information at hand depicted a scenario of higher and more persistent inflationar y pressures, which called for a more contractionary monetary policy than what had been foreseen in the March Report.",
        "It was pointed out that, although the inflation surprise of recent months had a clear focus on food prices and not so much on the core component, this did not imply that monetary policy should be neutral or take no action in this regard.",
        "Instead, what was needed was to assess whether these shocks affected the persistence of inflationary dynamics over the policy horizon.",
        "If they did, there should be a monetary policy response.",
        "It was added that it was important to bear in mind that the advantage of the inflation targeting scheme was that by establishing a two-year horizon, it avoided reacting to shocks that had transitory effect on inflation dynamics and did not jeopardize the achievement of the target.",
        "However, if these shocks had more permanent effects, irrespective of their origin, monetary policy had to react, because otherwise the inflation target would be compromised.",
        "It was noted that the conduct of monetary policy was based not only on analyzing inflation, but it also had a component of economic growth.",
        "However, in order for this mechanism to operate, it was necessary to maintain the credibility of monetary policy.",
        "It was recalled that the outlook for economic activity pointed to a significant weakening in the near future.",
        "There was consensus on the importance of specifying that this weakening was not an “externality” of the process of raising rates, but rather a fundamental element to achieve the convergence of inflation to the 3% target.",
        "It was also recalled that after the significant measures to stimulate spending adopted in 2021, the economy had reached unsustainable levels of activity from a medium-term perspective.",
        "Undoing this imbalance meant that economic activity would see negative growth rates.",
        "The importance of keeping this in mind was also stressed, as resolving the imbalances was a necessary condition for the economy to grow in a healthy manner while creating jobs and boosting real wages.",
        "On the external front, it was pointed out that the global inflationary problem was becoming more and more important.",
        "It was noteworthy that the central banks of the leading economies were still reacting rather cautiously, which generated the risk of larger corrections than those already seen in global financial conditions if a more abrupt and marked change in the monetary policy stance of those economies were to become necessary.",
        "The greater likelihood of the latter scenario increased the risk of a recession in the major economies.",
        "This put greater pressure on financial conditions for emerging economies, including the value of their currencies, which in the medium term would be an additional drag on growth.",
        "It was discussed that, in this context, the economy was facing a particularly complex scenario of very significant risks.",
        "For one, given how high inflation was going, there was the risk that it would become more persistent, which would have impacts in multiple dimensions: inflation expectations above the target; more frequent price adjustments by companies and, therefore, more frequent margin adjustments; and increased pass-through of the exchange rate to local prices.",
        "It was mentioned that a key factor to avoid the negative effects of this greater persistence and to ensure the achievement of the 3% inflation target within two years was the credibility of monetary policy.",
        "In this regard, it was noted that monetary policy could only fulfill its countercyclical role of alleviating the costs in terms of economic activity, employment, and wages, if it succeeded in maintaining its credibility and expectations aligned with the target.",
        "Such a scenario was also needed to mitigate the impact of a potential global liquidity crisis, an important risk given the progress of the world’ s inflationary situation and the reaction of the main central banks so far.",
        "Finally, it was mentioned that there was the risk of a steeper-than-expected economic slowdown, with negative and undesirable effects on investment and employment.",
        "In this scenario, it was noted, the Bank would have enough room to lower the MPR and generate a significant monetary stimulus.",
        "The reason for this was that in such a scenario inflation would fall gradually, and a relatively rapid decline in the MPR would allow the Bank to promptly produce negative real rates.",
        "The Board agreed that the monetary policy framework had been particularly stressed over the past year.",
        "The magnitude of the aggregate demand and supply shocks was unprecedented in terms of both size and synchrony.",
        "Moreover, their short- and medium-term implications were also diverse and much of the analysis was aimed at evaluating these different trade-offs.",
        "In addition, all this was taking place in a local context where there was quite significant financial tension, amid an environment of uncertainty and volatility.",
        "The Board recalled that the process of monetary normalization had already begun almost a year ago, so that a good part of the adjustment deemed necessary to resolve macroeconomic imbalances had already been made.",
        "Accordingly, they estimated that, given the background described in the June Report, the MPR was already close to its terminal level in this cycle and considered two possible options: (i) raise the MPR by 75 basis points (bp); or (ii) raise the MPR by 100bp.",
        "All five Board Members agreed that, as the MPR approached its target level, tactical considerations took on greater prominence when evaluating monetary policy options.",
        "In this scenario, there was agreement that the 75bp option struck a good balance between different considerations.",
        "On the one hand, it was consistent with the path judged necessary for inflation convergence in the Report’s central scenario, and at the same time it allowed room for additional hikes of a smaller magnitude that could be calibrated with information of the months ahead.",
        "On the other hand, this option was widely expected by the market, whose rate expectations were very close to the central part of the MPR corridor in the June Report.",
        "As for the 100bp option, although it could be justified as a sign of greater concern about the risk scenarios being faced, its counterpart was that it provided less flexibility for the future.",
        "In particular, to make it consistent with the idea that the MPR was approaching a terminal level, it would need to be accompanied by a clearly neutral bias, which was thought not to be feasible as yet.",
        "Governor Costa, Vice-Governor García, and Board members Naudon, Céspedes, and Novy voted to raise the monetary policy rate by 75 basis points, to 9%.",
        "New information of recent months showed that the Chilean economy continued along its adjustment process after the significant imbalances accumulated during 2021.",
        "In line with expectations, annual inflation had peaked in August, when the annual variation of the CPI had reached 14.1%.",
        "Pending the data for November, which would be known the day after the Meeting, the data for September and October showed that annual inflation it had slowed to 12.8%, but this was still very high.",
        "Local activity was already beginning to show negative annual variation rates.",
        "Measured in seasonally adjusted terms, in the third quarter, non-mining GDP had completed two consecutive quarters of contraction.",
        "In this context, private consumption continued to normalize after the rocketing increases of 2021.",
        "Investment, on the other hand, had been surprisingly strong, although growth was concentrated mainly in some particular sectors, such as renewable energies.",
        "Meanwhile, the global economic outlook was complex, given the high inflationary persistence worldwide and the rate hikes decided by the main central banks.",
        "Projections for 2023 pointed to major world economies, such as the United States and the Eurozone, entering recessions in 2023.",
        "In several others, including China, expansion would be slow.",
        "The Central Bank had implemented a significant monetary policy adjustment, taking the MPR to 11.25% at the October meeting.",
        "This was contributing to the gradual easing of inflationary pressures and would provide a better position to confront the difficulties of the external scenario.",
        "However, the activity gap was still high, inflation continued at exceptionally high levels and inflation expectations were above the target over the two-year horizon, all signs that the adjustment process of the Chilean economy was not yet complete.",
        "The local inflation outlook had evolved mirroring the forecasts in the September Monetary Policy Report, which was a significant development after several quarters of substantial changes in the macroeconomic scenario from one Report to the next.",
        "Annual inflation had declined slightly after peaking in August, driven mainly by volatile items, as well as some goods in the non-volatile basket.",
        "Behind the inflation behavior was a sum of factors, including the economy’s adjustment, the normalization of global supply chains and the decline in some international prices.",
        "The decline in annual inflation was positive news.",
        "However, the risks were far from over.",
        "Persistent inflation remained a matter of serious concern.",
        "Inflation levels remained well above target and the central scenario projections of this Report exceeded those of the previous one.",
        "Despite some moderation, inflation expectations two years ahead remained above 3%.",
        "Meanwhile, although the economy’s adjustment trend continued, indicators showed a somewhat more dynamic demand in the margin.",
        "This development was tempered by the fact that the biggest difference was in investment, concentrated in some specific sectors, with the overall outlook remaining weak towards 2023 and with a smaller impact on inflation.",
        "In any case, this issue needed to be carefully monitored.",
        "All the Board members agreed that the background information known since the October meeting was, for the most part, consistent with the decision announced at the time.",
        "This was that, after raising the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) to 11.25%, the Board had communicated that the MPR was at the highest point of the cycle begun in July 2021 and that it would be kept there for as long as was deemed necessary to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target over the two-year policy horizon.",
        "In this context, the Board agreed that the only plausible option at this Meeting was to keep the MPR at 11.25%.",
        "All five Board Members agreed that the events of recent months indicated that the economy was in an adjustment phase and that inflation would begin to ease.",
        "However, this did not imply that efforts to reduce inflation should diminish, much less that the inflationary problem had been solved.",
        "On the contrary, there was still a way to go before the macroeconomy would signal that the process of inflation convergence to the target had been consolidated.",
        "The full Board agreed that the turning points of monetary policy would be based primarily on an assessment of the state of the economy and not on specific dates.",
        "There was consensus among the Board that the key and essential commitment was to fight for inflation to return to 3% in two years, which was the way to avoid excessive and unnecessary costs for the population.",
        "Prematurely starting the process of lowering the MPR might have adverse effects on inflationary persistence and, therefore, on economic activity, as sensitivity scenarios could materialize that would force a pause or even a reversal of the process.",
        "Plus, this could adversely affect monetary policy communication and the Bank’s credibility.",
        "Anyway, there were also scenarios in which inflation falling faster, in which case the Board would also be vigilant.",
        "Governor Costa, Vice-Governor García, and Board members Naudon, Céspedes, and Novy voted for holding the MPR at 11.25%.",
        "Headline inflation had continued on an upward path, reaching 12.5% annually in June, while the core component had risen to 9.9% annually.",
        "CPI data for May and June had been largely in line with forecasts in the June Monetary Policy Report.",
        "The surprises were restricted to specific products, mostly volatile ones, and concentrated in the air transportation item.",
        "Inflationary pressures had continued to be reflected in the different lines of the core basket component.",
        "Cost pressures remained strong, amid a growing impact of labor costs and a more depreciated exchange rate.",
        "Business costs expectations as reported in the June IMCE remained near their historical highs.",
        "Inflation expectations derived from the July Economic Expectations Survey (EES) and the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) prior to the July meeting had been adjusted upward and remained above 3% over the two-year horizon.",
        "In May, the Imacec had posted annual variation of 6.4%, which included a 0.9% monthly drop in its nonmining component in its seasonally-adjusted series.",
        "Despite the positive surprise on the mining side, activity in all other sectors had continued to fall at a gradual pace, consistent with what was anticipated in the June Report.",
        "Again, the greater resilience of the sectors most closely linked to household consumption — especially services— stood out.",
        "The demand indicators had evolved in line with projections and continued to reflect a notorious disparity between the performances of private consumption and investment.",
        "Business (IMCE) and consumer (IPEC) confidence remained in pessimistic ground.",
        "In the labor market (INE), job creation had slowed further, with a fall in salaried employment (formal and informal) and an upturn in self-employment.",
        "The unemployment rate remained stable and close to historical averages, which was partly explained by the still high level of inactivity.",
        "Labor demand continued to lose momentum, as suggested by the online job postings index, which had declined again marginally.",
        "Business expectations for employment had continued to recede (IMCE).",
        "Annual real wage growth remained negative, reflecting the rising inflation.",
        "The domestic financial market had adapted to the deteriorating global financial conditions, in a context of high local uncertainty.",
        "Since the last Meeting, the IPSA had fallen by nearly 5%, the sovereign risk premium (CDS) had increased and the nominal 10-year interest rates (BTP-10) showed no major variation.",
        "The exchange rate had depreciated sharply (just over +20% since the last meeting), with high volatility.",
        "Up to that moment, the markets had been able to absorb the shocks adequately and the volatility in the forex market had not been transmitted to other segments of the financial system, which had operated with adequate liquidity levels.",
        "Bank lending remained subdued in the various segments, with financing conditions perceived to be tighter and demand for new loans lower, according to the second-quarter Bank Lending Survey.",
        "Lending interest rates had risen further in most portfolios.",
        "Market expectations about how far up the MPR would go in the current cycle of hikes had risen again.",
        "Both the EES and the FTS surveys placed it at 10% at the September meeting.",
        "Financial asset prices spoke of a higher level.",
        "As global inflation was still increasing central banks had either continued to raise their benchmark rates or signaled a faster hike if the rising inflation proved more persistent.",
        "At its June meeting, the U.S. Federal Reserve had made an unannounced 75 basis-point (bp) increase and had anticipated that rate hikes would continue going forward until inflation was brought under control.",
        "The European Central Bank had confirmed the end of its asset purchase program and announced that the rate hike cycle would begin in July.",
        "In this scenario, financial conditions had tightened around the world.",
        "Increased risk aversion had led to declines in world stock markets, while the dollar had appreciated sharply against other currencies and long-term interest rates had shown mixed movements.",
        "Since the last Meeting, the market’s outlook for global growth had deteriorated, approaching estimates in the June Report.",
        "In the U.S., concerns about an upcoming recession had increased.",
        "Tighter financial conditions had begun to affect investment, and consumer confidence had fallen further, as high inflation continued to erode real wages.",
        "In the Eurozone, higher inflation continued to show signs of spilling over the consumer basket.",
        "Consumer confidence and business and investor expectations had continued to worsen, amid Russia’s protracted invasion of Ukraine.",
        "In China, activity had seen some recovery after the reopening of the economy, although consumption fundamentals had remained weak and the risks associated with the zero-tolerance policy for Covid-19 were still present.",
        "Although activity in Latin America had shown positive surprises and the outlook for 2022 was broadly unchanged, for 2023 the outlook looked more unfavorable in the face of worsening financial conditions, weaker external momentum, low confidence levels, and the persistent rise in inflation.",
        "Commodity prices had fallen more than anticipated in the June Report, in large part because of fears of a global recession, the financial volatility, and the resulting appreciation of the dollar.",
        "Food prices posted the biggest drop, among which wheat stood out (-24% since the last meeting), which was also explained by a more favorable outlook on the supply side.",
        "The price of copper had declined significantly to around US$3.3 per pound (slightly more than -20% since the last meeting), even though inventories remained at historically low levels.",
        "Although the price of an oil barrel remained high, it had been corrected downwards to just over US$100 at the time of the meeting (-15% since the last meeting, for the WTI-Brent average).",
        "However, several of the factors that had driven commodity prices up were still present, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the constraints present in several markets, which kept prices under pressure, especially for food and energy.",
        "All of the above resulted in the external scenario being worse than expected in the June Report.",
        "The discussion touched on the evolution of the international scenario, noting the speed and magnitude of its downturn.",
        "The fall in commodity prices was stressed, affecting not only those products most sensitive to the economic cycle, such as copper, but also foods and energy, whose supply forces had been decisive in recent months.",
        "There were also lower prospects for world growth and tightened financial conditions.",
        "All these movements seemed to be linked to the inflationary cycle in the U.S. and the way the Federal Reserve should respond, although other negative phenomena linked to the dynamics of the war and the uncertainty about its repercussions in Europe could not be ruled out, which could also accentuate the downward risks in our international scenario.",
        "It was pointed out that, under normal circumstances of orderly macroeconomic conditions, it would be natural to evaluate the recent macro developments and the monetary policy outlook, by placing more weight on its medium-term effects than on the short-term inflationary impact.",
        "This was true both for what was happening with the sharp depreciation of the peso and the evolution of the external scenario.",
        "It was argued that, unfortunately, the Chilean economy was not in a normal situation; on the contrary, it continued to show significant imbalances: the activity gap remained wide; inflation was at levels not seen in many decades; and the current account deficit also showed very significant values.",
        "It was added that, beyond the Bank’s active response to the strong inflationary outbreak, it was evident that inflation was still high and that its local drivers, particularly consumption, was yet to show clear signs of normalization, beyond the fact that investment showed a clear weakness.",
        "Moreover, inflation expectations at different terms were also markedly above the inflation target, reflecting a view of greater inflationary persistence.",
        "The discussion focused on the events that were occurring the forex market, and there was agreement that the situation should be monitored on an ongoing basis, since changes were taking place at unusual speed.",
        "In fact, in recent days a significant increase in exchange rate volatility had been accumulating, which could introduce a difference with respect to the assessment made early in that week.",
        "It was agreed that the Bank had no limitations to act in the foreign exchange market, but that any action in this matter should be analyzed on its merits, referring to the functioning of such market and its potential repercussions on other segments of the financial market.",
        "Consistently, the Board agreed that, despite existing communicating vessels, the monetary policy decision does not relate to a specific exchange rate level, but rather to the evaluation of the inflationary implications of movements in the currency parity.",
        "The information received since the publication of the Report, particularly the short-term inflationary effect of the peso’s sharp depreciation, indicated that the annual variation of the CPI would be higher than that estimated in the last Report.",
        "In this context, just to ensure the same level of real interest rates as previously considered, a higher level of nominal rate was required in the horizon in which inflation expectations had risen.",
        "Meanwhile, it was estimated that the deterioration of financial conditions and the greater uncertainty of the macro scenario would have a negative effect on demand in the coming quarters.",
        "Although no projections were available at this Meeting to assess the medium-term trajectory of the MPR consistent with these developments, all the Board members agreed that the recent indicators called for higher rates in the short term, especially when the evolution of inflation expectations was factored in.",
        "All five Board Members agreed that the background information presented suggested that, in order to ensure the convergence of inflation to 3% over the policy horizon, it would be necessary to have a higher MPR trajectory than the one estimated in the June Report.",
        "Accordingly, three options were analyzed: (i) to raise the MPR by 50bp; (ii) to raise it by 75bp; and (iii) to raise it by 100bp.",
        "There was agreement that the option of raising the MPR by 50bp did not seem consistent with the current macro framework.",
        "It was pointed out that one way to consider this option valid would be to assume that the new scenario would be associated with a further contraction in demand whose effects on prices would offset much of the higher short-term inflation, which was seen as unlikely.",
        "One Board member mentioned that this option could also be valid if less negative effect it would have on the already plummeting investment was considered.",
        "Several Board members dismissed this option.",
        "One of them pointed out that, given the evolution of the macro scenario, this option was not consistent with the monetary policy path required for inflation to converge to the 3% target within two years.",
        "Several Board Members added that a hike of this magnitude was below expectations inferred from market prices, which could intensify exchange rate volatility and eventually cause problems in other segments of the financial market.",
        "All the Board Members agreed that the 75bp and 100bp options had the virtue of bringing the MPR closer to a level that looked more in line with the monetary policy needed for inflation to converge to the target within the two-year horizon.",
        "In the Board’s opinion, choosing one or the other had to consider conflicting aspects, such as the risks associated with higher inflationary pressures or medium-term contractionary forces.",
        "There was consensus that beyond this assessment, it was quite likely that the process of raising the MPR should be continued and that a 75bp hike provided more leeway for the assessment that would be included in the September Monetary Policy Report.",
        "Governor Costa, Vice-Governor García, and Board members Naudon, Céspedes, and Novy voted for raising the MPR by 75bp, to 9.75%.",
        "Inflation and its short-term outlook had continued to rise and was projected to approach 10% by mid2022.",
        "Higher inflation was having a significant impact on households, and continued to respond mainly to the recent quarters’ overspending wave.",
        "This impact had been exacerbated against a backdrop of significant cost pressures, which had been further increased by the commodity price shock triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",
        "The central scenario of the December Monetary Policy Report projected that in the latter part of 2022 inflation would begin to converge to the 3% target, which it would reach within the two-year horizon.",
        "Resolving the imbalances that the economy had accumulated over some quarters was vital for this convergence, fundamentally by adjusting the fiscal and monetary impulse, among other factors.",
        "Accordingly, and with a less favorable external scenario after the excessive growth of 2021, the economy would expand at a rate below its potential in 2022 and 2023, with contractions in private consumption and investment.",
        "The discussion centered around the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario, noting that the current situation seemed particularly challenging for monetary policy decision-making.",
        "First, there was an apparent change in the cyclical direction of the economy, which posed difficulties in properly calibrating monetary policy signals, as there was the risk of arriving too late or going too fast.",
        "Second, despite the rapid and significant increases in the MPR in recent quarters, inflation expectations from expert surveys and market prices indicated that risks of further persistence in inflationary dynamics continued.",
        "Third, there was the geopolitical shock present, which was having a negative impact on supply, implying higher costs and inflationary pressures in the short term, but which could lead to disinflationary effects in the medium term.",
        "The discussion turned to the evolution of inflation expectations and the reasons behind their divergence from the two-year 3% target.",
        "It was said that it was important to understand the motives behind these expectations, specifically whether they responded to a judgment on the Bank’s capacity to meet the inflation target or there were originated in a different view of the future evolution of the determinants of inflation..",
        "It was noted that it was difficult to establish which of the two reasons had greater weight: the first of them seemed less relevant considering that the Bank had raised the rate sharply over a short time span, even taking the market by surprise, and it was one of the world’s most proactive central banks in this matter.",
        "Therefore, the second explanation seemed more reasonable.",
        "Various sources suggested that the market had a clearly less contractionary view of demand, which was naturally associated with higher inflation.",
        "It was mentioned that beyond the reasons behind the behavior of inflation expectations, the fact that they remained above 3% in the two-year horizon was a matter of concern.",
        "On the one hand, it could lead to high inflation persisting longer than assumed in the central scenario of the Report, which was a problem in itself, because it would entail a more contractionary TPM trajectory, in the different scenarios under analysis, in order to ensure the convergence of inflation to the 3% target over the monetary policy horizon.",
        "On the other hand, in a context of high short-term inflation and a weak economy in the medium term, keeping inflation expectations in line with the target was essential for monetary policy to be able to deal appropriately with this scenario.",
        "The Board agreed that the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) should be further raised at a significant pace, consistent with a scenario where annual inflation was already high and was set to continue rising in the near future.",
        "The central scenario of the March Report considered an MPR that would be close to 7.5% in the second quarter of the year.",
        "While this scenario did not constitute a commitment by the Board, as decisions were subject to macroeconomic developments, it did allow for the establishment of policy options relevant to this Meeting: (i) raising the MPR by 125 basis points (bp); (ii) raising it by 150bp; and (iii) raising it by 175bp.",
        "All the Board members agreed that the three options were plausible, but that the 150bp option was the one that best fit in both technical and communicational terms with the intended message to be conveyed.",
        "Such a decision left them in a more comfortable position to react to any deviation or to accelerate the adjustment if deemed prudent as new information would become available going forward.",
        "Regarding the 125-bp and 175-bp options, there was agreement among the Board members that both had disadvantages, particularly the former.",
        "In the view of one Board member a 125bp increase could be ruled out based on the current inflation expectations scenario and what such an option would signal.",
        "In particular, because it would come as a major surprise, which could convey a relatively lower concern about the inflationary scenario and its outlook.",
        "Regarding the 175-bp option, all the Board members agreed that it could give stronger signals of concern about inflation, but it could also indicate an MPR trajectory that would go beyond the conditions described in the central scenario, and was therefore complex to communicate.",
        "All the Board members also agreed that increases in the MPR above 175bp —as could be observed in the expectations of some market agents— were outside the macroeconomic scenario that the Bank considered plausible.",
        "All the Board Members agreed that the Chilean economy was facing a complex scenario, and that the Bank’s main task was to ensure the convergence of inflation to the 3% target within the two-year horizon.",
        "For this reason, the Board would take every action necessary to meet this objective.",
        "Failure to do so would not only call the Central Bank’s credibility into question, but would also put the economy at risk, as it could end up causing a higher cost in terms of reduced economic activity and employment by weakening its ability to implement a countercyclical monetary policy.",
        "Governor Costa, Vice-Governor García, and Board members Naudon and Céspedes voted for raising the monetary policy interest rate by 150 basis points, to 7%."

        "In the Eurozone, despite an increase in total inflation during December, explained mostly by volatile items, core indicators were still moderating.",
        "In Latin America, the decline in volatile components stood out, while core inflation was taking longer to decrease, given the slower progress of services inflation relative to goods inflation.",
        "All in all, high levels of inflation persisted in some economies in the region.",
        "This took place in a context in which world activity had maintained moderate dynamism and its outlook remained contained.",
        "In China, figures for the fourth quarter of 2023 showed an economic slowdown, with growth expectations remaining cautious for 2024.",
        "Similarly, the outlook for the Eurozone remained weak amid the consequences of recent supply shocks, weak global demand, and the ongoing effects of tight monetary policy on certain sectors.",
        "The exception to the weak global activity remained the U.S., whose figures had again outperformed expectations in the fourth quarter of 2023, with demand still being driven by private consumption.",
        "In this context, the markets’ vision for the U.S. monetary policy had postponed the first reduction in the fed funds rate to the end of the first half of the year, thus affecting global financial conditions.",
        "The movements after the December FOMC, associated with the markets’ perception that the U.S. Federal Reserve had to some extent relaxed its monetary policy, had tended to be reversed during the past few weeks.",
        "Since the December meeting, long-term interest rates had shown moderate increases in some of the major economies, while the dollar had strengthened somewhat globally and stock markets had generally moved upwards.",
        "During the same period, the conflict in the Red Sea had been pushing up shipping costs in some international routes, while also driving some increase in oil prices.",
        "With respect to the December meeting, the price of a barrel of oil had risen to around US$80 (+6% since the last meeting, for the WTI-Brent average).",
        "The price of copper, although fluctuating, was around US$3.8 per pound, similar to the last meeting.",
        "In December, both headline and core inflation had posted negative monthly variations, which were below the expectations contained in the latest Monetary Policy (MP) Report.",
        "There was a significant difference in the core components of goods and in most volatile items.",
        "As a result, their annual variation continued to decrease, standing at 3.9% and 5.4% for total and core CPI, respectively.",
        "As for inflation expectations two years ahead, both the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) and the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) remained around 3%.",
        "Domestic activity continued to evolve in line with forecasts in the December MP Report.",
        "In November, the Imacec grew 0.3% month-on-month in its seasonally adjusted series (1.2% year-on-year), driven by the progress of most economic sectors.",

        "The labor market remained consistent with the trajectory of the economic cycle.",
        "The unemployment rate had reached 8.5% during the moving quarter ending in December, as the labor force was showing a gradual recovery.",
        "Beyond some limited variations in the margin, the expectations of persons (IPEC) and firms (IMCE) lingered in pessimistic territory.",
        "Regarding the external scenario, it was noted that inflation, although still high, continued to fall in several economies.",
        "As for global activity, the likelihood that the U.S. economy would undergo a smooth adjustment had increased, which would have implications for the country's inflation and monetary policy.",
        "In this context, global financial conditions had tightened somewhat, after incoming economic data had reduced the likelihood of an early rate cut by the Federal Reserve.",
        "China had closed 2023 with negative inflation and weak demand, especially for consumer spending.",
        "Moreover, geopolitical conditions had deteriorated, which was already affecting shipping costs and posing future risks in a number of areas.",
        "Locally, it was noted that activity, in broad terms, had behaved in line with December's forecasts.",
        "The Imacec data for November showed the impact of specific supply-related factors -in sectors such as fishing and mining-, as well as unexpected and transitory disruptions in manufacturing output.",
        "In general, all sectors were performing in line with expectations, reflecting the heterogeneity that had been the trend in recent months.",
        "On the demand side, indicators linked to consumption and investment did not show major changes.",
        "The labor market showed a slight growth in employment, with sectoral heterogeneity, and a growing wage bill in real terms.",
        "The Capital Goods Survey showed an increase in major projects for this and next year, with mining projects standing out.",
        "In any case, these figures were still considerably lower than historical ones and were below the previous year.",
        "Meanwhile, there were risks associated with the performance of certain business services activities and capital goods imports, although the latter variable generally presents a volatile behavior.",
        "As for local financial conditions, there was agreement that they were still tight.",
        "Qualitative sources, such as the BLS and the Business Perceptions Report, reported still high interest rates despite a recent decrease in some portfolios-, higher collateral requirements and contained demand.",
        "It was pointed out that tighter financial conditions than what was being perceived was a risk for the future evolution of activity, the gap and inflation.",
        "There was agreement that the main novelty with respect to the previous meeting was the negative variation of both headline and core inflation in December.",
        "While normally a single data point at the margin would not overly affect the interpretation of the macroeconomic framework on its own, this time there were some particularities.",
        "First, its size, which was larger than usual; and, second, that it added to other differences in the same direction in recent months.",
        "Both elements suggested lower inflationary pressures than anticipated, even considering the November figure which had gone the opposite way.",
        "Particularly, it was noted that understanding what this accumulation of lower PI records meant for the future inflation trajectory and for monetary policy decisions was a must.",
        "On the one hand, it raised questions about the size of the activity gap, in a context in which the evolution of activity and demand had not changed much over the last few quarters and the differences with respect to projections had been smaller.",
        "On the other hand, it called for an assessment of the level of pass-through of the peso depreciation of the last few months and the role played by external prices, in a context of a weaker Chinese economy.",
        "While various sources of information suggested that businesses had sufficient margins to accommodate a rise in imported costs, especially in a context of what they described as lower demand, goods inflation was showing rapid declines in several economies, reflecting the aforementioned global prices factor.",
        "However, these issues would be analvzed in depth as part of the reassessment of the macroeconomic scenario leading to the next MP Report.",
        "Comments were made on the possible impact that the INE's consumer basket updating would have on the CPI measurement.",
        "Difficulties in foreseeing its effect on annual inflation were mentioned, since changes in weights, products and calculation methodologies were involved, which made the end result uncertain.",
        "In fact, the analyses conducted by market economists yielded significant differences in the final impact.",
        "For the same reason, and without having more information than what was publicly available, the Board noted that any analysis on the impact of the change in the CPI measurement would be made after the publication of the data and the evaluation of its implications.",
        "All the Board members agreed that the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario showed that inflation was converging to the 3% target at a faster rate than had been expected some time ago.",
        "Beyond the surprise in December figure which had been significant-, inflation had been falling faster than expected for several months, in a context in which it was estimated that the economy had already narrowed the activity gap and inflation expectations were in line with the 3% target in the two-year horizon.",
        "In this scenario, there was agreement that the MP should reach its neutral level during the second half of 2024.",
        "Consistently, all the Board members assessed that more aggressive cuts than contemplated in the central scenario of December MP Report were necessary.",
        "Several Board members considered the options of reducing the MPR by 100 and 125bp.",
        "One Board member thought it was appropriated to analyze the option of reducing the MPR by 150bp, but then added that it would be preferable to wait for the next MP Report to implement such a change in the monetary policy strategy.",
        "All the Board members agreed that the options proposed reflected the need to speed up the pace at which the monetary restriction would be reduced.",
        "Therefore, the differences regarding the implementation of one or the other were more tactical in nature.",
        "The option of lowering the MPR by 100bp had the advantage that it would not come as a big surprise to the market, but it had to be accompanied by a clear communication that the MPR would reach its neutral level earlier than expected in the December MP Report.",
        "This favored signaling over surprising, which was of particular value in conditions of higher volatility and uncertainty.",
        "As for the 125bp option, it was noted that its advantage was that it would allow a faster approach to lower MPR levels, which might be preferable given the rapid fall in inflation and the state of the activity gap.",
        "One Board member pointed out that this option or a higher cut were, in his view, the ones that best responded to the macro scenario and reduced the risks of inflation being lower than desired.",
        "Several Board members mentioned that a cut above 100bp could be a surprise that might generate unnecessary volatility in some financial prices, which would end up undermining the correct transmission of the Board's decision.",
        "They noted that one of the desirable characteristics of monetary policy was its predictability.",
        "This did not imply that the Board should make decisions guided by what the market expected, but that it should guide the market regarding the future evolution of monetary policy.",
        "This could be achieved with a 100bp cut decision on this occasion, which allowed for more background information to be accumulated to strengthen the diagnosis on the state of the economy in the next MP Report and then give a clear communication of its future path.",
        "In any case, the market had already priced in several additional MPR cuts than expected in the December MP Report, which had shifted the rate curve in the appropriate direction given the changed scenario.",
        "All the Board members agreed that the proper monetary policy conduct implied meeting the inflationary target efficiently, i.e., at the lowest possible cost in terms of activity.",
        "This could require an early convergence of the MPR, which would reach its neutral level during the second half of 2024.",
        "Governor Costa, Vice-Governor Novy and Board members Naudon and Soto voted for reducing the monetary policy interest rate by 100 basis points, to 7.25%.",
        "Board member Céspedes voted for reducing it by 125 basis points.",
        "The local economy had evolved in line with forecasts in the March Monetary Policy Report (IPoM).",
        "Activity was heading to a growth path consistent with its trend, but showing heterogeneity across sectors.",
        "It was worth noting that, as expected, part of the higher growth early in the year had come from supply factors that had been reversing.",
        "At the same time, differences continued to be observed in the performance of the economic sectors, especially in the dynamism of services, better figures in some trade branches and poor construction activity.",
        "Domestic demand was outperforming expectations to some extent, particularly in consumption.",
        "The gradual recovery of household spending was taking place in the context of an increase in employment and real wages, sustaining the growth of the wage bill.",
        "As for Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), although still weak, the deterioration observed in the second half of last year had ceased, reflecting a more stable behavior of both machinery & equipment and construction & works.",
        "In any case, all GFCF components continued to contract year by year.",
        "Annual growth in the total CPI remained around 3.5%, while core CPI (i.e., without volatile items) dropped from 4.2% to 3.5% between February and May (spliced series).",
        "In cumulative terms, both measures were in line with forecasts.",
        "The annual change of services CPI excluding volatiles had dropped considerably from late 2023 (from 7% in December to 5.3% in May), reflecting indexation to lower inflation rates in the period that is most intensive in past-inflation adjustments.",
        "Inflation expectations at two years remained at 3%.",
        "The global economy continued to be dominated by the adjustment of expectations for monetary policy in the United States.",
        "World growth projections showed minor changes, although it was still necessary to bear in mind that several economies were performing somewhat better than expected.",
        "Regarding projections, local inflation was expected to rebound significantly and that convergence to the target would occur in the first half of 2026.",
        "This reflected the impact of the supply shock associated with the electricity prices hike and the greater momentum of domestic demand, considering early-year data and the higher copper price.",
        "About activity, the contractionary effect of energy costs on real household income was counterbalanced by the greater momentum of domestic spending given its improved fundamentals, and a higher copper price projection.",
        "The metal’s value had risen sharply in recent months and the projection scenario assumed that more than half of this increase would be permanent.",
        "There was important news in the global scenario.",
        "On the one hand, a postponement of the monetary easing in the United States was foreseen, which had put new pressures on the dollar at the global level.",
        "On the other hand, both the current and the expected copper price had risen.",
        "At the same time, longterm interest rates were high and were becoming more sensitive to changes in expectations regarding the Federal Reserve’s next decisions.",
        "The backdrop for this was higher uncertainty regarding several more structural global factors.",
        "Locally, it had been confirmed that part of the surprises observed at the beginning of this year had proved transitory, for both activity and inflation.",
        "It was also worth noting the appreciation of the peso and marginal data suggesting that domestic demand could be showing more dynamism.",
        "It was mentioned that the analysis included in the June IPoM indicated that commercial credit was performing in line with its fundamentals.",
        "However, incoming data showed a further weakening that called for close monitoring, as it could be signaling a less favorable behavior in some demand components in the near future.",
        "Two facts stood out regarding the central scenario projections in the June IPoM.",
        "First, the data for the last few months were in line with expectations, although demand showed a somewhat better performance than expected in the first quarter, which provided a more dynamic starting point for spending.",
        "Second, there were two factors that would have a significant impact on the evolution of inflation.",
        "On the one hand, the somewhat stronger domestic demand, in a context where the higher copper price boosted up the terms of trade.",
        "On the other, the impact of successive increases in the electric bill over the coming quarters.",
        "Regarding the factor first mentioned above, it was commented in the short term the copper price hike had generated an appreciation of the currency —with the resulting downward impact on inflationary pressures.",
        "Nonetheless, in the medium term, given the persistent nature of a part of the shock, domestic spending would strengthen, which would add to inflationary pressures.",
        "Thus, part of this effect would be transmitted to the external sector via imports.",
        "As for the second factor, the rise in the electric bill would be of such a magnitude that, other things being equal, it would have a significant effect on the CPI, especially in 2025.",
        "The most likely scenario considered that it would have a limited effect on medium-term inflation, as it was a one-time supply shock to the price level.",
        "Nevertheless, it was pointed out that there were scenarios in which the spillover mechanisms of this shock could make its inflationary effects more persistent than expected assuming the usual historical patterns.",
        "This could occur due to the importance of energy as a production input or due to the indexation processes to which the economy was subject.",
        "Meanwhile, the effects on households’ disposable income had to be factored in, as they could weaken demand beyond expectations.",
        "It was noted that the central projection scenario considered that, while important, the impact of this shock was transitory, and therefore contained a monetary policy response that on average did not alter the real monetary impulse considered in the March Report.",
        "It could even be argued that the monetary policy was somewhat more expansionary if the better scenario of aggregate demand resulting from improved terms of trade and slightly higher growth of trading partners was taken into account.",
        "In any case, there was agreement on the need for caution, as the evolution of inflation expectations and the impact of the spillover mechanisms on all other prices called for careful observation.",
        "All the Board members agreed that the macroeconomic scenario had evolved as foreseen in March.",
        "In this context, the local economy was returning to a growth path consistent with its trend and inflation continued to slow, with two-year inflation expectations remaining at 3%.",
        "The novelties of the central projection scenario were the better starting point of domestic demand, supported by the higher copper price, and the adjustment of electricity prices, which would significantly impact inflation, particularly in 2025.",
        "There was agreement that the two most important developments in the projection scenario suggested a path for the nominal MPR somewhat above that considered in March, as contained in the June IPoM.",
        "The Board remarked on the effect that the electricity rate hike would have on inflation, but also noted that, given its characteristics, a transitory supply shock, the monetary policy was capable of accommodating it without the nominal MPR having an equivalent reaction to the inflation hike.",
        "It was stressed that this was conditional on the second-round effects being in line with the forecast, which would be a matter for the Board to carefully evaluate.",
        "All five Board members agreed that the current MPR level was still above the neutral values that had been estimated in late 2023, so monetary policy was still contractionary in nature.",
        "For the same reason, as long as activity gaps remained relatively closed, medium-term inflationary pressures were in line with the target being achieved and expectations remaining anchored at 3%, the MPR should continue to be reduced over the monetary policy horizon.",
        "In the immediate term, the central scenario of the June IPoM estimated that the MPR had accumulated during the first half of the year the bulk of this year’s expected cuts.",
        "Consistent with this, all the Board members evaluated the option of lowering the MPR by 25 basis points (bp) to be plausible.",
        "Several Board members evaluated the options of lowering it by 50 bp or keeping it at 6%.",
        "About the decision to cut 25bp off the MPR, it was noted that this option was the most consistent one with the IPoM’s central scenario.",
        "It had the advantage of clearly stating that, despite how important the shock on inflation was, it was transitory, and monetary policy could accommodate it by further reducing the MPR in the quarters ahead.",
        "Moreover, it was a decision that, if the central scenario proved true, it left room for a further reduction in the remainder of the year.",
        "As for the options of cutting 50 bp off the MPR or keeping it unchanged, it was said that they were valid insofar as the sensitivity scenarios defining the MPR corridor were given more weighting.",
        "On the one hand, the option of keeping the rate unchanged was consistent with a scenario where the impact on inflation of the higher expenditure and the supply shock would exceed the forecast, leading to a more contractionary than expected monetary policy.",
        "It was added that, because most of the MPR adjustments had been made in the first part of the year, it was possible to monitor the evolution of the scenario.",
        "In turn, the option to cut 50bp was based on a less benign reading of recent spending developments, a more negative view on the weakness of commercial credit according to the latest data, or that the negative effects of the electric utility rate hike on disposable income would be larger than expected.",
        "In contrast to the option of reducing the MPR by 50bp, it was mentioned that, if the central scenario were to materialize, that decision could force a prolonged pause in the process of reductions.",
        "Regarding the option to maintain the policy rate unchanged it was mentioned that it could send the wrong signal about the risks that the Board was analyzing.",
        "Governor Costa and Board members Naudon, Céspedes and Soto voted for lowering the monetary policy rate by 25 basis points, to 5.75%.",
        "Vice-Governor Novy voted for lowering it by 50 basis points.",
        "Inflation had declined rapidly and was closer to 3%, in a scenario of domestic spending adjustment and a narrowing of the activity gap, which had contributed to resolving the large macroeconomic imbalances of previous years.",
        "In this context, two-year inflation expectations had remained at 3% for several quarters.",
        "Early-year data showed some increase in annual inflation.",
        "Both January and February had seen high and above-expected monthly CPI variations.",
        "Among other factors, this had been due to the depreciation of the exchange rate, world price increases and inflation-adjustment of some local prices.",
        "In addition, monthly inflation had shown greater volatility in the past few months.",
        "This recent inflation performance took place in a context where at the beginning of the year both the mining and non-mining Imacec components had improved somewhat above expectations.",
        "This combined several elements, namely: greater external demand, supply factors and signs of greater local impulse.",
        "Given the transitory nature of some of these factors, slower expansion velocities were foreseen for some months ahead, in line with assumptions contained in the previous Monetary Policy Report (IPoM).",
        "In turn, in the second half of 2023, final demand had been somewhat weaker than projected, particularly in its tradable components.",
        "The 2023 National Accounts showed that the deseasonalized series of household consumption had fallen up to the third quarter, with a modest recovery towards the end of the year.",
        "Gross fixed capital formation (GFF) showed a strong reduction in the last quarter of 2023, particularly for machinery and equipment.",
        "On the external front, world inflation had continued to ease, although there were some risks due to the reversal of cost factors and the persistence of high services inflation.",
        "Doubts rested especially on the United States, where the resilience of its economy stood out, supported by strong dynamism in the labor market and private consumption.",
        "The greater dynamism of the economy, along with recent inflation figures somewhat higher than expected, had led the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the market to believe that interest rate cuts would be postponed to the second half of the year.",
        "The postponement of the interest rate cut in the US and the slower reductions central banks elsewhere had affected Chile's interest rate differential with other economies.",
        "This, coupled with the evolution of its other determinants, was behind the significant depreciation of the peso, showing greater than usual sensitivity.",
        "These factors, combined with the recent rise in some international prices, are expected to push up annual inflation in 2024.",
        "Our projections are that it will converge to the 3% target within the two-year monetary policy horizon, which considers the temporary nature of the aforementioned elements, that the economy will post growth rates consistent with its trend, and that the real exchange rate (RER) will gradually decline.",
        "Regarding activity, the IPoM's central scenario assumes GDP growth for this year to range between 2% and 3%, and between 1.5% and 2.5% for 2025 and 2026.",
        "It was emphasized that domestic activity and demand reflected the resolution of the significant imbalances of previous years, which had been the main cause of the high inflation observed in the period.",
        "Incoming data showed somewhat more dynamic activity; however, it was difficult to infer from this any change in inflationary pressures.",
        "Partly because many of the activity surprises could be transitory and partly because some sectors of domestic demand looked weaker.",
        "In fact, an evaluation of the state of the gaps showed them to be bigger in the sectors linked to goods consumption.",
        "It was noted too that, despite the temporary nature of some elements, data from the beginning of the year made it possible to project somewhat stronger growth in activity in 2024, as reflected in the growth range of the central IPoM scenario.",
        "Moreover, despite the weak domestic demand in late 2023, the most recent labor market, credit and expectations data, among others, pointed to a continuation of moderate consumption growth and a recovery in investment in the second half of 2024.",
        "This showed that the possibility of significantly lower-than-expected activity, which could pull inflation below the 3% target, was seen as unlikely.",
        "With respect to inflation, it was noted that several surprises had led to the annual CPI variation to end 2023 below the December forecast, which had been compounded by a reduction in its levels during the past year as a result of the updated basket and improved methodological measurements.",
        "However, in the first two months of 2024, monthly inflation had been high and above expectations.",
        "These results were explained by a specific set of elements, including the depreciation of the peso, external price increases and some local inflation-based repricing.",
        "In this context, the outlook for 2024 considered in the IPoM central scenario increased, based on higher external costs, the exchange rate hike and the inflation rates of the beginning of the year.",
        "In any case, the assessment of the macroeconomic scenario suggested that the inflationary pressures facing the economy were lower than they had been six months earlier.",
        "Even so, the risks were significant and required careful analysis.",
        "The evolution of the exchange rate in recent months was discussed.",
        "It was recalled that, since the last IPoM, the nominal exchange rate had depreciated significantly, going from around 870 pesos to nearly 980 pesos in the days prior to the MP meeting.",
        "Part of this depreciation was explained by the evolution of interest rate differentials with the U.S. and other economies, which had added more than expected pressure on the peso.",
        "In particular, because the futures for the Fed funds rate indicated that they would be kept for a longer period and would be reduced more gradually than expected some time ago, while for the monetary policy rate (MPR), although it had changed in the meantime, the trajectory expected by market prices was similar to the one considered last December.",
        "Background information was discussed suggesting that the peso's reaction to these rate differentials was greater than in the past and potential reasons were explored.",
        "It was mentioned that the central scenario considered that, as the prospects of rate cuts for the rest of the world began to consolidate -particularly for the US and Latin American countries-, the RER would appreciate and would ease inflationary pressures on the economy.",
        "All five Board Members agreed that the background information accumulated since the last Meeting indicated that the MP should be further reduced.",
        "On the one hand, beyond the recent evolution of activity, the economy still presented weak domestic demand.",
        "Actually, it was estimated that some of the factors that had led to higher growth in the Imacec at the start of the year were temporary in nature.",
        "On the other hand although the peso depreciation and global cost shocks pointed to greater pressures on prices, both factors would tend to dissipate within the monetary policy horizon.",
        "Moreover, given the slack in sectors linked to goods consumption, the pass-through of their effects on inflation would be moderate.",
        "Therefore, although it was possible that inflation would rise in the short term, in the medium term there were still forces at work that would bring it back to the 3% target within the two-year policy horizon.",
        "In this way, the strategy of concentrating a significant part of the MP reductions in the first half of this year remained in place.",
        "Therefore, starting from MP levels that were still above what could be considered neutral, the right action at this Meeting was to continue reducing it at fairly fast.",
        "In this scenario, all the Board members considered that the options of reducing the MPR by 75 or 100 basis points (bp) were plausible.",
        "One of them estimated that a 50bp cut could be considered if more weight was assigned to the risk of increasing inflationary pressures However, the option was quickly ruled out because there was not enough background to validate it.",
        "There was consensus in the Board that the options of reducing the MP by 75 or 100bp seemed the most appropriate.",
        "Both of them satisfied the need to continue to make substantial cuts to the MPR, better reflecting the economy's progress in resolving the significant macroeconomic imbalances and the inflationary convergence process.",
        "Therefore, leaning to one or the other option had connotations more closely related to tactical and risk elements.",
        "The option of cutting 75bp off the rate provided greater degrees of freedom in the event that some assumptions in the central scenario failed to materialize as expected, particularly those that considered that some of the recent phenomena, such as the rise in cost pressures, were temporary in nature.",
        "This could also be the case if activity and domestic demand were to recover more rapidly, putting upward pressure on inflation.",
        "In addition, it coincided with what the markets expected, avoiding surprises that could affect the correct transmission of the boards assessment of macroeconomic conditions and the expected path of inflation.",
        "This, in a context where market expectations for inflation, growth and the MP trajectory during 2024 did not differ substantially from the central scenario depicted in the IPoM.",
        "Governor Costa, Vice-Governor Nov, and Board members Naudon, Céspedes and Soto voted for lowering the monetary policy interest rate (MPR) by 75 basis points, to 6.5%.",
        "On the external front, global inflation had generally continued to decline at a moderate pace, mainly due to a slow decline in the services components.",
        "In the United States, June’s inflation had been below expectations and the labor market was showing signs of moderation at the margin, including only modest job creation.",
        "This had turned the market’s outlook for the Federal Reserve (Fed)’s monetary policy somewhat less contractionary.",
        "In the Eurozone, total inflation had receded as expected, although its core component had remained unchanged compared to May and exceeded projections, in a context where the inflationary dynamic of the region had shown some volatility in recent months due to one-off events.",
        "In several Latin American economies, inflation had tended to stabilize.",
        "On one hand, the widespread rebound of food prices in the region, partly influenced by the lagged effects of the El Niño phenomenon.",
        "On the other hand, core inflation had fallen, along with the prices of goods, in a scenario of no significant slack in the labor markets.",
        "About activity, second-quarter growth had accelerated in the United States exceeding market forecasts.",
        "Every component of domestic demand had contributed to boost growth in the country, with a noteworthy contribution of private consumption.",
        "This situation contrasted with the limited pace of growth observed in the rest of the world, especially due to a greater-than-expected slowdown in China in the second quarter.",
        "This was explained, in large part, by the weakness of consumption, while investment had continued to show a disparity between the deteriorating residential sector and a more favorable evolution of investment in manufacturing and infrastructure.",
        "In the Eurozone, high-frequency activity data for the second quarter showed signs that the bloc’s economy was growing, but at a somewhat slower pace than in the preceding quarter.",
        "Monthly Latin American indicator had maintained their dynamism and suggested that the rebound observed in the first quarter would continue going forward.",
        "Overall, growth prospects had not changed significantly for 2024-2025.",
        "As for global financial markets, compared with the previous Meeting, long-term interest rates had seen some decline in both developed and emerging economies.",
        "The stock markets had shown mixed movements and the global dollar had appreciated.",
        "In general, commodity prices had dropped since the last Meeting.",
        "The drop in metals responded partly to somewhat weaker signals from China, along with other elements such as a lower momentum associated with the energy transition in developed economies and some positive supply-side news.",
        "Thus, although with fluctuations, the price of copper had decreased with respect to the June meeting.",
        "The price of a (WTIBrent average) oil barrel was around US$79 in the days prior to the Meeting (-5% since the June Meeting).",
        "Food prices had remained fairly stable during June, although there had been significant falls for some grains due to a more favorable outlook on the supply side.",
        "In June, headline inflation had been in line with forecasts in the last IPoM.",
        "The core measure --CPI without volatile items-- had varied less than expected, mainly in goods and due to factors that were estimated to be transitory.",
        "Among them, the occurrence of trade-related events that had a stronger than anticipated downward impact.",
        "On the volatile side, foodstuff prices had risen more than expected due to adverse weather events.",
        "Thus, the annual variation of the CPI --spliced benchmark series-- reached 3.8% and that of the core measure reached 3.2%.",
        "Regarding two-year inflation expectations, both the Economic Expectations Survey (EEE) and the Financial Operators’ Survey (EOF) were at around 3%.",
        "Local activity had performed below expectations in the June IPoM.",
        "In May, the non-mining Imacec had decreased 0.5% month-on-month in its seasonally adjusted series (+0.2% annually), a result that was largely explained by one-off supply factors, mainly associated with manufacturing and mining.",
        "June sectoral activity data (INE) showed a below-expected performance in some sectors.",
        "On the demand side, high-frequency indicators pointed to no major differences with the projections of the last IPoM.",
        "The large-scale investment project surveys stood out, showing a significant increase in the amounts foreseen for the upcoming years.",
        "In the labor market, the unemployment rate for the moving quarter ending in June remained at 8.3%.",
        "Although still in pessimistic territory, the expectations of businesses and households had picked up somewhat.",
        "In the local financial market, short- and long-term indexed interest rates had declined since the last Meeting, in a context where nominal rates had not changed much.",
        "The peso had depreciated, in line with a lower copper price.",
        "Meanwhile, the IPSA stock index had oscillated and had fallen a little sin the last Meeting.",
        "Our Bank Lending Survey (ECB) for the second quarter of 2024 revealed that the lending conditions had been stable in most portfolios, while the demand for loans was still low in every segment.",
        "Real consumer and commercial loans were still declining, with annual variations of -2.1% and -2.8% in June, respectively.",
        "In the housing segment, they maintained moderate growth (+2.3% in real annual terms in the same period).",
        "The rates of shorter-term loans continued to reflect the pass-through of MPR cuts, in line with the usual patterns.",
        "Delinquency rates continued to increase in the commercial and housing portfolios, while they decreased slightly in the consumer segment.",
        "At this Meeting, the Economic Expectations Survey (EEE) median anticipated a reduction in the MPR of 25 basis points (bp), and both the Financial Traders Survey (EOF) along with the projections implicit in the prices of financial assets pointed to a pause.",
        "At one year, both surveys placed the MPR at 4.75%, while the forward curve saw it at 5%.",
        "It was noted that, generally, incoming news since the last Meeting did not deviate from the trends assumed in the June IPoM.",
        "On the one hand, the economy was recovering, with demand being somewhat more dynamic than activity.",
        "On the other, the direct impact of electricity prices on inflation would be significant, but transitory.",
        "Moreover, the outlook for investment, especially in the mining sector, was picking up.",
        "Finally, the US inflationary cycle would feature a gradual convergence to its 2% target, suggesting that the America economy, which had been unexpectedly dynamic lately, was losing speed.",
        "This would allow the Fed to go ahead with its gradual process of lowering its benchmark rate, with one or two cuts of 25bp during this year.",
        "In this context, global financial markets will remain broadly unchanged, with long rates still high but with possible minor declines, and the dollar remaining strong.",
        "In any case, it was noted that there were new developments whose impact was important to measure, as they could generate risks for the central scenario.",
        "On the external front, the weakness of the Chinese economy stood out, which contributed to a significant downward correction in the price of copper.",
        "If persistent, the Chilean economy could have a milder external impulse than contemplated in the IPoM, since the copper price, which was one of the factors behind the adjustment of the projections, not only because of its impact on mining investment, but also because of its consequences on expectations and the resulting effect on household spending, could have a greater impact on the Chilean economy.. At home, partial second-quarter data showed slower than expected activity.",
        "However, a more thorough analysis pointed to some specific factors in this result, while domestic demand performed relatively in line, albeit with a restructuring of domestic demand towards lower consumption and higher investment.",
        "Regarding inflation, the depreciation of the peso and the fact that the INE would not factor the subsidies associated with the electric bill hike into its CPI calculation, pushed up the inflation outlook for the second half of 2024 and the first half of 2025.",
        "It was pointed out that the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario seemed to be generating relevant risks with opposing effects on inflation.",
        "On one hand, the risk that activity would turn out to be lower than expected, leading to lower inflationary pressures.",
        "On the other hand, there was a risk of greater inflationary persistence, in a context of higher levels of inflation in the short term associated with the rise in electricity prices.",
        "It was argued that neither risk scenario was imminent and neither dominated over the other.",
        "Although activity was behaving below expectations, this was not the case with demand and some particular elements were identified.",
        "Meanwhile, the reaction of inflation expectations and interest rates showed that the markets had grasped the specific origin of the inflationary shock and its transitory nature.",
        "All in all, it was emphasized that this issue should remain under close scrutiny.",
        "All five Board members agreed that the information at hand confirmed that, generally speaking, the economy was evolving in line with the trends depicted in the June IPoM’s central scenario.",
        "Despite some important news regarding activity and the short-term inflation forecast that had to be considered, they pulled in opposite directions for the future inflationary dynamic.",
        "It was agreed that a more thorough analysis of the implications of these elements for monetary policy would be undertaken in the context of the next IPoM when more background information would be available to contrast these trends.",
        "The Board agreed that it continued to consider the strategy outlined in the last IPoM to be valid, i.e., that the convergence of inflation to the 3% target was consistent with a policy rate that would be further reduced over the monetary policy horizon.",
        "Accordingly, they considered the most appropriate options to be (i) hold the MPR, or (ii) lower it by 25bp to 5.5%.",
        "The Board agreed that the two options were compatible with the strategy proposed in the IPoM, noting that market expectations actually assigned fairly the same probability to both.",
        "Hence, choosing one or the other option required considering tactical aspects and the weighting of risks.",
        "On the one hand, considering the central scenario of the June IPoM, it was reasonable to begin to make pauses in the MPR lowering process.",
        "In addition, given the fact that short-term inflation projections were being revised upwards, there was room to be cautious and wait for the next Report with more background information and a revision of the medium-term outlook.",
        "As for the decision to lower the MPR, conditional on the central scenario, making that choice now or at one of the following meetings was just a timing issue.",
        "However, lowering the rate at this Meeting would limit the leeway for the rest of the year.",
        "Considering the related risks, it was noted that neither option clearly dominated over the other, and the data that would be known before the next IPoM would help to better gauge their implications.",
        "Governor Costa, Vice-Governor Novy and Board members Naudon, Céspedes and Soto voted for keeping the monetary policy rate (MPR) at 5.75%.",
        "Rosanna Costa, Governor; Stepanka Novy, Vice-Governor; Alberto Naudon, Board member; Luis Felipe Céspedes, Board member; Claudio Soto, Board member.",
        "Present the Finance Minister, Mario Marcel.",
        "Also present, Luis Óscar Herrera, General Manager; Juan Pablo Araya, Legal Counsel and Attestor; Elías Albagli, Monetary Policy Division Director; Ricardo Consiglio, Financial Markets Division Director; Rosario Celedón, Financial Policy Division Director; Gloria Peña, Statistics and Data Division Director; Michel Moure, Institutional Affairs Division Director; Markus Kirchner, Macroeconomic Analysis Manager; Enrique Orellana, Monetary Policy Strategy and Communication Manager; Sofía Bauducco, Economic Research Manager; Guillermo Carlomagno, International Analysis Manager; Felipe Musa, Market Operations Manager; Miguel Fuentes, Financial Stability Manager; David Kohn, Head of Massive Information Analysis Department; Andrés Sansone, Advisor to the Finance Minister; Erika Arraño, Senior Economist; Marlys Pabst, Secretary General.",
        "On the external front, world inflation had been declining steadily, although it had moderated its pace due to the high persistence of services components.",
        "In the United States of America, after a succession of upward inflationary surprises during the first quarter of the year, the April figure had revealed a deceleration of core inflation.",
        "In the Eurozone, inflation continued to subside, favored mostly by goods, and was slowly converging to the target.",
        "In Latin America, both headline and core inflation had generally dropped further, although its decline had slowed down due to some reversal in energy prices and the stabilization of goods inflation.",
        "All of it in a context of inflation expectations remaining above the target in several economies in the region, with the exception of Chile.",
        "This was taking place while economic activity and prospects that had remained contained, beyond some signs of an upturn earlier this year.",
        "In China, activity had accelerated in the first quarter 2024, while investment maintained marked heterogeneity between the deteriorated residential sector and the progress displayed by the other sectors, while consumption remained weak.",
        "Expectations for the rest of the year for the Chinese economy had not changed much with respect to forecasts in our March Monetary Policy Report (IPoM).",
        "The Eurozone had shown signs of a recovery, aided by services, while the manufacturing industry continued to linger behind.",
        "The U.S. remained the exception, as its economy remained resilient, favored by dynamic domestic demand due mainly by services consumption.",
        "Meanwhile, the labor market remained strong throughout the first quarter; job creation, after several months posting rises unexpected by the market, had shown signs of moderation in April.",
        "In this scenario, doubts about when the Fed would begin reducing the interest rates were the main factor behind the movements of global financial markets.",
        "Upward surprises in inflation, activity and the labor market in the U.S. economy had driven the markets to revisit their predictions about monetary policy, assuming that the rate cuts this year would be smaller than they considered in March.",
        "Compared with the April Meeting, long-term interest rates and stock markets had increased moderately in several economies.",
        "The global dollar, despite fluctuations, remained at similar levels-.",
        "As for commodities, worth noting was the substantial increase in the copper price, to nearly US$4.9 per pound (+22% since the April Meeting).",
        "This evolution would have been related to news about supply constraints, which contrasted with still strong demand associated with copper usage for the energetic transition.",
        "Oil was trading at around US$81 per barrel (WTI-Brent average), which represented a fall of around 6% since the April Meeting, due to a relative stabilization of geopolitical conflicts and weak demand for gasoline in the United States.",
        "The prices of cereals had risen, largely because of weather phenomenon that affected the supply outlook.",
        "On aggregate, March and April inflation had been in line with forecasts in the March IPoM.",
        "Thus, the annual CPI variation —spliced benchmark series— was 3.5% for both headline and core inflation—the latter being the CPI without volatiles.",
        "As for inflation expectations two years ahead, both our Economic Expectations Survey (EEE) and Financial Traders Survey (EOF) stood at 3%.",
        "First-quarter National Accounts showed that, overall, the economy had performed in line with forecasts in the March IPoM.",
        "In deseasonalized terms, GDP had grown 1.9% with respect to the previous quarter, a result to which mining, trade and some services had contributed significantly.",
        "In annual terms, GDP variation was 2.3%.",
        "On the demand side, quarter-on-quarter consumption had risen again.",
        "Gross fixed capital formation variation was almost flat.",
        "The labor market behaved consistently with the trajectory of the cycle, the unemployment rate stood at 8.7% in the moving quarter ending in March, while the labor force was expanding steadily.",
        "Wages were still on a recovery path.",
        "The expectations of businesses (IMCE) and households (IPEC) remained pessimistic, beyond marginal changes in opposite directions.",
        "In the Chilean financial market, movements of both long-term interest rates and stock prices matched those of its international peers.",
        "In turn, the peso had appreciated more than other comparable currencies and had strengthened around 8% against the dollar.",
        "This evolution owed mainly to the higher copper price, among other reasons.",
        "Regarding credit, our Bank Lending Survey for the first quarter 2024 reported that lending conditions offered by banks showed no significant change from the previous quarter, while demand for credit was perceived to be weaker.",
        "In that context, real consumer and commercial loans posted changes of –1.3% and –3.7% in April, respectively.",
        "In the housing segment, credit showed limited growth, at 2.6% in real annual terms in the same month.",
        "Lending interest rates, especially short term, continued to reflect the passthrough of the cuts to the monetary policy rate (MPR), although at different paces.",
        "Mortgage rates, more closely related to long-term credit, remained high, while delinquency remained high in every portfolio.",
        "Both the EEE and the EOF surveys, combined with prospects implicit in financial asset prices reflected expectations that, at this Meeting, the MPR would be reduced by 50 basis points (bp).",
        "In turn, while the EEE anticipated that the MPR would be at 4.5% in one year, the EOF and the forward curve placed such expectation at 4.75%.",
        "It was mentioned that the world economy had performed relatively in line with assumptions in the latest IPoM.",
        "The biggest news was the sharp increase in the price of copper, which had traded above US$5 per pound, but had shown some declines in the last few days.",
        "It was noted that said copper price hike could lead to revisions in the external boost to the Chilean economy.",
        "This assessment, however, required careful analysis of the degree of persistence of this shock and also of the pass-through mechanisms to the domestic economy.",
        "In the short term, the lower exchange rate could ease inflationary pressures.",
        "Into the medium term, this could be more than offset by the greater dynamism of activity.",
        "Overall, careful evaluation of the economy’s responses was also needed, as these could be different from what had been the case in the past, particularly during the commodity super-cycle of the early 2010s.",
        "It was noted that, aside from the potential impact of the copper price increase, there were other elements to review to yield a correct estimate of the inflationary pressures the economy would encounter with two years.",
        "On one hand, there was the dynamic of investment and credit, both of which were evolving in line with forecasts, but continued monitoring was required.",
        "It was mentioned that the first technical report of the National Energy Commission, which implemented the law to stabilize electric power rates enacted in late April, would be known almost simultaneously with this Meeting taking place.",
        "Preliminary antecedents did not rule out the possibility of several increases in rates, which would be greater than those considered in the current central scenario, so its implications would have to be carefully evaluated in the next IPoM.",
        "The discussion turned to the interest rate structure that prevailed in the market and whether it was consistent with the monetary impulse that the economy required.",
        "At the time of the Meeting, the market curve signaled a string of limited cuts that would place the MPR at 5% at the end of 2024, to then stay at 4.75% throughout the policy horizon.",
        "In real terms, this involved a rate above the ceiling of the current neutral MPR estimate range, a situation that needed to be analyzed.",
        "Several reasons were brought up to explain why this could be happening, including a different assessment of the neutral MPR and the expected monetary policy trajectory of the U.S. Federal Reserve.",
        "All five Board members agreed that information received since the last Meeting indicated that further cuts to the MPR were needed.",
        "The macroeconomic scenario was evolving in line with assumptions in the March IPoM, so the monetary policy strategy communicated at that time remained in effect.",
        "In this scenario, all the Board members considered 50bp and 75bp cuts to be plausible options.",
        "There was consensus among the Board members that both options met the need to continue reducing the MPR, thus reflecting the economy’s progress in resolving the significant macroeconomic imbalances and the process of inflationary convergence.",
        "Still, given its coherence with the March central scenario, the option of lowering the MPR by 50bp clearly dominated when the two alternatives were contrasted.",
        "Furthermore, the 50bp-cut option had the great advantage that it was widely expected, so it would cause no significant changes in market prices.",
        "It was emphasized that adopting this decision did not imply that the Board followed the market to make its decision.",
        "Quite the contrary, it had been market expectations that had adjusted to the Board’s communication in the March IPoM, with an MPR corridor that contained a reduction of that magnitude in the central scenario.",
        "Therefore, lowering the MPR by 50 bp only reinforced the previous message, which the market had made its own after the publication of the Report.",
        "Governor Costa, Vice-Governor Novy and Board members Naudon, Céspedes and Soto voted in favor of lowering the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points, to 6%.",
        "Rosanna Costa, Governor; Stepanka Novy, Vice-Governor; Alberto Naudon, Board member; Luis Felipe Céspedes, Board member; Claudio Soto, Board member.",
        "Also present, Luis Óscar Herrera, General Manager; Juan Pablo Araya, Legal Counsel and Attestor; Elías Albagli, Monetary Policy Division Director; Ricardo Consiglio, Financial Markets Division Director; Rosario Celedón, Financial Policy Division Director; Gloria Peña, Statistics and Data Division Director; Silvana Celedón, Institutional Affairs Director (s); Markus Kirchner, Macroeconomic Analysis Manager; Enrique Orellana, Monetary Policy Strategy and Communication Manager; Sofía Bauducco, Economic Research Manager; Guillermo Carlomagno, International Analysis Manager; Felipe Musa, Market Operations Manager; Silvana Celedón, Communications Manager; Andrés Sansone, Advisor to the Finance Minister; Marlys Pabst, Secretary General.",
        "As had been anticipated, the strong dynamism of activity at the beginning of the year had subsided, which was partly associated with the reversal of some transitory elements.",
        "However, the magnitude of the reversal was somewhat greater than expected.",
        "Part of the difference was explained by the decline in service-related activities and another part by the impact of some on-off supply elements, related to the availability of fishery resources in the industry, the effect of a climatic shock and maintenance downtime in mining operations.",
        "The July Imacec showed a significant acceleration of month-to-month activity, although it was estimated that once again a significant part was due to these transitory factors, in a context of high volatility.",
        "Demand had also underperformed in the second quarter, held back by private consumption.",
        "Household spending on non-durable goods and services had declined, breaking the upward trend of previous quarters.",
        "This behavior occurred in a context in which several of its fundamentals had evolved in line with expectations.",
        "Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) had stabilized after the sharp drop of the second half of last year.",
        "However, high-frequency indicators reveal important differences between sectors, as most sectors exhibited poor results in contrast with the dynamism of investment in the mining industry.",
        "Total annual inflation had risen to 4.4% in July, while core inflation remained close to 3.5% (benchmark series).",
        "The higher-than-expected headline inflation in the June IPoM was related to volatile items, mainly due to the increase in electric power rates and the prices of goods included in that CPI measure.",
        "Market inflation expectations exhibited a sharp contrast between the short and medium term.",
        "In line with financial asset prices, one-year inflation expectations had risen significantly, while at two years they remained aligned with the 3% target.",
        "The MPR cuts continued to be passed through to bank lending rates according to the usual patterns.",
        "Bank credit remained weak, especially its commercial component, amid conditions of access to financing without major changes.",
        "This result was consistent with the behavior of sectoral investment, dynamic for mining, which used Foreign Direct Investment more intensively to finance itself and weaker in the rest of the sectors, more prone to borrowing from banks.",
        "On the external front, news from the United States continued to dominate the economic landscape.",
        "The last few weeks had been characterized by the markets’ assessment of the American economy’s growth and the actions of the Federal Reserve (Fed).",
        "After the latter signaled the imminent start of the Fed funds rate (FFR) cutting cycle, short- and long-term rates had fallen in the main economies and the dollar had depreciated globally.",
        "The Chilean peso followed the movements of global markets, responding to the volatility of the external scenario.",
        "The projections for activity and demand continued to estimate that the economy would grow around its trend over the next few years.",
        "For 2024, the range for the GDP growth forecast was lowered at its high end, and unchanged for 2025 and 2026.",
        "Private consumption would regain momentum, although its level at the end of the projection horizon would be lower than in the previous estimate.",
        "The evolution of several of its fundamentals —such as the lower cost of credit and the increase in the real wage bill— suggested that its recent moderation would not last long.",
        "The GFCF growth forecast for the period 2024-2026 was somewhat lower than the one considered in June, reflecting the weak investment in the non-mining sectors.",
        "For the mining industry, the central scenario confirmed the greater impulse from investment, which would positively boost activity in other sectors, especially construction.",
        "The headline inflation projection was revised up for the short term, mainly due to the greater increase in volatile items.",
        "In the medium term, it is expected to decline more rapidly than foreseen in June, given the lower inflationary pressures stemming from domestic demand.",
        "It is estimated that it will converge to the 3% target in the early months of 2026, and remain nearby until the end of the projection horizon.",
        "The estimated impulse that the Chilean economy would receive from abroad considered that our trading partners’ growth would be fairly the same as our previous projection —i.e., around 3% in the period 20242026—, with some improvement in international financial conditions, including low long-term interest rates and somewhat lower terms of trade.",
        "It was noted that, with respect to the June IPoM and the July monetary policy meeting, there had been three developments that deserved analysis.",
        "First, the Fed Governor had communicated that “the time has come to lower the target range for the FFR…,” which was interpreted by all market participants as an imminent start of the cycle of monetary policy adjustments.",
        "In addition, the number of expected cuts for this year had risen compared to the assumption in the last IPoM and in the July meeting.",
        "This occurred in a context where, despite no major surprises in U.S. activity, the markets had intensified their perception that the U.S. economy could slow down more rapidly.",
        "In fact, this had led to episodes of high volatility at the beginning of August and was also generating movements at the time of the meeting.",
        "It was also noted that global interest rates at different maturities had declined and the peso had appreciated over the course of the past month, due to both changes in the rate differential and a decrease in foreign exchange premiums.",
        "A second factor worth mentioning was the evolution of domestic activity and demand in the second quarter.",
        "Although activity did not differ much from what had been projected after factoring in a series of supply-side factors that had affected various sectors, demand had been less buoyant.",
        "Private consumption posted a quarter-on-quarter decline, after its significant expansion in the first quarter of the year.",
        "It was estimated that this result would have little persistence given the evolution of consumption fundamentals, so the projected quarterly variations going forward did not differ from previous projections.",
        "However, the level of consumption would remain below the previous forecast throughout the projection horizon, which explained the expected behavior of domestic demand.",
        "Investment, although in line, showed significant weakness in every sector other than mining.",
        "In this scenario, consumption and investment projections were revised downwards by around 1% until 2026.",
        "All this took place in a scenario of still weak credit —a behavior that appeared consistent with the evolution of investment in the non-mining sectors— and employment had shown a marginal deceleration.",
        "Finally, the behavior of inflation expectations showed that market agents had considered the transitory nature of the effect of the increase in electric rates.",
        "There was a significant rise in inflation expectations in the short term, while in the two-year term they remained at around 3%.",
        "This occurred in a scenario where inflation had ultimately risen to some extent, as a result of a slightly higher-than-expected increase in electricity prices.",
        "The Board agreed that the combined information accumulated since the June Monetary Policy Report showed that the lower demand was being counterbalanced by the pressure on prices from energy costs, among other factors.",
        "This, together with inflation expectations aligned with the 3% target, reduced the risks of greater inflationary persistence in the medium term as a result of the cost shock, which pulled down the balance of inflationary risks present at the previous meeting.",
        "In that context, the Board members agreed that the MPR could be further reduced toward its neutral level.",
        "Given the lower risks to inflation that were assessed, this decline would be somewhat faster than previously considered.",
        "The Board considered reducing the MPR by 25 or 50 basis points, quickly discarding the latter.",
        "There was consensus that the option of cutting 25 points off the MPR was perfectly coherent with the central scenario of the September IPoM, with further lowering the MPR later on, and with the risks that menaced the economy.",
        "Moreover, the decision had undisputable communicational advantages.",
        "Governor Costa, Vice-Governor Novy and Board members Naudon, Céspedes and Soto voted for reducing the MPR by 25 basis points, to 5.5%."

        "Present the Finance Minister, Mario Marcel.",
        "In December 2022, headline and core annual inflation had been at 12.8% and 10.7%, respectively, both figures down from the previous month.",
        "However, inflation accumulated in the last two months had been higher than projected in the December Monetary Policy Report, both in its core and volatile components.",
        "Inflation expectations two years ahead from the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) and the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) persisted above 3%.",
        "In the latter, although two-year expected inflation was lower than in the survey prior to the December meeting, it showed a slight rise in the latest observation.",
        "Cost pressures had shown some signs of moderation but were still high.",
        "Companies’ cost expectations (IMCE) had continued to decline across all sectors.",
        "Transportation costs and the prices of energy and foodstuffs had continued to normalize globally.",
        "Furthermore, the exchange rate had fallen nearly 10% in the past few weeks.",
        "In November, the non-mining Imacec had declined again, with a 0.2% fall in monthly deseasonalized terms (-0,8% for the total Imacec).",
        "This result exceeded the forecast of the December Report and was explained to some extent by some services and wholesale and retail trade.",
        "However, this had been partly offset by a greater relapse of the manufacturing industry due to some particular factors, such as maintenance downtime in refineries and a truck drivers’ strike.",
        "From the expenditure side, the adjustments in consumption- and investment-related high-frequency indicators continued, including retail trade, imports, and low construction activity.",
        "In the labor market, both employment and participation figures had seen no big changes, with the unemployment rate hovering around 8%.",
        "Real wages continued to falter, in a context of still low demand for workers: the Internet Job postings index was under its historical average and companies hiring expectations (IMCE) remained low, amid persistent pessimism among consumers (IPEC) and entrepreneurs (IMCE).",
        "The local financial market mirrored the global trends.",
        "With respect to the latest Meeting, the IPSA stock index and long-term interest rates were at similar levels, while the exchange rate had appreciated around 8%, somewhat more than comparable currencies.",
        "Real banking loans remained contained.",
        "Commercial and consumer portfolios continued to fall (-4.6 and -2.1%, respectively in annual terms), while housing loans continued to show record-low annual changes.",
        "Consumer and commercial credit interest rates remained above their historical averages, with respective increases up to 28.1 and 15.3%.",
        "Interest rates on UF-indexed mortgage loans had dropped from November, to 4.4%, in a context where the Bank Lending Survey for the fourth quarter reflected still stringent supply conditions and further falling demand.",
        "The various market expectations indicators placed the monetary policy rate (MPR) at 11.25% at the January Meeting and the next cut in April.",
        "Forecast ranges obtained from the surveys had declined to 6.5%-7% in one year and to 4.5%-4.75% in two years.",
        "Expectations inferred from financial asset prices had also fallen and were below those contained in the surveys.",
        "Internationally, inflation had declined, especially in the U.S., where the CPI had gone from 8.2% to 6.5% between September and December 2022, owing mainly to lower energy prices.",
        "In any case, global inflation was still high, as the persistence of the core data continued to indicate, and inflationary pressures remained quite significant.",
        "In this scenario, the main central banks had continued to raise their benchmark interest rates.",
        "At its December Meeting, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) had raised range of the fed funds rate by 50 basis points (bp), to 4.25%-4.5%, in the context of a still tight labor market, which continued to pose an important upward risk for inflation.",
        "In turn, the European Central Bank had raised its monetary policy rate by 50bp at its last meeting, and had intensified the restrictive tone of its statement, adding a significant increase in its inflation forecasts.",
        "In Latin America, inflation seemed to have reached its peak in most countries, and some central banks had continued to raise their benchmark rates.",
        "Brazil, where the rate had been maintained, did not rule out resuming rate hikes if so required.",
        "The global growth outlook for 2023 remained weak, despite a small upward adjustment.",
        "In the U.S., incoming data showed that activity was still resilient, with robust private consumption indicators, supported by the momentum that the labor market continued to provide, as well as the dynamics of saving and credit.",
        "In China, the outlook had improved significantly following the end of the zero-Covid policy in December.",
        "The most recent activity and spending data had brought positive surprises, while measures to support its real-estate sector seemed to have reduced the likelihood of a severe contraction in the near future.",
        "The Eurozone also seemed to have outperformed expectations, as the effects of the energy crisis had been mitigated partly by the resilience of low energy-intensive industries, fiscal aid programs, and more favorable climate conditions.",
        "In addition, the end of China’s confinements was expected to boost external demand, while the outlook for gas prices had improved.",
        "Against this backdrop, the region’s confidence indicators had seen some marginal improvement.",
        "Financial markets had reflected greater optimism, fueled largely by changes in China’s zero-Covid policy and prospects of a more relaxed monetary policy path by the Fed, in a context where tighter monetary policies were expected from the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.",
        "Since the last meeting, the dollar had depreciated against all other currencies, risk appetite and capital flows to emerging economies had increased, and sovereign and corporate financing spreads in general had evolved more favorably recently.",
        "With the important exception of the U.S., most stock markets had risen, further encouraged by the more positive outlook for global growth.",
        "Long-term interest rates had shown mixed movements.",
        "Commodity prices had behaved heterogeneously.",
        "The copper price had risen significantly, up to US$4.2 per pound (+11% since the last Meeting), driven by better demand prospects from China and in a context of persistently tight supply.",
        "Oil was trading around US$83 per barrel (+5% since the last Meeting for the WTI-Brent average).",
        "The discussion covered the external scenario, noting that, since the December MP Report, it looked somewhat more favorable, with increased risk appetite in global financial markets.",
        "In the U.S., recent inflation data had surprised to the downside, encouraging market expectations that disinflation could occur sooner and have a milder impact on activity and employment.",
        "This had led the market to anticipate a less contractionary monetary policy path.",
        "In China, the end of the zero-Covid policy spurred expectations of higher global spending and activity, increasing the price of commodities, especially metals, including copper.",
        "It was further noted that, in any case, the risks of the global scenario remained significant.",
        "The gap between the fed funds rate as expected by the markets and by the Fed remained, which could be a source of global volatility when resolved.",
        "These external trends had been picked up by the local financial market, notably the appreciation of the peso, which placed the exchange rate well below its level at the statistical cutoff of the December Report.",
        "It was mentioned that, while the stronger peso was a significant development, an important factor to assess its macroeconomic implications —and its persistence— was to understand the reasons behind it.",
        "On one hand, said appreciation could be attributed to greater optimism regarding the evolution of emerging economies, associated with the change in China’s zero-Covid policy, which would put upward pressure on commodity prices and generate greater demand for Chilean exports.",
        "This would improve the current account of the balance of payments.",
        "In the medium term, such a scenario could even generate greater inflationary pressures, despite having a disinflationary effect in the short term.",
        "On the other hand, the drop in the exchange rate could be due to the predominance of purely financial phenomena of lower risk premiums and shorter-term capital flows.",
        "In such case, there was the benefit of a better immediate financial tone and disinflationary pressures, but it did not guarantee higher growth going forward.",
        "Finally, it was also possible that the decline in the exchange rate was a response to an unfolding sense that the cyclical weakness and disinflationary process in the U.S. was proceeding at a much faster pace.",
        "That situation —where the U.S. economy was not performing as well as expected and the Fed was aggressively cutting interest rates— would be a relatively disinflationary medium-term scenario for Chile.",
        "However, there was agreement that at this point it was difficult to elucidate the macroeconomic impacts of the peso appreciation, including its effect on inflation, and that was a task to be addressed with more information in the next Report.",
        "On the domestic front, it was noted that activity figures had presented some upward surprises in recent months.",
        "In any case, they were rather specific and limited, so that, in general, the adjustment scenario contemplated in the Report was coming true.",
        "High-frequency information indicated that the adjustment was ongoing, particularly in private consumption.",
        "In investment, survey information (CBC), capital goods imports and expectations continued to suggest that, beyond the positive surprise of the third quarter, investment would be adjusting downwards.",
        "In the labor market, real wages and vacancies continued to dwindle.",
        "Regarding inflation, there was consensus that, despite having decreased since its August peak, it was still very high.",
        "Moreover, the annual variation of its core part showed no major changes in recent months, so the drop in total inflation was rather associated with its volatile component.",
        "It was further noted that inflation accumulated in November and December had exceeded somewhat the Monetary Policy Report’s forecasts for both volatile and core inflation.",
        "It was worth noting that the short-term inflation projections measured in surveys showed no significant variations, despite the substantial appreciation of the peso.",
        "Some measures, such as two-year expected inflation in the FTS, even showed a slight increase.",
        "In this context, two-year inflation expectations remained above 3%.",
        "The Board recalled that in the latest Meeting they had delivered an unequivocal message regarding the future evolution of the monetary policy rate.",
        "That is, the MPR would be kept at 11.25% until the state of the economy informed that the convergence of inflation to 3% was consolidated.",
        "Therefore, in the Board’s opinion, what had to be done was to analyze whether there were any clear signs of said process being consolidated.",
        "Although establishing such a conclusion required reviewing multiple dimensions, some of them could be mentioned.",
        "On one hand, broadly speaking, the macroeconomic scenario was aligning itself with the assumptions in the December Report.",
        "Some aspects stood out, however.",
        "Although limited, activity and inflation brought some upward surprises which, coupled with the more positive tone of the external scenario, spurred some concerns about the speed of the economic adjustment and its implications for the convergence of inflation.",
        "The close of the 2022 National Accounts, which would be released in March, would give valuable information to assess the state of the adjustment the economy required to bring down inflation.",
        "On the other hand, the exchange rate was the most surprising variable but, as had been discussed, its medium-term implications on inflation were far from evident.",
        "Moreover, the markets’ inflation expectations had not had a strong reaction to the appreciated peso, as expectations two years ahead persisted above 3%.",
        "Plus, the risks around the inflationary scenario were still important, with a marked asymmetry with its costs in case inflation did increase.",
        "In this context, all five Board members agreed that there was no reason to believe that the convergence of inflation to the 3% target was consolidated.",
        "Therefore, the only plausible option was to keep the MPR at 11.25%.",
        "One Board member pointed out that analyzing the option of making a small reduction to the MPR at this Meeting could be valid.",
        "In this Board member’s view, this could be justified if it was kept in mind that, including the peso appreciation, the trends suggested that inflation was set to decline going forward, although it was recognized that there was not enough information.",
        "It could also be considered that, once deflated by inflation expectations one year ahead, the level of the MPR achieved 6% and was high by international standards.",
        "The other members reaffirmed that, for the time being, the option of lowering the MPR was not a valid one.",
        "In their view, in the current scenario, the convergence of inflation relied significantly on the credibility of the Central Bank’s capacity and commitment with the 3% inflation target over the two-year horizon.",
        "Any doubt would lead to an adjustment much more costly for the economy.",
        "The best way to mitigate this risk was to be more cautious regarding the start of the MPR reduction process.",
        "This suggested waiting until the process of inflation convergence to 3% was consolidated, because other paths could risk pausing or even reversing the process of lowering the MPR.",
        "Governor Costa, Vice-Governor García and Board members Naudon, Céspedes, and Novy voted to hold the MPR at 11.25%.",
        "In general terms, the economy had evolved in line with forecasts in the September Monetary Policy Report (MP Report), and the inflation outlook continued to point to its convergence to the 3% target in the second half of 2024.",
        "Compared to 2022, inflation had fallen from a peak of 14.1 % in August of that year to 4.8% last November.",
        "This had been a rapid decline, in which monetary policy action had played a significant role.",
        "Activity was back to slightly positive quarterly growth rates, and projections were that in the quarters ahead it would continue to gradually approach growth rates in line with its trend.",
        "In this context, the economy was expected to clase 2023 with zero growth, with the usual heterogeneity across sectors.",
        "Towards 2024 and 2025, the growth ranges of the previous Report were maintained at 1.25%-2.25% and 2%-3%, respectively.",
        "As for expenditure, no majar changes were observed in aggregate numbers.",
        "However, private consumption had shown an incipient increase in the third quarter, while investment remained subdued.",
        "In the labor market, job creation remained sluggish, with demand for workers still weak, consistent with the evolution of the economic cycle.",
        "The unemployment rate had reached 8.9% in the moving quarter ending in October, outpacing its historical average.",
        "Real wage growth had risen to 3.5% annually, favored by lower inflation.",
        "The economy had been making progress in resolving the macroeconomic imbalances accumulated in recent years.",
        "This had brought inflation down in line with expectations, taking steps towards the consolidation of its convergence to the 3% target.",
        "In general, domestic activity and demand had evolved in line with expectations, although with a larger than expected decline in the durable component of private consumption.",
        "The central scenario projections of the June Monetary Policy Report showed modest changes in magnitude with respect to the March Report.",
        "For this year, activity was expected to grow between -0.5% and 0.25%.",
        "In 2024 it would grow between 1.25% and 2.25% and in 2025, between 2% and 3%.",
        "On the external front, activity had begun the year with increased dynamism and reduced financial volatility.",
        "However, the outlook for financial conditions continued to be tight, in an environment of high uncertainty and in which a more contractionary monetary policy was expected in the main economies, considering their challenge to reduce inflation.",
        "There was consensus that the accumulated information brought no surprises with respect to the last Meeting and to expectations contained in the March Report.",
        "Abroad, there were minor changes in the global growth outlook.",
        "Although global inflation had eased in various economies, pressures remained, particularly in the United States.",
        "Thus, a scenario was outlined in which the financial constraints in the developed world would last longer, so the inflationary problem in those economies could be tackled.",
        "Thus, beyond the better performance of the first quarter, the projections continued to anticipate that Chile would receive a limited impulse from other economies.",
        "Locally, activity, demand and inflation indicators were well aligned with the March projections and the revisions made at the previous Meeting.",
        "From a demand-side point of view, although on aggregate neither consumption nor investment showed any significant deviations, the larger drop in private consumption of durable goods stood out.",
        "High-frequency figures for the second quarter — credit and debit cards transaction records (Transbank) and imports data— showed that this spending component was stabilizing at the margin.",
        "In that context, the central scenario of the June Report assumed that the first quarter’s drop in durable consumption represented an advance of the expected trajectory.",
        "Moreover, the lower durable consumption contrasted with steadily growing consumption of services, reaffirming the trend towards a restructuring of consumption in favor of the latter.",
        "Finally, government consumption had also surprised in the first quarter, with a higher-than-expected increase.",
        "Headline Inflation had diminished to 8.7% in May and non-volatile inflation had slowed to 9.9%.",
        "Both components were still high, beyond the fact that, headline inflation had seen six consecutive months of declines.",
        "The fall in overall inflation had been driven by volatile prices, and in the core part, by the appreciation of the peso and the adjustment of goods consumption.",
        "The services component continued to be more stable.",
        "Going forward, the lower local uncertainty would contribute to a more favorable evolution thanks to its impact on the exchange rate, while cost elements, such as labor expenses, provided a partial counterbalance.",
        "Two-year inflation expectations in the surveys had returned to 3% after a long time.",
        "The Board noted that the macroeconomic scenario had evolved in line with expectations, and therefore the economy was approaching a point where the data indicated that the convergence of inflation to the target looked more consolidated.",
        "In that context, a less contractionary monetary policy would be needed.",
        "There was agreement that this consolidation process had made positive strides in several respects.",
        "Headline inflation continued to decline, even somewhat more than expected.",
        "Two-year inflation expectations had made significant progress, and market projections for shorter terms were narrowing their differences with the Bank’s projections.",
        "Activity was proceeding as expected, which was consistent with an inflationary convergence process in line with estimates in the central scenario of the Report.",
        "Several Board members stressed that, while the risk of further inflationary persistence had subsided, it still seemed premature to rule it out completely.",
        "In their opinion, one should not lose sight of the fact that inflation was still high and the reduction in the core was less marked, suggesting that inflationary pressures had not yet dissipated to a significant degree.",
        "All five Board members agreed that the recent evolution of the economy pointed in the required direction.",
        "The fact that the monetary policy stance had been contractionary over several quarters had contributed considerable to bring down inflation.",
        "Moreover, although related risks persisted, they had been balancing out.",
        "In that context, if the trends continued, the process of reducing the MPR would begin briefly.",
        "The magnitude and timing of said process would take into account the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario and its implications for the inflation trajectory.",
        "In the central scenario of the June Report as approved by the Board, this was expressed in MPR cuts of the order of 250 basis points (bp) by the end of the year.",
        "Based on this, all the Board members considered that the following options were plausible: (i) keep the MPR at 11.25%; (ii) lowering it by 25bp.",
        "Some Board members added the option of cutting 50bp of the monetary policy rate.",
        "One Board member estimated that the best decision was to cut 50pb off the MPR, noting in the Statement that similar moves could be made at future meetings depending on the information accumulated.",
        "In this Board member’s view, this was consistent with the scenario in the Report and with suitable degrees of flexibility to deal with risks in either direction.",
        "Given the current monetary policy constraints, this Board member found it doubtful that such a move would be seen as a relaxation of monetary policy.",
        "This Board member considered this strategy more appropriate than keeping the MPR unchanged with an explicitly downward bias, which could be interpreted by the market as an anticipation of very aggressive cuts in the MPR.",
        "Several Board members agreed that the macroeconomic scenario had been evolving in line with expectations and that, accordingly, monetary policy should follow a trajectory relatively aligned with what had been said in an earlier Report.",
        "Based on this analysis, maintaining the MPR at this Meeting seemed to be the best alternative, since it was consistent with new information and with the foreseen trajectory for inflation convergence.",
        "This did not preclude the possibility of initiating an MPR reduction process in the short term if current conditions remained the same.",
        "In fact, one of these Board members recalled that the MPR corridor contained in the June Report depicted no path where the MPR would not begin to decline before the end of the year.",
        "In the view of one Board member, the risk of inflation falling more than projected, even below target, possibly accompanied by a partially unnecessary downturn in the economy, investment and employment, seemed to be quite high, adding that, in annual terms, private consumption had fallen quite significantly in the first quarter of 2023, mostly in durable and imported goods, but also in other categories.",
        "This larger than anticipated drop significantly reversed an earlier trend in which private consumption fell less than projected.",
        "This Board member added that inflation expectations had fallen in every term and instrument, coming closer to the Report’s forecasts and the 3% target two years ahead, emphasizing that the significant appreciation of the peso since October 2022 contributed substantially to easing inflationary pressures.",
        "One Board member noted that one way of assessing the relevance of reducing the MPR at this Meeting was to review whether or not the process of consolidation was taking place and/or whether the magnitude of the costs being caused by the process of lowering inflation exceeded expectations.",
        "Regarding the former, it was clear that important progress was being made in this process.",
        "As for the latter, there was no doubt that the economy was adjusting.",
        "Some figures showed it more clearly, others less so, but from labor to economic activity data, all reflected an ongoing adjustment.",
        "However, there was no indication that this adjustment was proving greater than expected.",
        "Several Board members recalled that the Report’s central scenario assumed that economic activity would be below potential GDP for several quarters.",
        "This projection had been maintained in similar terms for several reports, as it was considered a necessary condition for solving the inflationary problem.",
        "One Board member added that to argue that the distribution of inflation risks had been shifting in balance was a factual description of the state of the macroeconomy.",
        "At the same time, to argue that said distribution had moved in the direction of a faster fall in inflation and activity was not well grounded.",
        "It was not sustained by the available information on activity, demand, slack, labor market, etc., nor was it supported by the simple observation of the inflationary levels still exhibited by the economy.",
        "He recalled that the objective of monetary policy was to ensure the convergence of inflation to the 3% target over two years and that this was based on the management of the business cycle.",
        "In this Board member’s opinion, conveying the feeling that a risk about the performance of the business cycle was beginning to guide monetary policy could jeopardize the ultimate goal, namely the convergence of inflation to 3% within the two-year horizon.",
        "According to this Board member, conveying a message that what dominated in monetary policy conduct was the risk of an bigger adjustment of economic activity than was needed to ensure the convergence of inflation, would be inconsistent with the available macro information and would damage the effectiveness of monetary policy.",
        "Governor Costa and Board members Naudon and Céspedes voted for holding the MPR at 11.25%.",
        "ViceGovernor García and Board member Novy voted for a 50bp cut.",
        "Present Rosanna Costa, Governor; Pablo García, Vice-Governor; Alberto Naudon, Board member; Luis Felipe Céspedes, Board member; Stepanka Novy, Board member.",
        "Present the Finance Minister, Mario Marcel.",
        "Both headline and core inflation had evolved as forecast in the March Monetary Policy (MP) Report.",
        "In April, the CPI annual variation had been 9.9%, in a decline consistent with the gradual adjustment of domestic demand, the normalization of the significant cost increases of previous quarters and the gradual passthrough of a more appreciated exchange rate.",
        "In core inflation, the fall had been more limited (to 10.3% annualized in April), which coincided with still high pressures on the services side.",
        "Most measures of inflation expectations two years ahead remained above 3%.",
        "Preliminary first-quarter data —based on the Imacec— showed that the activity’s performance had been in line with expectations in the March MP Report, beyond the meager performance of mining.",
        "On the demand side, consumption-related indicators had continued to adjust downwards, with a weak performance of imports of these goods and of retail sales, according to Imacec and digital invoicing data, among other factors.",
        "On the investment side, capital goods imports, construction indicators and the responses of interviewees to the May Business Perceptions Report (IPN) confirmed its weak status.",
        "In the labor market, the unemployment rate had risen to 8.8% in the moving quarter ending in March (8.4% at February).",
        "Among other factors, this was explained by the reduction in employment and the increase in the labor force.",
        "Real wages continued to recover.",
        "This occurred in a context in which labor demand was still expected to weaken in the coming months, as suggested by the evolution of the Internet job postings index, the deterioration of companies’ employment prospects (IMCE) and the greater slack in the labor market suggested by the opinions collected in the May IPN.",
        "In this scenario, the perception of the economy by employers (IMCE) and consumers (IPEC) remained on the pessimistic side.",
        "Bank credit continued to show poor dynamism.",
        "Real consumer and commercial loans again showed annual contraction rates, which in April were at –2.1% and –5.3%, respectively.",
        "In the former, the persistent contraction of installment loans stood out again.",
        "Mortgage loans maintained modest growth (2.8% real annual change in April).",
        "The Bank Lending Survey for the first quarter showed that credit supply and demand had generally continued to weaken in all portfolios.",
        "Surveys to experts, namely the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) and the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) and forward interest rates reflected expectations that the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) would be maintained at this Meeting.",
        "All measurements coincided in that the first cut would take place between the July and September meetings, although they differed as to its magnitude.",
        "Thus, for September, the EES placed the MPR at 9.75%, the FTS at 10.25% and the forward curve implicit in swaps rates at 10.5%.",
        "Headline inflation had declined in several economies, although core indicators remained high, reflecting the fact that the inflationary convergence process was not yet consolidated.",
        "In the developed world, different signs suggested that this would occur at a slow pace —one such sign was the tight labor market in some countries—, even though the medium-term expectations of various agents were close to their respective targets.",
        "The main central banks had continued to raise their benchmark rates, despite a mixed outlook for monetary policy.",
        "Thus, while in the U.S. the Federal Reserve (Fed) had shown signs of a possible pause, the European Central Bank had signaled that further rate hikes were in the horizon.",
        "Global growth prospects for this year remained weak.",
        "In the main economies, the tightening of lending conditions, together with monetary tightening, were expected to negatively affect activity in the near future.",
        "In the U.S. the available data questioned a slowdown in consumption going forward, adding to the deceleration already shown by investment.",
        "In the Eurozone, consumption was also expected to be weaker, considering the deterioration of real wages.",
        "In China, although the actual figures had outperformed expectations, the boost associated with the reopening of the economy was expected to be transitory.",
        "Global financial conditions showed no major changes in the last month, but uncertainty about their future evolution was significant.",
        "Fears about the performance of the world economy, the potential vulnerabilities of some banks and the evolution of credit in developed economies were particularly noteworthy.",
        "In the latter, some impacts on bank credit to companies were already visible.",
        "Discrepancies between the Fed and market projections for the U.S. monetary policy continued to leave room for possible financial turmoil, as did the discussion around the U.S. government’s debt limit.",
        "In this context, currencies had appreciated against the dollar and stock markets had recorded slight increases, while long-term interest rates had risen only slightly in developed economies and declined in the emerging ones.",
        "Commodity prices had receded, in line with the weak global economic outlook.",
        "Compared with the last Meeting, the oil price had fallen by just over 8%, although with high volatility during the last month, which included the impact of the unexpected announcement of production cuts by the OPEC.",
        "The drop in the copper price had been around 5.5%.",
        "On the day of the Meeting, the metal was trading at around US$3.7 per pound.",
        "This decline owed much to the effect of the slowdown in demand, which outweighed the impact of the continued tightness of the market.",
        "Regarding the external front, it was noted that international financial conditions had tended to stabilize with respect to the last Meeting.",
        "However, they remained very sensitive to new information, in a context of greater uncertainty regarding future financial conditions.",
        "External risks continued to be high, due to both the probability of major disruptions in the banking system and an optimistic view of the markets regarding what it would cost to resolve the inflationary process in developed countries.",
        "In the country, it was mentioned that the unfolding of the macroeconomic scenario was in line with the central scenario of the March MP Report.",
        "Output was slowly adjusting towards its potential level, as was consumption.",
        "Consumption was losing dynamism according to incoming information, although it was still above the levels traditionally consistent with output or household income.",
        "On the other hand, headline inflation had fallen again, driven by its more volatile components.",
        "Although it had returned to one digit after several quarters, it remained quite high.",
        "The evolution of core inflation was still a matter of concern.",
        "Its annual variation remained at levels between 10% and 11%, where it had persisted for several months.",
        "Going forward, it should come as no surprise that core inflation would decline much more slowly than headline inflation.",
        "It was noted that the evolution of the labor market confirmed the signs of an adjustment consistent with the economy’s performance and the usual lags between the two.",
        "On the one hand, unemployment was rising.",
        "Although this responded to a greater labor supply, it also reflected less dynamic hiring.",
        "In the latter, there was a predominance of self-employment.",
        "On the other hand, the Internet Postings Index continued to decline, indicating that the labor market would continue to adjust going forward.",
        "The Board recalled that during the last meetings they had delivered a very clear message regarding the future evolution of the Monetary Policy Rate.",
        "It stated that the rate would be held at 11.25% until the state of the macroeconomy indicated that the convergence of inflation to 3% had been consolidated.",
        "All five Board members agreed that, from the analysis of the background data, it could be concluded that there was still no evidence to affirm that inflationary convergence had been consolidated.",
        "For this reason, the only plausible option for this Meeting was to hold the MPR flat at 11.25%.",
        "There was agreement at the Board that the performance of the economy was in line with forecasts in the March Report.",
        "It was pointed out that this was good news, especially after several quarters in which this had not been the trend.",
        "In fact, the usual pattern was to observe a string of shocks that were constantly modifying the macroeconomic outlook and affecting monetary policy decisions.",
        "The Board agreed that the fact that total inflation fell and activity and consumption continued to adjust did not indicate that the inflationary problem had been resolved.",
        "That only realized that it was on the right path and that information still had to be accumulated to assess whether the convergence of inflation to the 3% target had been consolidated.",
        "All the Board members reiterated the importance of the risks present, which could lead to scenarios of either higher or lower inflationary pressures.",
        "However, there was also agreement that, in the current context, the risks associated with scenarios of higher inflationary pressures were particularly complex and costly.",
        "Governor Costa, Vice-Governor García and Board members Naudon, Céspedes and Novy voted to maintain the MPR at 11.25%.",
        "On the external front, the main development had been the tightening and volatility of global financial conditions.",
        "This was associated with, among other factors, the dynamic performance of the U.S. economy.",
        "with its implications for the future evolution of U.S. inflation and a scenario of looming doubts about — — the country’s fiscal performance.",
        "Another factor had to do with geopolitical conditions.",
        "This contrasted with the situation in the rest of the world, where an important group of economies remained weak in both their actual and expected performance, including China.",
        "In this context, U.S. long-term interest rates had risen significantly, which had been transmitted to the rest of the economies.",
        "In fact, 10-year US Treasury rates had risen by nearly 70 basis points (bp) since the last meeting, to decade-long highs.",
        "This increase was largely explained by a decompression of term premia, associated partly with a market reassessment of the U.S. fiscal outlook.",
        "In addition, the Federal Reserve (Fed) had strengthened its message of prolonged monetary tightening and did not rule out further hikes in the federal funds rate.",
        "The outlook for monetary policy in developed and emerging economies had also tightened.",
        "All these factors combined had led to a global appreciation of the dollar and a negative correction in stock markets.",
        "Commodity prices had shown mixed movements.",
        "The recent escalation of global geopolitical risks, together with the announcements of OPEC+ production cuts, had increased the volatility of the oil price, which was trading at around US$87 per barrel in the days prior to the meeting (Brent-WTI average).",
        "Copper had fallen to US$3.6 per pound, in line with the global appreciation of the dollar.",
        "Food prices had continued their downward trend, although the rise in certain production costs and the effects of the El Niño phenomenon posed upside risks.",
        "Inflation had continued to decline.",
        "Compared to expectations in the last Monetary Policy (MP) Report, a faster fall was observed in core inflation ─which excludes volatiles─, particularly in its goods component.",
        "This was partially offset by volatile inflation, which had surprised slightly upwards since then.",
        "In September, total and core CPI had reached annual variations of 5.1% and 6.6%, respectively.",
        "As for two-year inflation expectations, in both the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) and the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) they remained at 3%.",
        "Activity continued to evolve in line with forecasts in the central scenario of the September MP Report.",
        "In August, the seasonally-adjusted total and non-mining Imacec had fallen compared to previous month, due to one-off factors that had affected educational services.",
        "On the demand side, data on retail sales, imports of construction materials and capital goods, among others, again showed weak consumption and investment.",
        "In any case, some related indicators had performed somewhat better than expected.",
        "The labor market had weakened further, mirroring the evolution of the business cycle.",
        "The unemployment rate had risen to 9% in the moving quarter ending in August.",
        "Real wage growth remained at around 2.5% per year.",
        "All this occurred within the context of still pessimistic household and business confidence.",
        "The local financial market had reacted to the movements of its global peers.",
        "Long-term interest rates in the fixed-income segment had increased, while the IPSA accumulated losses.",
        "The peso had depreciated by around 9% from the previous meeting.",
        "Regarding credit, the third quarter Bank Lending Survey (BLS) reflected that credit demand continued to deteriorate in some segments, consistently with the deceleration of credit flows in several portfolios, especially toward firms.",
        "The BLS reported no significant change in supply conditions.",
        "Interest rates on commercial loans —more closely related to monetary policy decisions— showed decreases, while housing interest rates —linked to long-term rates— were on the rise.",
        "For this meeting, the median of both the EES and the FTS showed an expected reduction in the monetary policy rate (MPR) of 75bp.",
        "MPR expectations for the end of this year stood at 8% in the case of the EES and at 8.25% according to the FTS.",
        "Financial asset prices also revealed an 8.25% inflation expectation.",
        "Locally, it was noted that the information at hand showed that the macroeconomic scenario was evolving in line with expectations.",
        "About activity, there were occasional and transitory deviations, while the sectors most related to consumption continued to show signs of stabilization.",
        "At the same time, the CPI accumulated a somewhat smaller-than-expected increase, mainly in the non-volatile goods component.",
        "This difference could be linked to the exchange rate appreciation of previous quarters, whose effects still dominated over those of the most recent depreciation.",
        "However, these trends were expected to change in the months ahead.",
        "There was agreement that the most relevant economic development was the tightening of international financial conditions.",
        "The discussion focused on how this situation would impact the Chilean economy.",
        "It was noted that, among other factors, this would depend on the persistence and possible intensification of these phenomena, which, in turn, would be related to their origin.",
        "With respect to the latter, some hypotheses were brought up.",
        "One of them was the possible effects of a more complex inflationary problem in the U.S., where monetary and fiscal policy issues could be intertwined.",
        "Whatever the case, higher real interest rates and inflation premiums were to be expected, both of which, to a greater or lesser extent, were being observed in the data.",
        "Other hypothesis to explain the rise in real rates was the decompression of term premia.",
        "There was ample evidence that a combination of regulatory, economic and financial factors had meant that, since the Global Financial Crisis, demand for government securities had increased.",
        "For this reason, investors were willing to pay a higher premium than usual to hold these instruments, which had caused rates to fall sharply in the U.S.",
        "The question was whether this phenomenon was slowing and thus pushing up long-term rates.",
        "A third hypothesis pointed to deeper factors, related to the global savingsinvestment balance, which could be affecting the neutral or more structural levels of long-term rates.",
        "There was also consensus that each of these hypotheses would have different consequences for the global macroeconomic scenario and for Chile in particular, so their relevance and effects should be carefully analyzed.",
        "In any case, it seemed reasonable to think that long-term interest rates would remain high for quite some time.",
        "In this context, everything seemed to indicate that financial conditions for Chile would remain stressed for a prolonged period and that the risks of disruptions in global financial markets would also be higher than usual.",
        "The impact that external phenomena were having on the local financial market was underscored.",
        "Among other things, the increase in the cost of medium and long-term financing for all types of agents, the fall of the stock market and the depreciation of the peso drew special attention.",
        "Regarding the latter, it was mentioned that the increase in the peso/dollar parity exceeded what was observed in other comparable economies, without there being a single hypothesis regarding the reasons for this sharper reaction of the Chilean peso.",
        "It was mentioned that there could be risk factors associated with the expected trajectories of monetary policy in Chile and the U.S. and the reduced presence of some important players in the forex market.",
        "Meanwhile, it was not obvious that the reserve replenishment program and the process of reducing the NDF position were affecting the level of the exchange rate in a relevant way, although, given the volatile external conditions, it was indicated that some effect on the functioning of the exchange rate market could not be ruled out.",
        "In this context, a precautionary attitude would be advisable.",
        "With respect to the financial considerations of the peso depreciation, it was noted that the available information showed that the exchange rate mismatches were being well managed by private agents.",
        "All five Board members recalled that the monetary policy strategy defined at the previous meeting indicated that: (i) if the central scenario were to materialize, in the short term the MPR would be reduced further; (ii) the magnitude and timing of the MPR cut process would take into account the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario and its implications for the path of inflation; (iii) the Board would act with flexibility in case macroeconomic conditions so required.",
        "In this context, the Board evaluated lowering the MPR by either 50bp or 75bp.",
        "They all coincided that the local activity and inflation scenario showed little change with respect to forecast, although the non-volatile component had fallen somewhat faster than projected.",
        "Regarding external developments, in the immediate future, an inflationary impact was to be expected due to the price rise of some commodities and the higher exchange rate.",
        "However, if the tightness of external financial conditions persists, the medium-term effects on activity and inflation would be negative.",
        "There was agreement that the recent behavior of the exchange rate, marked by greater sensitivity to news and greater volatility, reflected several elements.",
        "On the one hand, Chile was further ahead than other economies in the inflationary convergence process and, consequently, the prospects were that the MPR reduction process would continue.",
        "It was added that the Fed had increased its hawkish tone.",
        "This change in the rate differential was generating uncertainty in a market where some medium and long-term investors were less present.",
        "All this was reflected in an increase in the exchange premium and the sensitivity of the exchange rate.",
        "In that context, an additional degree of prudence could help reduce the possibility of facing short-term financial stress.",
        "In any case, the Board considered that was essential to have more clarity on the evolution of recent macro-financial developments, to deepen their understanding of the underlying factors of inflation and its persistence, as well as their possible contractionary impact.",
        "All the Board members agreed that at this point it was complex to assess the balance of these impacts, precisely because they were unfolding and were accompanied by higher-than-usual volatility.",
        "In this context, and with inflation still not completing its convergence process, all the Board members agreed that it was necessary to continue with the cycle of MPR cuts, although this time around it was advisable to do so at a somewhat slower speed, which was well represented by a 50bp reduction.",
        "There was consensus that the December MP Report, where the complete macroeconomic scenario would be reviewed, would be the appropriate occasion to give guidelines on how the process of lowering the MPR would go on.",
        "Finally, the Board emphasized that the objective of monetary policy was the inflation, and its instrument was the MPR.",
        "It was reiterated that this not mean that the exchange rate did not have an important role in the inflation targeting framework, since it was a relevant price in the economy, whose movements could have significant effects and which also provided valuable information on how things were going in the macroeconomic and financial scenario.",
        "It was added that, in no case would this imply that monetary policy or the reserve hoarding policy would target an exchange rate level.",
        "Although on some very special occasions massive exchange rate intervention measures had been implemented, this was not the case at this point.",
        "Governor Costa, Vice-Governor García and Board members Naudon, Céspedes and Novy voted for lowering the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points, to 9%.",
        "Rosanna Costa, Governor; Pablo García, Vice-Governor; Alberto Naudon, Board member; Luis Felipe Céspedes, Board member; Stepanka Novy, Board member.",
        "Present the Finance Minister, Mario Marcel.",
        "Also present; Beltrán de Ramón, General Manager; Juan Pablo Araya, Legal Counsel and Attestor; Elías Albagli, Monetary Policy Division Director; Ricardo Consiglio, Financial Markets Division Director; Rosario Celedón, Financial Policy Division Director; Gloria Peña, Statistics Division Director; Michel Moure, Institutional Affairs Division Director; Diego Ballivián, Corporate Risk Division Director; Markus Kirchner, Macroeconomic Analysis Manager; Enrique Orellana, Monetary Policy Strategy and Communication Manager; Lucas Bertinatto, acting International Analysis Manager; Sofía Bauducco, Economic Research Manager; Felipe Musa, Market Operations Manager; Juan Carlos Piantini, Business Strategy Administration Manager; Miguel Fuentes, Financial Stability Manager; Francisco Ruiz, Macroeconomic Statistics Manager; Juan Pablo Rioseco, acting Communications Manager; Andrés Sansone, Advisor to the Finance Minister; Erika Arraño, Senior Economist; Marlys Pabst, Secretary General.",
        "Internationally, inflation had declined further, with downward surprises in a broad group of economies, including the United States.",
        "In the latter, the decline in both inflation and core measures increased the likelihood that inflationary convergence process would take place with no significant drop in activity.",
        "Contributing to this was the behavior of consumption, the fact that investment had picked up somewhat and that the labor market remained resilient.",
        "In the Eurozone, inflation had continued to decline, although service inflation remain high.",
        "Overall, in Latin America, headline inflation had continued to subside and core measures had recently begun to decline as goods prices decelerated.",
        "The fundamentals, however, continued to point to the need for a more contractionary monetary policy in developed economies.",
        "The main central banks had raised their benchmark rates again and continued to signal that their monetary policies would remain in restrictive territory for a prolonged period of time.",
        "In the United States, the FOMC had conveyed a more hawkish tone at its June meeting, a position that had been reinforced at its July meeting by resuming the hiking cycle and by its authorities’ emphasizing that the rates would remain high for several more months.",
        "The European Central Bank had also continued to raise its benchmark rates and communicated that its future decisions would continue to be reviewed on a meeting by meeting basis.",
        "In this scenario, the impulse that the Chilean economy would receive from abroad was expected to remain moderate, with weak world growth prospects for both this year and next.",
        "In the United States, despite the recent resilience, a slowdown in activity was expected in the coming quarters.",
        "In China, the recovery of activity had continued to lose traction, amid fundamentals that pointed to less dynamism going forward.",
        "In the Eurozone, the outlook remained negative, due largely to the impact of the energy crisis and the tightening of financial conditions.",
        "With regard to commodities, food prices continued to fall.",
        "However, in the days leading up to the July Meeting, the prices of grains had soared following Russia’s withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative.",
        "The copper price, with ups and downs, was close to its level of the previous Meeting.",
        "Its evolution had received opposite influences: on the one hand, from lower activity in China and, on the other hand, from inventory levels, which remained tight.",
        "The price of a barrel of oil had risen by nearly 10% since the last meeting, favored by a greater global appetite for risk, the depreciation of the dollar and the continuous recovery of its demand.",
        "Both headline and core inflation had fallen faster than had been projected in the last Monetary Policy Report.",
        "In June, they had posted drops of 7.6% and 9.1% annually, respectively.",
        "The differences owing mainly in the goods component, affected by the appreciation of the exchange rate over the last year.",
        "Regarding two-year inflation expectations, both the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) and the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) placed it at 3%.",
        "In general, activity and demand continued to evolve in line with expectations.",
        "Although in May the Imacec had fallen by 0.5% from the previous month in its seasonally adjusted series, this monthly contraction was especially related to supply-side elements that had affected mining and, to a lesser extent, some industrial lines and others linked to external demand.",
        "In fact, discounting seasonality, non-mining activity had seen no month-to-month variation.",
        "On the expenditure side, retail sales and imports of consumer goods, among other indicators, continued to show a less marked deterioration in household consumption, validating the hypothesis that the first quarter contraction, particularly in durables, was rather a preview of the expected adjustment.",
        "The outlook for investment confirmed its weakness.",
        "The labor market showed no major changes from its previous trends, as the unemployment rate had remained at 8.5% in the moving quarter ending in June, and firms’ hiring expectations were low according to several sources of information.",
        "Compensations continued to increase in real terms.",
        "In this context, consumer (IPEC) and business (IMCE) expectations were still on the pessimistic side, but with some improvement.",
        "The movements in the local financial market remained aligned with expectations that monetary policy would become less contractionary, in a context where global markets had reflected a greater appetite for risk, with a global depreciation of the dollar, an increase in stock markets and a compression of risk premiums.",
        "Local short-term interest rates had continued to fall, affected by the markets’ reaction to the most recent CPI and Imacec data.",
        "The exchange rate had depreciated and the IPSA accumulated significant gains.",
        "Meanwhile, long-term interest rates had undergone minor adjustments.",
        "Bank credit remained tight, as could be seen in the performance of real loans in all portfolios.",
        "Interest rates were high in all of them.",
        "Meanwhile, the Bank Lending Survey for the second quarter reflected tight conditions on the supply side, while the demand for credit remained weak.",
        "Both the EES and the FTS anticipated a reduction of 75 basis points (bp) in the monetary policy rate (MPR) for this Meeting.",
        "However, around a third of the analysts polled in the EES and almost half of the analysts polled in the FTS expected a cut of 100bp or more.",
        "Furthermore, in July, both surveys had lowered their expectations for the MPR towards the end of this year, placing it at 8.0% and 7.75%, respectively.",
        "At the same time, the outlook implicit in the prices of financial assets anticipated that the MPR would stand at 7.5% next December.",
        "On the domestic front, it was noted that activity and demand had evolved broadly in line with what was expected in the June Monetary Policy Report.",
        "This implied that activity gap was materializing towards negative values, which was necessary to control core inflation and ensure the convergence of inflation to the 3% target.",
        "It was added that this also indicated that the economy’s adjustment was progressing in line with expectations, although this was a matter that needed to continue to be carefully monitored.",
        "On inflation side, in June CPI inflation had been negative, with a difference with respect to projections concentrated in the goods component, both volatile and non-volatile.",
        "Given that no major developments were observed on the demand side and services inflation was no different from the forecast, the main explanation for the lower actual inflation was a faster-than-expected exchange rate pass-through.",
        "If so, it was important to keep in mind that this did not alter the magnitude of the expected transmission, but only brought forward its timing.",
        "It was also noted that the normalization of firm margins, with heterogeneity across sectors, was probably also contributing to a smoother pass-through of lower cost pressures.",
        "The impulse that the Chilean economy would receive from abroad would remain limited, matching the forecast in the June Monetary Policy Report.",
        "Inflation remained the dominant problem, despite some recent progress, given the dynamics of demand and labor markets which remained tight in some developed economies, particularly in the United States.",
        "This problem was still a challenge for the monetary authorities and anticipated tight financial conditions still for a significant period of time.",
        "All the Board Members agreed that, as expected, the Chilean economy had made progress in resolving the macroeconomic imbalances accumulated in recent years.",
        "Monetary policy had played a crucial role in this, allowing a reduction of MPR based on progress in the convergence of inflation.",
        "The Board recalled that the central scenario of the June Report assumed that by this Meeting it would be in a position to begin discussing the reduction of the benchmark rate.",
        "Activity and demand did not show big differences with respect to projections, but inflation was falling somewhat faster.",
        "For this reason, the Board considered that it was reasonable to think that the MPR would have somewhat little trajectory that the estimated in the June central scenario.",
        "By the end of the year, this new level could be consistent with what the surveys indicated at the time of the Meeting, which as of December placed the MPR between 7.75% and 8%.",
        "In any case, all the Board members agree that the magnitude and timing of the MPR cuts will take into account the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario and its implications for the trajectory of inflation.",
        "Taking the aforementioned arrival point as a reference, the Board considered plausible options of lowering the MPR 75 or 100bp.",
        "It was indicated that, depending on the accumulated information, in the next Meetings there could be movements around these magnitudes, keeping in mind that a total adjustment of between 325 and 350bp was required until the end of the year.",
        "Furthermore, there was agreement that the magnitude of the first move did not impose any conditions on those of the subsequent moves, which could be smaller.",
        "The considerations in deciding between these options, therefore, had more to do with tactical elements and the relative balance of risks of inflationary convergence given the new background information.",
        "Regarding the tactical issues, there was agreement that the 75bp option would be less surprising, as it reflected the median of market expectations.",
        "However, all the Board Members noted that a significant portion market agents expected a 100bp cut, which lessened its surprising status.",
        "Some Board Members expressed concern about the impact that a decision to lower the MPR by 100bp could have on market expectations.",
        "In particular, because if that it would be considered a dovish decision, there could be additional falls in short-term rates and a greater depreciation of the peso.",
        "All five Board members agreed that this risk could be mitigated by a communication that would clearly state that the MPR was still inside the corridor considered in June, with an arrival level consistent with what surveys foresaw for the end of the year.",
        "Regarding inflation risks, the full Board agreed that, in general, the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario pointed to a rebalancing of them.",
        "Several Board members said that the information available suggested lower inflationary pressures, including the evolution of activity and inflation.",
        "In addition, market expectations showed downward adjustments in the short term, while remaining in the two-year 3% target.",
        "One Board Member pointed out that, although the most extreme scenarios of inflationary outbursts had become less likely, in his opinion, continued to be a significant risk the effects of a prolonged period of high inflation and two-year expectations above the target could have had on the dynamics of price formation and expectations.",
        "All the Board Members noted that, despite the recent decline, inflation was still very high, and inflation expectations had only recently returned to the 3% target, after several months of being misaligned.",
        "Therefore, it was still premature to think that the inflationary problem had been solved, so the Bank should remain watchful for developments in the macroeconomic scenario.",
        "Governor Costa, Vice-Governor García and Board members Naudon, Céspedes and Novy voted for lowering the MPR by 100 basis points, to 10.25%.",
        "Communications Manager; Andrés Sansone, Advisor to the Finance Minister; Marlys Pabst, Secretary General.",
        "In general terms, the macroeconomic scenario had evolved in line with forecasts in the June Monetary Policy (MP) Report.",
        "Although still high, inflation continued to decline, in a scenario of ongoing adjustment of activity and demand.",
        "At the same time, cost pressures had eased and two-year inflation expectations stood at 3%.",
        "In this context, the Board had begun to reduce the monetary policy rate (MPR) at its July meeting, lowering it from 11.25% to 10.25%.",
        "Although the decline in inflation was a global phenomenon, its outlook differed from one country to another.",
        "Thus, while in some economies monetary policy was being less contractionary, in others a more prolonged than anticipated tightening was foreseen, particularly in the developed world.",
        "These divergences had been permeating global financial markets, with opposing movements in interest rates and the depreciation of an important group of currencies, the Chilean peso included.",
        "The projections in the central scenario of the September MP Report contained few changes with respect to June’s.",
        "GDP growth was foreseen between -0.5% and 0% in 2023.",
        "In 2024 and 2025, the economy would resume positive expansion rates, growing between 1.25-2.25% and 2-3%, respectively.",
        "Private consumption had stabilized and its projection was maintained, while investment was expected to contract somewhat less this year than had been anticipated in June.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to decline further, reaching 3% in the second half of 2024.",
        "Core inflation would follow suit in early 2025.",
        "On the external front, it was noted that the growth outlook for our trading partners and the terms of trade did not change significantly with respect to projected in the June MP Report.",
        "However, it was noted that the external scenario did exhibit a change in composition that was worth analyzing.",
        "This originated in the resilience of the U.S. economy and China’s more pronounced weakness.",
        "It was mentioned that, in case these differences deepened, the effects on the Chilean economy could be significant.",
        "On the one hand, a more contractionary interest rate trajectory in the U.S. resulting from a more dynamic economy, which would not generate the necessary conditions for the inflationary convergence, could trigger a major worsening of the financial conditions facing emerging countries.",
        "On the other hand, lower growth in China could hurt Chile’s terms of trade and exports significantly.",
        "It was noted that, although the central scenario did not factor in this type of negative events, careful monitoring was required.",
        "About the local economy, it was noted that the economy had been gradually resolving the macroeconomic imbalances of previous quarters and that inflation was falling, even somewhat faster than expected in the case of core CPI.",
        "It was added that, however, the most important change was in risks, since the likelihood of scenarios of a more marked deviation of inflation had decreased significantly.",
        "This was so mainly because the economy had been adjusting in line with projections, inflation expectations had been aligned with the two-year 3% target and, in general, the market’s macroeconomic view had also been converging with the Bank’s projections.",
        "The analysis emphasized the short-term volatility that had been observed in certain financial variables for some weeks, particularly interest rates and the exchange rate.",
        "About possible explanations for this behavior, it was mentioned that it was not unusual to see this kind of movements during episodes where the MPR began to be changed after a period of stability.",
        "In those circumstances, communicating the changes could be more complex.",
        "It was recalled that back in 2013 something similar had already occurred as, after an extended period of a flat interest rate, a cycle of monetary easing had followed, which lasted several quarters and was accompanied by doubts in the market about what form it would take.",
        "A second example was taken from mid-2021, at the start of an MPR hike cycle, when there was also considerable debate regarding its pertinence and the pace of the hikes.",
        "It was suggested that another reason that could explain this short-term volatility was the fact that the Central Bank of Chile was one of the first to begin reducing its reference rate, with prospects that the reduction would continue in the future.",
        "In addition, the Fed’s rate hike had been quite aggressive, and doubts as to how this process would continue introduced an additional degree of sensitivity with respect to the Bank’s own decisions and their effects on market financial variables.",
        "Finally, the peculiar fact of having a curve that was very inverted was noted, which could be heightening the sensitivity of the market’s reactions.",
        "There was agreement among the Board members that the unfolding macroeconomic scenario and the outlook for inflationary convergence allowed reaffirming the general orientation of monetary policy that had been communicated at the previous Meeting.",
        "This meant that, at the end of the year, the MPR would stand between 7.75% and 8%, and that in the medium term it would follow a downward trend consistent with achieving the inflation target.",
        "The Board reiterated that the magnitude and timing of such process would take into account the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario and its implications for the inflationary trajectory.",
        "Therefore, all the Board members considered that the plausible options for this Meeting were to lower the MPR by: (i) 50bp; (ii) 75bp; (iii) 100bp.",
        "All five Board members agreed that the option of cutting 75bp off the MPR was fully consistent with the central scenario of the September MP Report and the general monetary policy stance that had been delivered at the previous Meeting.",
        "This option, moreover, had the advantage that it reflected most market expectations, a point to bear in mind given the high sensitivity that the MPR expectations and the exchange rate had shown to developments related to interest rate differentials.",
        "With respect to the other options —i.e., a reduction of 50bp or 100bp—, all the Board members opined that both were consistent with the MPR corridor.",
        "In one case, whether a scenario of higher inflationary persistence or more accelerated activity was assigned more weight.",
        "In the other, if a scenario of lower inflationary pressures, caused by internal or external factors, was being considered.",
        "The Board estimated that, given the consistency of the scenario outlined in the Report and market expectations for activity, inflation and the most likely MPR trajectory, there were no compelling arguments to give greater weight to some of these scenarios.",
        "For the same reason, these options lost relevance compared to a reduction of 75bp.",
        "Governor Costa, Vice-Governor García and Board members Naudon, Céspedes and Novy voted for lowering the monetary policy interest rate by 75 basis points, to 9.5%.",
        "Inflation remained very high.",
        "Pending the March figure, which was to be known the day after the Meeting, the CPI’s annual variation had fallen to 11.9% in February, which was still well above the 3% target.",
        "In addition, the core part of the CPI —without volatile items–— had been at around 11% annually for some time, accumulating a significant surprise over the last few months.",
        "Several factors explained why inflation was taking so long to come down.",
        "Most importantly, the economy was still struggling to reverse the impact of the excess spending accumulated in previous years.",
        "In fact, the revisions to the National Accounts showed that between 2020 and 2022 consumption levels had been significantly higher than estimated.",
        "Moreover, the speed at which this spending component was adjusting in the most recent period had been slower than previously assumed.",
        "In any case, going forward, the decline in inflation would be sustained by the appreciation of the peso in recent months and the reduction of a number of cost factors.",
        "The central scenario of the March Monetary Policy Report had revised upward the GDP growth forecast for 2023.",
        "This was in response to the better performance early in the year.",
        "Going forward, the central scenario assumed that the economy would continue with its adjustment process.",
        "Therefore, the projection for 2024 has been reduced.",
        "Considering both years, cumulative growth was not very different from the December Report’s forecast.",
        "As for inflation, it was expected to return to the 3% target in the latter part of 2024.",
        "Globally, the world economic outlook had worsened in the last few weeks.",
        "The Chilean economy would be affected by lower external demand and tighter global financial conditions.",
        "The current scenario was associated with a higher than usual degree of uncertainty.",
        "On the one hand, there was the risk of a more abrupt deterioration of the external scenario, with greater implications for Chile.",
        "On the other, a more complex inflationary dynamic could not be ruled out.",
        "About the international scenario, it was pointed out that its evolution showed two phases.",
        "Towards the end of 2022 and the turn of 2023, markets had become more optimistic, betting on a smooth inflationary control and practically no recession.",
        "However, in early March, turbulence in the U.S. and European banking systems abruptly changed the picture, introducing additional concerns.",
        "Although in the days leading up to the Meeting the effect seemed contained, the scenario was likely to be dominated by greater caution in the supply of credit.",
        "Primarily, its effects would be channeled through lower external demand and tighter financial conditions.",
        "The central scenario of the March MP Report had assumed that this would have an impact on the local macroeconomic scenario in the second half of the year.",
        "Mention was made of the uncertainty as to the magnitude and duration of the impact of the change in external financial conditions.",
        "It was pointed out that, although the turbulence had abated and been confined to certain events, there were vulnerabilities at the global level.",
        "Particularly important was high corporate and government indebtedness and, probably, increased risk-taking in some sectors in search of higher returns after years of low rates.",
        "Attention was drawn to how it would affect credit volume, especially in economies like the United States, where smaller banks are a significant source of financing.",
        "Nonetheless, all of this was rather speculative, so it was part of important risk scenarios to consider and address in case they came true.",
        "Locally, the adjustment was more moderate than expected, with upward surprises in demand and inflation.",
        "The revision to the National Accounts from 2020 onwards revealed a different composition of domestic demand, with higher consumption and rather stagnant investment.",
        "Moreover, new data on the consumption trajectory revealed a slower than expected speed of adjustment.",
        "All this certainly contributed to explaining the upward surprises in headline inflation and why core inflation had persisted between 10.5% and 11% in annual terms for several months.",
        "It was noted that the overall information available indicated that the economy was having difficulties in closing its gaps.",
        "The activity gap, far from closing, as would be expected in an ongoing adjustment process, was wider than had been expected in late 2022 and early 2023.",
        "The current account, despite some correction, also reflected these high imbalances, accounting for the households’ deficit savings.",
        "The Board recalled that during the last several meetings a clear message had been delivered regarding the future evolution of the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), that was, that the rate would be maintained at 11.25% until the state of the macroeconomy indicated that the convergence of inflation to 3% had been consolidated.",
        "All five Board members agreed that, from the analysis of the background information submitted in the preparation of the March MP Report, it could be concluded that there was still no evidence of consolidation of said inflationary convergence.",
        "Actually, while headline inflation had continued to decline, it was still high.",
        "Core inflation, assumed to be a better predictor of future inflation, was not declining.",
        "As of February, it stood at 10.7%, fairly constant for several months.",
        "Moreover, with an upward surprise of about one percentage point when compared to the forecast in the December MP Report.",
        "Activity was not adjusting in line with expectations, either.",
        "The activity gap was significantly revised upwards when removing the transitory effect on activity in the transport sector.",
        "Moreover, the revisions to the National Accounts showed that the composition of domestic demand was more inflationary than expected, with consumption much higher and investment stagnant for several quarters.",
        "All this pointed to a scenario in which inflationary pressures were evidently higher than previously estimated.",
        "In this context, all the Board members agreed that the only plausible option was to keep the policy rate at 11.25%.",
        "The five Board Members agreed that the economic scenario posed significant risks.",
        "On the one hand, inflation was at risk of becoming more persistent.",
        "In such a situation, the Bank would have to respond with a particularly aggressive and contractionary monetary policy.",
        "The costs in terms of lost economic activity and jobs would be “transitory,” but certainly substantial.",
        "However, the Board would have no other choice in order to fulfill its mandate and, just as important, to avoid significant “permanent” costs to macroeconomic stability and economic welfare.",
        "At the same time, there were also very significant external risks.",
        "There were risk scenarios in which the international situation could deteriorate abruptly and sharply.",
        "In such case, the Bank would have to aggressively lower the MPR.",
        "This would occur precisely because inflation would converge more rapidly to the target in a context of a strong deceleration of economic activity.",
        "The above, without considering the potential additional economic policy measures that a global financial crisis scenario might require implementing either ex post and/or ex ante.",
        "The Board was unanimous in agreeing that any of these situations formed part of the risks of the macroeconomic scenario.",
        "For the same reason, they were not considered in the sensitivities underpinning the corridor for the MPR.",
        "However, there was agreement that the Bank should act with flexibility in the event that any of the internal or external risks materialized and macroeconomic conditions so required.",
        "Governor Costa, Vice-Governor García and Board members Naudon, Céspedes and Novy voted for holding the MPR at 11.25%."

    "2019": [
        "The data submitted to the Board and analysis thereof are contained in the December Monetary Policy Report.",
        "This document highlighted that the macroeconomic scenario has undergone an abrupt change since mid-October.",
        "Until then, the economy had behaved in line with projections in the September Report, with annual GDP growth at 3.3% in the third quarter and an annual CPIEFE variation of around 2%.",
        "The crisis that had broken out on 18 October was characterized by social demands that had prompted the discussion of relevant institutional changes —including a new Constitution— and pressures for social reforms.",
        "This process, however, had been accompanied by significant and prolonged episodes of violence, which had triggered major disruptions in the productive system, severely reducing activity and weakening employment.",
        "The information at hand showed a significant rise in uncertainty and a deterioration in confidence that were amplifying these effects.",
        "The financial markets had been strained by sharp price movements, which in some cases had gone beyond what one would expect given the country risk.",
        "The Board had taken various measures to ensure liquidity in both pesos and dollars, and had decided to intervene in the foreign exchange market to rein in the high exchange rate volatility and help in the adjustments so they would proceed appropriately.",
        "About projections, the recently announced increase in the fiscal impulse, coupled with the already very expansionary monetary policy, would help contain the economic downturn in the policy horizon, so after a contraction of 2.5% annually in the fourth quarter of 2019, GDP would grow between 0.5% and 1.5% in 2020.",
        "The important deceleration of growth would widen the activity gap over the monetary policy horizon, pulling down inflation.",
        "However, the financial impacts of the higher uncertainty and the more persistent effects of the peso depreciation, would increase inflationary pressures over the policy horizon.",
        "All the Board members agreed that the diagnosis of the current state of the economy was highly uncertain, so in the coming months efforts would need to concentrate on making comprehensive evaluations of the macroeconomic scenario in order to determine its most likely short-term evolution.",
        "In addition, in the immediate future the consequences of the disruptions in economic activity and the protraction of disturbances of the public order had been clearly reflected in the drop in October’s Imacec.",
        "Still, in the medium term the situation could be further complicated by increased uncertainty.",
        "It was affecting consumer and business confidence, financial asset prices and the value of the dollar, signaling a perception that negative effects would last longer.",
        "Among many issues, this was related to the lack of certainty on several political, economic and social issues so, to avoid major adverse effects, new agreements were required in order to narrow the spaces of uncertainty as quickly as possible.",
        "In fact, it was noted that the Report’s baseline scenario pointed to very low growth in 2020 to begin recovery in 2021, which relied partly on the assumption that uncertainty would dissipate throughout this period, so that companies and individuals would invest again and regularize their consumption decisions.",
        "Absent this, the economy could stagnated for several years.",
        "There was debate around the evolution of inflation in the next few quarters, particularly because of uncertainty regarding which effect would dominate, either the impact of the idiosyncratic depreciation of the peso or the widening of the activity gap.",
        "It was brought up that the unusual nature of the phenomenon affecting the economy meant that its effects on inflation were more difficult to forecast and called for a special effort of analysis and scrutiny.",
        "Actually, this characteristic of the current situation assigned much value to the information that would be gathered in the coming months.",
        "Thus, going forward, information on the evolution of inflation, activity, and financial and credit conditions would be much appreciated.",
        "Some Board members raised concern about the need to monitor very carefully how the monetary policy pass-through channel was working.",
        "In their view, in an environment of uncertainty and risk, the sensitivity of spending and production decisions to monetary policy was likely to be altered.",
        "While the measures taken by the Bank had succeeded in normalizing the functioning of the money and foreign exchange markets, their evolution had to be continually monitored in the coming quarters.",
        "In particular, how credit risk would evolve, how this might affect the behavior of banks, and what measures could be taken to ensure the expeditious transmission of monetary policy.",
        "All five Board members agreed that the underlying factors that generated uncertainty and influenced the evolution of economic activity and inflation were outside the scope of macroeconomic policies, despite the fact that they could help to mitigate their negative impacts somewhat.",
        "In this sense, when defining the course of the monetary policy, it was necessary to take into account that in moments of falling GDP and employment it was essential for the MPR to have a strong expansionary tone.",
        "They also agreed that the decision to hold the MPR at 1.75% dominated every other option.",
        "First, the current degree of monetary expansion was estimated to be consistent with the cyclical weakness of the economy, with the high level of uncertainty regarding its future evolution, and with the fiscal stimulus program that the government had announced in previous days.",
        "Second, the necessary consistency between exchange rate intervention and monetary policy limited the room for rate reductions over the coming months, as speculation on the latter could generate the kind of volatility the intervention sought to avoid.",
        "Finally, it would be inconvenient to consider raising the MPR, as the Report’s scenario did not contemplate rises for some time, even taking into account the short-term inflationary impact of the peso depreciation.",
        "One Board member recalled that in the recent past the Bank’s reaction to an environment of deteriorating activity had been to boost the monetary stimulus, always keeping in mind the right calibration of the impact of the peso depreciation on inflation, which now would be even bigger due to its idiosyncratic nature.",
        "This time around, however, he thought that the prudent thing to do was to signal a flat MPR during a period, because the direction that the social unrest had taken had created a climate of stress and uncertainty that could take various forms.",
        "In particular, he noted that the Bank had adopted extraordinary measures of liquidity provision and had begun a foreign exchange intervention that limited —especially the latter— the countercyclical action that in principle could be expected from monetary policy.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Costa and Naudon voted for keeping the MPR at 1.75%.",
        "Furthermore, they agreed that a signal had to be given that the MPR would be kept stable over the coming months, awaiting for more information about the unfolding to the macroeconomic scenario.",
        "With such information factored in, the next movements could be either up or down depending on the true state of the economy and the inflationary outlook.",
        "In the Board’s opinion, flatlining the MPR not only was consistent with inflation’s convergence in the policy horizon, but it also contributed to reducing uncertainty within the economy during a troubled period.",
        "In addition, it would be coupled with the greater exchange rate stability generated by the intervention and the provision of liquidity to the market that had been assured through different instruments.",
        "In the Board’s view, reducing uncertainty was imperative in order to spur the economic recovery, reduce the probability of a recession and prevent unemployment from reaching high levels difficult to reverse.",
        "True enough, for the Central Bank it was not possible to reduce this uncertainty in its roots, but at least it could prevent it from multiplying via its impact on the markets.",
        "The background information presented to the Board and analysis thereof are contained in the September Monetary Policy Report.",
        "In it, it was noted that since the previous Report, both headline and core inflation had remained around 2%, within a context where the macroeconomic outlook had weakened, increasing the risks concerning the timely convergence of inflation to 3%.",
        "The change in macroeconomic conditions was largely due to the evolution of the external scenario, where the trade tensions had increased global uncertainty, slowed down growth in different countries and reduced trade volumes.",
        "The persistence and increasing complexity of the conflicts, as well as the predominance of greater pessimism in the markets, led to forecast that the external impulse for the remainder of the year and much of 2020 would be considerably lower than had been estimated in the June Report.",
        "In the second quarter, domestic activity and demand had grown less than expected.",
        "Although some of this was due to some sector-specific factors, also noteworthy was the deceleration of consumption and a deterioration of its fundamentals, including the lower dynamism of private salaried employment, and that consumer expectations had fallen since early in the year.",
        "Although investment looked somewhat more dynamic in the margin, this was mainly associated with large-scale mining projects, while the worsening of business expectations, the depreciation of the peso and the poor performance of the stock market led to revise downward the previous growth forecast of this expenditure component for the rest of the year.",
        "Accordingly, the higher growth rates of the second half would be explained mainly by the low comparison bases of 2018, not to a significant rebound in economic growth.",
        "This implied that the activity gap would remain open for some time.",
        "All of this occurred in a context in which headline and core inflation were still low, particularly in their components more closely linked to said gap.",
        "About the external scenario, there was agreement in pointing out that beyond the fact that marginal data had worsened somewhat, what was most important was the deterioration of the medium-term outlook, largely linked to the escalating trade war.",
        "Attention was drawn to the context of much greater uncertainty, which had become persistent and was having negative consequences on investment, trade and other important macro variables.",
        "The weakness of several emerging economies against this backdrop had become apparent, as reflected in revised growth figures for Asia and Latin America.",
        "It was added that, although a global recession was still far away, the change in the international scenario was reason enough to substantially modify the external impulse for the Chilean economy.",
        "In particular, there were no foreseeable elements that would allow anticipating a reversal of this scenario.",
        "Regarding the domestic economy, it was noted that the first half of the year had shown a much weaker than expected recovery.",
        "Although supply-side factors still prevailed, there was also lower growth in sectors such as the manufacturing industry.",
        "The biggest surprises came from the demand side, particularly because the behavior of consumption in the second quarter made it necessary to review its future dynamism.",
        "On the one hand, expectations had deteriorated, trade had disappointed expectations and consumer loans had decelerated.",
        "On the other hand, the wage bill continued to outpace consumption.",
        "It was agreed that the evolution of the labor market required special attention.",
        "The information at hand pointed to low wage pressures and an increase in employment based on a significant participation of self-employment, all in the midst of a scenario of labor market complexity due to the immigration shock.",
        "There was agreement that external and internal developments shaped a scenario where this and next year the Chilean economy would grow less than previously estimated, which affected the evolution of the activity gap and jeopardized the convergence of inflation to the target over the policy horizon.",
        "This was reflected, in part, in the recent behavior of services component of core inflation —more sensitive to capacity gaps and remunerations— has slowed down significantly.",
        "The doubts regarding the projected evolution of the output gap and its implications for inflation and monetary policy were discussed.",
        "On the one hand, the baseline scenario assumed that economic growth would resume its stronger dynamism in 2020.",
        "On the other hand, there was uncertainty regarding the measurement of potential GDP, in a context where productivity growth could be lower than estimated and where it seemed that the burdens for investment and the recovery of labor could be somewhat heavier.",
        "Such visions had differences about the implications for inflation and monetary policy, because the former implied a more expansionary monetary stance than that described in the baseline scenario, while the latter reduced inflationary pressures and, therefore, led to a less expansionary monetary policy.",
        "The great uncertainty regarding the measurement of the output gap, especially in a context of significant immigration flows, led one Board member to believe that the evolution of the output gap could not be reason enough to decide on a change in the monetary stimulus.",
        "One Board member pointed out that the relevance of the output gap estimate depended on the state of the cycle.",
        "In his opinion, in an economy that was apparently accelerating (or slowing down) —and growing more (less) than its trend or potential— and inflation was also increasing, having an estimate of the magnitude of the output gap was perhaps more important than in a situation like the current one, where the economy was growing below potential and inflation was quite stubbornly below the target.",
        "Some Board members agreed that the current direction of the monetary policy was crystal clear and signaled the need for greater monetary expansion, so seeking a more accurate measure of the magnitude of the output gap seemed less important.",
        "All five Board members agreed that the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario and its outlook made it clear that, in order to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target, it was necessary to lower the MPR.",
        "This, in a context where the world economy was clearly in a scenario of greater risk and slowdown, whose main internal transmission channel was the deterioration of financial conditions and expectations, compounded with a local scenario that also failed to cooperate in reducing the uncertainty that surrounded consumption and investment decisions.",
        "All the Board members agreed that the issue of how much more expansionary should monetary policy be was still under discussion, but that the Report’s analysis indicated that an MPR reduction of at least 50 to 75 basis points (bp) seemed necessary.",
        "The Board ruled that the plausible options were an MPR cut of 25, 50, or 75 basis points.",
        "The entire Board agreed that since there was no doubt regarding the need to lower the MPR, the decision had to do rather with tactical and communicational aspects.",
        "Thus, all the Board members agreed that the option of cutting it by 75bp was a complex one.",
        "If it was done with a neutral bias, certainty signals would be sent as to the actual magnitude of the required monetary impulse, which seemed incompatible with the downside risks of the baseline scenario.",
        "Several Board members added that such a decision ran the risk of generating polar interpretations: either it could convey an unrealistic degree of certainty in the Board’s projections and decisions, or it could increase uncertainty by fueling interpretations that the Chilean economy was more vulnerable than it actually was.",
        "This latter view could be exacerbated by a decision to apply a 75bp reduction with a downward bias.",
        "About the options of lowering the MPR by 25 or 50bp, all the Board members agreed that both were consistent with the baseline scenario and posed less communication problems because they left the door open to new adjustments given the expansionary bias considered in either of the two.",
        "However, several Board members agreed that lowering the MPR by 25bp was not the best option as it entailed the risk of reflecting an excessively prudent or passive Central Bank, at a time when the economic scenario was changing rapidly and the Report’s analysis suggested boosting the impulse by more than 25bp.",
        "In their opinion, such a decision could call into question the Board’s reaction function and raise doubts about the true policy space available, which could affect the perceptions of risks facing the Chilean economy.",
        "One Board member noted that the fundamental difference between both options was the different signals they gave.",
        "In that sense, a 50bp cut could signal an urgency, which was mitigated because the decision was anticipated by the market.",
        "One Board member added that the option of lowering the MPR by 50bp was most consistent with the decision of the July Meeting.",
        "He recalled that an expansionary bias had been communicated then, deferring the MPR adjustment until the evolution of the external scenario and the data of the first half could be framed into a foreseeable monetary policy trajectory, supported by medium-term projections.",
        "From July to date, the external scenario had worsened and domestic activity, demand, and price figures had been below expectations, fully justifying a somewhat stronger adjustment to the monetary policy rate.",
        "One Board member estimated that in certain aspects the option of a 25bp reduction dominated over the 50bp option.",
        "In his opinion, the degrees of uncertainty were important, and just as more negative scenarios could not be ruled out, neither could more positive scenarios be dismissed.",
        "In his view, the need to lower the MPR so fast was tempered by the fact that inflation had begun to rise towards the target and the current-account balance measured at trend prices was high.",
        "Moreover, the probability of some improvement in the scenario was not negligible.",
        "The persistence of weak consumption could disappear thanks to better financial conditions, due to the impact of a wage bill that grew somewhat more than consumption, or due to the likely increase in consumption by immigrants once they began to consolidate their labor insertion in Chile.",
        "That could also be the case with investment, because the background provided by the Capital Goods Corporation Survey tended to reinforce the perception of more dynamic investment.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Costa and Naudon voted for reducing the MPR by 50 basis points, to 2%.",
        "They also agreed that a further increase in the monetary stimulus might be required, which would be assessed in the following Meetings in light of the unfolding of the macroeconomic scenario.",
        "There was agreement among the Board members that this decision was fully consistent with the analysis in the Report, which yielded that the monetary stimulus needed to be enhanced in order to ensure inflation’s convergence to the target.",
        "At the same time, beyond the magnitude of the MPR cut at this Meeting, the change was consistent with the expectations of the markets, which also saw the need to lower the MPR.",
        "Finally, the Board members agreed that a 50bp cut left them in a more comfortable position to evaluate the monetary impulse that would be needed in the meetings ahead.",
        "The external scenario had evolved in line with forecasts in the September Monetary Policy Report.",
        "Regarding trade, despite preliminary agreements reached by China and the United States, there were still important issues unresolved, with new tariffs imposed by the latter on Europe, plus growing political unrest in the US.",
        "In the United Kingdom, some doubts about Brexit had been rekindled in the days before the Meeting, while in the Middle East several flanks of instability remained.",
        "Hand in hand with idiosyncratic factors, the situation continued to be complex in Latin America, where more countries reported internal political conflicts.",
        "The overall picture remained marked by deteriorating manufacturing, international trade and investment activity, and growth projections had been adjusted downwards for several countries.",
        "In the developed world, manufacturing production had surprised in the major economies, most showing setbacks in annual terms, while business expectations saw no progress going forward.",
        "In the US, there was also some weakening of a number of consumptionrelated indicators that had previously proven more resilient.",
        "The same was true of some labor market indicators, which in any case continued to show signs of being tight.",
        "In the Eurozone, Germany again stood out among the most hurt, with further worsening exports data.",
        "The UK was stagnant in productive investment, amid generalized falls in different confidence indicators.",
        "In China, third-quarter GDP growth (6% annually) had disappointed as once again it reached its lowest figure of several decades.",
        "Towards the end of the period there was some improvement in manufacturing output, retail sales, and credit, among others, which contrasted with the negative surprise of its external sector.",
        "The breakdown of the latter showed that the redirection of shipments had failed to compensate for the decreased activity with the United States.",
        "Political uncertainty was the tonic in Latin America, with falling confidence indicators in several countries.",
        "Argentina was in the run-up to elections.",
        "The situation had become much more complex in Ecuador—where the persistence of its fiscal deficit stood out—and Peru, whose investment prospects had fallen sharply.",
        "Monthly activity and manufacturing production in Mexico continued to post negative annual expansion rates.",
        "Meanwhile, in Brazil and Colombia the outlook was somewhat more encouraging, both with ongoing reforms that could result in greater dynamism going forward.",
        "In this context, an important number of monetary authorities around the world had continued to increase their stimulus, with reductions in the benchmark rates in several countries together with unconventional measures.",
        "Worth noting were the policy rate cut applied by the US Federal Reserve, which had also announced the end of the adjustment of its balance sheet, and the set of measures adopted by the European Central Bank, which included revisiting quantitative easing.",
        "All this in the midst of still-contained inflation numbers in most economies.",
        "There was still some volatility on the financial front.",
        "Thus, beyond some fluctuations, long-term interest rates and stock market indices posted slight increases with respect to the previous Meeting, while the bulk of currencies showed limited appreciations against the dollar.",
        "As for commodities, the price of copper had remained virtually flat since the September Meeting, combining inventory depletions and reduced imports globally.",
        "In the case of oil, apart from a sharp transitory increase resulting from the attack on an important refinery, its international price had tended to decline, within a context of weaker demand and higher inventory build-up.",
        "Prior to the social upheaval that shook the country, local financial markets had been influenced by the more expansionary stance of monetary policy and developments abroad.",
        "Compared with September, beyond some ups and downs, the exchange rate had decreased and the stock market indices had risen.",
        "Interest rates in the fixed-income market, both real and nominal, had shown mixed behavior since the previous Meeting, with decreases in UF-denominated instruments, particularly at 2 and 5 years, and increases in the last week, in line with the international scenario and due to pension system affiliates shifting to riskier funds at the local level.",
        "Regarding financing conditions, there were interest rate reductions in all portfolios and increases in the real annual variation of commercial and mortgage loans.",
        "The Bank Credit Survey of the third quarter reported an unchanged supply, as well as a more dynamic demand in the housing segment and weaker demand among construction companies.",
        "As for local activity, the third-quarter data at hand was in line with forecasts in the last Report’s baseline scenario, with annual economic growth outperforming that of the first half of the year.",
        "This was consistent with the fading out of some supply factors that had temporarily affected the performance of some sectors in the first half (e.g.",
        "mining), and with the lower comparison base of the second half of 2018.",
        "Thus, in the July-August two-month period, the mining Imacec had increased its annual expansion to 3.2% and the non-mining index, to 3.5%.",
        "On the expenditure side, investment remained dynamic, especially in mining, which continued to boost activity in other sectors, such as business services and construction.",
        "This contrasted with the deterioration of business expectations (IMCE) and capital goods imports.",
        "Private consumption kept growing moderately, in a context where the wage bill reflected no big changes and continued to outgrow consumption; consumer confidence had worsened further, imports of consumer goods had declined and the growth of private salaried employment was bounded.",
        "Exports remained weak, partly because of the poor performance of some trading partners and the impact of the trade war.",
        "In this context, growth expectations in the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) contained minor changes since the September Report.",
        "In particular, the October EES anticipated a GDP increase of 2.5%, 3% and 3.3% for 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.",
        "The Business Perceptions Report, for which data had been collected up to October 18, reported that the business performance of most respondents had been similar to or somewhat better than the previous quarter, with results that were mostly in line with expectations.",
        "By sectors, the better performances continued to be seen in those having contracts with major mining projects, the salmon sector, those engaged in the construction of homes under UF3,000 or with a housing subsidy, and some services.",
        "Meanwhile, trade had continued to see stagnating sales, as had companies linked to the forestry sector.",
        "Beyond exchange rate movements, cost pressures had remained contained.",
        "In any case, many respondents drew attention to the increases in the prices of fuel and electricity.",
        "Selling prices had remained constant or had risen less than expected, a situation they expected to continue over the foreseeable future, in particular because in their opinion demand was still precarious.",
        "Investments remained concentrated mostly in process automation to increase efficiency and/or mitigate higher payroll costs.",
        "In the labor market, workforce remained abundant, but most respondents did not foresee big changes in their staffing.",
        "Financial conditions had improved in terms of rates.",
        "In any case, the banks noted that the demand for loans, beyond refinancing and/or portfolio repurchase motives, remained bounded.",
        "Headline inflation had remained around 2% annually since the September Meeting.",
        "The components of core inflation (CPIEFE) continued with their behavior of previous months.",
        "The services CPIEFE was still low, while the goods CPIEFE had risen further.",
        "Among the more volatile items, it was worth noting the decline in some foodstuffs’ inflation, which was below its historic standards, and that of fuels.",
        "As for the inflation outlook, various indicators showed increases, most notably one year ahead.",
        "Expectations for the monetary policy rate (MPR) were for a 25 bp (basis point) cut at this Meeting.",
        "Going forward, the October EES did not foresee any new falls, while the Financial Brokers Survey and the information implicit in the financial asset prices anticipated another 25 bp cut between the end of this year and early 2020.",
        "Regarding the effects of the events occurring in the country since 18 October, it was evident that they would have negative consequences on short-term activity, but there was more uncertainty regarding their medium-term effects, so it was necessary to evaluate, among many factors, the magnitude and speed of reconstruction works, the impact on expectations and the effects of the measures announced by the government.",
        "Until the time of the Meeting, the effects on local financial markets had been limited.",
        "Most affected were the stock market, which had reversed part of its previous increases, and the risk premiums, which showed minor increases.",
        "The peso had depreciated from around $715 to 725 per dollar —near its price at the September Meeting.",
        "With respect to the inflation outlook, after the announcements canceling the increases in electricity rates and public transport fares, inflation expectations implicit in market prices had undone earlier increases.",
        "In the case of the MPR expectations, financial prices showed that the 1.5% rate expectation had been prolonged until the first quarter of 2021.",
        "It was noted that the overall figures of the domestic macroeconomic scenario had performed in line with forecasts in the September Report.",
        "For example, there was greater annual growth in activity in July and August, while private consumption and its fundamentals, as well as services inflation, continued to be weak, leading to persistent risks in this area.",
        "In the external scenario, manufacturing, investment and trade activity continued to fall, validating the cuts in the growth projections for the major economies.",
        "Likewise, the discussion on the space for and effectiveness of a more expansionary monetary policy in those economies had intensified, as had the viability of a timely action coming from the Treasury.",
        "About the social turmoil affecting the country, all the Board members agreed that undoubtedly the social and political disorders of recent days would have implications on the evolution of the economy in the short and medium term.",
        "In the immediate future, it was clear that the partial paralysis of the country for several days, the destruction of public and private infrastructure and the greater sensitivity of some important sectors, such as trade and transport, would have a significant impact on activity, which would negatively change the growth prospects for the year.",
        "However, the short-term effects on inflation were difficult to assess and would depend largely on how long the interruptions in the production and distribution of goods and services would last.",
        "There was consensus among the Board members that in the medium term the effects would also be seen in productive activity, expectations, consumption, investment, fiscal policy and financial indicators.",
        "However, the net effect that all these factors combined would have on inflation was not obvious.",
        "In particular, it could depend not only on the dynamics of some relevant prices, but also on the evolution of actual activity and potential growth.",
        "The Board agreed that it was therefore premature to size up the response that would be required from monetary policy.",
        "For example, some calibration was needed of the effects on business and household confidence, and how the investment and consumption plans of the various players would be affected.",
        "It would also require calibrating and knowing the ultimate size of the fiscal policy response to this scenario.",
        "All the Board members stressed that so far the markets’ reaction had been limited.",
        "They mentioned the fall in the stock market, which could be explained by the fact that adverse effects on short-term economic activity resulted in reduced the companies’ expected profits and provided fewer incentives for longer-term investment.",
        "In any case, there was agreement that greater volatility in the future could not be ruled out and the Bank should be prepared to address anomalous situations.",
        "All the Board members agreed that the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario confirmed the assessment made in the September Report.",
        "It implied that the convergence of inflation to the target required a greater monetary stimulus, part of which had already been added with the MPR cut at the previous Meeting.",
        "Unequivocally, recent events would negatively affect activity in the short term, but their effects on inflation in the short and medium term were not entirely evident.",
        "Some Board members said that the possible negative effect on demand would dominate in the evolution of inflation, while in the opinion of other Board members the effects on the productive capacity and the potential impact on demand of some proposals should not be ruled out, therefore the impact on inflation in the medium term was still uncertain.",
        "In view of the above, all five Board members agreed that the option of reducing the policy rate by 25 bp clearly prevailed over all other alternatives.",
        "On the one hand, it was consistent with the evaluation of the data and the message delivered in the September Report.",
        "On the other, it was consistent with market expectations, which had correctly internalized the Board’s message.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Costa, and Naudon voted for lowering the MPR by 25bp, to 1.75%.",
        "They reasoned that this option clearly dominated, as it was not possible for the moment to anticipate the effects that the social situation would have on the medium-term macroeconomic scenario.",
        "Thus, a communication could be achieved that would not alter the current interest rate structure and would emphasize the need to evaluate the effects of the recent events before making any decision.",
        "Recent international data had increased the possibility for the world economy to experience a sharper-than-expected slowdown, in a context of persistent volatility in the financial markets and where political and financial risks remained fully in force.",
        "In the developed world, economic expectations had deteriorated.",
        "Inflation had moderated in most countries, largely due to the oil price drop of the last quarter of 2018.",
        "In this scenario, some external risks had gained strength.",
        "The uncertainty surrounding the Brexit had intensified, with little time left for the parties to reach an agreement before the deadline of the actual departure.",
        "In China, there were doubts concerning the magnitude that the slowdown of activity could achieve and the effectiveness of its stimulus policies, coupled with medium-term risks that might continue to incubate.",
        "Meanwhile, the trade conflict between the US and China showed no major advances, beyond the fact that the market was still awaiting the possible results of their bilateral talks.",
        "In terms of activity, the conjunctural data and economic outlook of the Eurozone were still moderating and posting lower figures than the market expected, raising doubts going forward.",
        "In November, annual growth in manufacturing output had dwindled across the entire bloc.",
        "Purchasing managers’ indexes (PMI) for manufacturing and services continued to decline towards neutrality and consumer confidence had weakened somewhat in recent months.",
        "In the US, incoming data remained dynamic, with a still tight labor market that was sustaining consumption in the short term.",
        "However, market investment prospects for 2019 had declined further.",
        "In the emerging world, China’s GDP had grown 6.4% y-o-y in the fourth quarter, still on a path of gradual deceleration.",
        "December’s exports and imports had contracted in annual terms and the manufacturing outlook was below the expansion-indicator pivot.",
        "In this context, the Chinese authorities had continued to announce and implement stimulus measures to stabilize the economy into the near future.",
        "Latin American data was mixed.",
        "Brazil showed improvement in industrial and consumer confidence, while announcements were expected regarding structural reforms that would sustain the fiscal accounts.",
        "In Mexico, the economic proposal focused on fiscal responsibility had calmed the markets.",
        "Argentina had officially entered a recession in the third quarter of 2018 and partial figures for the fourth quarter pointed to a new contraction.",
        "In this context, the main central banks had attenuated the restrictive character of their monetary policy communication.",
        "In addition to its direct effect on shortterm interest rates, the change in tone in the communication had had effects on the prices of different assets, including reductions in long-term interest rates and partial recoveries in the stock markets, after their poor performance of the latter months of 2018.",
        "This had also driven capital flows towards the emerging world.",
        "Commodity prices had shown mixed movements since the December monetary policy meeting.",
        "Brent and WTI oil prices had risen around 1% each, mainly because of production cuts being applied by OPEC countries and other important producers.",
        "The copper price had receded nearly 5%, largely because of concerns about the Chinese economy’s slowdown and a global scenario that pointed to lower demand.",
        "In parallel with this policy meeting, the FOMC’s meeting was taking place, after which it decided to keep interest rates unchanged and announced that it would be patient as it determines further adjustments, while it would revise its plans to adjust its balance sheet.",
        "Regarding local financial conditions, again the peso/dollar parity had shown significant ups and downs, but it was not far from its level at the previous meeting.",
        "Among the multilateral measures, the MER posted a depreciation in the period.",
        "The real exchange rate (MER index, 1986=100) had been at 93 in December 2018 and, using all the available information, it was estimated at 93.4 in January 2019, close to its average of the last 15 and 20 years.",
        "This, in a context in which the local risk indicators had remained contained and the fixed-income market interest rates had declined slightly, converging with the global trend.",
        "The stock market (IPSA) had increased in every sector, owing partly to the improvement in global stock markets following the reorientation of the monetary policy statement in developed countries, but also influenced by a recovery in the Brazilian economic outlook.",
        "In the credit market, inflation-indexed loans had grown since the previous meeting, in particular the consumer and commercial segments.",
        "Interest rates were still low from a historical perspective, despite a slight increase recently.",
        "The Banking Credit Survey for the fourth quarter of 2018 showed strengthened demand for the different credit types, especially to large corporations, real estate and construction companies.",
        "On the supply side, credit constraints had eased for large companies while mortgage lending conditions had tightened somewhat.",
        "About local activity, in line with the December Monetary Policy Report, partial fourth-quarter figures showed that the economy had regained dynamism, having left behind the specific factors that had slowed it down during the third quarter.",
        "Between October and November, the Imacec had averaged 3.6% annually, from an average y-o-y growth of 2.7% in the third quarter.",
        "The non-mining sectors had improved their performance, where again the greater momentum of those more related to investment, such as business services and some wholesale trade lines, was worth noting.",
        "Also, construction had recovered recently.",
        "Mining, after several months, had returned to positive annual expansion.",
        "With this information, the markets’ growth expectations, as measured by the Economic Expectations Survey, were consolidated at 4% for 2018, while for this year and the next they were at 3.6% and 3.5%, respectively, almost unchanged since the close of the December Report.",
        "Domestic spending behavior was consistent with that of activity.",
        "Investment continued to be its most dynamic component, with still optimistic prospects.",
        "On the side of machinery and equipment, imports of capital goods were growing strongly.",
        "In construction and other works, among other elements the upward correction of the CBC’s Project Survey reflected that a greater number of economic sectors had increased the number of initiatives for this and the next few years, adding to the high flows that continued to be projected for mining.",
        "Business expectations (IMCE), on aggregate, remained around their neutral value.",
        "About private consumption, annual growth in the second half of 2018 had been slower than in the first, and below forecasts, especially regarding durables.",
        "Indicators of services consumption, in any case, suggested that it sustained a more favorable performance.",
        "The labor market showed no change with respect to the evaluation included in the December Monetary Policy Report.",
        "The unemployment rate and the annual expansion of nominal and real wages continued to be around 7%, 4% and 1%, respectively.",
        "Salaried employment continued to slightly outpace self-employment.",
        "Consumer expectations as measured with the IPEC had moderated.",
        "However, alternative indicators—built on the basis of the IPEC components more highly correlated with consumption—showed minor movements.",
        "Imports of consumer goods persisted at high levels.",
        "Most of the interviewees for the Business Perceptions Report of February 2019 expected their businesses to perform this year as they did last year.",
        "Many of them responded that 2018 had closed with better results than in previous years, although less than they initially expected.",
        "This, in a context in which, competition among companies was still strong in general terms, they found it difficult to adjust prices upwards and their margins were narrow.",
        "There was a more positive perception of investment across the different regions, especially those related to mining, forestry and salmon farming.",
        "In contrast, opinions about consumption pointed to less dynamism, as was evident from interviews to retail agents, among others.",
        "About the labor market, no big changes were foreseen in the staffing of the interviewed firms and the vision remained of low wage pressures.",
        "Cost control continued to be an important focus point for the bulk of the companies consulted.",
        "On the credit side, lending conditions were still seen as favorable.",
        "December’s inflation had been at -0.1%, affected mainly by a fall in the prices of its most volatile items.",
        "With respect to the December Report, inflation had been somewhat below projections, mainly because of specific factors, such as lower inflation of some typically highly volatile services.",
        "In annual terms, inflation had fallen to 2.6% in December.",
        "By components, the annual growth rate of fuel prices had decreased to 8% and that of fresh fruits and vegetables, to 7.8%.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation —CPIEFE— had risen to 2.3% annually, less than previous projections.",
        "By components, the CPIEFE for goods exhibited a slightly positive annual variation, while the CPIEFE for services had dropped to 3.4%.",
        "In any case, prices more sensitive to the activity-gap, such as non-regulated utilities in the CPIEFE, continued to rise steadily.",
        "The private inflation outlook, albeit with fluctuations and following the evolution of international fuel prices, had decreased in the short term, standing at 2.8% annually for December of this year.",
        "Two years ahead, they were still around 3%.",
        "The different market expectations (i.e.",
        "from surveys to specialists and implicit in the prices of financial assets) anticipated an increase of 25 basis points in the monetary policy rate (MPR) at this meeting.",
        "The surveys to specialists continued to predict that the MPR would stand at 3.5% and 4.0% one and two years ahead, respectively.",
        "Meanwhile, the prices of financial assets remained on a more stable trajectory with respect to the surveys and somewhat below what they had anticipated at the December meeting, placing the policy rate in the neighborhood of 3.25% one year ahead and somewhat above 3.5% in two years.",
        "There was debate about the evolution of the global economy, noting that although the indicators showed slower growth than expected in Europe —particularly Germany— and in China, the US economy maintained its growth rate in line with projections, and a steady strengthening of its labor market.",
        "However, concerns about the evolution of global risks and their impact on growth had triggered a major adjustment in asset prices late last year, which had affected the expectations in all these countries significantly and had led monetary authorities to state that the interest rate hikes would be moderated going forward.",
        "This, coupled with the US and Chinese governments’ willingness to negotiate their trade issues, had brought a little more calm to the financial markets, with some recovery in stock prices and declines in interest rates.",
        "It was mentioned that, despite this noisier environment, the situation for emerging countries had not changed much so far.",
        "After the capital outflows at the end of last year, calm had returned to the markets, risk premiums had fallen and commodity prices had tended to stabilize.",
        "It was commented that the present economic climate had to be related to the persistent uncertainty that was accumulating, at least since the beginning of 2017, around important economic policy decisions.",
        "All this in a context in which the markets’ sensitivity to potentially negative news seemed to have risen.",
        "It was concluded that the current global scenario was on a relatively atypical phase of the global economic cycle, which called for a more thorough analysis aimed at anticipating its future dynamics and possible transmission channels to the Chilean economy.",
        "A key element in this regard was to elucidate how the structural factors, the trade conflict and the policy responses that were operating in parallel would be reflected on the Chinese economy.",
        "Summing up, the assessment of the risks in the more negative external scenarios, associated with the international political-economic conduct, had increased significantly.",
        "There was discussion about what could be underlying the slowdown in activity in the Eurozone and why the likelihood of a US recession had increased.",
        "This, in a context in which the reasons that usually hold back growth —for example, an accelerated monetary contraction as a reaction to inflationary pressures, or the exposure of important financial vulnerabilities— were not present.",
        "Among the possible causes, some specific issues that had affected activity in Germany and the slowdown of activity in China were mentioned.",
        "The hypothesis was also raised that it could be due to the prolonged time during which some risks had been present in the international scenario without being cleared, which could have led to a worsening of expectations.",
        "There was also discussion regarding the central banks’ reaction to the evolution of the global economic outlook.",
        "It was mentioned that, although the changes in the external baseline scenario were not big, the generalized reaction of the central banks had clearly been to signal greater caution.",
        "One way of interpreting this reaction was that the most recent recovery had responded rather to an expansionary monetary policy than to a more structural upturn.",
        "This could indicate that the international economy was weaker than had been considered in the baseline scenario, beyond the fact that the data had fairly matched the forecasts.",
        "The risk that emerged in this area was about the growth capacity of the world economy, because it could hardly be thought that monetary policy, or other countercyclical measures, had the capacity to continue providing an impulse of the same magnitude as in the past.",
        "On the domestic front, there was agreement that, for the moment, the information at hand gave no obvious signs that the evolution of the external scenario was permeating the local economy.",
        "In particular, although inflation had closed 2018 somewhat below projections, it was adjusting in the foreseen direction.",
        "On aggregate, the non-mining GDP had brought no surprise either, although it did show a divergence between the evolution of the more investment-related sectors —which showed greater dynamism— relative to those more related to consumption, which had fallen below estimates.",
        "Exports and imports also evolved somewhat above forecasts.",
        "The local financial conditions continued to be stable and favorable, the credit channel had strengthened, with increased lending and higher demand for consumer and commercial loans, according to the Banking Credit Survey.",
        "Finally, the faster than expected advancement of the fiscal consolidation objectives was worth noting as a positive development in the domestic scenario.",
        "The debate covered the reasons that could explain why inflation had been somewhat lower than expected, in particular the CPIEFE.",
        "It was said that it was difficult to associate this difference with a change in the business or the credit cycle, since after the doubts of the third quarter of last year, the fourth quarter had shown a recovery.",
        "It was added that core inflation for goods could be responding to a delay in the pass-through of the exchange rate rise of the second half of the year to prices, in which case a reversal should be expected in the short term, provided that the exchange rate stayed longer at its current levels.",
        "Alternatively, the fact that lower inflation seemed to affect every category of goods, suggested that it could be reflecting the weaker than expected consumption, in which case the convergence of inflation could take a little longer.",
        "Figuring out the relevance of these alternatives emerged as a priority task for the analysis of the upcoming March Report.",
        "Also, the possible changes associated to the new CPI basket had to be considered.",
        "The implications of the evolution of the external scenario for the path of monetary withdrawal were also discussed.",
        "On one hand, the new information caused no significant change in the external impulse projected in the Report’s baseline scenario.",
        "However, it was obvious that downward biased risks for activity had increased.",
        "The quantification of the effects of these developments was not evident and it would be a matter of the March Report to gauge its effects more accurately.",
        "At the local level, the outlook was somewhat more positive for investment, reflecting that, for now, the greater global uncertainty had not permeated the local economy so much.",
        "It was added that, actually, the easing of external monetary conditions had driven capital flows to emerging economies, so it could be thought that it was having a rather expansionary effect.",
        "Facing the complete revision of the forecasting exercise —to be included in the March Report— it was noted that the external scenario depicted in the December Report was already below the market’s projection.",
        "The discussion turned to the uncertainty surrounding the evaluation of structural parameters that sustained monetary policy (i.e.",
        "trend and potential growth, activity gap and neutral interest rate).",
        "It was noted that this made it especially necessary to update those estimates over the course of this year.",
        "All the Board agreed that, given the information available, it was right to think that the baseline scenario continued to estimate closing capacity gaps and inflation converging to the target within the next two years.",
        "Therefore, they agreed that the monetary policy’s orientation should continue to point at a normalization of the policy rate towards its neutral level, as had been expressed in the December Report.",
        "Several Board members added that, in any case, it was important to bear in mind that multiple MPR trajectories were consistent with a given baseline scenario, and the convenience of signaling to the market one or another path as the most likely one depended not only on the starting point but also on the risk scenarios.",
        "However, all the Board members agreed that given the distance that still existed with respect to the neutral interest rate, these considerations were not an obstacle for the two policy options proposed at this meeting (i.e.",
        "holding the MPR at 2.75% or raising it to 3%) to be fully valid, as was a restrictive bias going forward.",
        "All the Board members agreed that the main argument for this option was that it was totally consistent with the baseline scenario, which showed no significant deviations.",
        "In addition, it was what the market expected, and the current degree of monetary stimulus, including its distance with the MPR’s neutral level, provided room to raise the policy rate without entailing higher costs associated with the related risks.",
        "One Board member noted that, beyond the decision to raise the MPR and further withdraw the monetary stimulus, it was important to communicate that such withdrawal would be done with greater flexibility, consistent with the commitment to proceed gradually and cautiously.",
        "This greater flexibility should leave no doubt that it was still necessary to continue with the normalization process, but, in turn, it was possible that this process could be somewhat slower than was communicated in the last Report.",
        "The Board members agreed that the main argument for this option was that it bought time to await for more information on the evolution of the external scenario, its fundamentals and its transmission channels to the Chilean economy.",
        "This option, however, would not only take the market by surprise, it could also signal a change in the baseline scenario or in the need to continue with the normalization of the MPR, without having any information that could justify this.",
        "One Board member noted that the evolution of the external scenario had led to a flattening of the MPR curve implicit in the prices of local assets.",
        "In his opinion, there was a quite remarkable divergence, since from the point of view of market prices, monetary policy would be more expansionary than projected some time ago without the ingredients that had motivated this movement in the world occurring at home.",
        "This, he concluded, could suggest that monetary policy was unnecessarily more expansionary than needed.",
        "Accordingly, from the standpoint of aligning the monetary policy with the international scenario, keeping the MPR and validating a scenario of a much flatter trajectory seemed very inconsistent with local developments, especially because Chilean economic indicators did not factor in developments in other countries, particularly in the developed world, and that was what had led other central banks to react.",
        "The Board decided, with the votes of Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Costa and Naudon, to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 3% annually.",
        "The background information presented to the Board and the analysis thereof are contained in June’s Monetary Policy Report.",
        "That is, in recent months annual CPI inflation had remained around 2%, both in its headline and core measures.",
        "In turn, activity had reduced its annual expansion rate in the first quarter, falling below expectations.",
        "This adjustment had concentrated especially on mining, agriculture and other sectors dominated by supply factors.",
        "On the expenditure side, there had been a significant deceleration of investment, particularly of machinery and equipment, and of exports.",
        "In contrast, consumption had sustained the expected dynamism.",
        "Externally, the main development since the last Report had been the escalating conflict between the United States and its main trading partners, which had resulted in increased risk aversion, affecting the valuation of assets, currencies and commodities, as well as Chile’s terms of trade, in a context of marked deterioration of global trade figures.",
        "In this Report, the Board had updated the structural parameter estimates that were used to assess the state of the economy, their prospects and implications for monetary policy.",
        "Most importantly, this had allowed to quantify the effect of the strong immigration flow of recent years on trend and potential growth, increasing both.",
        "Meanwhile, the neutral MPR had been revised downward by 25 basis points (bp), partly reflecting the fall in neutral rates around the world and despite the opposing effect that could be expected from the higher trend growth.",
        "The widened gaps that were derived from the updating of the parameters and the weakness of first-quarter activity and demand were consistent with the low inflationary pressures observed.",
        "All five Board members agreed that the new combination of precedents justified the need to increase the monetary stimulus.",
        "In particular, the updating of the structural parameters pointed to greater potential and trend growth, which, if added to the lower dynamism of the economy in the first quarter, resulted in a wider and more-persistent-than-expected capacity gap.",
        "This was compounded with the worsening of external conditions, especially the risks, and a lower neutral MPR, which translated into a somewhat weaker-than-expected monetary stimulus.",
        "In such context, a needed discussion was about how this monetary expansion would proceed.",
        "A first option was to signal that the MPR would remain flat for longer than had been announced in March.",
        "Although this option matched market expectations, the Board members agreed that it had two important problems that ruled it out.",
        "First, it implied a delayed convergence of inflation to the target, which was obviously a problem in a context in which risks related to the external scenario and activity were biased downward.",
        "Thus, any shock entailing a greater delay in the convergence of inflation would make it difficult to meet the target within the policy horizon and would require sharper cuts to the MPR in the future.",
        "Second, under this option, the more expansionary monetary policy would rely essentially on signs of future decisions, which would have more limited effects than would concrete actions now.",
        "One Board member said that this second apprehension also applied to the option of not changing the rate at this Meeting with an expansionary bias, for which reason he also ruled it out.",
        "All the Board members also agreed that, at this Meeting, the most relevant options were those that considered MPR cuts of 50 bp.",
        "This could be done in two ways.",
        "One, with a 25 bp reduction and a bias indicating that there would be another movement of the same magnitude.",
        "Or two, with a 50 bp reduction and a neutral bias stating that the next MPR movement will hinge on how certain the Board is about the convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "Some Board members noted that, in terms of their macroeconomic effects, both options were practically identical so, in essence, the decision was tactical.",
        "These Board members opined that the main advantage of lowering the MPR by 25 bp and include a downward bias, was its lower communicational cost, mainly because it reduced the risk of this action being seen as a more adverse signal with respect to the macroeconomic scenario, compared with the scenario in the June Report.",
        "One Board member emphasized that this risk could be mitigated by the fact that the Report was due to be released the following Monday.",
        "The entire Board agreed that, given the surprise that the MPR cut would involve, on this occasion it was advisable to provide more information in the statement, including the Bank’s outlook for activity.",
        "Meanwhile, several Board members mentioned that the option to lower the MPR in two steps was not free of communicational costs.",
        "On one hand, it could convey some conditioning of the second cut, which was inconsistent with the Report’s baseline scenario.",
        "For example, it could be the case that the next 25 bp occurred with no bad news in the margin, which perhaps would be difficult to explain.",
        "On the other hand, such two-step cut could be construed as a scenario that required a reduction of more than 50 bp, which was neither consistent with the Report’s baseline scenario.",
        "About the option to lower the MPR by 50 bp, the Board members emphasized that although it would come as a surprise, it was important to make it clear that the combination of factors behind the decision was unusual.",
        "In particular, due to the upward revision of potential and trend growth, which occurred along with a fall in the neutral rate, in a context of low inflation and economic slowdown.",
        "Furthermore, it had to be made clear that in the new scheme —eight meetings per year— this kind of MPR movements —50 bp— would be more frequent, partly because more background information could be accumulated between meetings.",
        "Thus, as the option to lower 50 bp was now relevant, it could not be ruled out that different scenarios should mean raising the MPR by the same amount without this being interpreted as fear of an imminent inflationary outburst.",
        "Summing up, all the Board members agreed that either option would be a surprise and there was no clear-cut reason indicating the convenience of making a gradual adjustment instead of doing it in one take, while including more information in the statement and in the understanding that the Report’s release would mitigate any possible misinterpretation.",
        "The entire Board agreed that the evaluation of the macroeconomic scenario raised no doubts about the need to lower the MPR by 50 bp altogether.",
        "This was much more consistent with the Report’s baseline scenario and associated risks, allowing for greater certainty regarding the convergence of inflation to 3% in the policy horizon.",
        "The Board also agreed that reducing the MPR by 50 bp accompanying a neutral bias would allow focusing the upcoming analysis in the evolution of the economy and its implications for monetary policy.",
        "The Board decided, with the votes of Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial, and Board members García, Costa and Naudon, to reduce the MPR by 50 basis points, to 2.5%.",
        "In the international scenario, the consolidation of more expansionary expectations for monetary policy at a global level stood out, with movements in that direction that had already taken effect in some economies.",
        "Following the recent communication from the Governor of the Federal Reserve Board (Fed), a large part of the market had internalized a cut in the US benchmark rate for the upcoming July meeting, adding statements with a more dovish tone by the monetary authorities in the Eurozone and England, among others.",
        "In terms of inflation, beyond seasonal increases, the numbers remained contained in the developed world, as did its outlook.",
        "Within the emerging bloc, in several Latin American countries inflation had decreased in the margin and was approaching the respective targets.",
        "Overall, there was latent concern about the performance of the global economy, especially considering the negative surprise from manufacturing, foreign trade and investment indicators in several countries, which contrasted with incoming data from labor, consumption and services, that showed little change.",
        "About the developed world, the US manufacturing industry, although more stable in the margin, had contracted again in the second quarter, amid indicators of capacity utilization and business prospects for the sector (ISM) that showed some deterioration in recent figures.",
        "Meanwhile, the evolution of retail sales and job creation predicted that private consumption would complete the period with good performance.",
        "In the Eurozone, different expectations measures backed the region’s weak outlook, especially those more closely linked to the tradable sector, coinciding with the worsening of exports from these economies.",
        "Germany, in particular, had disappointed again according to different data, with its evolution lagging somewhat with respect to other countries in the zone.",
        "In the emerging world, China’s GDP had expanded 6.2% annually in the second quarter.",
        "Worth noting was the lesser momentum from manufacturing and construction, while the behavior of services had not varied much.",
        "In any case, toward the end of the quarter some sectors had surprised positively, such as manufacturing and retail, pointing to some stabilization of the Chinese economy.",
        "In Latin America, despite rather improved confidence indicators in the margin, many economies had seen weak performance in the early part of the second quarter, as was evident in monthly activity figures.",
        "Domestic challenges persisted in several countries.",
        "In Mexico, the resignation of the Minister of Finance and government support for the state-owned oil company had triggered doubts in the markets, while Argentina was slowly leaving the recession behind, amid political uncertainty.",
        "In Brazil, meanwhile, there was progress in pension reforms.",
        "This scenario continued to favor lenient global financial conditions.",
        "In line with the further easing expected for monetary policy, long-term interest rates had seen significant declines since the previous Meeting, to negative values in real terms in several economies, essentially the developed ones.",
        "Likewise, the appetite for risk had risen, with significant increases in the stock markets and greater capital flows to emerging countries in the margin.",
        "The risk premiums had receded, while the dollar had tended to weaken against other currencies.",
        "Trade tensions between the US and China had moderated somewhat, but with a limited impact on the markets.",
        "After the June Meeting, commodity prices had risen slightly.",
        "Still, metals—copper included, with a near 3% rise since the previous Meeting—were below their prices of earlier months, in line with the uncertainty surrounding the external scenario.",
        "The oil price had risen around 6% according to the WTI-Brent average, boosted by supply factors and geo-political conflicts.",
        "The evolution of the local financial market had been strongly influenced by the more expansionary monetary policy stance in Chile and by external developments.",
        "Medium- and long-term fixed income rates had declined sharply.",
        "The local stock exchange (IPSA) had posted increases during the last month, in line with stock markets abroad, all in a context in which risk indicators had declined for Chile and emerging countries in general.",
        "The nominal exchange rate, with some volatility, was down from the last Meeting, in line with the evolution of the dollar around the world and the copper price.",
        "Multilateral exchange rate measures had also declined.",
        "Meanwhile, the real exchange rate (RER index, 1986 = 100) was estimated at 93.4 in July, slightly below the June estimate (94.2) and close to the average of the last 15 and 20 years.",
        "In the credit market, real loans showed a decrease in their annual growth rates in the consumer and commercial segments, and a slight increase in housing.",
        "Lending interest rates continued to decline, except for a minor rise in consumer loans due mainly to composition effect.",
        "The Bank Lending Survey of the second quarter reflected that supply conditions remained fairly stable, while demand was perceived to be weaker in large companies and with moderate rebounds in the segments of construction companies and housing credit.",
        "As for local activity, between April and May the Imacec had accumulated an annual expansion of 2.2%, surpassing the 1.6% of the first quarter of the year.",
        "However, some early indicators and qualitative background suggested downside risks for the coming months.",
        "On the one hand, there was a contraction in exports, due to the weakness of some trading partners and low mining production.",
        "On the other hand, there had been some strikes in June.",
        "On the consumption side, imports of consumer goods had fallen deeper.",
        "Consumer expectations (IPEC) had continued to decline, becoming more pessimistic, and even the respondents to questions about consumption pointed to lower expansion going forward.",
        "This, beyond that in May the annual variation of retail sales (IACM) had been the largest of the year, owing partly to a one-off event of retail discounts during the month.",
        "The labor market showed no significant changes.",
        "The unemployment rate had remained around 7%, similar to the same period the year before, while different sources of information pointed to an increase in employment.",
        "Real wages continued to grow at or above 2% per year.",
        "Investment showed a mixed performance.",
        "On the one hand, there was the favorable evolution of some items linked to business services and wholesale trade and, on the other, a slower rate of construction expansion.",
        "Meanwhile, capital imports had shrunk in the margin.",
        "Qualitatively, business expectations (IMCE)—excluding mining—had become more pessimistic.",
        "It was worth noting the deterioration of the manufacturing industry, which posted the largest drop within the index.",
        "In this context, market expectations for growth as per the Economic Expectations Survey had been revised downward with respect to the information available at the closing of the last Meeting, to 2.8% and 3.2% for this and next year (from 3.2% and 3.4% at the previous closing, respectively).",
        "Preliminary information in August’s Business Perceptions Report showed that the respondents continued to expect their businesses to improve growth in the second half of this year and over 2020, although their prospects had moderated, because of lower-than-expected results in the first half, and some sources of uncertainty externally and internally.",
        "By sectors, those linked goods trading were still among the most affected while those related to public infrastructure works lingered.",
        "By contrast, housing construction and the salmon industry posted good results.",
        "As for mining, the main impulse came from a handful of large projects underway, while output was seen as lower.",
        "Regarding investment, most of the respondents did not contemplate large initiatives in the short term, because they either had idle capacity or were waiting for a more sustained improvement in the economic context and/or the result of their businesses.",
        "Meanwhile, the mining, forestry and salmon sectors continued to develop important projects, which were boosting activity in some regions.",
        "In the labor market, most respondents reported that they were adequately funded for their current levels of activity, and that wage pressures remained low.",
        "Credit conditions remained favorable, with low interest rates and substantial availability of funds from the banking system for those who could show good results.",
        "Still, several respondents had no intention of taking more debt.",
        "In any case, in the segments of persons and companies, there were some reducing their financial burden, via debt renegotiations.",
        "Annual CPI inflation—measured using the 2018=100 benchmark series—had remained at 2.3% in June, while the core measure (CPIEFE) had continued to hover around 2%.",
        "Among the items making up the latter, the generalized downward surprise from services prices, more linked to capacity gaps and labor costs, was most striking.",
        "On the contrary, the goods component of the CPIEFE had been above expectations, although largely motivated by the tourist package item.",
        "Inflation of the more volatile components of the CPI basket—food and energy—had brought marginal surprises.",
        "As for private inflation expectations, there was a decrease for the end of 2019 and one year ahead.",
        "At two years, the median of the Economic Expectations Survey had remained at 3%, while the median of the Financial Brokers Survey had declined to 2.8%.",
        "In this context, expectations for the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) foresaw an increase in the monetary stimulus in the coming months, despite that the consensus at this Meeting pointed to no change in the policy rate.",
        "It was agreed that the main piece of news since the previous Meeting was the evolution of inflation.",
        "In particular, due to the general downward surprise from the services CPIEFE, which, given its historical persistence, suggested that its annual variation would flatline until the end of the year, as a result of a significant deceleration of its services component.",
        "As this tended to respond more to the activity gap and wages, and it had reached record lows, this was an important indicator of risk regarding inflation’s convergence to the policy target.",
        "It was noted that the surprise in services CPIEFE inflation suggested a rather widespread tendency in its components more related to wages, pointing to a potentially greater impact of immigration on its evolution.",
        "This signal was consistent with cost containment and low wage pressures that were repeatedly mentioned in successive Business Perception Reports.",
        "In the short term, it was pointed out, the projection of CPIEFE inflation would be materially different from what had been described in the latest Monetary Policy Report—partly a reflection of the persistence of services inflation—which was not part of private expectations.",
        "It was also noted that the evolution of inflation expectations had been noticeably downward, despite the clearly expansionary movement of the MPR in June, which had also taken the vast majority of people by surprise.",
        "It was noted that the evaluation of risks called for a thorough analysis of the evolution of activity, demand, and capacity gaps.",
        "The Imacecs of April and May, adjusted for some one-off phenomena, had remained within expectations.",
        "For June, not-so-optimistic figures were expected, because the combination of two important strikes and the smaller number of business days would reduce activity’s annual expansion by about half a percentage point.",
        "Thus, although the second quarter would exhibit greater growth than the first quarter, the weight of the acceleration would depend even more on the unfolding of the second half.",
        "The certainty about this, however, was toned down by some recent qualitative indicators, including the deterioration of consumer expectations and highfrequency information such as imports and construction data.",
        "It was stressed that the re-acceleration of the economy in the second half was an important component of inflation’s convergence to 3%, and news coming from both abroad and within triggered significant doubts about whether the economy would have the capacity to begin closing the activity gap, or not.",
        "The change in perspectives on the private consumption side was stressed.",
        "In particular, because imports of durable and non-durable consumer goods in the last month had brought significant unexpected nominal drops, in an environment of steadily deteriorating consumer expectations, which warranted weighting their incidence beyond the most recent figures.",
        "In any case, it was noted that there was less information about the consumption of services, which had shown greater dynamism in recent quarters, suggesting that production and employment in these sectors could be more stable or partially compensate for the aforesaid.",
        "It was said that one hypothesis that seemed consistent with the observed changes was that immigration was having a somewhat greater-than-anticipated impact on the capacity gaps, reducing inflationary pressures.",
        "This was consistent with a greater creation of salaried employment, especially in services, which coincided with an increase in self-employment.",
        "How much this increase in the wage bill weighed was difficult to assess, given the problems of labor statistics in measuring the effects of immigration.",
        "In this context, it was noted that there were more doubts about the downward revision of private consumption, because forces operating in opposite directions were at play: consumer expectations were pointing down, while the possible evolution of the wage bill and better financial conditions pointed to some containment of these trends.",
        "There was debate about risks for investment.",
        "On the one hand, the large investment projects were proceeding according to plan and their effects on certain sectors’ and regions’ economic activity was already becoming apparent, as the Business Perceptions Report showed.",
        "On the other hand, the possibility of slower investment dynamics in the rest of the sectors seemed to gain strength, partly fueled by recent figures that showed less momentum in some construction lines.",
        "In any case, the risk was of a lag in investment that would not significantly moderate the evolution of the economy in the near future, and that had already been present for some time.",
        "About the external front, it was said that, far from being resolved, commercial conflicts and political uncertainty in the main economies of the world had intensified and extended into new dimensions of economic relations across countries.",
        "The markets seemed to have begun to internalize this dynamic as a more permanent element of reality, but at the same time had raised their wagers for an expansionary response by the monetary authorities.",
        "The words of the latter seemed to validate those expectations, but the most expected deeds of monetary policy were yet to be materialized.",
        "Just as it had been argued in the Monetary Policy Report, the complex external scenario was already having an impact on Chile, with opposing effects on exports and capital inflows, while the copper price had remained fairly stable.",
        "It was also said that, although some of the drop in Chile’s valued exports could be blamed on the trade war—which was possibly being reflected in lower prices of several of the country’s main export items—the worsened economic performance of our main Latin American trading partners was also playing a part.",
        "All the Board members agreed that, as the downward risks in the local economy and particularly in inflation had intensified, the valid options for this Meeting should be to either hold the MPR at 2.5% with an expansionary bias, or reduce it by 25 bp, also with an expansionary bias.",
        "Several Board members agreed that, in order to opt for one or the other, a rigorous analysis was necessary of the inflationary risks posed by the economy’s current and expected dynamic, in order to assess what its true impact would be on this variable in the policy horizon.",
        "They agreed that, while the more qualitative information was enough to raise a warning sign in this regard, they would not necessarily suffice to compensate for the lack of more recent hard data and updated projections.",
        "Given that at the previous Meeting it had been decided to make an important, surprise cut in the MPR, several Board members agreed that updating the macroeconomic scenario was particularly relevant to extract the implications for monetary policy.",
        "This was so because the monetary policy would not be exhausted by an immediate adjustment of the rate, but by defining the trajectory of which this possible change was part.",
        "In other words, adjusting again the rate based on partial and qualitative background could increase, rather than reduce, uncertainty in the economy if it was not clear how much the macro projections had changed and how deep and persistent the additional monetary stimulus was intended to be.",
        "One Board member noted that, although the most profound analysis of the state of the macroeconomy was carried out in the Meetings that coincided with the preparation of the monetary policy reports, this did not imply that in Meetings like this one, where that was not the case, no changes in the orientation of monetary policy could be adopted.",
        "He added that this could occur when acting in line with a predefined bias, when powerful evidence of a change in the macro scenario arose, or when an intermediate update of projections was made in response to a significant set of antecedents.",
        "In addition, he agreed on the difficulties in forecasting or estimating the size of the additional monetary stimulus that would be required without a more detailed analysis of the mediumterm impacts of the latest news.",
        "However, in his opinion, it was possible to think that this increase in momentum should not be less than that which at that date was incorporated in the prices of financial assets, which was, give or take, a reduction of 50 basis points off the MPR for a relatively long period of time.",
        "One Board member felt that there were sufficient antecedents that made it necessary to lower the MPR by 25 bp, as it was clear that the 50-bp reduction of the last Meeting had not been enough to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "In particular, activity and demand data showed lessthan-expected growth for the next few quarters; inflation was still low and had surprised with lower numbers in a large group of services; plus the external scenario was uncertain, and steadily weakening.",
        "Furthermore, the evolution of the exchange rate and inflation expectations also contributed to postponing the convergence of inflation.",
        "He added that the market anticipated this assessment, as asset prices showed that the MPR would be reduced by 25 basis points in September, with a high probability of a second cut toward the end of the year.",
        "In addition, expectations surveys also showed reductions.",
        "Finally, he believed that the fact that now there were eight instead of twelve meetings every year, increased the costs of delaying the monetary policy decisions.",
        "In contrast, some Board members considered that the information at hand did not yet allow validating a change in the macro scenario that would justify an MPR cut at this Meeting.",
        "One Board member added that, if indeed it was a scenario of greater slack and less dynamism of consumption, a greater monetary stimulus would be required.",
        "But if consumption remained dynamic, beyond the adjustment in the automobile market, which was something anticipated and desirable, it was possible for inflation to resume its convergence trajectory as the effects of the greater monetary stimulus adopted in the previous Meeting, so a new MPR reduction would be unnecessary.",
        "He concluded by noting that the cost of making mistakes in this sense could be high, since it would imply that within a few months a much more steep path of future rates would have to be communicated.",
        "Conversely, waiting a little longer to gather information and validate a scenario of wider gaps than those already anticipated in the last Report was less costly, precisely because the MPR had already been reduced by 50 bp a month ago.",
        "The Board discussed the communicational considerations that a potential 25-bp reduction of the MPR would have, given that it was not the option most expected by the market.",
        "One Board member pointed out that it was important to keep in mind the existence of a trade-off between the effectiveness of the decision and the communication noise that a surprise would cause, which had already been present when it was decided to lower the MPR at the June Meeting.",
        "In his opinion, the greatest argument in favor of reducing MPR at this Meeting was its effectiveness, because any future movement committed entailed some degree of conditionality that would be difficult to leave.",
        "This time around, however, the decision of the previous month reduced the need to make a quick move.",
        "Meanwhile, the possible negative readings that a MPR cut at this Meeting could open also had to be considered, especially if it was interpreted as a worsening in the Bank’s vision of growth.",
        "This, because although there was reason enough to think that the growth projection would be revised going forward, this derived in part from specific factors and it was still unclear how capable the economy was to resume a growth pace that would allow it to close the gap.",
        "One Board member argued that the communicational risks of a potential 25-bp reduction were minor.",
        "On the one hand, it could be argued that the Board did not want to surprise the market again, after having done so at the previous Meeting.",
        "In his opinion, both situations were very different.",
        "At the last Meeting, not practically nobody, but downright nobody, remotely considered the possibility that the Board would lower the MPR, neither in magnitude nor in timing, like it did.",
        "On this occasion, the scenario was very different.",
        "The market considered reductions that did not exist at the time of the June Monetary Policy Report and the difference between a reduction now and one in September was negligible thanks to the practically unanimous expectations that the MPR would be reduced.",
        "He added that the concern for a more negative reading of the macro was not so obvious, and that the space granted by the Meeting Statement was sufficient to convey the changes that were being observed.",
        "In his opinion, it was not necessary to have a full Report to justify a movement of 25 basis points in the MPR, especially now that the market was already anticipating movements of that magnitude for the coming months.",
        "All five Board members agreed that the information accumulated since the publication of the last Report had increased the risks about the timely convergence of inflation to the target within the policy horizon, particularly due to the lower services inflation figures, whose persistence was high compared with other CPI components and the risks surrounding the future evolution of activity and demand, in a context of a highly uncertain external scenario.",
        "Governor Mario Marcel, Vice-Governor Joaquín Vial, and Board members Rosanna Costa and Alberto Naudon voted for keeping the policy rate at 2.5%, with an expansionary bias.",
        "In their view, after considering the costs and benefits of the two options it was the most appropriate.",
        "In particular, they contrasted a relatively limited benefit of lowering the MPR on this occasion, given the adjustment already made the previous month and the fact that market expectations already incorporated an adjustment in September.",
        "In contrast, they assigned greater relevance to the costs that could involve a decision that was not backed by a sufficient analysis and projections.",
        "One Board member added that his decision was reinforced because of existing doubts regarding the need to increase the monetary stimulus and its possible magnitude.",
        "One Board member said he thought it necessary to increase the monetary stimulus; however, he was inclined to hold the rate considering the communicational risks entailed by a reduction now.",
        "Board member Pablo García voted for cutting 25 basis points off the MPR, to 2.25%, as he believed that what should prevail in monetary policy decisions in general were the macroeconomic fundamentals, which, in his opinion, suggested that the previous cut had not been enough because activity and demand indicators showed less-than-expected growth for the next few quarters; inflation was still low and had surprised with lower numbers in a large group of services; plus the external scenario was gradually weakening.",
        "In this occasion, he estimated that communicational or tactical considerations did not warrant putting it off.",
        "The information submitted to the Board and the analysis thereof are contained in the March Monetary Policy Report.",
        "Its contents show that, in line with forecasts, domestic economic activity recovered its growth pace after taking a pause in the third quarter of 2018.",
        "Activity’s performance was being driven by investment.",
        "On the external scenario, it was noted that growth in the main economies had decelerated faster than expected, leading their authorities to implement further economic stimulus measures.",
        "The Report noted that the main difference with respect to December’s baseline scenario was due to domestic inflation.",
        "Measured by the new benchmark CPI calculated by the INE, inflation was significantly below the forecast.",
        "In a context in which activity and demand had been in line with projections, the lower inflation figure was consistent with a lower peso depreciation pass-through coefficient; favorable supply factors in some sectors and greater than expected gaps in the labor market resulting from massive immigration.",
        "In this context, the convergence of inflation to the target would occur later than foreseen in December, so the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus would take longer than had been announced by the Board.",
        "Regarding the external scenario, it was mentioned that the risks of a drastic correction of asset prices had not vanished, despite announcements of several countries’ economic authorities.",
        "It was said that, in fact, in recent days greater volatility had been observed and pressures had increased on those economies perceived as the weaker ones.",
        "It was also noted that, although a mild revision to world growth could be good news for emerging economies, as it would imply that the main central banks would adopt more expansionary monetary policies, probably the effect of the interest rate decrease would be lower than in other circumstances.",
        "However, the deflationary effects of potential appreciations of their currencies would still be present and strong.",
        "Summing up, although more benign scenarios could not be ruled out, a negative bias continued to predominate in the evolution of the external scenario.",
        "Also in discussing the risks from abroad, it was said that one of the most important issues had to do with the reaction of emerging economies to a persistent strengthening of the dollar, while, at the same time, Europe, China and world trade were gradually weakening.",
        "It was mentioned that, unlike 2008, when the nature of the cyclical deceleration and its potential propagation and risks were quite evident, this time around the cyclical weakening had many origins and it was difficult to identify the fundamental forces that were governing it.",
        "Among them, the cycle’s maturing process, which had taken quite long; political pressures in different places; the risk of a trade war; and financial stress.",
        "Figuring out the relative importance of each element was essential to gauge the effect of the external cycle on the Chilean economy.",
        "On the domestic front, the annual national accounts had confirmed the direction and magnitude of the evolution of activity and demand during 2018.",
        "In the profile of activity during the year, a somewhat stronger-than-expected fourth quarter had been observed, confirming the transitory nature of previous quarter’s slowdown.",
        "This was reinforced by the upward trajectory of investment during the year and consumption a little above forecasts.",
        "It was pointed out that the fact of consumption growing in tandem with GDP was consistent with the Bank’s analysis of the labor market, which drew attention to how the economy had absorbed a significant immigrant flow.",
        "It was noted as well that the magnitudes of this flow had also been confirmed by the population projections published by the INE last December.",
        "The implications of a possible combination of negative shocks from abroad with positive supply-side shocks at home associated with immigration and its labor market effects were discussed.",
        "On one hand, the effects on activity and employment would possibly tend to cancel out but, on the other hand, both scenarios implied lower inflation in the policy horizon.",
        "For the same reason, at least for now, more attention should be paid to inflation than to the activity gap.",
        "In that sense, a potential risk of inflation being below target for a very long time due to the intensification of these two scenarios was a possibility that should be evaluated in future Reports.",
        "All five Board members agreed that the background analysis of the last Monetary Policy Report confirmed that it would be prudent to postpone the withdrawal of the monetary impulse.",
        "In particular, because inflation estimated with the new CPI was clearly lower than expected—which, among other things, had to do with the apparently bigger gaps due to the aforementioned supply shocks—and its convergence to 3% would take almost a year longer than thought in December.",
        "Moreover, there was uncertainty surrounding the structural parameters, such as potential growth and the neutral interest rate, something that would be resolved in the June Report.",
        "All the Board members agreed that everything suggested that in the medium term it would be necessary to normalize the MPR and take it to its neutral level.",
        "However, in the short term the main concern was to understand the present level of inflation and what it meant for its future trajectory.",
        "They all considered it difficult to justify a different option—in either direction— than holding the MPR flat at this Meeting.",
        "In particular, because as was also noted in the March Report, this pause in the monetary withdrawal needed to last for several meetings before resuming its path of normalization toward the neutral MPR.",
        "There was consensus among the Board members that the option to not change the MPR was the natural one and it was consistent with inflation converging to the target over the policy horizon.",
        "Moreover, it adapted better to the risk scenarios analyzed.",
        "It was also agreed that not changing the MPR was proof of the coherence between the Bank’s actions and communications, especially in that the monetary stimulus would be withdrawn gradually and cautiously.",
        "Actually, this caution was evident in the postponement of the normalization process, in light of new elements in the evolution of inflation and the interpretation of its fundamentals.",
        "The Board decided, with the votes of Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Costa and Naudon, to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3%."

    "2021": [
        "The background information for this Meeting was contained in the September Monetary Policy Report to be published the morning after this Meeting.",
        "The Report noted that the Chilean economy had made a rapid recovery from the recession caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, which had far exceeded expectations.",
        "This recovery had been made possible by the adaptive capacity of businesses and individuals and the great progress made in the vaccination campaign, which had contributed to a significant process of opening up.",
        "All this had been underpinned by the large deployment of policy measures, as well as by the international environment marked by the simultaneous action to contain the crisis, led by the central banks and other authorities of the world’s main economies.",
        "The extension and persistence of some of the local measures, combined with a higher propensity of households to consume the resources received, had had an impact on private spending that exceeded all forecasts.",
        "In a context in which supply had not yet fully recovered, this had significantly changed the assessment of inflationary pressures facing the economy, reflected in an increase in inflation and its outlook for the near future.",
        "The depreciation of the peso also contributed to this, caused in part by the perception of a worsening of the economy’s fundamentals as a result of the liquidation of long-term savings through the successive massive withdrawals of pension savings and the deterioration of the fiscal accounts, all in an environment of high local uncertainty.",
        "Thus, interest rates, risk premiums and stock prices showed an unfavorable performance when compared to their external counterparts.",
        "The need to avoid the accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances which, among other consequences, could lead to a more persistent increase in inflation beyond the two-year 3% target, led the Board to modify the monetary policy stance.",
        "The rapid evolution of the macroeconomic scenario, inflation expectations and sensitivity scenarios associated with higher price pressures, set the stage for the Central Bank to act promptly to ensure the convergence of inflation.",
        "Regarding the external scenario, it was agreed that it offered no major novelties in its evolution.",
        "On the one hand, the gaps in the speed of exit of developed economies with respect to emerging economies in general had intensified.",
        "On the other, problems with logistics chains persisted and inflation tended to increase moderately in most countries, while commodity prices remained relatively high.",
        "The risks surrounding the evolution of inflation in the United States, and the reaction of the U.S. monetary policy, were still important.",
        "In contrast, there was consensus that the domestic scenario did offer significant changes.",
        "The extraordinary dynamism of consumption and a partial recovery of investment stood out.",
        "The former, which was being driven by successive liquidity injections to households, showed an expansion that went beyond projections, which led to an upward revision of the assumption of the marginal propensity to consume, in a context in which individuals had accumulated liquid resources in savings and demand accounts for some US$23 billion.",
        "If the increase in direct fiscal transfers was added to this, a scenario was configured in which the expansion of consumption was considerably greater than had been foreseen in the June MP Report.",
        "This was reflected in the upward revision to the growth projection for 2021, which, despite its magnitude, was not enough to absorb the full expansion of domestic demand and yielded the way for the current account to move from a surplus of 1.5% of GDP in 2020 to a deficit of slightly more than 2% of GDP in 2021.",
        "All this, despite the strong improvement in the terms of trade during this period.",
        "About the labor market, there was agreement that the available data —including the results of the INE survey for the May-July 2021 quarter published on the day of the Meeting— also pointed to an improvement, although gaps remained to be closed.",
        "Salaried employment had made an almost full comeback and selfemployment had recovered partially.",
        "However, participation rates and average hours worked remained below trend, while a significant portion of the female population was out of the labor force.",
        "Vacancies had increased, but companies reported difficulties in filling them, especially in the case of lower-skilled jobs.",
        "Wages had risen in real terms at a pace that was consistent with a tighter labor market.",
        "It was noted that this scenario entailed a significant change in the assessment of the activity gap — whose estimate for the second half of this year went from being slightly positive in the June Report to being strongly so in the new Report—, which boosted inflationary pressures.",
        "These pressures had also increased by the rise in international inflation and the idiosyncratic depreciation of the peso.",
        "It was pointed out that, under normal circumstances, a rapid recovery such as the one observed in Chile, in a context of strong copper price increases, would have resulted in a strong appreciation of the peso and not in the substantial depreciation that was the case.",
        "This was even more evident when considering that it was occurring amid massive liquidations of investments abroad, by both the Treasury and the pension funds.",
        "Not only had this not occurred, but there had been a significant depreciation of the local currency with respect to the dollar and other comparable currencies.",
        "This could only be explained by significant increases in the perception of local risk and greater uncertainty regarding the future.",
        "Moreover, this type of exchange rate movement showed above-average passthrough and persistence on inflation, given the idiosyncratic nature of the shock.",
        "There was agreement that this scenario was already affecting inflation.",
        "In fact, headline and core inflation had risen faster than expected, and some expectations indicators two years ahead already exceeded the 3% target.",
        "The Board agreed that, as the worst of the pandemic was being left behind, it was also reasonable that the measures deployed to deal with this difficult situation should be phased out.",
        "There was no doubt that these actions had contributed decisively to limiting the economic consequences of the pandemic, but it was also evident that their continuation beyond necessary was generating macroeconomic problems and imbalances that needed to be avoided.",
        "The main question was the speed at which these measures should be withdrawn.",
        "The Board agreed that, up until the previous meeting, the overall background was consistent with a gradual and partial reduction of the monetary impulse, which involved keeping the MPR below its neutral level for an extended period.",
        "However, the latest information known since then had prompted a change in this assessment.",
        "In particular, a scenario where inflationary pressures were stronger given the extraordinary dynamism of consumption — derived both from the extension and greater impact that the stimulus measures were having on it— and the idiosyncratic depreciation of the peso, and where the sensitivity scenarios associated with greater pressures on prices were somewhat more likely to occur.",
        "Consistent with this assessment, and because the starting point was exceptionally low for the MPR, the Board concurred that it was necessary to implement a rapid adjustment of the monetary impulse that would bring the policy rate close to its neutral value by the middle of the first half of 2022.",
        "Considering the frequency of the monetary policy meetings under the rules in place since 2018, this translated into the MPR needing to be raised by between 50 and 75 basis points (bp) over several meetings, making them the plausible options for this occasion.",
        "Several Board members noted that the option of a 75bp rise was the one that best suited the scenario being faced.",
        "In particular, considering that the stimulus measures weighing on the economy were already very significant, that their impact was being greater than anticipated and that such measures had also increased in magnitude.",
        "All this gave rise to a scenario where the convergence of inflation to the target was close to the policy horizon and where upside risk scenarios dominated.",
        "In addition, the current monetary stimulus did not fit easily with an economy that was growing at double-digit rates and had already closed the activity gap, despite some sectors still lagging behind.",
        "In short, this option was the most appropriate if the aim was to anticipate the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus and to gain room in the face of sensitive scenarios of higher inflation.",
        "Several Board members agreed that the 50bp hike option had the advantage of being the one expected by the market consensus and, therefore, would not come as a surprise.",
        "They also noted that surprising with a higher-than-expected hike could have merit in terms of its impact on inflation expectations but could also come at a cost in terms of a less favorable response from other agents.",
        "One Board member recalled that in the last two years the economy had been strongly affected by surprises of various kinds, which had stressed the adaptive capacity of economic agents.",
        "Furthermore, the political-legislative climate had become very tense.",
        "In these circumstances, it was added, the cost of an unexpected decision by the Central Bank could be counterproductive to the objectives pursued.",
        "Several Board members pointed out that, while the decision of a 75bp hike might surprise the market, it was totally consistent with a scenario where inflation and projected growth were also higher than what the average analyst assumed.",
        "In addition, such a choice had the advantage of supporting a more effective communication regarding a rate path that ran clearly above what the market was considering at the time.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial, and Board members García, Naudon, and Costa voted for raising the monetary policy interest rate by 75 basis points, to 1.5%.",
        "Once again, activity had been higher than expected.",
        "In particular, in May the Imacec was back at its prepandemic level, up 18.1% annually.",
        "In seasonally adjusted terms, it had risen 2.6% over its April value, showing growth in most economic sectors.",
        "Trade stood out as the fastest growing one (51.3% annually; 13.4% monthly, deseasonalized), as a result of highly dynamic consumption, still boosted by the massive fiscal transfers —which had far exceeded plans of the beginning of the year— and the withdrawals of pension savings.",
        "Increases in demand were observed in all types of consumer goods, which in May was reflected in the strong monthly increase in the Retail Trade Activity Index and the Supermarket Sales Index (controlling for seasonality and at constant prices).",
        "Consumer expectations (IPEC) had improved from the previous Meeting, but were still in pessimistic territory.",
        "As for investments, capital goods imports remained dynamic and business confidence (IMCE) was still on the optimistic side.",
        "Other indicators, however, were less favorable, such as the low number of new building projects in the pipeline, the evolution of stock markets, and levels of uncertainty that were still high by the usual standards.",
        "The information gathered up to the time of the Meeting in the context of the Business Perceptions Report (IPN) also indicated that activity had increased, which also resulted in a more positive outlook for 2021.",
        "This was associated with the increased household liquidity and the gradual reopening of the economy.",
        "The latter had immediately reflected in more cash flow in personal services firms, which in some cases had reached pre-pandemic levels.",
        "However, various sources of uncertainty continued to be reported, where those related to the presidential elections and the constituent process had taken on greater relevance.",
        "The pandemic continued to be a source of concern, but with somewhat reduced intensity.",
        "Government projections presented in the second-quarter’s Public Finance Report confirmed the prospect of a significant fiscal impulse during 2021, with projected real fiscal expenditure growth of 27.3% (9.2% in the previous issue) and projected effective and structural fiscal deficits of 7.1% and 9.5% of GDP, respectively, ranking among the biggest among OECD economies.",
        "Private expectations for this year’s GDP growth had improved further thanks to better effective data for activity and demand, significant progress in the national vaccination campaign and in the re-opening of the economy, among other factors.",
        "Accordingly, the median of the July Economic Expectations Survey foresaw GDP growth in 2021 at 8.0% (7.0% in June).",
        "The labor market continued to be influenced by a number of opposing forces.",
        "On the one hand, INE data showed the unemployment rate at around 10%, high inactivity —which had even risen in May— and employment affected in all its categories.",
        "On the other, the data on pension-fund contributors showed that formal salaried employment had made a full recovery.",
        "In addition, the Internet Job Postings Index was at its highest of the last five years, the annual variation of real wages was close to its 2019 values and employment expectations (IMCE) were in optimistic territory.",
        "On the other hand, the partial information gathered for the August IPN indicated that the difficulties in hiring labor had been accentuated in a greater number of economic sectors and had translated into wage increases in several cases.",
        "Most of those interviewed linked this to the income-support measures, an increase in informal work, people’s fear of getting infected, and the closure of international borders.",
        "In the local financial system, interest rates in the fixed-income market had seen further increases since the previous Meeting, which had been influenced by different idiosyncratic elements.",
        "The two-year nominal rates spike of nearly 110 basis points (bp) stood out, explained by factors such as the change in the economic and monetary policy outlook, especially after the publication of the June Meeting minutes.",
        "The recent operations of the Finance Ministry had affected performance of longer bonds.",
        "The BCP10 had shown high volatility in the period, widening the divergence with its external peers (+35bp differential with respect to the U.S.) Meanwhile, the peso had depreciated, to its peak so far this year, coinciding with the fall in copper prices and the global strengthening of the dollar.",
        "The IPSA accumulated slim gains and the sovereign risk premium (CDS) showed some decline.",
        "In the money market, the banks’ abundant liquidity in dollars kept the local cost of dollar financing contained.",
        "In pesos, this cost had risen, influenced by adjustments in monetary policy expectations.",
        "Regarding bank credit, the commercial segment had sustained positive credit flows in recent months, in a context of continuous rescheduling, refinancing and amortizations, in the midst of special liquidity and guarantee programs.",
        "Fogape-Reactiva loans showed a rather stable recent performance, while nonFogape loans had increased flows, which were focused on smaller firms.",
        "Likewise, the commercial portfolio maintained negative annual growth rates (–4.5% real annual growth in June), relating to the high comparison base left by the Fogape-Covid lines granted during 2020.",
        "Consumer loans had continued to reduce their annual contraction (–14.6% real annual contraction in June), in response to abundant household liquidity, and flows in the mortgage portfolio were stable in the margin.",
        "Meanwhile, interest rates showed more limited variations, and remained low across all portfolios, and delinquency rates for the overall system remained well contained.",
        "In the Bank Credit Survey (ECB) for the second quarter, the lower demand by companies for both working capital and investment was worth noting, amidst somewhat tighter lending conditions, due, among other reasons, to a sense of a deteriorating economic environment or greater debtor risk.",
        "This was complemented by information gathered for the IPN, which revealed that most of the firms interviewed thus far had not requested new loans due to improved cash flows or out of caution given the various sources of prevailing uncertainty.",
        "Those that had taken out loans reported tighter requirements, especially in areas such as tourism and construction.",
        "As for households, the Bank Lending Survey noted that supply remained flexible, while demand was dynamic in the consumer portfolio and weaker in the mortgage portfolio.",
        "The latter was partly linked to higher interest rates in the segment, a phenomenon that had also been mentioned in the IPN.",
        "Headline inflation had risen to 3.8% annually as of June, which was mainly due to the evolution of fuel prices in recent months, because of both their increase and the low comparison base left by the same period of 2020.",
        "In contrast, food prices had been reducing their contribution to total inflation.",
        "The annual variation of the core component —the CPI without volatiles— was comparatively lower and remained somewhat above 3% annually.",
        "In this sense, some services stood out, which could have been affected by the extension of quarantines, lagged openings and/or because part of them continued to be imputed.",
        "On the cost side, qualitative indicators —the IMCE and partial results of the August IPN interviews— showed greater pressures, which coupled with the acceleration in nominal wage growth.",
        "About market expectations, although the June figure was lower than the consensus forecast, expected inflation for December 2021 and for the twelve-month term had risen after the previous Meeting.",
        "In the two-year term, surveys continued to place it at around 3% annually.",
        "In this context, expectations for the monetary policy rate (MPR) contained in the Financial Traders Survey and financial asset prices pointed to a +25bp adjustment in the July Meeting, which in the Economic Expectations Survey was foreseen in September.",
        "The one-year-ahead MPR forecast by these indicators ranged from 1.5% to 2.5%, and two years ahead, from 2.5% to 3.75%.",
        "Incoming international data showed a continuing recovery, consolidating the outlook for this year.",
        "This had been especially noticeable in countries displaying a more controlled epidemiological situation, either due to the effectiveness of their sanitary containment measures or to the progress of their vaccination programs, which had allowed them to proceed with their reopening plans.",
        "Thus, the business outlook (PMI) in developed economies had remained optimistic, and the upturn in services in the Eurozone was particularly noteworthy.",
        "The consumer and business confidence indicators endorsed this scenario, standing in highly favorable territory.",
        "Meanwhile, many emerging economies continued to lag, while the spread of new strains of Covid-19 emerged as a new risk factor.",
        "In Latin America, in spite of the fact that short-term indicators had generally surprised on the downside, the outlook for 2021 was still better than a few months ago due to the positive surprises accumulated during the first quarter.",
        "The behavior of external financial markets had been influenced, among other factors, by recent epidemiological developments, surprises in the confirmed data of the main economies and the outlook for monetary policy in the U.S.",
        "Since the previous Meeting, the dollar had appreciated against all other currencies and the stock markets showed mixed results, and important new highs had been achieved by some stock market indicators in the U.S.",
        "Long-term interest rates, in general, accumulated limited decreases, although increases were observed in certain countries of the emerging bloc —especially in Latin America—, which continued to receive capital inflows.",
        "All this occurred in a context in which cost pressures continued to be present, linked to the difficulties in the supply of goods, soaring transportation costs and/or the high prices of inputs and commodities.",
        "In any case, the latter had decreased at the margin, except for oil, whose price continued on an upward trend (+8.1% for the WTI-Brent average since the previous Meeting).",
        "This was partly explained by the difficulties in OPEC+ to reach an agreement on the increase in production quotas.",
        "Meanwhile, there were recent falls in the prices of some metals, with copper at around US$4.3 per pound (–6.3% with respect to the previous Meeting).",
        "The decline in these prices had been influenced to some extent by China’s announced sale of part of its metal reserves in order to curb price increases.",
        "Some monetary authorities, particularly the Federal Reserve, had described these pressures as transitory, which had mitigated concerns about recent higher inflationary records and the movements in financial markets following its latest Meeting.",
        "At the same time, several central banks had announced or begun to implement their respective monetary policy normalization processes, especially in commodity-exporting economies.",
        "It was agreed that, in essence, the external and local scenarios had evolved in line with projections in the June MP Report.",
        "On the external front, the progress in vaccinations in the world’s main economies stood out, as it had allowed to gradually overcome the recession.",
        "Another important development was the greater concern about inflation, which continued to be a latent threat, especially in the United States, but about which the market still had a rather benign view, seeing it as a transitory phenomenon.",
        "Finally, a noteworthy fact was that global financial markets continued to be very constructive, although for Latin America, including Chile, they seemed to be gradually worsening.",
        "On the domestic front, there was a new upward surprise in activity and dynamic consumption that contrasted with investment which, beyond some improvements, was still sluggish and there was concern about its future performance.",
        "Inflation, in turn, was somewhat lower than expected, but not by much.",
        "The mixed signals coming from the labor market were also discussed.",
        "On the one hand, according to surveys, in the aggregate there were lags in the recovery of employment, a significant loss in labor participation and high unemployment.",
        "On the other hand, according to administrative data, formal salaried employment had made a full comeback, with an increase in vacancies and, according to the CNSI for the first quarter, the wage bill had recovered.",
        "There was also a feeling that people remained cautious about taking a job —particularly no salaried—, because of the risk of being infected, the difficulties for women to reincorporate to the labor market while their children did not return to school, and the presence of income transfer programs for families.",
        "This was reasonably consistent with the difficulties in finding workers in certain sectors reported in the preliminary background information leading to the Business Perceptions Report.",
        "Emphasis was placed on the persistence of uncertainty prevailing in the country and its effect on the financial market.",
        "On this point, it was pointed out that the decoupling from external markets that had already been reported at the previous Meeting continued, with long-term interest rates showing greater volatility and new increases, an exchange rate that was partially more depreciated than could be justified by the copper price and the global behavior of the dollar, and a stock market that continued to lag behind the global benchmarks.",
        "In the case of shorter rates, significant increases were observed, although mostly linked to the improved macroeconomic outlook and expectations of a faster withdrawal of the monetary impulse.",
        "Overall, however, the general assessment was that these developments had not translated into tighter local financial conditions.",
        "In fact, the annual variation of commercial credit was still very much affected by a very high base of comparison, and the qualitative background —Bank Lending Survey and Business Perceptions Report— drew attention to the weakness of demand for credit.",
        "On this last point, abundant liquidity seemed to be playing an important role.",
        "All the Board Members agreed that the information gathered since the previous Meeting reaffirmed the need to gradually reduce the high degree of expansionary monetary policy.",
        "They also agreed that, to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target, it would be necessary to continue stimulating the economy for a long time, although with a lesser intensity than the current one.",
        "This, because pockets of weakness still persisted in some sectors and a significant degree of uncertainty, to which was added the considerable fiscal consolidation assumed for 2022.",
        "In this context, the Board evaluated two options: keep the MPR at 0.5% or increase it by 25 basis points, up to 0.75%.",
        "All the five Board members agreed that an increase of 25 basis points in the MPR was sufficiently robust to the different scenarios that had been analyzed for the economy and, therefore, made it the best option.",
        "In fact, it was the dominant alternative for an economy showing a rate of recovery consistent with closing the activity gap faster than anticipated, but also with lower growth prospects for the medium term.",
        "Increasing the MPR by 25 basis points was also consistent with signals previously delivered and internalized by the market.",
        "Regarding the option to keep the MPR at 0.5%, this could be considered to the extent that it was estimated that the probability of the materialization of less favorable scenarios was still high; however, that probability had decreased given the evolution of the economy.",
        "The Board considered it relevant to reaffirm that, as usual, future adjustments to the MPR would depend on the evaluation made at each Meeting regarding the behavior of the economy.",
        "The signals obtained so far made the scenarios that marked the limits of the interest rate corridor of the June Report unlikely.",
        "In fact, several Board members highlighted that at the time of the Meeting, market prices had tended to internalize a process of monetary policy adjustment faster than was considered appropriate given the central scenario of the June Report.",
        "In this context, all the Board members agreed that medium-term risks and the need to understand more precisely the state of the labor market and the evolution of credit, made it convenient for the pace of monetary policy adjustment to be gradual.",
        "This, it was concluded, was fully consistent with the idea that, even in a context of gradual normalization, monetary policy would continue to accompany the recovery of the economy, anticipating that the MPR would be below its neutral value throughout the complete policy horizon of two years.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Naudon, and Costa voted for raising the MPR by 25 basis points, to 0.75%.",
        "Background information for this Meeting was contained in the March Monetary Policy Report, to be released the following day.",
        "This Report noted that the Chilean economy had been advancing steadily in its recovery process after the massive shock caused by the pandemic.",
        "The year 2020 had ended with greater dynamism than had been foreseen in December, reflecting the better adaptation of firms and households and the support of a substantial monetary and fiscal impulse.",
        "Thus, although in the immediate future a setback in local activity was projected due to the tightening of sanitary measures, the outlook for 2021 had strengthened, supported also by the sustained progress of the vaccination campaign, the greater impulse from abroad, and ongoing expansionary policies.",
        "However, the indicators showed that there were still significant risks latent associated with such an unprecedented shock.",
        "On the one hand, there was the still complex epidemiological evolution, which added uncertainty to the timing and manner in which sanitary restrictions would be eased.",
        "On the other hand, the recovery continued to be heterogeneous, with significant lags in the sectors most intensive in social interaction, which partially explained the important gaps that persisted in the labor market.",
        "At the global level, the correct calibration of monetary and fiscal stimuli in terms of their size, scope and permanence emerged as key, so as to strengthen the recovery without generating macro-financial imbalances.",
        "Equally important were the scars that the pandemic would inflict on households and businesses—including the deterioration of their net worth—and its impact on the future dynamism of the economy.",
        "It was noted that the macroeconomic scenario, in general, presented a better aspect compared with late last year.",
        "Several economies, Chile included, were recovering faster than had been foreseen early in the year and their outlooks for 2021 had improved.",
        "All this configured a global scenario that would provide greater impetus, with faster growth of our trading partners and better terms of trade.",
        "In addition, especially in the case of Chile, there was the progress of the vaccination process, which was expected to lead to a significant reduction in sanitary restrictions in the second half of the year.",
        "In any case, there was agreement that, despite the positive news, the evolution of activity would be negative in the immediate future, due to the tightening of sanitary measures.",
        "Although these effects were expected to be milder than those observed in the early stages of the pandemic, and probably more transitory, they would nonetheless delay the economy’s recovery process.",
        "For all of the above reasons, the unfolding of the sanitary situation going forward was a critical element in the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario.",
        "Moreover, while the recovery continued to be very heterogeneous across sectors, job creation had slowed down and continued to lag significantly behind economic activity.",
        "It was remarked that, although projections for 2021 were improving, the scenario was still surrounded by significant risks.",
        "One was the heterogeneity of both the effects of the crisis and the recovery process.",
        "Whether at the level of countries, economic sectors and/or socioeconomic groups, there were considerable differences in the way the pandemic had impacted their economic situation, which posed challenges as to how to manage the level of monetary and fiscal stimuli without generating imbalances that would put the economy at risk.",
        "Doubts concerning the severity of the scars the pandemic would leave were also an element that could condition the measures’ fine-tuning.",
        "Finally, the risks associated with the rise in long-term interest rates in Chile and elsewhere were discussed.",
        "Although these risks were linked to the perception of an improved economic scenario and, therefore, were not in themselves cause for concern, the possibility of abrupt movements in long rates continued to be a latent risk, particularly due to market questionings about the fiscal and monetary policy mix in the United States.",
        "All the Board members present agreed that, while prospects for the economy had improved, for inflation to converge to the target over the policy horizon, monetary policy needed to remain highly expansionary.",
        "They also agreed that the range of risks was significant, and close attention should continue to be paid to the evolution of both sanitary conditions and the economy’s recovery.",
        "In this context, there was consensus that everything suggested that the MPR would be kept at its minimum level for several more quarters, which was consistent with the fact that most of the scenarios analyzed in the MP Report anticipated no increases in 2021.",
        "The Board agreed that, even after considering all the risks and uncertainties regarding the future evolution of the economy, the prevailing view was that the most complex part of the shock was being left behind.",
        "Therefore, the time was approaching when monetary policy would once again be implemented in the traditional way, where the momentum was determined by the level of the MPR and the orientation that the Board provided on it.",
        "The Board deemed it important to clarify that returning to traditional monetary policy making did not require the extraordinary measures taken during the pandemic to be extinguished beforehand.",
        "In the past year, conventional measures—such as lowering the MPR to its 0.5% minimum—as well as unconventional ones—such as the FCIC and the bond purchase program—had been adopted.",
        "The latter had already been defined in terms of their amount and duration and, barring any changes, would be extinguished with the passing of time.",
        "This, in any case, was no obstacle for the Bank to make every adjustment it considered necessary to accommodate the end of these measures as their duration expired.",
        "Governor Marcel and Board members García, Naudon and Costa voted in favor of holding the MPR at 0.5%.",
        "In addition, they agreed to effect not changes to the unconventional liquidity and credit support measures in place.",
        "On the domestic front, November’s Imacec was giving signs of a steady recovery of activity, advancing in the economy’s gradual reactivation process.",
        "In annual terms, growth had achieved 0.3% and the seasonally-adjusted series had risen 1.1% with respect to the month before.",
        "Disparities across sectors remained, with services lagging the most.",
        "Despite having grown month on month, services continued to be severely affected by the sanitary constraints.",
        "Mining activity had declined from the previous month and year.",
        "The sectors with the best relative performance were manufacturing and trade, the latter maintaining its high dynamism resulting from the pension fund withdrawals and fiscal transfers.",
        "Accordingly, the levels of retail activity and vehicle sales (ANAC) were high, while inventories, as reflected in the underlying trade index, had been significantly reduced.",
        "However, the recovery of consumer imports had the potential to mend part of the latter in the short term.",
        "On the investment side, home sales and capital goods imports were indicative of some reactivation.",
        "The labor market showed some recovery from mid-year declines; however, the gaps that had been generated by the pandemic were still significant.",
        "Employment and hours worked continued to rise month on month.",
        "The IMCE’s vacancy job rate and hiring expectations reflected an increase in demand for employment, although supply continued to be tight, mainly for reasons related to Covid-19 or family duties.",
        "Meanwhile, business and consumer expectations reflected a limited impact from the increase in restrictions implemented in December.",
        "In this scenario, private expectations reported in January’s Economic Expectations Survey (EES) anticipated for 2021 an expansion of 5.0% in total GDP and 5.2% in non-mining GDP.",
        "Preliminary qualitative data derived from the February’s Business Perceptions Report showed some relapse in the latest performance of many businesses, after a significant rebound between the end of the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2020.",
        "The outlook for 2021 was subject to high uncertainty, owing particularly to the evolution of the sanitary situation and its implications for companies’ revenues, investments and staffing.",
        "Half of the respondents had expressed that they would invest in 2021 and a larger fraction had said that they would do so in 2022.",
        "The main constraints to their decisions had to do with the uncertainty of the sanitary situation, the evolution of demand and the political environment.",
        "Access to new credits was perceived as being restricted by the higher financial burden on companies, especially in the areas most affected by social distancing.",
        "In the labor market, stability continued to prevail, although there were new layoffs reported in some companies and reduced availability of lower-skilled labor.",
        "Meanwhile, costs had risen for a fraction of interviewees, who attributed this to factors such as shortage of inputs and/or products for sale.",
        "They also noted that they hadn’t always been able to pass on these increases to prices.",
        "Local financial markets, overall, had matched the more positive tone of their international peers.",
        "The selected stock index IPSA had accumulated even higher gains than some comparable economies’ indicators, and the peso had appreciated with respect to its year-before average.",
        "In the fixed-income market, interest rates had fallen at different maturities, especially at the longer terms, with the 10year BCP and BCU falling by 30 and 40 basis points (bp), respectively.",
        "Indexed instruments also recorded significant drops at shorter terms (-35bp at 2 years), affected by better prospects for domestic consumption.",
        "Regarding bank credit, commercial loans had continued to decline in real annual terms (2.9% in December; 4.4% in November), while activity linked to Fogape-Covid lines and the use of phase 2 of the Funding Facility Conditional on Increased Lending (FCIC 2) remained at moderate levels.",
        "This was coupled with a further contraction of consumer loans (-16.5% real annual rate in December) and relatively stable growth of the mortgage portfolio in recent months (5% real annual rate in December).",
        "Interest rates remained low for all lending categories.",
        "As for risk indicators (Financial Market Commission), on aggregate, the banking system’s delinquency rate remained contained, while the increase in provisions and the expected loss in the commercial segment stood out.",
        "The Bank Lending Survey (BLS) of the fourth quarter again reported a decline in companies’ credit demand for investment and working capital purposes, while the supply was tighter, especially for SMEs.",
        "This was consistent with the increased financial burden and risk perception at the corporate level, mainly in a context of a slower-than-expected recovery of the local economy.",
        "The authorities had responded by enacting the law that extended the uses of Fogape —Fogape Reactiva—, so as to adapt it to the new needs of the firms.",
        "As for households, the BLS revealed greater demand and softer lending standards at the margin.",
        "In addition, the qualitative information gathered in the last Business Perceptions Report confirmed the high levels of indebtedness of companies and their impact on access to credit, especially in businesses most intensive in human interaction.",
        "A fraction of the respondents reported difficulties to meet their financial obligations, and in some cases noted that they had to cut down on expenses as a strategy to be able to pay their debts.",
        "Headline inflation had ended the year 2020 at 3% annually, 3.3% for core inflation—CPI minus volatiles.",
        "December’s monthly rate (0.3%) had responded mainly to some high-demand goods that had continued to drive inflation in recent months, while services inflation was still weak.",
        "This scenario had been shaped amid low inventory levels, where replenishment was occurring gradually, and transportation costs ran high.",
        "This had been validated in the preliminary information gathered in February’s Business Perceptions Report, which reported shortage of some inputs and/or products for sale attributed to logistical issues, mainly the increased cost of maritime transportation, production problems and inventory depletion.",
        "At the medium term, inflationary pressures remained contained, as the gradual closing of the wide activity gap dominated.",
        "As for market expectations, one year out the EES showed they had risen to 3%, the same figure that the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) showed at the same horizon.",
        "Two years out, both the EES and the FTS remained at 3%.",
        "On the external front, the general outlook for 2021 presented no major changes with respect to the forecasts in the last Monetary Policy Report, combining a somewhat weaker short-term scenario —due to the evolution of contagions— with improving longer-term expectations thanks to progress in vaccine development and application.",
        "Household and business expectations were consistent with this scenario, showing a worse outlook for the short term and a better outlook going forward, which was also reflected in the market’s GDP growth expectations.",
        "The latter also showed the differences between the recovery process expected by developed and emerging economies, in which the speed of the vaccination process played an important role.",
        "External financial conditions remained favorable, in a context of monetary stimulus that would be kept in place for a long period of time, as had been stated by the authorities of various central banks.",
        "Plus, the announcements of new fiscal packages, particularly in the United States, which had driven stock market hikes globally, increases in long-term interest rates in developed economies, capital inflows to emerging economies and commodity price rises.",
        "Among these, it was worth noting the strong recovery of the oil price (close to 15% for the Brent-WTI average since the last Meeting) and the copper price climbing to US$3.6 per pound (a little more than 3% since the last Meeting).",
        "These increases were a response to the weakening of U.S. dollar, a more favorable outlook for demand and a somewhat weaker outlook for supply.",
        "There was consensus that the evolution of the economy, both globally and locally, had generally been in line with the forecasts in the last MP Report.",
        "Local activity had closed 2020 within projections, while inflation had slightly exceeded expectations for the end of the year.",
        "It was noted that the sanitary backdrop for these developments had been shaped by the combined effects of increased restrictions on mobility associated with soaring Covid-19 infections and concrete progress in vaccine production and application.",
        "Thus, the greater weakness in activity early in 2021 was offset by better prospects for the rest of the year.",
        "In this context, the financial markets reflected this heightened optimism, driving up stock markets, capital inflows to emerging economies and commodity prices.",
        "It was agreed that, despite everything, persistent risks and challenges remained on the horizon.",
        "One such challenge would be the capacity to implement a massive and efficient vaccination process, while following all sanitary measures, until the risks of contagion and its most severe impacts were well under control.",
        "In this context, a major challenge would be to maintain the impulse of monetary and fiscal policy, as well as the ability to safeguard financial stability, until the economy was able to achieve a self-sustained growth rate, reducing the gaps and frictions that still remained.",
        "It was highlighted that after months of weakness due to an unprecedented crisis, where the focus of concern had obviously been on the short term, it was now time to look more closely at the challenges posed by the medium term.",
        "Moreover, this debate was taking place in many places and, in practice, it could be understood as a shift from a damage control approach, which had largely focused on financial stability issues, to policies aimed at sustaining the economic recovery, while keeping inflation in line with the target.",
        "In any case, it was emphasized that this was not an imminent task, but it was important to bear in mind, because the usual timeline under which monetary policy operated was longer now, and several of the measures implemented had a quite extensive application horizon.",
        "The evolution of local inflation was also examined.",
        "There was agreement that its recent increase was explained mainly by short-term phenomena, adding that the projections for the coming months incorporated additional impacts from the rise in volatile prices, partially offset by the peso appreciation and the weaker performance of services.",
        "Into the medium term, inflation convergence would be achieved as the economy returned to trend growth, supported by external, fiscal, and monetary impulse, and as progress in sanitary control would allow lifting the supply restrictions, which would require maintaining a strong monetary stimulus.",
        "Although everything indicated that short-term factors did not necessarily imply medium-term trends, it would be important to monitor them in the coming months in order to properly calibrate the level of monetary stimulus and the instruments that the economy needed to consolidate its recovery.",
        "All five Board members agreed that, given the macroeconomic context caused by the pandemic, the monetary policy message should continue to emphasize that a high monetary impulse would be maintained for a prolonged period of time, in order to ensure the consolidation of the economic recovery and the achievement of the Bank’s objectives.",
        "This suggested that the MPR would be kept at its minimum level over most of the two-year monetary policy horizon, and that unconventional measures would remain in effect.",
        "All the Board members also agreed that the advances in the economic recovery process made it necessary to adjust financial conditions so that companies could meet the needs arising from this new stage of the business cycle.",
        "In particular, there was an agreement that the weaker demand and supply of commercial credit that had been observed in recent months reflected the fact that the simple availability of new credit for working capital would no longer be enough to meet the needs of companies.",
        "This was so because some of them need financing for investment or because others had accumulated obligations that they were unable to meet with the income flows they expect to have in the coming months.",
        "All the Board members noted that the Bank could play an important role by supplying the necessary liquidity for the financial system to generate the conditions for firms to successfully adjust their financial burdens.",
        "In particular, the recently approved legislation on state guarantees—Fogape Reactiva— opened space for the Bank to adapt the FCIC and comply with its commitment established in the last Meeting’s statement.",
        "This adaptation of the FCIC involved completing the momentum committed by the Board through unconventional instruments, by means of a mechanism that had ensured its effective monetary policy transmission.",
        "To this end, while maintaining the residual financial conditions of the FCIC 2, it would be necessary to adjust the access conditions, incorporating the new definitions of Fogape, focusing on gross flows —as the aim was not necessarily to increase the companies’ leverage— and extend collaterals.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial, and Board members García, Naudon and Costa voted for keeping the MPR at 0.5% and maintaining the reinvestment policy under the bank bond stock program announced last December.",
        "They also agreed to adapt the FCIC, by opening a third phase covering an amount of US$10 billion in effect for six months.",
        "In addition, they agreed to extend the eligible collateral for this phase, adding the A5- and A6-category commercial portfolio with state guarantee.",
        "The background information for this Meeting was contained in the June Monetary Policy Report that was to be published the next morning.",
        "That Report noted that the recovery of activity had been a positive surprise in the first months of 2021, reflecting the strong macroeconomic stimulus and the economy's better adaptation to the sanitary restrictions.",
        "At the same time, inflation had performed relatively in line with expectations.",
        "In the past few quarters, private consumption had risen strongly, fueled by pension savings withdrawals and massive fiscal transfers.",
        "In addition to this, there were the recently approved reforms, which meant that fiscal policy would be significantly more expansionary than had been anticipated in March.",
        "The recent improved performance combined with increased stimulus to spending, in a context of more favorable external conditions, led to a significant increase in growth projections for this year, to a range between 8.5% and 9.5% (6% to 7% in March).",
        "The Report emphasized that even with these advances and better prospects for recovery, the general perception remained marked by the evolution of infections and quarantines, the significant lags of some sectors, the fragilities in the labor market and the persistence of high uncertainty.",
        "It was also stressed that the financial market had reacted to aggregate local events with an increase in long rates that diverged from the stability of their external counterparts, a fall in the stock market and moderate increases in sovereign risk.",
        "The Report emphasized that higher growth in 2021 would bring forward the closing of the wide activity gap caused by the Covid-19 crisis, making it less necessary for the monetary impulse to support the economy's recovery, so it should begin to moderate sooner than anticipated in the previous Report.",
        "This would prevent an increase in inflation—around 3.5% at the time—from driving up the cost of living and eroding the purchasing power of the households most affected by the crisis.",
        "Even so, it was anticipated that, in the central scenario, the MPR would remain below its neutral level throughout the policy horizon, underpinning a recovery process that would continue to face important challenges.",
        "On the external front, the strengthening of the global recovery, the performance of the stock markets and the increases in commodity prices were highlighted.",
        "If this were compounded by the greater stability of long-term interest rates, the outlook for global financial conditions was very positive.",
        "It was added that, meanwhile, this process was accompanied by greater cost pressures, which in any case were estimated to be transitory, as was reflected in market expectations.",
        "It was pointed out that, in any case, the latter did not prevent the risk of greater persistence of these cost pressures, which posed a risk in a scenario of high liquidity and considerable stimulus to demand.",
        "Particularly important was the case of the U.S., where inflation was already showing very significant surprises.",
        "Locally, the impact of several factors on the recent evolution of the macroeconomic scenario stood out.",
        "On one hand, the sanitary situation showed a worsening in the evolution of infections while at the same time there was considerable progress in meeting vaccination goals, which gave significant support to the assumption that the economy would gradually open up as of the third quarter of the year, which underlay the Report's projections.",
        "On the other hand, activity figures confirmed that the recovery had been faster than expected, even in some services that strongly depended on human interaction.",
        "However, it was pointed out that this recovery was still very heterogeneous, which was especially evident in the labor market and left no doubt that there were still loopholes to be closed in the economy.",
        "It was pointed out that, beyond the recent evolution of the external scenario or the better performance of the economy at the beginning of the year, the main novelty of the macroeconomic scenario was the substantial increase in the boost to private spending and the impact it would have on aggregate demand.",
        "This was accompanied by a series of fiscal measures and the implementation of a third withdrawal of pension savings.",
        "As this boost coincided with progress in the recovery of and improvements in the external environment, the activity gap was projected to close much faster than expected, together with an increase in inflation, which was already near 3.5% All five Board members agreed that the fiscal expansion and the dynamism of consumption configured a macroeconomic scenario for the next two years in which it would be unnecessary to maintain such a highly expansionary monetary policy stance as the current one for such a long time as was expected until a few months back.",
        "In this scenario, the Board considered that holding the MPR at 0.5% was no longer the only possible option, and that the option of raising it by 25 basis points, to 0.75%, was also plausible.",
        "All the Board Members agreed that deciding on one option or the other was fully consistent with the macroeconomic scenario and the required monetary policy stance.",
        "In the view of several Board members, the biggest difference stemmed from a tactical and communicational component: in particular, the need to inform the market of the change the Bank was observing in the macroeconomic scenario—which would be attained with the publication of the June Report—and to prepare it for the adjustments that would occur shortly.",
        "It was further noted that this meant a return to a more traditional way monetary policy making, where the Board defined stages, first establishing a bias and then implementing changes in the MPR.",
        "One Board member added that, in addition to tactical considerations, the decision to hold the MPR was justified on the grounds that the widening activity gap in the second quarter pointed to lower immediate pressures on inflation, which overlapped with the labor market still being far from a full recovery.",
        "Although the Board considered it important to communicate the launching of the process of withdrawing the monetary stimulus, it also deemed it advisable to emphasize that monetary policy would remain expansionary for a long period of time.",
        "It was recalled that, despite the faster recovery and a greater boost to private spending, this would be temporary, as expenditure-boosting measures were phased out.",
        "Moreover, the economy was still immersed in a context where uncertainty was higher than it had been until a couple of years ago and where the prospects for investment and growth were constrained for the coming years.",
        "In this scenario, excessive tightening of local financial conditions could be counterproductive, and the Board would keep a watchful eye on economic developments.",
        "In fact, it was recalled that, in the central scenario of the June Report, it was anticipated that the MPR would remain below its neutral level throughout the entire policy horizon.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial, and Board members García, Naudon, and Costa voted in favor of keeping the monetary policy interest rate at 0.5%.",
        "Since the September MP Report the economy had pursued a path of strong expansion driven by private consumption.",
        "The year’s GDP growth exceeded forecasts, ending 2021 with activity significantly outpacing pre-crisis levels and its estimated potential.",
        "Inflation kept rising steadily, to more than 6.5% annually, due mainly to the exceptional expansion of domestic demand and the depreciation of the peso caused by local factors.",
        "These elements had been coupled with global phenomena, such as increased world demand, pandemic-related disruptions in international value chains of goods, and higher commodity prices.",
        "Higher inflation had persisted long enough to risk second-round effects through the indexation of contracts and wage increases.",
        "The burden of inflation on the economy was already visible and had become one of the main economic concerns of both households and businesses.",
        "Containing inflationary pressures would require withdrawing the domestic demand stimulus measures deployed during the crisis.",
        "On the fiscal side, this entailed public expenditure adjusting to the budget approved for 2022 and the medium-term projections contained in the Public Finances Report, initiating a path towards converging with debt levels sustainable in the medium term.",
        "On the monetary side, the central scenario projections in the MP Report’s central scenario indicated that the MPR should be further increased in the short term, to place it above its nominal neutral level (i.e., that which is consistent with the 3% inflation target) during most of the monetary policy horizon.",
        "In the central scenario, this adjustment of fiscal and monetary policies would contribute to a gradual closing of the activity gap, helping to prevent the recent inflation dynamics from having a persistent impact on the price formation process.",
        "Regarding the domestic scenario, it was noted that the most relevant surprise of recent times had been the dynamism of private consumption, which exceeded the already high estimates of September.",
        "Together with the stronger investment of recent months, growth in domestic demand was clearly overtaking growth in domestic supply, which translated into a significant increase in the current-account deficit.",
        "Measured at trend prices, this deficit would go from around 1% of GDP in 2020 to just under 7% of GDP in 2021.",
        "In such circumstances, it was noted, it was no surprise that the activity gap had turned more positive.",
        "It was further mentioned that the recent evolution of demand placed greater emphasis on the tensions between a very dynamic economy in the short term and a stagnant one in the medium term, a behavior in which local factors played a major role.",
        "There was debate about the risks implied by the high level of inflation, particularly its second-round effects and its impact on expectations.",
        "About these, it was pointed out that, despite the significant shift towards a monetary policy contraction, two-year inflation expectations persisted above 3%.",
        "It was noted that this could be reflecting an overreaction to the short-term behavior of inflation, given the severe shock of recent months and the fact that inflation was becoming a much more widespread problem around the world than was typically the case.",
        "It was further noted that, although the present conditions were cause for concern, inflation was still determined by its fundamentals and, therefore, monetary policy remained intact in its maneuvering capacity to control it.",
        "In fact, while more slowly, the market continued to expect inflation to converge to 3%.",
        "In any case, it should be clear that inflation expectations were an important reference when gauging the market’s perception but were not an intermediate monetary policy goal.",
        "The objective of monetary policy was still an MPR path that would bring inflation expectations to 3% over a two-year horizon.",
        "The risks of the external scenario—which seemed to have increased in the last few months—were also discussed.",
        "It was said that the most striking change was the risk of a disorderly recovery from the Covid-19 crisis in different dimensions.",
        "First, a shift from a coordinated global cycle to one that could be quite unsynchronized, especially between China and the United States.",
        "This could have complex effect on exchange rate dynamics and commodity prices.",
        "A second dimension was a scenario in which different economies would accumulate inflation levels not seen in many decades.",
        "Such a situation could lead to a significant change in the financial conditions facing emerging economies.",
        "It was mentioned that in the local financial markets’ risks seemed to be receding somewhat from their peak.",
        "Their recent evolution showed that volatility was being reflected more in the exchange rate than in the dynamics of long-term interest rates.",
        "This implied that the positive correlation between depreciation and long-term interest rates was tending to reverse, beyond the fact that those rates were still high compared with the recent past.",
        "The Board agreed that monetary policy should complete the withdrawal of the full monetary impulse adopted during the crisis and open the way to a contractionary stance, in order to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target over the two-year policy horizon.",
        "For this Meeting they considered three options: (i) raise the MPR by 100 basis points (bp); (ii) raise the MPR by 125bp; and (iii) raise the MPR by 150bp.",
        "All five Board members agreed that, given the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario and related risks, the MPR needed to move towards a more restrictive level, as reflected in the MPR corridor depicted in the December MP Report.",
        "Based on this corridor, to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target within the policy horizon, in a few months the MPR had to stand between 275 and 325 basis points above its level prior to this Meeting (2.75%).",
        "Therefore, the decision on this occasion had important tactical and communicational components because, irrespective of the option chosen, the MPR had to be raised further in the coming months and the increase determined now could set the future pace of increases.",
        "There was consensus on the Board that the option of raising the MPR by 100bp offered the least advantages.",
        "In the opinion of one Board member, this alternative had been lingering behind the markets’ expectations and faced at least two risks.",
        "One, it would require accelerating hikes in future meetings causing some degree of confusion.",
        "And two, it could lead people to believe that the Bank was too lax regarding its commitment with the inflation target.",
        "Several Board members appreciated the option of raising the MPR by 150bp.",
        "In their view, it helped to mark a more decisive step toward the interest rate levels they expected to achieve in the coming months, which could help prevent the impacts that high inflation was having on expectations.",
        "All the Board members agreed that the main risk of this option was to take the market by surprise again, since the last two decisions had already done so.",
        "About this, one Board member added that, although a hike of this magnitude would surprise part of the market, it could be explained because there was still a long way to go, the increases took place at a time that the economy was growing well above its capacity, nominal interest rates were substantially below the expected inflation for the coming quarters, and inflation expectations were above the target.",
        "The same Board member added that, nevertheless, at the same time there was the risk of it being perceived as the reflection of a more severe situation than had been estimated in the MP Report’s central scenario, which could drive up the entire interest rate curve to undesirable levels.",
        "About the option of raising the MPR by 125bp, all five Board members agreed that it was the one that best reflected the contents in the MP Report and the judgment of the Board.",
        "In particular, it would place the MPR somewhat above the median of expectations, but within the corridor, which would give full credibility to the Report’s diagnosis and forecasts while, at the same time, it would reassert the Board decision to take every step necessary to ensure compliance with the inflation target.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial, and Board members García, Naudon, and Costa voted in favor of raising the MPR by 125 basis points, to 4%.",
        "Activity had grown well above estimates.",
        "The March Imacec had risen 6.4% annually, having decreased only 1.6% with respect to February, despite the fact that in that month the number of quarantined people had soared to more than 80% of the national population.",
        "This suggested, in part, that agents had adapted better to the sanitary context, which was also expected to be reflected in a lower impact of the quarantines in April and May, which was already evident in the data on mobility, electricity generation and sales with digital invoices and receipts.",
        "By sectors, trade continued to lead as the best performer.",
        "Construction and services, although maintaining their recovery trend, had not yet reached pre-pandemic levels of activity, while manufacturing and mining had already done so.",
        "On the domestic spending side, incoming data indicated that consumption remained dynamic, supported by the high liquidity resulting from income support measures, as evidenced by the retail trade activity index (INE) and automobile sales (ANAC).",
        "Regarding investment, the rebound in capital goods imports continued to give signs of recovery.",
        "In this scenario, growth expectations for this year contained in the May Economic Expectations Survey (EES) had been adjusted upwards to 6.2% annually (5.3% in March).",
        "Additional information compiled in the May Business Perceptions Report (IPN) showed that, despite the negative effects of the tightening of sanitary restrictions on performance since March, the respondents were still betting on a better 2021 than 2020, although with heterogeneity among different sectors and company sizes.",
        "In any case, the uncertainty related to the pandemic, particularly regarding sanitary measures and, to a lesser extent, the political scenario, had increased from a few months before, which had led in some cases to hiring and investment plans being postponed or cancelled.",
        "The labor market was showing a significant rise from the poor employment levels of mid last year, with magnitudes varying depending on the occupational category and economic sector.",
        "There were also differences across multiple sources of information.",
        "Thus, while the data on the number of dependent contributors of the pension fund system (AFPs) suggested that formal salaried employment was already nearing its pre-pandemic level, INE data pointed to a milder rebound.",
        "For their part, hours actually worked had decreased since the previous Meeting, in a context of still constrained labor supply.",
        "A large number of respondents to the May IPN reported difficulties in recruiting personnel, especially lower-skilled workers.",
        "This was related, in their opinion, to fear of contagion, increased income support measures including pension savings withdrawals.",
        "The Internet Job Postings Index and IMCE hiring expectations continued to reflect higher labor demand, although with some pullback in the latter in April.",
        "Some idiosyncratic elements were gaining relevance in the behavior of the local financial market.",
        "In the fixed-income segment, the 10-year nominal rate had risen by 30 to 40 basis points (bp) more than its developed-economy counterparts since the beginning of March.",
        "Nominal and UF-indexed 2-year bonds had accumulated significant increases, i.e., more than 70 bp in indexed ones since the previous Meeting, where the discussion around a possible transitory reduction of the VAT was among the main factors behind the correction.",
        "Meanwhile, the IPSA had fallen, while the exchange rate had appreciated, amid a sustained copper price increase to near record highs.",
        "After the approval of the third withdrawal of pension savings, the Bank had once again launched extraordinary measures to contain the financial volatility that could result from the associated adjustments to pension fund portfolios, including reopening the CC-VP.",
        "As for bank credit, the activity of Fogape-Reactiva had continued on the rise, with disbursements close to US$4.5 billion and operations concentrated in smaller companies according to the latest available data.",
        "This program continued to underpin the performance of commercial loans, whose real annual growth had, however, turned negative.",
        "The high basis of comparison was relevant here, since in the same period last year many companies had drawn on bank credit lines to ensure liquidity at a time of high uncertainty.",
        "The consumer portfolio had reduced its annual contraction and the housing portfolio maintained a relatively stable performance (-16% and 4.8%, respectively in real annual terms in April).",
        "Interest rates remained low for all credit users.",
        "In terms of risk indicators, the banking system’s delinquency rate remained contained overall.",
        "For consumer loans, in recent months this had played a part in the decline in provisions.",
        "The Bank Lending Survey (BLS) for the first quarter reported a more dynamic supply for smaller companies, which was partly related to a lower perception of risk in this segment, aided by the continuity of credit support measures.",
        "The survey also reported a rebound in firms’ requests for funds, especially for working capital, as was also confirmed by May’s IPN.",
        "However, the latter also revealed that a fraction of the companies needing financing did not request it because of capacity issues, financial burden or unfavorable conditions, among other reasons.",
        "For households, the BLS revealed an improvement in both demand and lending standards in the consumer portfolio.",
        "IPN respondents linked to the banking sector added that the requirements for access to this type of credit were again similar to those in force prior to the pandemic, although a good part of these operations continued to be for portfolio purchases.",
        "Annual inflation, both headline and core (i.e.",
        "CPI without volatiles) had continued to hover at around 3%.",
        "In the latest monthly figures—March and April—price hikes for gasoline and some foodstuffs had stood out again.",
        "This was compounded with an incipient rebound in the prices of non-managed or indexed services, as well as continued high demand and difficulties in the production and supply of several high-demand goods.",
        "This had been confirmed by interviewees in and respondents to the survey of the May IPN, who reported cost pressures in a greater number of sectors, which had often translated into price increases.",
        "Business expectations (IMCE) continued to reflect the prospect of cost increases going forward.",
        "One- and two-year-ahead market expectations for inflation were still standing around 3% annually, according to the May EES and the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) prior to this Meeting.",
        "Regarding the unconventional measures in place, nearly 75% of the total FCIC3 available had been used up.",
        "In turn, since January the asset purchase program had been reinvesting coupons at maturity, a policy that would be maintained until June.",
        "Thereafter, the stock would be gradually reduced as the assets in the portfolio matured.",
        "In this context, MPR expectations in the surveys (EES and FTS) showed increases of 25 to 50 pb one year ahead, while the prices of financial assets pointed to a rise of around 100 pb.",
        "The international outlook was still evolving favorably, with global growth projections consolidating steadily.",
        "This, in a context in which the improved evolution of the pandemic and speed of vaccination had made it possible to relax sanitary restrictions, especially in developed economies.",
        "In particular, the dynamism of the United States during the first quarter (6.4 q-o-q annualized) stood out, consolidating a recovery driven by consumption.",
        "The Eurozone, on the other hand, had contracted in the first quarter, as a result of the extension and intensification of tightening measures during the first months of the year.",
        "However, the latest indicators showed a rebound in confidence and outlook, anticipating a faster recovery in the second half of the year, supported by progress in the vaccination processes, the high savings accumulated by households, and the fiscal stimulus plans.",
        "In the emerging world, China had seen positive quarterly growth, despite the reinstated restrictions during the period, with a more dynamic industrial sector, services that continued to recover and a solid external economy.",
        "In Latin America, activity had shown some resilience, although the worsening sanitary situation in several countries in the region, in the midst of sluggish vaccination processes, was compounded by some idiosyncratic factors of political and economic nature, which weakened expectations going forward.",
        "International financial markets maintained a positive tone, encouraged by the sustained improvement in global growth expectations, mainly in developed countries.",
        "Since the March meeting, stock market indexes had risen and risk premiums in an important group of economies (EMBI and CEMBI) had fallen further, while most currencies had appreciated against the dollar and capital was flowing into the emerging bloc.",
        "Meanwhile, long-term interest rates remained above those of the beginning of the year, but still low by historical standards.",
        "Commodity prices had risen across the board, particularly for oil and copper, with the latter hovering around US$4.8 per pound on some days of May.",
        "Rising commodity prices, together with higher effective inflation registers, greater cost pressures and strong incentives to demand had increased concerns about inflation—specially in the U.S.—which had led to some volatility in the financial markets.",
        "While most monetary authorities had maintained their stimulus policies, some had already announced or started the withdrawal of some of the unconventional measures, particularly in countries that already presented better growth prospects or were seeing inflationary risks.",
        "About the international scenario, it was stressed that the Chilean economy would receive a considerable external impulse this year.",
        "Global growth had consolidated with good numbers in the main economies, while financial conditions continued to be very positive and the main central banks remained committed towards highly expansionary policies.",
        "Last but not least, the prices of copper and other commodities had far exceeded projections.",
        "Although some correction was to be expected, it was clear that on average they would be well above estimates of just a few weeks before.",
        "In any case, it was also pointed out that, particularly in the United States, the macro policy mix seemed to be incubating inflationary risks that were not negligible.",
        "For the moment, this phenomenon was mostly circumscribed to the US economy, but there were reasonable doubts as to how widespread it might be across the world.",
        "In fact, this heightened concern about inflation had fueled some recent adjustments in the markets, although expectations remained anchored.",
        "On the domestic front, the favorable evolution of demand and activity indicators was noted, as it had been outperforming expectations since the end of last year.",
        "This occurred in a context in which the evolution of the external scenario had so far been beneficial for Chile, boosting foreign trade and facilitating the execution of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.",
        "Also noteworthy were the improved capacity of companies to adapt to the sanitary restrictions, a positive flow of credit oriented to the worst affected companies, a substantial volume of support to households suffering income losses, and substantial progress in the Covid-19 vaccination program.",
        "Nonetheless, it was noted that the application of new quarantines, lags in the recovery of the labor market and political tensions had significantly deteriorated consumer and, though somewhat less, business expectations.",
        "This negative climate had led to significant benefit extensions for households and small businesses, reflected in a third pension savings withdrawal approved in April and in the ongoing discussion about extensions to the coverage and amounts of fiscal transfers to households.",
        "The combination of these factors had resulted in increases in long-term interest rates on local bonds in excess of those on U.S. Treasury bonds.",
        "Regarding credit, it was mentioned that the annual variation rate of the stock of commercial loans was beginning to turn negative in real terms.",
        "Although this seemed to be largely explained by the high basis of comparison, another possibility was that, once the most difficult stage of the sanitary emergency was over and a sales had recovered, many companies had begun to reduce their future financial burden, either through amortizations or rescheduling.",
        "On the other hand, the fall in the stock of consumer loans was consistent with the increase in household liquidity provided by pension fund withdrawals and transfers from the Treasury.",
        "On the labor market, attention was drawn to the fact that the data showed both employment and wages were improving.",
        "However, it was also pointed out that the employment increases were concentrated mostly in salaried jobs, while self-employment lagged far behind.",
        "The data also showed a still very slow recovery in labor force participation, which was consistent with the difficulties faced by caregivers of children, the sick and the elderly, in a context of pandemics, on-line schooling and closed medical and elderly care centers.",
        "All in all, it was pointed out that, beyond the differences across multiple indicators, it was clear that the recovery of the labor market was quite significant with respect to the lowest point associated with the pandemic.",
        "The changes that had occurred in some of the risks identified in March were also noted.",
        "On the one hand, the risks related to the pandemic had moderated, particularly because the progress made in the vaccination campaign opened up the prospect of a sooner, albeit partial, return to normal life.",
        "This fact, as well as available first-quarter data, the greater adaptation of the economy and the increases in stimulus measures made it possible to dispel scenarios of a weaker recovery in consumption or a greater-than-expected effect of quarantines.",
        "On the other hand, idiosyncratic risks had become more prevalent, as could be inferred from market prices.",
        "Accordingly, the exchange rate seemed to have appreciated less than expected considering the increase in the copper price, and sovereign rates incorporated external developments, but also term premiums more closely associated with local factors.",
        "All this occurred in a context of heightened political tension and new legislative initiatives that, beyond their short-term benefits, would impose costs that would have to be assumed in the medium and long term.",
        "On top of it, there was the greater concern about global inflation, which was becoming one of the main medium-term risks in the financial markets.",
        "All five Board members agreed that the recent evolution of the external and internal scenarios, the stronger fiscal impulse and boost to private consumption that the additional stimulus packages would entail, plus the reduction of some risks, permitted estimating that Chile’s economic outlook was now significantly improved compared with estimates in the March Monetary Policy Report.",
        "This positioned our economy near the positive sensitivity considered in the scenarios of that MP Report.",
        "In any case, the Board agreed that the moment the normalization process would begin remained highly uncertain.",
        "In particular, because despite the greater expansion of demand and activity, other factors also had to be considered when assessing medium-term inflationary pressures, including the persistence of the lags in the sectors most affected by the pandemic, the labor market’s evolution, and possible structural changes caused by the crisis itself.",
        "All the Board members agreed that the June MP Report would be particularly relevant to elucidate some of these issues.",
        "By that time, April activity data would be available, so it would be possible to verify how much more resilient the Chilean economy had become to quarantines such as the one initiated in late March that had involved a major portion of the population.",
        "By then, the initial impact on private consumption of the third pension savings withdrawal, which was preliminarily estimated to be less than for the previous two, could also be assessed.",
        "In the political sphere, by the June MP Report, the election process would have already been completed and the conversations regarding the adjustment of government support to households and small businesses would have been advanced or even concluded.",
        "With respect to sanitary matters, progress in the vaccination campaign and its impact on the dynamics of the pandemic could be evaluated with greater certainty.",
        "In addition, the June MP Report would contain an update of the structural parameters of trend growth and the neutral interest rate, which would allow for a reassessment of the activity gap and the degree of expansiveness of monetary policy.",
        "Consequently, all the Board Members agreed that it was prudent to hold back any substantive definition on the future evolution of the monetary policy for that instance, keeping the MPR at its technical minimum at the present Meeting.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Naudon, and Costa voted for holding the MPR at 0.5%.",
        "They also agreed to effect no changes to the unconventional liquidity and credit support measures.",
        "Headline inflation had risen above forecasts in the last MP Report, standing at 5.3% annually at September.",
        "On the other hand, core inflation --CPI without volatiles-- had risen to 4.2% annually, in line with projections.",
        "The rise in recent months had affected all the different items that make up the CPI basket, reflecting domestic demand-side and cost-side inflationary pressures, as well as the significant idiosyncratic depreciation of the peso.",
        "In this sense, the low inventory levels perceived in trade and manufacturing continued to stand out, as did the prospects of higher costs and generalized wages across sectors (IMCE).",
        "The National Statistics Institute (INE), meanwhile, reported that the percentage of imputed prices during the pandemic had continued to decline.",
        "Increased prices of fuels and some foodstuffs had raised inflation of the volatile component to 7.5% annually.",
        "In this scenario, inflation expectations had shown increases at all terms, and in some cases exceeded 6% at December this year, surpassing the projections contained in the September Report.",
        "Two years ahead, for the second month in a row the median of the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) was above 3% annually, with 70% of the respondents pointing to a value above 3%.",
        "The median of the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) remained around 3.5% for the third month in a row, while 90% of the respondents expected inflation to be higher than 3%.",
        "As for activity, the August Imacec had significantly surpassed its pre-pandemic level, growing by 19.1% annually and 1.1% monthly in seasonally adjusted terms.",
        "In a context of continued abundant liquidity derived from massive fiscal transfers and pension withdrawals, trade remained the most dynamic sector.",
        "In annual terms, it had continued to grow at high rates —25.5% in August—, but in seasonally-adjusted terms it had dropped 1.5% with respect to the previous month.",
        "Retail trade evidenced that private consumption of goods had remained dynamic.",
        "Accordingly, imports of consumer goods had continued to post record-high annual variations, especially in the durable segment.",
        "The recovery of several sectors that had been lagging behind — especially services activities—, was compounded with the high liquidity and eased sanitary restrictions.",
        "Goods production had maintained the high growth of previous months.",
        "Consumer expectations (IPEC) continued to be pessimistic, with a slight decline in their last figure, especially due to the increase in inflation.",
        "On the investment front, short-term indicators such as construction and business services had improved, while capital goods imports remained high.",
        "The business outlook (IMCE) was in optimistic territory, although it also revealed cost increases and inventory shortages.",
        "However, medium-term expectations for investment remained less favorable, as suggested by the evolution of the stock market and uncertainty indicators, the abrupt deterioration of local financial conditions, as well as cash management decisions made by big companies.",
        "Preliminary information for the Business Perceptions Report (IPN) showed significant dynamism of activity, especially in private-consumption-related sectors.",
        "This continued to respond to the abundant household liquidity and advances in the reopening of the economy.",
        "Nonetheless, survey participants listed several causes for concern.",
        "To begin with, costs —especially of imports— remained historically high, which had led to narrowing margins or increased sale prices.",
        "Moreover, further price increases were expected in the short term.",
        "In addition, labor costs were rising due to difficulties in hiring labor, especially of lower-skilled workers.",
        "Finally, political/legislative uncertainty had intensified, as had concerns about the possible resurgence of violence, especially affecting investment decisions.",
        "Thus, the outlook for the coming year had become more pessimistic.",
        "In this context, the growth outlook for this year according to the EES had seen another revision upward, to 11.0% in its October version (10.4% in September).",
        "In contrast, expected GDP for 2022 was down to 2.2% (2.5% in September), and remained at 2.0% for 2023.",
        "In the labor market, employment (INE) had risen in every category and the unemployment rate had declined to 8.5% in the June-August quarter.",
        "Still, there was a significant lag in the recovery of categories with a high percentage of informality, especially informal salaried employment, while the lag in self-employment had been reduced.",
        "Moreover, despite a certain upturn in labor supply as seen in lower inactivity and more job postings on the Internet, there was still a big mismatch between the supply of and demand for jobs, especially for lower skilled persons.",
        "Accordingly, labor income showed a strong recovery from year-before levels.",
        "For the short term, business expectations (IMCE) predicted increases in hiring.",
        "Local financial markets exhibited much sharper and more systematic deteriorations than their external peers, with corrections at the extremes of international movements.",
        "This was due to the influence of idiosyncratic factors, especially the change in the inflation outlook and uncertainty about political/legislative issues, particularly with respect to new pension savings withdrawals.",
        "In the fixed-income market, interest rates had risen along the curve, especially in the medium and long tranches, although with low amounts traded in those instruments.",
        "The 10-year nominal interest rate had exceeded 6.5%, a rate unseen in more than a decade.",
        "Thus, from early September to the time of the Meeting, the differential with its U.S. counterpart had moved from around 370 basis points (bp) to around 500bp.",
        "In the same period, the exchange rate had continued to rise, accumulating a depreciation of more than 5% against the dollar, drifting away from its fundamentals.",
        "The IPSA had fallen close to 8%, while country risk posted an increase of nearly 25bp, similar to the average of other Latin American economies.",
        "In the money market, the banking system’s dollar liquidity remained near its all-time highs and kept the cost of dollar funding contained at the local level.",
        "In pesos, interest rates had risen, with trading centered on more immediate terms.",
        "As to banking credit, commercial loans had reduced their real annual contraction rate (-1.9% in September) —reflecting a recent improvement in non-Fogape credit activity—, as had consumer loans (-9.3% in September), with smaller declines in all products of this portfolio.",
        "As of September, mortgage loan flows remained relatively stable (6.3% in real annual terms in September), largely supported by a higher number of transactions, in a context in which interest rates had risen again in the different categories.",
        "Non-performing loans in the overall system remained contained.",
        "According with the Bank Lending Survey (BLS) for the third quarter, demand for credit had strengthened in most segments.",
        "The exception were mortgage loans, where the impact that the higher interest rates were having on credit applications stood out.",
        "For larger companies, the BLS reported an increase in credit demand for working capital.",
        "On the supply side, it generally reported fairly stable conditions for the various portfolios.",
        "In any case, preliminary information from the IPN revealed a drop in the number of transactions carried out in October, especially mortgages, with a tightening of lending standards, greater restrictions in terms and in the required down payment, among others.",
        "Regarding the evolution of fiscal expenditure, the 2022 budget bill contemplated a convergence trajectory in accordance with the structural balance rule, with a nominal reduction of close to 20% in 2022 with respect to the expenditure that would be executed in 2021, according to the Public Finance Report for the third quarter.",
        "In this scenario, expectations for the monetary policy rate (MPR) had risen.",
        "In particular, the FTS and the EES projected an adjustment of +75bp at the October Meeting, while the prices of financial assets pointed to +100bp.",
        "One year ahead, the outlook for the MPR contained in these measures fluctuated between 4% and 5.5%, while two years ahead they did between 4.25% and 6%.",
        "On the external front, the outlook for global activity had moderated marginally as a result of constraints due to the resurgence of Covid-19 in some economies and the persistence of bottlenecks at the global level, which had limited growth in certain sectors.",
        "In developed countries, high vaccination coverage had allowed economies to continue to reopen despite increases in infections.",
        "However, in the U.S., although the outlook remained favorable, the outbreaks had affected the consumption of services and job creation.",
        "In Asia, on the other hand, the outbreaks had led to maintaining restrictions in place.",
        "In China, disruptions in supply chains, demands to meet Government environmental targets, higher energy prices and the tension generated by the Evergrande situation in the real estate sector were all factors that anticipated an economic slowdown.",
        "These developments had taken place in a context where global inflation had continued to rise, most notably in the U.S. and Latin America.",
        "Bottlenecks continued to be reflected in high shipping costs, longer delivery times, shortages of inputs, and lower inventory levels, which together had continued to put pressure on costs.",
        "In addition, energy prices had risen sharply after the August meeting.",
        "In particular, the price of a barrel of oil had surpassed US$80 (+15% for the WTI-Brent average since the last meeting).",
        "This added to the significant rise in the price of gas (+45% since the last meeting), due to the strong world demand increase and supply disruptions in some of the world’s main producers.",
        "Meanwhile, the copper price was stable at around US$4.2 per pound.",
        "In this scenario, several central banks had adopted a less expansionary stance.",
        "Worth noting were the changes in both the Fed’s communication —which had signaled that it would withdraw its unconventional monetary stimulus faster than had been foreseen— and of the Bank of England, which had signaled an upcoming increase in its policy rate.",
        "This had been compounded by the start of monetary normalization by the authorities in Norway, New Zealand, and various emerging economies.",
        "External financial markets had reduced their appetite for risk, considering, mainly, the aforementioned elements, doubts that had also triggered a higher degree of volatility in the markets recently.",
        "Interest rates had risen across the board, the bulk of global currencies had depreciated against the dollar, and sovereign spreads had risen in an important group of countries, while stock markets showed mixed movements.",
        "Capital inflows to emerging economies had tended to moderate, with marginal outflows from Latin America.",
        "The region was still underperforming with respect to other emerging economies.",
        "On the external front, it was noted that there had been changes in recent months, with some deterioration in activity and a tightening of financial conditions, and that this responded to some increasing risks —such as the persistence and extension of supply disruptions— and to the beginning, or approaching, monetary normalization in several economies.",
        "The reaction of financial markets had increased volatility and longterm interest rates, although quite more moderately in developed countries than in emerging ones.",
        "These adjustments were also based on a certain fear about what was happening with the Chinese company Evergrande, which placed the focal point on the Chinese real-estate indebtedness, but that after Covid-19 appeared as a broader concern.",
        "This would likely have an impact on China’s growth outlook, although for now its potential effects were contained, and the copper price was still high.",
        "While the local economy bore the impact of all these developments, it was clearly dominated by idiosyncratic factors.",
        "In fact, the deterioration of the different variables of the Chilean financial market had been much more marked and systematic and was at the extremes of the international movements.",
        "Locally, indicators showed that since the last Report, both activity and core inflation had behaved in line with estimates.",
        "A somewhat lower-than-expected Imacec in July had been offset with a better-than-expected performance in August.",
        "Meanwhile, cumulative core inflation between August and September differed only marginally from the September Report’s estimate.",
        "Short-term forecasts for domestic demand and activity were also within expectations.",
        "In contrast, total inflation posted somewhat bigger changes in projections that affected mainly the volatile component —not core— given the price hikes in fuels and some foods.",
        "The core part had smaller changes in its projections, although higher levels were expected in its goods component, mainly due mainly to the additional depreciation of the peso and the greater pass-through implied by its idiosyncratic nature.",
        "It was mentioned that the biggest difference with respect to the central scenario of the September Report were seen in the financial conditions and inflation expectations.",
        "The former had experienced a significant decline, as evidenced by the significant depreciation of the peso, the decoupling of the local stock market with international markets, and the significant increase in long-term rates since the beginning of the year.",
        "Interest rates had risen much more than that of economies such as Australia, New Zealand, Norway, and even greater than that of other countries in Latin America.",
        "The analysis of structural models was added as a precedent, which confirmed that both the exchange rate depreciation and the rise in long-term rates were mainly explained by idiosyncratic elements.",
        "It was emphasized that this tightening of financial conditions would have an effect on activity.",
        "As for inflation expectations, it was noted that they had risen for every source and every term, including the 24-month policy horizon.",
        "It was mentioned that the fundamental cause of the rise in these expectations seemed not to be linked to lack of credibility of the Bank’s commitment with inflation control but to the uncertainty caused by the political/legislative context and its implications on the demand impulse measures.",
        "Attention was drawn to the high complexity of the Chilean macroeconomic scenario.",
        "On one hand, high growth and demand-side pressures —which in normal circumstances would cause an appreciation of the exchange rate and a softening of inflationary pressures— were overwhelmed by elements of exchange rate risks whose depreciative effects would put pressure on prices.",
        "On the other hand, the higher interest rates and the higher exchange rate will negatively affect activity and investment in the medium term.",
        "Add to this the evolution of inflation expectations and preliminary background from the IPN that signaled the relevance of cost increases and indications of higher pass-through to prices.",
        "The Board members agreed that a macroeconomic scenario where activity was above potential and inflation was speeding up, needed monetary policy to continue to go from an expansionary stance to a more neutral one.",
        "In this context, the Board examined four options of MPR increase at this Meeting: (i) a 75bp raise; (ii) a 100bp rase; (iii) a 125bp raise; and (iv) a 150bp raise.",
        "They all agreed that, given the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario and considering its risks, it was necessary to approximate the MPR to its neutral level earlier than projected in the central scenario of the September Report.",
        "In the Board’s opinion, the best option was to place the MPR around its neutral value in the next Meeting, leaving room for the December Report to calibrate the next steps, considering the revised outlook for activity and inflation for 2022 and 2023.",
        "In this context, the Board members coincided that the options of raising the MPR by 100 or 125 bp seemed to be the most appropriate.",
        "On one hand, they were consistent with the need to accelerate the pace of the monetary stimulus withdrawal and, on the other hand, in both cases the MPR would be below the lower bound of the estimated neutral rate, so it should certainly be further increased in the coming meetings.",
        "In the opinion of one Board member, the option of raising the MPR by 100bp was consistent with the evolution of market expectations, and could suffice to signal the increased risk materialized, given its sources, particularly the dynamism of consumption and uncertainty in financial markets.",
        "In the opinion of another Board member opting for one option or the other entailed a relevant tactic element, namely the pertinence —or not— of surprising the market.",
        "In his view, what mattered most was to communicate that the MPR would sooner come close to its neutral level, and in that scenario a 125bp raise was a wise combination between a somewhat higher than what the market expected increase and the need to convey the earlier materialization of the MPR trajectory.",
        "The options of raising the MPR by 75 or 150bp seemed less plausible to the Board, because they carried a surprise component that could be complex for the market to understand.",
        "On the one hand, the 75bp option could give a feeling of continuity of the Report’s central scenario which was not consistent with the observed changes and which, in a context where inflation expectations had risen, could be counterproductive.",
        "On the other hand, the option of raising the MPR by 150bp seemed a good choice if the intention was to shock the market and try to affect inflation expectations.",
        "There were some caveats, however.",
        "In particular, that it could generate an even greater tightening in local financial conditions —and there were no forecasts to quantify this effect— or it could be associated with a response to inflationary surprises that had no relation with core inflation.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial, and Board members García, Naudon, and Costa voted for raising the MPR by 125 basis points, to hasta 2.75%."

        "CENTRAL BANK OF CHILE Spanish original prevails.",
        "Both versions are available at www.bcentral.cl The rapid spread of Covid-19 together with the sanitary measures adopted in various countries were beginning to severely affect the capacity of households and firms to carry out their social and economic activities normally.",
        "In recent weeks, the international financial markets were exhibiting an unusual degree of volatility and a fall of their main indicators.",
        "As a response, many central banks had anticipated their monetary policy decisions and announced a string of complementary measures intended to facilitate liquidity provision and the normal operation of their credit markets.",
        "While Chile’s economic indicators were yet to reflect the effects of these disruptions, the progression of the virus in other countries pointed at significant impacts on the affected firms’ sales and cash flows.",
        "If it proved persistent in time, it could erode their solvency position, in particular that of SMEs, which would adversely affect economic activity and the labor market.",
        "Such a situation might hinder the normal transmission of monetary policy.",
        "Taking stock of the significant changes in the macroeconomic scenario, the Board decided to conduct an extraordinary monetary policy meeting on 16 March 2020, which was communicated to the public the morning of that day.",
        "Emphasis was placed on the uniqueness of the shock being faced.",
        "On the one hand, the effects of the social crisis that had burst out in October were still unfolding, and although the Imacec in December and January had been above expectations, other real and financial variables showed a deterioration in recent months.",
        "In particular, the behavior of salaried employment, the persistent pessimism of expectations and the meager credit growth, most notably of consumer loans, stood out.",
        "On the other hand, the global Covid-19-related sanitary crisis that had broken out in recent weeks was becoming the main factor reshaping both the global and local scenarios.",
        "Actually, our country had rapidly moved to phase 4 of the outbreak, which entailed a number of restrictions that would have immediate effects on the economy’s performance.",
        "The complexity of this sanitary event was exacerbated by the difficulty of estimating its effects, because it was so unfamiliar that it was causing great uncertainty not only locally but throughout the entire world.",
        "It was noted that an important number of central banks were adopting significant measures to mitigate the effects of the crisis.",
        "In this regard, it was recalled that the Bank had already adopted a major package of measures at the end of last year when the social crisis had significantly affected the domestic markets.",
        "Hence, if new decisions were to be made they should take into account the steps that had already been taken.",
        "It was noted that the market, in particular the exchange rate, had not overreacted to that morning’s announcement of a special meeting being summoned.",
        "It was commented that the biggest concern over the short term was the need to safeguard the proper functioning of the credit channel.",
        "This was a dominant element, both because it boosted the power of the transmission channel of monetary policy and because, in one way or another, it made it easier for the private sector to absorb some of the financial costs of the interruptions caused by the epidemic.",
        "While it seemed impossible to foresee that there would be no associated problems, this did not mean that facilities could not be devised to generate such funding and mitigate the impact on the private sector.",
        "All five Board members agreed that the scenario where the country was operating was one of seldom seen, extraordinarily high, uncertainty that was sweeping through the real economy and the financial system.",
        "Undoubtedly the shock would have contractionary effects and reduce inflationary pressures in the policy horizon.",
        "There was also significant risk of contagion between real shocks and the situation of the financial system.",
        "In particular because the weaker or more vulnerable segments of the corporate sector—most specially small firms— would have a reduced capacity to sustain the dramatic adjustment in their cash flows.",
        "A particularly complex situation because the social explosion had greatly eaten into the liquidity margins of an important number of businesses and most affected sectors.",
        "The entire Board agreed that the current situation called for a clear, multidimensional and mutually consistent policy response.",
        "On the one hand, it was necessary to protect and deepen the monetary stimulus, in order to address the severe contraction that the economy would suffer in the coming months, and to counteract its deflationary impact, which was being amplified by a worldwide fall in the oil price.",
        "On the other hand, it was necessary to continue ensuring the proper, flexible and stress-free functioning of financial intermediation in the main markets in which the Bank had influence, particularly fixed-income securities, plus banking and corporate financing.",
        "Finally, it was necessary to promote the flow of credit and refinancing to the private sector, which was going to be severely strained in the coming months, and where the aim was to avoid permanent damage to the balance sheets that would lead to company bankruptcies, a sharp rise in layoffs, and persistent effects on the economy and the national financial system.",
        "All the Board members agreed that this policy response should contemplate extending the current monetary stimulus and taking measures to safeguard the normal functioning of the credit markets and the effective transmission of the greater monetary impulse.",
        "All the Board members voted for adopting a set of extraordinary measures.",
        "These included opening a funding facility for the banks conditional on their increase in loans (FCIC), valid for six months, to grant credits charged to it over a term of up to four years with an initial loan amount equivalent to 3% of their commercial and consumer portfolios as reported by the Financial Market Commission (CMF) for 29 February 2020 (benchmark portfolio).",
        "It was also agreed that the additional resources channeled through the FCIF would be proportional to each entity’s lending increase with respect to its benchmark portfolio, and the extension factor would be greater for loans to smaller firms (SMEs).",
        "As for its cost, it was agreed that banking firms making use of this facility would be charged an interest rate equal to the MPR in effect at the moment of request.",
        "Should the MPR be modified during the six months of the program’s duration, the rate for the residual term of the credit would be adjusted to its lower value for the period.",
        "The Board also agreed, as extraordinary measures, to include corporate bonds among the eligible collateral for all the liquidity operations in pesos in place, including the FCIC; to launch a bank bond purchase program from SOMA system participants for an amount equal to the UF equivalent of up to 4 billion US dollars; and to extend the forex sale program up to 9 January 2021.",
        "With respect to the MPR, all the Board members voted in favor of a reduction, noting that the change in the macroeconomic scenario required a stronger monetary impulse to successfully achieve convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board member García voted for cutting 75 basis points off the MPR, bringing it to 1%.",
        "Their argument was that the present circumstances made it necessary to act sooner, so a reduction of that magnitude would cause no major inconveniences in the domestic markets.",
        "They actually mentioned that after the extraordinary meeting had been announced that morning, the markets were betting on MPR reductions of 50 or 75 basis points, and no unexpected reaction had been observed in other variables, including the exchange rate.",
        "Board members Naudon and Costa voted for lowering the MPR by 50 basis points, to 1.25%.",
        "In their opinion, the important financial tensions the country was experiencing—and that could increase due to the world markets’ events as well as escalating domestic stress— could result in a scenario like the one Chile had endured at the end of last year, significantly affecting the functioning of the markets, including the exchange rate.",
        "Thus, they believed that the wisest thing to do was to slow down the pace of reducing the rate while boosting the rest of the measures that sought to strengthen liquidity and foster credit.",
        "According to these Board members, these measures were of first order, while they deemed correct to continue on a declining interest rate path, monitoring its effects on the evolution of the financial markets.",
        "Several Board members (JV, RC, AN) pointed out that future movements of the monetary policy rate would be conditional not only on the evolution of the macro economy, but also on the evolution of the financial markets.",
        "The local and international economic scenario continued to be determined by the evolution of the people’ mobility and its relation to the pandemic.",
        "In Chile, although infections had declined and mobility had increased since mid-year, improvements in activity had been slower than expected in September.",
        "This had been especially true for the sectors most affected by social distancing, such as construction and a good proportion of services.",
        "The withdrawal of pension savings had resulted in temporary increases in consumption, especially of imported goods, which had had a positive impact on sectors such as trade but had also put pressure on the prices of the products most demanded.",
        "Investment, beyond the reactivation of public and private projects, was being affected by the financial situation of companies and the persistent uncertainty.",
        "The labor market had shown some recovery, with a rise in employment compared to mid-year.",
        "The balance of these elements meant a downward revision of the forecasts contained in the December MP Report for this year’s growth.",
        "The central scenario foresaw that the economy would keep improving, that mobility restrictions would not return to mid-2020 levels, and that the fiscal and monetary impulse would continue.",
        "Even so, dismay caused by the sharp drop in activity, plus the necessary use of public and private strenghts to overcome the emergency, heightened vulnerability to risk scenarios and posed significant challenges to recovering near-trend growth rates.",
        "Regarding the external scenario, it was noted that, positive news exceeded the negative.",
        "Along with the news about a vaccine becoming available, there was good news about GDP in several countries during the third quarter —notably China—, the copper price hike and the elimination of some risks, such as those associated with the U.S. elections.",
        "Naturally there were also negative elements, mainly the increase of infections in several European countries and in the United States and the fact that the scars caused by this the crisis had become more evident.",
        "Both facts suggested that there was the risk of a slower recovery going forward, even with a readily available vaccine.",
        "Locally, there was consensus that news was not as encouraging.",
        "Incoming data on activity had surprised on the downside, with both regular consumption and investment being weaker than expected.",
        "In addition, the data was difficult to interpret, particularly because of doubts about how much of it was due to the measures taken in association with the pandemic; how much was a reflection of something more persistent resulting from the scars of the crisis; and how much was simply statistical noise with no macroeconomic content.",
        "It was noted that something similar happened with inflation, which had been particularly volatile in recent months, making it difficult to read.",
        "Most importantly, however, the evolution of inflation was leaving behind the risk of persistently low inflation that could affect the evolution of inflation expectations.",
        "It was also noted that another important factor in the macroeconomic scenario would be the evolution of uncertainty and its potential impact on investment.",
        "This was compounded with sanitary issues—e.g.",
        "possible new outbreaks or progress in vaccination—, the fear of new violence episodes as manifested in some surveys, together with financial difficulties in some companies.",
        "Their behavior would be decisive for investment to be reactivated beyond large-scale public and private projects.",
        "In any case, there were also favorable aspects, such as the performance of the stock market, the evolution of business expectations and the higher price of copper.",
        "Beyond the immediate evolution of the macro scenario, it was remarked that the ugliest side of the Covid-19 crisis was dissipating, and a worst-case scenario had been averted.",
        "Since June, half of the sharp fall of the previous three months had been recovered and by 2021 a growth range between 5.5% and 6.5% was projected.",
        "These projections were largely based on a reduction in infections, the gradual phasing out of sanitary restrictions, the impulse of monetary and fiscal policy, and the capacity of many companies to adapt.",
        "Furthermore, private consumption was being boosted by two withdrawals of pension savings.",
        "Although the announcement of the Metropolitan Region’s retreat to step 2 of the deconfinement plan could reduce somewhat the momentum at the margin, to the extent that it could help articulate a more orderly transition to the application of a vaccine, it would avoid having to resort to more drastic measures.",
        "There were also newly incorporated exemptions for construction and some services activities.",
        "All the Board members agreed that, given the macroeconomic context caused by the pandemic, there was no other options than reinforcing the message that monetary policy would maintain a strong monetary impulse for an extended period of time, in order to ensure the consolidation of the economic recovery and achievement of the Bank’s objectives.",
        "Accordingly, it was foreseen that the MPR would remain at its minimum level over a large part of the two-year monetary policy horizon, and the unconventional measures would remain in application.",
        "The Board agreed on the necessity to assess the situation of commercial credit, in particular the limited use of Phase 2 of the FCIC facility by the financial system.",
        "In this respect, various doubts arose as to what it meant that it was not being used with the expected intensity and what the implications for the current monetary impulse were.",
        "They all agreed that it was imperative to address these questions in order to possibly make adjustments to these measures.",
        "Especially important was to determine whether more structural phenomena were occurring—as a result, for example, of the scars being left by the crisis—that could affect economic recovery in a more sustained way.",
        "They thought it also necessary to examine the coherence of a possible extension and redesign of the FCIC with other existing regulatory, credit and guarantee policies that could be operating.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Naudon, and Costa voted for keeping the monetary policy rate at 0.5%.",
        "They also agreed to keep in place the unconventional measures to support liquidity and credit.",
        "In particular, they decided to maintain the total stock of bank bonds acquired under different programs—in the order of US$8 billion—for at least the next six months, reinvesting the coupons as they matured.",
        "This included the purchases under the CC-VP program.",
        "Regarding the FCIC, the Board decided not to introduce any changes to the total of resources available and conditions for utilization.",
        "Nonetheless, it agreed to assess a possible extension and changes in access parameters that would facilitate its use to respond to the needs of the economy at the present stage",
        "In the external scenario, the advances in trade negotiations between China and the United States, particularly after signing the first phase of the agreement, and the positive surprise in incoming activity and demand figures from the main economies —especially the greater stability of manufacturing-related indicators— had a positive impact on financial markets and commodity prices.",
        "However, new sources of tension, in particular the coronavirus outbreak, had increased the global perception of risk, to a great extent because of how it could affect the performance of the Chinese and other Asian economies.",
        "In the days leading up to the Meeting, this had translated into higher risk premiums, widespread depreciations of currencies against the dollar, and falls in stock prices and interest rates.",
        "In the case of commodities, prices had fallen to their lowest of several months, and copper was no exception.",
        "In terms of activity, better numbers could be observed in the US in starts of new homes and mortgage loans that showed a higher impulse in residential investment, while the outlook for consumption remained robust, especially considering the tight labor market according to many indicators, similarly to other developed countries.",
        "The high level of US consumer confidence persisted and suggested that it would support this part of spending going forward.",
        "In the Eurozone, manufacturing production and several measures of expectations were showing better performance in the margin.",
        "In Germany, in particular, preliminary information confirmed positive GDP growth in 2019, albeit the lowest rate since 2013.",
        "Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom the latest known economic data showed a deterioration, in the run-up to the signing of a Brexit deal with the European Union.",
        "In the emerging economies, China’s GDP had closed 2019 with a 6.1% expansion, in line with market expectations, while short-term activity data showed an acceleration in December from the previous month, including figures from the external sector.",
        "The upturn in investment in fixed assets stood out.",
        "The outlook in Latin America continued to be characterized by socio-political tensions in a significant group of countries, with monthly activity data that had been weaker at the margin in some countries, such as Mexico and Argentina.",
        "In Brazil, the approval of the pension reform had boosted confidence and several indicators suggested a gradual rebound there.",
        "In a context where global inflation was still bounded, global monetary policy continued to be expansionary, with policy rates being held flat or further reduced in most countries.",
        "Meanwhile, in the Eurozone it had been announced that the monetary policy framework would be revised during 2020, which could result in an extension of the current mandate of the European Central Bank.",
        "Since the last meeting, domestic financial markets had shown some volatility that matched the evolution of internal and external determinants, and in line with the impact of the measures adopted by the Bank.",
        "Thus, since the December Meeting, the peso had appreciated and had become notably less volatile, reflecting the effects of the exchange rate intervention carried out by the Bank.",
        "The measures aimed at favoring market liquidity had also been effective, contributing to reducing money market spreads in both pesos and dollars.",
        "In the credit market, the marked deceleration of consumer loans stood out, while commercial and mortgage lending showed no major changes in annual expansion rates.",
        "At the same time, corporate bonds had been issued abroad in significant amount, with favorable financial conditions.",
        "Interest rates on commercial and mortgage loans had increased compared with data available at the previous Meeting.",
        "Regarding qualitative information, credit conditions had tightened, as reflected in the Bank Credit Survey of the fourth quarter of 2019, which reported that credit supply was perceived as more restricted in all portfolios, particularly in the consumer and large company segments, together with weaker demand, mainly for consumer credit.",
        "Also, in the Business Perceptions Report (IPN) of February, most of the respondents saw a tightening of financial conditions, mainly due to some increase in interest rates in certain segments—although they noted that they were still low by the usual standards— and greater difficulties in credit granting requirements.",
        "Regarding local activity, fourth-quarter figures available were in line with assumptions in the baseline scenario of the December Monetary Policy Report, which ratified that the disruptions caused by the social crisis had significantly affected the Imacec of October and November 2019 (-3.4 and -3.3% annually), where the annual fall in some services and trade deserved mention.",
        "On the opposite side of the spectrum, construction had shown positive growth in both months, and so had the manufacturing industry in November.",
        "At the same time, some indicators suggested that the negative effects had moderated in December.On the expenditure side, the contraction of private consumption’s tradable components stood out, as reflected in retail sales (INE) new car sales (ANAC), consumer goods imports (durable and non-durable), retail inventories that continued to be seen as high (IMCE) and consumer expectations that persisted in strong pessimistic territory.",
        "In the labor market, INE data for the moving quarter ending in November showed the unemployment rate at around 7.0%, while private and public salaried job creation was increasing in annual terms, concentrated mostly in public.",
        "Meanwhile, Universidad de Chile fourth-quarter 2019 saw the unemployment rate for Greater Santiago rising up to 8.8% and slightly negative annual employment growth, influenced mainly by the annual contraction of salaried employment, in a context where administrative data, such as December’s contract termination notices, showed an incipient deterioration.",
        "Furthermore, hiring expectations remained pessimistic in several sectors (IMCE).",
        "In addition, most respondents to the IPN of February said they had made no hiring and were more cautious in making and/or postponing this type of decisions.",
        "Some sectors reported layoffs, as well as fewer recruitments of seasonal summer workers, especially in the most severely affected sectors.About investment, capital goods imports had continued to contract in annual terms and business expectations remained pessimistic.",
        "In any case, the Corporation of Capital Goods (CBC)’s investment project survey for the fourth quarter of 2019 showed no big changes so far in the amounts committed for 2020 and 2021.",
        "On the other hand, fourth-quarter exports had fallen in annual terms, mainly due to supply-side factors that had affected industrial and mining shipments, while agricultural shipments had risen.",
        "In this scenario, private expectations as per the January 2020 Economic Expectations Survey (EES) for total and non-mining GDP growth had dropped in both cases to 1.2% annually for 2020 and 2.5% annually for 2021.",
        "The IPN of February showed a high level of uncertainty regarding the outlook for this year, beyond the fact that the immediate impact of the social crisis on business performance had been uneven across regions and economic sectors.",
        "Regarding fourth-quarter activity, in most regions performance was poor, especially in activities related to tourism, hotels and retail, where establishments in central areas had been the most affected, as they were more exposed to outbreaks of violence.",
        "In several regions, construction and real estate were also among the hardest hit.",
        "Still, more respondents reported some improvement in their activities in December compared to the previous two months.",
        "By contrast, some activities, such as those linked to the mining and salmon sectors, had continued doing business as usual.",
        "Going forward, most respondents said they were anxious about developments in March and April, particularly for fear of the return of violence, the outcome of the constitutional plebiscite and the progress of the measures under discussion.",
        "Given the difficulties in making projections, many had decided to postpone their investments.",
        "However, the large-scale projects under way in the mining, forestry and salmon sectors had not been modified significantly.",
        "Since the last Meeting, annual inflation had risen to 3% and the core measure (CPIEFE) had remained at around 2.5%.",
        "The evolution of both indicators had been lower than foreseen in the December Report.",
        "Going forward, the evolution of inflation remained exposed to opposing forces, whose relative impact was still uncertain.",
        "On the one hand, the outlook for activity remained weak and its recovery continued to depend on the economic agents’ reaction to the new scenario.",
        "On the other hand, the inherent pressures of the idiosyncratic depreciation that the peso had accumulated since October 2019 were still present.",
        "In this regard, most of respondents to the February IPN reported that costs had remained stable or increased slightly caused mainly by the higher prices of imported inputs, which they anticipated might intensify in the future.",
        "In some cases, this had resulted in higher final prices or fewer clearance sales.",
        "In others, respondents pointed out that the highly volatile exchange rate had led them to postpone adjustments to final prices, and that the pass-through could begin to occur as the large inventories were used up.",
        "Also, the cost outlook that was reflected in the IMCE business confidence showed increases in recent months.",
        "With respect to private inflation expectations, one-year-ahead measurements had risen, while two years ahead they had remained around 3%.In this context, expectations for the MPR implicit in the prices of financial assets and inferred from surveys to specialists (i.e.",
        "the Financial Brokers Survey and the EES) anticipated that the benchmark rate would remain at 1.75%, at least until the first half for 2021.",
        "It was noted that the volatility of the domestic macroeconomic scenario had decreased significantly since the December Meeting, thanks to several factors combined, in particular the decline of the most violent episodes—and a lower level of disruptions in productive activities—and the extraordinary measures taken by the Bank.",
        "Plus the more favorable response of the world markets to the first phase of the US-China trade agreement, coupled with early signs of stabilization or even improvement in developed economies.",
        "Most recently, the latter had been overshadowed by the Coronavirus crisis.",
        "It was mentioned that now that several weeks had passed since the outburst of the social crisis, it was clear that local agents had made major adjustments to their investment portfolios.",
        "Exchange rate intervention and liquidity measures by the Central Bank, as well as the government sales of dollar assets to finance its deficit, had helped to accommodate this adjustment, thus avoiding excessive strain on domestic financial markets.",
        "In the near future, this situation should continue to be monitored, as should foreign investors’ perceived risk in Chile.",
        "The data showed that investment flows from non-residents were still on positive ground and recent bond issues abroad by both the government and companies had been successful, with no big increases in risk premiums.",
        "In this sense, the evolution of the risks of the external scenario was particularly important, as although the occurrence of more positive or more negative scenarios could be just as likely, at this point the impact of the latter could have more severe consequences on the local economy.",
        "It was noted that overall domestic growth figures had performed in line with the Monetary Policy Report, but there were still several aspects that needed resolution.",
        "One was the magnitude of the contribution of fiscal expansion to the cycle, as there could be tensions between short-term needs and medium- term sustainability of the fiscal accounts.",
        "Another was that consumer loans were decelerating rapidly, suggesting a more cautious behavior of households, together with credit constraints that were perhaps becoming more stringent on the credit suppliers’ side.",
        "Although the labor market was not showing strong evidence of weakening in the surveys, consumption was a matter to be monitored very carefully, because, in the last few years, this component had sustained a good part of domestic growth.",
        "With regard to the situation of companies and investment, the short-term data also showed nuances.",
        "On the one hand, expectations were very negative, as was the evolution of some investment components and, on the other, credit creation figures remained fairly reasonable, while investment components more closely linked to mining maintained an interesting rate of expansion.",
        "It was stressed that risks of a further weakening of the economy were still present.",
        "It was brought up that the December Report noted that uncertainty was fundamentally affecting the performance of the economy and that a recovery would be conditional on this uncertainty being reduced.",
        "In the weeks following the December Report, progress had been made on the legislative agenda, both on political and economic issues, and even on issues related to the protection of public order.",
        "However, it was yet to show up in economic indicators reflecting better expectations, and this would continue to hold back economic recovery.",
        "About inflation, it was noted that it had been below the forecast in the December Report.",
        "A first reading led to think that this surprise did not signal a substantial change in the medium-term outlook, as it originated in the behavior of some more volatile prices.",
        "However, it did raise a red flag, as it could somehow mean that the transmission of the idiosyncratic peso depreciation was not evolving with the intensity expected in December, or that disinflationary pressures were more acute than expected.",
        "The March Report, where some more information would be available, would allow a better assessment of the implications of this surprise.",
        "In any case, in the medium term, inflation expectations remained at around 3%, even though in the shorter term they were below the Bank’s projections.",
        "All five Board members agreed that the option of holding the MPR at 1.75% dominated over any other.",
        "In a context where news accumulated since the latest Report did not alter substantially the macroeconomic scenario, holding the MPR was consistent with keeping a highly expansionary monetary impulse and the contents of the Statement from the last Meeting.",
        "All the Board members agreed that beyond the decision of this Meeting, the recovery of the economy and the achievement of the inflation target required monetary policy to remain expansionary during the coming quarters, lending counter-cyclical support to the economy.",
        "One Board member stressed that keeping the MPR unchanged contributed to said expansionary monetary policy, considering that inflation was somewhat higher than had been projected before the social crisis.",
        "Moreover, he felt that the Bank’s extraordinary measures had made it possible to maintain this monetary stimulus, because otherwise financial and monetary conditions would clearly be much tighter than they are today.",
        "He concluded by indicating that the March Report should assess whether the monetary conditions were indeed contributing to the process of refinancing and deleveraging of persons and companies unfolding in an environment aligned with macro projections and the achievement of the inflation target.",
        "In his view, the risk of having an inflation rate below the target could become significant in the coming quarters.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Naudon and Costa voted for keeping the MPR at 1.75%.",
        "In the Board’s opinion, the orientation of monetary policy in the December Report remained fully in force, so the MPR had to hold on to its strong expansionary stance to cushion the adverse impacts of the deteriorated internal confidence.",
        "At the same time, the Board considered that the persevering uncertainty limits the possibility of anticipating now a course of action for the trajectory of monetary policy over the coming months.",
        "All five Board members reiterated their disposition to calibrate monetary policy to meet the inflation target, factoring in the responses of the Chilean economy to the effects and evolution of the ongoing crisis.",
        "Chilean economic conditions had worsened dramatically since the last Monetary Policy Report.",
        "The global spread of Covid-19, the measures implemented to contain it and the uncertainty about its reach had been reflected in plummeting stock markets and asset prices around the world, paving the way for a global economic recession in 2020.",
        "The Chilean economy was also being affected substantially by the pandemic, driving projections of a GDP contraction and a further deterioration of the labor market this year.",
        "The Board had made a series of decisions to mitigate the effects of this new scenario, including a cut of 75 basis points off the MPR at a special meeting held on 16 March and the implementation of a package of extraordinary measures aimed at ensuring adequate access to credit and the normal functioning of financial markets.",
        "These measures sought to preserve the correct transmission of monetary policy and facilitate credit flow to companies and individuals in need of funds to overcome this complex stage, aiming to soften its impacts on employment, income and households’ well-being.",
        "There was discussion on the evolution of the macroeconomic outlook, concluding that despite the short time that had elapsed since the previous Meeting —on March 16— the deterioration observed was very significant.",
        "Since then, the number of confirmed cases of infection in the world had almost quadrupled, and many governments, including in countries with a limited number of cases, had applied non-pharmacological containment measures that were severely affecting productive activity.",
        "Although there were no accurate measurements, the steep drop in activity in China upon implementing the first sanitary measures anticipated double-digit monthly declines in the countries adopting them, affecting a wide spectrum of economic activities.",
        "Moreover, as the epicenter of the crisis had moved to Europe and the United States, the risk to the global economy was enormous, with a social and economic cost that could even be amplified in the emerging world.",
        "Attention was drawn to the important need to clarify that this crisis was occurring in the corporate sector, which made it different from earlier catastrophes.",
        "In particular, a corporate crisis typically not only makes it necessary for companies to renew their loans, but it is also essential for them to be able to increase the amounts so they can cover temporary shortfalls in earnings.",
        "This posed a major challenge in a context where not many agents were willing to take risks and where the information asymmetries associated with the corporate crisis were gigantic.",
        "Therefore, in order to ensure the proper functioning of monetary policy transmission channels, the Bank might have to explore new paths never before considered.",
        "It was also stressed that acting in time to safeguard the proper functioning of the markets was key, as there was the risk of significant decapitalization of companies of all sizes, which could hurt the solvency of financial intermediaries and call for much more radical measures.",
        "The way that local financial markets had welcomed the measures taken by the Bank was commented, in particular the MPR cut at the special meeting of 16 March.",
        "At the time —it was recalled— there was debate on whether there was a very strong trade-off between the greater monetary impulse that was necessary in the new macroeconomic scenario and the problems that could endanger the stability of the financial markets.",
        "The events of the last two weeks pointed to a significant change in this trade-off.",
        "On the one hand, the macroeconomic scenario had deteriorated significantly both internally and externally, but on the financial side there seemed to be slightly positive news.",
        "Although financial markets were highly volatile, the exceptional measures taken in many countries, including Chile, had been correctly assimilated by the markets, allowing them to gradually adjust to the new reality.",
        "All five Board members agreed that the assessment of the macroeconomic outlook and its implications for inflation left no doubt that a boost in the monetary stimulus was needed.",
        "While the peso depreciation put upward pressure on inflation in the short term, this was contained by the sharp fall in oil prices, while in the medium term, inflationary pressures were clearly determined by the weakening of the economy and increasing capacity gaps.",
        "They also agreed that the wisest decision was to bring the policy rate to its technical minimum of 0.5%.",
        "Several Board members noted that although the option to lower the MPR by 25 points was plausible, it became less valid considering the need to act quickly.",
        "In the opinion of one Board member, the only possible decision was to cut 50 basis points off the monetary policy rate.",
        "All the Board members agreed that not only was it necessary to lower the MPR, but it was also essential to give a clear signal that this monetary policy expansionary stance would be kept for a long period of time.",
        "One Board member noted that, beginning with this Report, the MPR corridor had been added to the monetary policy communication tools.",
        "He further noted that although this corridor was created to factor in the uncertainty about the future evolution of the MPR, on this occasion he could ascertain that that it would remain at its technical minimum for several quarters.",
        "All five Board members agreed on the need to intensify the coordination measures with the other economic authorities.",
        "One Board member recalled that while the Bank’s decisions were essential for companies to cover their cash deficits and ensure their survival in such a difficult context, success in achieving this purpose required the contribution of other players, including commercial banks, regulators and the government.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Naudon and Costa voted in favor of lowering the MPR by 50 basis points, to 0.5%.",
        "They all agreed that the analysis in the Monetary Policy Report was clear about the need to sustain a strong monetary impulse for a prolonged period.",
        "In particular, considering that the pandemic would cause a major drop in activity in Chile and the world during this year, followed by a rapid recovery in 2021.",
        "Its negative effects could be mitigated if credit was kept flowing to sustain the smooth functioning of the payment system, thus limiting the more persistent damages to activity, employment and income.",
        "The entire Board agreed on the need to safeguard the proper functioning of the monetary policy pass-through channels, so the MPR reduction should be accompanied by non-traditional measures to support liquidity and boost credit.",
        "Considering the number of measures already in operation and the need to review their limits and conditions, the Board members voted unanimously in favor of extending both the amounts and maturities of the bank bond purchase program, but still keeping an eye on the prudential limits to the accumulation of these liabilities.",
        "August’s Imacec posted an 11.3% annual fall in domestic activity in the month, contracting somewhat more than expected by the market, although with increasing speed compared to the previous month: 2.8% month-on-month in de-seasonalized terms.",
        "Sectors such as construction and services continued to show markedly negative annual variation rates, still affected by the quarantines that had been in place throughout the month.",
        "Mining had also underperformed in annual comparison, although production levels remained high.",
        "In contrast, retail had made significant progress and had gone positive in annual variation terms for the first time since February.",
        "This, in a context where consumption was being temporarily boosted by the partial withdrawal of pension savings and, to a lesser extent, by fiscal transfers.",
        "This had resulted in significant purchases of goods, important inventory depletion, and higher consumption-related imports.",
        "As for investment, various indicators—including wholesale trade, home sales, construction expectations (IMCE)—had improved in the margin, despite being still low, in general.",
        "The labor market had continued to show signs of stabilization.",
        "Employment and hours worked had seen an incipient improvement in the moving quarter ending in August, while wages showed no significant change.",
        "Both the Bank’s online job ad index and hiring expectations (IMCE) had recovered partially.",
        "The above, together with the progress of the deconfinement process and the government’s employment subsidy measures made it possible to foresee further progress in this area in the coming months.",
        "Business and consumer expectations had continued to recover, although still on pessimistic territory.",
        "The median of October’s Economic Expectations Survey (EES) yielded an estimated fall in GDP of 5.5% this year, albeit with a high dispersion of responses.",
        "Preliminary qualitative information, compiled through interviews conducted for the Business Perceptions Report (IPN), indicated that the outlook for activity was strongly associated with the temporality of the pandemic’s cycle.",
        "Thus, improved conditions were observed in the North and a more depressed situation in the South.",
        "However, the withdrawal of pension savings and fiscal measures had caused effects across all regions and in several sectors and in the repayment of financial obligations.",
        "Regarding trade, a large number of respondents reported inventory shortages, increased demand and price hikes.",
        "However, most perceived this as a transitory effect.",
        "Respondents continued to report a high level of uncertainty, mainly associated with the resurgence of violence outbursts in the country.",
        "Business perceptions regarding the labor market were not as pessimistic as in previous months.",
        "There were reports of fewer layoffs in recent months and the return of employees covered by the Suspended Employment Law.",
        "In any case, for the following months increases only in the number of seasonal workers were foreseen because uncertainty held back new hirings.",
        "Moreover, the prevailing vision was that not all the layoffs due to the pandemic would be reversed.",
        "Generally speaking, the behavior of local financial markets matched those abroad, with stock market losses and a depreciation of the peso.",
        "Special mention deserved the rise in long-term interest rates, which in the cases of BCPs and BCUs were up between 25 and 30 basis points from early September.",
        "In the money market, the cost of financing in pesos and dollars remained low, but with some increase in the latter.",
        "In this context, the Bank had announced at the end of September that it would lift the measures to mitigate the financial impact of the partial withdrawal of pension funds.",
        "Furthermore, on the day of the Meeting, the country had learned of Chile’s sovereign risk rating downgrade.",
        "Credit growth in the commercial segment showed less dynamism in the margin (9.5% real annual growth in September; 10.9% in August), while consumer loans showed a sharper contraction and mortgages posted a minor advance (-15.3 and 5.3% in real annual terms in September, respectively).",
        "In any case, commercial loans continued to grow above numbers of the beginning of the year, thanks to the strong impulse provided by the measures in place.",
        "Interest rates had fallen across all credit categories.",
        "Banks’ applications for phase II of the Credit Facility Conditional on Increased Lending (FCIC) amounted to just over 30% of available funds.",
        "According to August data from the Financial Market Commission, bank delinquencies of 90 days or more had been declining for several consecutive months, with a recent reduction in portfolios associated with individuals.",
        "Provisions showed no big variations, and remained at their highest levels of several years.",
        "The Bank Credit Survey of the third quarter reported tighter conditions for all types of loans, as higher risks were perceived in all segments.",
        "Meanwhile, household demand remained weak —for the consumer and mortgage segments—, related to the users’ worsened income and/or employment conditions.",
        "Regarding corporate demand, the unrelenting deterioration of investment-related requirements was compounded with a fall in working capital requirements.",
        "Preliminary qualitative information gathered for the Business Perceptions Report showed that most of those consulted so far did not foresee any imminent financing needs.",
        "This was explained by their gained access to credit, their improved financial situation, their reluctancy to increase their indebtedness in the face of perceived uncertainty, or because their applications had been turned down and they quit trying.",
        "Since the last Meeting, annual inflation had risen to 3.1% and its core component (i.e.",
        "CPI without volatiles) had risen to 2.9%.",
        "This increase was mainly explained by the rise in the prices of goods and foodstuffs in September, which had brought the monthly variation in the CPI to 0.6%.",
        "This evolution was mainly in line with the temporary boost in consumption of goods linked to the withdrawal of pension savings and to some short-term supply constraints to meet this demand.",
        "Into the medium term, inflationary pressures remained contained.",
        "As for inflation expectations, they had been adjusted upward in the short term.",
        "At December 2020, the median of the EES was 2.4% per year.",
        "Meanwhile, one year ahead the median had risen to 2.7% per year and that of the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) to 2.5%, while two years ahead it remained around 3%.",
        "In this context, expectations for the monetary policy rate (MPR) implicit in financial asset prices and included in the surveys (EES and FTS) continued to point to the rate being kept at 0.5% for a prolonged period of time.",
        "On the external front, incoming data pointed to some moderation in the pace of economic recovery, especially in developed countries.",
        "This was visible in indicators such as manufacturing output, services and retail sales, as well as in the PMIs.",
        "The fundamentals of private consumption were still weak, particularly consumer confidence and labor market indicators.",
        "After the previous Meeting, there had been no major developments in fiscal support programs, and the few announcements that had been made entailed a reduction in previously adopted stimulus measures.",
        "This, in a context where knowledge had been gained in handling the pandemic, which allowed pacing the containment measures despite increases in infections, as a better control of its effects had been gained.",
        "In the emerging world, the dynamism of activity and demand variables in China were worth noting, including investment in fixed assets —state-owned and private—, foreign trade, retail sales and business prospects.",
        "In Latin America, economic recovery was lagging, reflecting quite diverse epidemiological, economic and social realities, which also reflected differences in countries’ policy responses.",
        "Although market projections for global growth this year had not changed much, their composition did show changes, with better prospects for developed economies, especially the United States, and a deteriorating outlook for emerging economies.",
        "With respect to commodity prices, copper had remained at around US$3 per pound and oil had fallen to around US$40 per barrel.",
        "The financial markets had seen more episodes of volatility.",
        "With respect to the previous Meeting, stock markets had shown some falls, currencies had depreciated across the board with respect to the dollar and risk premiums had been slightly reduced.",
        "Credit had been decelerating in some economies and corporate risk remained contained.",
        "However, the risk of the possible consequences of high corporate indebtedness had risen.",
        "Monetary incentives from central banks remained high, while many policymakers had reaffirmed their commitment to keep them in place, scale them up and/or adopt new measures if necessary.",
        "Commenting the macroeconomic scenario, it was agreed that, in general terms, the bulk of information indicated that both the global and local economy had evolved in line with forecasts in the September MP Report.",
        "In general, activity in Chile and many other countries was on a recovery path, thanks to the momentum provided by the various economic policies implemented and the sanitary management of the crisis.",
        "Still, it was mentioned that clearly the evolution of the economy was and would continue to be closely linked to steps forward and backward in the control of the pandemic.",
        "This raised a note of caution, because while some countries had significantly reduced the number of cases, others were struggling with a significant increase.",
        "There was consensus that the set of risks remained very important, and their implications were generally negative.",
        "On the external side, in recent weeks uncertainty had resurfaced regarding the evolution of the pandemic, both because of the increase in infections in Europe, the scars it was leaving on economic activity, and also regarding the possibility of having a vaccine widely distributed in a relatively short period of time.",
        "There were also several important political risks, such as the elections in the United States, the Brexit unfolding in Europe and other sources of recent geo-political conflict.",
        "Locally, the data on activity, demand, employment and inflation had shown some differences with forecasts, with different signs and uncertain persistencies.",
        "It was noted that the data suggested that the worst of the pandemic had been left behind, and that the negative surprise of August could be due to a delay in opening compared to what had been anticipated in the September MP Report.",
        "Incidentally, doubts remained as to when to expect the economy to recover.",
        "This was especially visible when considering that part of the increased dynamism of demand was associated to transitory effects, such as the impact of the withdrawal of pension savings and increased fiscal transfers, among others.",
        "In fact, these same factors would explain the unexpected rise in some prices, which suggested that the medium-term outlook continued to be one where downward inflationary pressures predominated, along with capacity gaps that would continue to be substantial in the coming quarters.",
        "The evolution of political risks was another factor of concern both globally and locally.",
        "In many countries, the Covid-19 shock had caused considerable stress on society and its authorities, whether through advances and setbacks in fighting the pandemic, the imposition of sanitary measures and the implementation of compensatory economic policies.",
        "In Chile, this phenomenon was accentuated by the preceding social crisis, the high level of distrust in some institutions and the tensions between government branches.",
        "It could not be ruled out that these phenomena were affecting the price of some Chilean financial assets.",
        "Although the CDS and EMBI had declined since the last Meeting and long rates stood at low levels, it was undeniable that, as of the second quarter of this year, the dollar and longer-term interest rates were on an upward trend.",
        "The important correction of the stock market stood out, as it had fallen more than that of other comparable economies.",
        "In addition, while the Meeting was taking place, the country had learned of the downgrading if its credit rating by a risk-rating agency, a correction that was expected by the market and reflected, in the agency’s statement, the weakening of public finances caused by greater spending pressures in the wake of the social outbreak and the pandemic.",
        "It was further noted that in the current context it was difficult to discern how much of the movement of long rates was due to rather transitory phenomena and how much to more persistent factors, for which the policies of the Central Bank had little capacity to reverse.",
        "At the opposite side, it was noted that some of the risks had evolved positively.",
        "On the one hand, for the first time in several months, positive numbers had been achieved in job creation, and at the same time administrative data suggested that the impact of the crisis on salaried employment had been somewhat less than estimated.",
        "This, coupled with the announcement of the employment subsidy program, somehow mitigated the risk of a further worsening of the labor market.",
        "Another important element was the fact that the expected inflation measures had moved away from the levels that could cause concern for the anchoring of expectations, partly because of the surprise of September, which also reduced one of the risks considered a while back.",
        "All five Board members agreed that, the same as in previous meetings, the macroeconomic context produced by the pandemic only stressed the message that monetary policy would continue to be highly expansionary for a prolonged period of time.",
        "This meant keeping the MPR at its technical minimum for several quarters and the prevailing unconventional measures in place.Towards the medium term, all the Board members agreed that it would be essential to to be on the alert for events that could generate instability in the financial markets, reacting in an effective and timely manner.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Naudon and Costa voted for holding the MPR at 0.5%.",
        "The also agreed to keep in place the unconventional measures to support liquidity and credit, furthering the current asset purchase program.",
        "In addition, should the evolution of the economy would so require, they would continue to explore options to adjust said impulse and lend support to financial stability.",
        "CENTRAL BANK OF CHILE of interpretation, the Spanish original prevails.",
        "The evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic and the actions taken to contain it presented an unparalleled, massive shock on the global economy.",
        "Its immediate impact was severe, it was lasting more than previouly expected and its longterm repercussions were still uncertain.",
        "The whole situation had deteriorated activity and employment beyond the forecasts of only a few months back, with a high degree of uncertainty regarding the unfolding of the pandemic and the best strategies to fight it.",
        "No country in the world had been spared, so most of them were experiencing significant drops in activity this year.",
        "Chile was no exception, and foresaw for 2020 the greatest contraction in 35 years.",
        "In this context, the main components of domestic demand had seen major setbacks while inflationary pressures had fallen dramatically.",
        "The authorities had devised unprecedented responses to this scenario, using the policy space built over decades of responsible macroeconomic and financial management.",
        "The Board had taken the MPR to its technical minimum, and had adopted several measures to ensure liquidity provision and incentives to credit and, at its May Meeting, had committed further non-conventional measures should the evolution of the economy so require The discussion focused on how the macroeconomic scenario was evolving in response to the pandemic, in particular the size and simultaneity of the drops in activity in several countries, plus the negative impact on the labor market.",
        "It was noted that some countries were already beginning to show some incipient signs of a recovery, but in any case the projections of only three months back had been largely exceeded, revealing a much deeper crisis.",
        "In Chile, the effects were also strong, with a fall in the April Imacec in the order of 14%, and a dramatic deterioration of the labor market, which anticipated a very significant downturn in activity in the second quarter.",
        "These went far beyond the March forecast, precisely because the evolution of the pandemic had proved to be much worse than projected then.",
        "This was consistent with the containment measures, which had been more prolonged and had spread over an increasing proportion of the territory, which would take a toll on the pace of recovery, because the longer the freeze-up of economic activities continued, the worse the financial and asset situation of businesses, families and the government would be.",
        "As for inflation, it was striking that in practically every country it had been below its pre-crisis forecasts, even after correcting for the effects of the drops in oil prices.",
        "One interesting aspect about the response to the pandemic was that, while sanitary approaches to dealing with it had been very different from one country to another, economic measures were becoming much more similar, at least in those economies that had fiscal and monetary policy space, mainly strong fiscal support programs to sustain household and corporate income, and very aggressive monetary policies, both conventional and unconventional.",
        "This had eased pressures on the financial markets, allowing asset prices to recover in line with falling spreads.",
        "In this regard, it was noted that the Chilean government had promoted several initiatives that involved a significant fiscal impulse, to which in the days prior to the Meeting the agreed Emergency Plan had been added.",
        "This plan considerably reinforced previous announcements, and its implications on activity and inflation had been preliminarily incorporated into the projections of the Monetary Policy Report.",
        "There was agreement that the actions to provide liquidity and support the granting of loans, promoted by the Bank, the Finance Ministry and the Financial Market Commission (CMF) had not only succeeded in avoiding a fall in commercial credit, but had also allowed them to increase their rate of expansion at the margin.",
        "However, it was clear that while this would have been adequate to finance a large part of the bank credit needs in the March scenario, in the current scenario it was insufficient in view of the prolonged disruption of economic activities All five Board members agreed that, given the macroeconomic context caused by the pandemic and with the MPR at its current technical minimum estimate (0.5%), there could be no other option than to keep it unchanged while stressing the message that it would be held flat for a prolonged period of time, longer even than had been previously estimated.",
        "They also agreed that there was conclusive evidence that the economy was requiring a stronger monetary stimulus that had to be implemented using unconventional measures.",
        "About the type and scope of the unconventional measures to be implemented, one Board member remarked on the complexity of conducting monetary policy under exceptional conditions, since quantifying the necessary stimulus, as well as understanding its transmission to the economy, were different than they were in normal circumstances.",
        "He added that, in any event, with the policy toolkit currently available to the Bank, an appropriate strategy could be adopted, encompassing a range of possible transmission channels.",
        "In the view of this Board member, implementing a new phase of the FCIC would encourage a deepening of the counter-cyclical behavior of commercial credit.",
        "In this new stage, he continued, it was reasonable to recalibrate the parameters and modalities in order to increase the complementarity of this new FCIC with the existing guarantees in COVID loans, as well as to consider the role of non-bank credit intermediaries that depend themselves on bank financing.",
        "This can be complemented by a financial asset purchase program.",
        "This mechanism would allow, in principle, to reduce certain risk premiums in the capital market, facilitate portfolio rebalancing towards riskier assets, and directly provide liquidity to non-banking institutions, which nevertheless are important mobilizers of private savings.",
        "One Board member noted that the various measures implemented had been very effective in maintaining very high levels of liquidity and very low risk-free rates associated with that liquidity.",
        "In his opinion, however, credit presented problems that went beyond liquidity, in particular the risks associated with the granting of loans.",
        "On the latter, he believed that problems still existed that were preventing such liquidity from fully materializing into increased credit.",
        "He added that the Bank’s new measures could help at the margin to lower spreads and thus deal with the issue of risk, but would not necessarily solve it.",
        "Regarding the magnitude of the new monetary stimulus, all the Board members agreed that some figure of up to 10% of GDP seemed consistent with what the economy needed to navigate this complex period, to allow inflation to converge to the target and to ensure financial stability.",
        "One Board member commented that while this figure seemed reasonable, the doubts surrounding these estimates were significant, particularly because they were made in a very uncertain environment.",
        "One Board member agreed that it was difficult to accurately measure the magnitude of the additional impulse, but said that there were several metrics that could shed some light, such as the Covid loans’ outstanding balance that was still available and needed, the sensitivity of the total commercial credit stock to the flow linked to the FCIC, or the exercises regarding the financing needs of the corporate sector.",
        "In his opinion, a judicious review of this background suggested that an additional boost of up to 10% of GDP for the remainder of the year would ensure the objectives of price stability and normal functioning of the payments system.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Naudon and Costa voted for holding the MPR at its technical minimum of 0.5% while strengthening the policy orientation, noting that the MPR will be kept at that level over the entire policy horizon.",
        "At the same time, the Board decided to add an extra, unconventional boost of up to 10% of GDP by means of two measures.",
        "First, it agreed to open phase 2 of the FCIC for an amount of US$16 billion for a period of eight months.",
        "This program considers the strengthening of incentives for the provision of bank credit to small and medium-sized enterprises, and to non-bank credit providers.",
        "Second, it agreed to implement a special asset purchase program, in the amount of up to US$8 billion, over a period of six months.",
        "The latter will allow acquiring bonds from eligible issuers, in order to increase liquidity in the market, reactivate the bond market, reduce the cost of long-term borrowing, facilitate portfolio adjustments and strengthen medium-term inflation expectations.",
        "All the Board members stressed the need to extend the Bank’s powers and instruments to take action when confronting riskier scenarios, considering the high degree of uncertainty that still hovers over the spread of the pandemic, the performance of the domestic economy, and the dynamics of the financial markets.",
        "The macroeconomic scenario had continued to reflect the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
        "In Chile, the second-quarter data available confirmed a sharp economic contraction.",
        "Considering wider sanitary containment measures, May’s Imacec had dropped 15.3% annually, with decreases in almost every sector.",
        "Exports had shown greater resilience than expected, particularly in mining shipments and some industrial lines.",
        "Import levels, in turn, showed some stabilization, after the significant falls of previous months.",
        "Business and consumer expectations remained markedly pessimistic.",
        "In this context, the most stringent sanitary containment measures continued to affect an important part of the country, although health indicators had evolved favorably, which had allowed some regions to begin reducing the confinement measures.",
        "Various sources of quantitative information (i.e.",
        "surveys and administrative sources) reported a sharp deterioration of the labor market, in particular a significant fall in employment and a decrease in hours worked and wages.",
        "Inactivity had risen substantially, which, together with the Employment Protection Law, had contained an even greater increase in the unemployment rate, although indicators of underutilization had worsened further.",
        "The Bank’s Online Help Wanted index had stabilized in a low level and hiring expectations (IMCE), despite some improvement, remained in pessimistic territory.",
        "Preliminary qualitative information drawn from the Business Perceptions Report confirmed this evaluation of the labor market and revealed concerns on this front.",
        "Some respondents commented that they saw pending workforce adjustments and most said that they expected no further hirings in the near future.",
        "Hence, more respondents than not anticipated that employment would recover at a slower pace than activity.",
        "Several also pointed to a reduction in labor income resulting from shorter working hours, no overtime, reduced sales commissions, elimination of benefits and wage adjustments, among others.",
        "On the other hand, government measures to compensate for income loss had been strengthening since June.",
        "The evolution of consumption continued to be affected by these dynamics, in particular the sale of non-essential goods.",
        "In this context, the median of private expectations in July’s Economic Expectations Survey (EES) anticipated a GDP drop of 6.1% annually for this year, in line with the central scenario of the latest Monetary Policy Report, albeit with a high dispersion in these estimates.",
        "The domestic financial markets reflected both the somewhat better tone of the external scenario and the stronger boost from the domestic monetary policy.",
        "Long-term interest rates —BCP and BCU at 5 and 10 years— saw sharp decreases in the days following the June Meeting, of between 30 and 40 basis points.",
        "However, in the run-up to the July Meeting, amidst the Congress debate around the withdrawal of 10% of individual pension funds, this decrease had been importantly reversed.",
        "In the same context, the stock market returns had worsened and the peso, with ups and downs, had appreciated.",
        "In the money markets, financing costs remain contained in both pesos and dollars, despite a reduction in dollar liquidity.",
        "With respect to the previous meeting, bank spreads had widened in both the AA and AAA segments.",
        "Meanwhile, non-bank corporate spreads showed a heterogeneous evolution; while in the AA segment no changes were observed, in the AAA the spreads had increased noticeably.",
        "The annual variation in commercial loans had continued on the rise, while for consumer loans it had continued to fall (13.3% and -7.8%, in real annual terms respectively).",
        "The mortgage segment had decelerated its real annual growth from 8.8% to 7.8%.",
        "Commercial banks had applied to nearly 95% of the funds available under phase 1 of the Facility Conditional on Increased Lending (FCIC), and many had used up their full assigned amount.",
        "In addition, the resources of FCIC – phase 2 were already available.",
        "As for portfolio risk, between April and May the Financial Market Commission data showed no significant change in bank arrears of 90 days or more.",
        "Provisions had increased, albeit to a limited extent, between February and April, especially in the consumer segment.",
        "The second-quarter Bank Lending Survey reflected a tightening of credit supply conditions in every segment, owing partly to the risks present in the customer portfolio.",
        "Meanwhile, household demand for credit had fallen substantially, for both consumption and housing.",
        "In the corporate segment, demand continued to rise for funds to meet working capital needs, while it declined for funds to finance investment projects.",
        "Demand indicators from the real estate and construction sector pointed to further weakening.",
        "Since the previous Meeting, annual inflation had dropped to 2.6% while core inflation—CPI minus volatiles—had declined to 2.5%.",
        "This figure was in line with forecasts in the June Report, with persistently weak areas more closely related to services, in a context of low inflationary pressures due to the abrupt widening of the activity gap.",
        "Accordingly, June’s business expectations (IMCE) continued to show a weak outlook for future costs and prices.",
        "Inflation expectations showed no big change.",
        "One year ahead, in the EES they had remained at 2.5% while the Financial Brokers Survey (FBS) showed a decline to 1.7%.",
        "Two years ahead, the EES remained at 3.0% and the FBS at 2.6%.",
        "Expectations for the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) contained in both the EES and the FBS continued to foresee it unchanged at is technical lower bound of 0.50% for a protracted period of time, while those implicit in the prices of financial assets anticipated a transitory cut to 0.25%.",
        "At longer terms, asset prices pointed at the MPR standing at 0.5% over the entire two-year monetary policy horizon, while the FBS and the EES estimated a rise towards mid-2022, up to levels of 0.75% and 1%, respectively.",
        "In the external scenario, the figures for May and June showed improvements in the main economies, coinciding with their gradual reopening after historic falls in the previous two-month period.",
        "The upturn was visible in the manufacturing and retail sectors, along with labor market information which, at the margin, was also more positive in some of them.",
        "Business expectations (PMI) had recovered.",
        "Household expectations had also improved, although their performance and that of other indicators more closely related to private consumption augured a slow rebound in this expenditure component.",
        "In any case, all these variables remained well below pre-pandemic levels, while important risks remained concerning the performance of activity going forward, mainly considering the recent resurgence of Covid-19 in several countries, and restated confinements in some places.",
        "The sanitary situation had complicated particularly in the United States, where the new quarantines imposed threatened to halt the recovery of mobility and the performance of its economy.",
        "In this context, the overall markets’ estimates for world growth had not changed materially in the last month, although some further deterioration in Latin America stood out.",
        "This region was facing the most complex situation, with long-standing doubts regarding the handling of the sanitary emergency and deep damage especially on employment, which pointed to a sluggish recovery.",
        "Central banks and governments had maintained their efforts or made additional economic policy announcements, holding on to their highly expansionary tone.",
        "On the monetary side, this included further interest rate cuts in some countries or the extension of unconventional plans, with actions concerning the pandemic being led by the Fed and the European Central Bank.",
        "On the fiscal front, there was also increased spending packages in some economies, further swelling the debt of governments, in some cases to their bulkiest in decades.",
        "In the last month, the international financial markets had seen some fluctuations associated with the aforementioned upsurges, and with news from the commercial and geopolitical scenarios.",
        "In any case, they had kept a more positive tone, because of both the economic measures adopted and the improvement of effective activity data.",
        "Thus, although with limited movements overall, in the last month several economies had exhibited improvements in their stock markets, spreads and currencies, while a large part of long-term interest rates had declined.",
        "The emerging world continued to see reversals in capital outflows.",
        "Commodity prices had also picked up, driven particularly by a brighter outlook for activity in China and, in the case of copper, also by supply-side factors.",
        "Thus, copper had risen 14%, to near US$3 per pound, oil (the WTI-Brent average) had risen 9%, to US$42 per barrel, while foods posted their first monthly increase in the year so far.",
        "There was discussion about the evolution of the external scenario, noting that the recent developments were in line with expectations.",
        "On the one hand, global growth prospects had stabilized and financial markets maintained a favorable outlook, leaving the most stressful moments behind.",
        "On the other hand, there was progress in the successive openings in several economies, with numbers that confirmed this gradual recovery in line with projections or even with some positive surprises.",
        "In addition, the price of copper, which was affected by supply and demand conditions, had outperformed expectations.",
        "However, the risks of new epidemiological outbreaks and the need to impose new containment measures—or to impose a more paused withdrawal of the ones in place—had been increasing in recent weeks, especially in the United States, and new sources of conflict were re-emerging in the political arena, particularly in the relationship between the US and China.",
        "Internally, there was agreement that the activity and price data of recent months fell within the scope of the June Report’s baseline scenario.",
        "However, the risks were high, especially since the more stringent sanitary containment measures had been extended beyond predictions and the labor market had worsened significantly.",
        "In particular, it was mentioned that the extension of quarantines might significantly tighten financing and credit conditions for companies that, given their size, were neither small enough to access Covid-related credit lines nor large enough to access the capital market.",
        "Coupled with the poorer performance of the labor market, a scenario could be emerging in which the post-pandemic economy’s ability to recover would be affected.",
        "This was especially complex in a context where the political cycle was introducing more uncertainty about the future evolution of the economy, particularly because of its impact on investment.",
        "In any case, they stressed the improvements in sanitary indicators and the possibility that stricter containment measures might be relaxed over a shorter time horizon, something that was not thought possible just a few weeks back.",
        "As for the domestic financial market, it was pointed out that liquidity levels were still high, with interest rates aligned with the message of the MPR being kept at its technical minimum for an extended period and long-term rates that had fallen in response to the monetary policy announcements of the previous Meeting.",
        "However, the latter’s reversal of recent days was also mentioned, in the midst of the discussion about the withdrawal of funds from the pension funds.",
        "Regarding credit, there was agreement that the growth in commercial loans showed that the stimulus measures provided by the Bank, the CMF and the Government were helping to provide significant financing flows to companies, which were vital to overcome the economic emergency caused by the pandemic.",
        "It was noted that the existence of Fogape guarantees, which complemented the liquidity available with a credit-risk buffer, had been a very relevant factor in the good evolution of credit.",
        "However, it was also said that the data suggested that the credit-risk problem was still significant and might be escalating, and this was an important issue, because the increase in credit flows not only depended on the provision of liquidity, but also required limiting the risks associated with credit intermediation.",
        "In particular, care had to be taken to ensure that the longer-lasting quarantines and weaker activity would not imply firms going from facing a liquidity problem to facing a solvency one, which had very different consequences for the economy and for the kind of actions that had to be taken.",
        "All five Board members agreed that, given the macroeconomic context created by the pandemic and with the MPR at its 0.5% technical lower bound, there was no other option than to keep it untouched and strengthen the message that it would remain there for a prolonged period of time.",
        "On unconventional measures, all the Board members agreed that the decisions made at the last Meeting had been fully validated, which justified keeping them in place.",
        "The increased monetary stimulus continued to help ensure that commercial credit, backed by the established guarantees plus regulatory measures, continued to sustain the productive sector.",
        "In turn, the asset purchase program had been well received, whose magnitude and timing seemed appropriate under the circumstances.",
        "All the Board members agreed that beyond the fact that the data of recent months were in line with expectations, the most relevant question to ask was how robust and sustainable the economic recovery would be.",
        "The answer was not obvious, because the scale of the shock was causing many scars, particularly to individuals and businesses, whether due to lost jobs and income, solvency problems, or more permanent adjustments that should be made to the operation of some sectors.",
        "In the Board’s opinion, all the above heightened the importance of the role played by public policy.",
        "In the upcoming stage, these would be as important as they had been during the shock containment stage, especially regarding the rehiring of workers, the restructuring of companies and the administration of financial conditions and obligations, all of which while also preventing sources that could reactivate the epidemic.",
        "There was agreement that the challenges for monetary policy were also considerable in this context.",
        "The measures adopted by the Bank in recent months had been effective not only in helping mitigate further damage to the economy and the population, but also in ensuring the countercyclical behavior of credit and financial conditions.",
        "Maintaining this orientation would sustain the economy’s recovery capacity and, with it, the convergence of inflation to the policy target.",
        "All the Board members drew attention to the effects that Congress approval of the bill of pension fund withdrawal could have on the economy, because of its impact on both the financial markets and domestic demand.",
        "They agreed that there was no obvious policy response, beyond the fact that the necessary measures should be implemented to ensure that there would be no excess volatility that would compromise financial stability as the pension funds were being liquidated.",
        "They also agreed that a clearer assessment of these issues should be made as the bill advanced in its legislative process, which together with the fine-tuning of the diagnosis on the economy’s evolution would be priority tasks until the September Monetary Policy Report.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Naudon and Costa voted for holding the MPR at 0.5%.",
        "They also agreed to keep in place the unconventional measures lending support to liquidity and credit.",
        "CENTRAL BANK OF CHILE interpretation, the Spanish original prevails.",
        "The macroeconomic scenario continued to evolve driven by the spread of Covid-19 and the containment measures needed to protect the populations’ health.",
        "After a sharp fall early in the second quarter, in recent months the Chilean economy had given signs of stabilization, combining a timid improvement in some sectors and marginal deterioration in others.",
        "This revealed an improved sanitary response, a faster adaptation to the new ways of operating of several activities, and the boost from the various measures implemented.",
        "However, the negative shock caused by the pandemic was very significant, as reflected in the high number of persons and firms whose income source had been affected.",
        "Considering the actual activity data for the first half of the year and a rebound consistent with the gradual withdrawal of sanitary controls and household income support measures, it was estimated that 2020 would end with a fall in GDP between 4.5% and 5.5%.",
        "This estimate assumed a significant recovery in the second half, even though only towards 2022 would the capacity gaps created in this period be closed and inflation converge to the target.",
        "However, this scenario was still marked by high uncertainty and substantial risks.",
        "Regarding the recent evolution of the macroeconomic scenario, there was consensus that symptoms of stabilization in both sanitary and economic terms could be observed thanks to a combination of factors.",
        "Among them were the way some sectors had been able to adapt to the new reality of the pandemic with more flexibility than previously thought, the various initiatives adopted to sustain businesses and individuals, as well as the fiscal and monetary stimulus measures implemented.",
        "It was agreed to make it very clear that, despite the milder decrease in the projected GDP fall and the signs of stabilizing activity, this should not be seen as a radical change in outlook.",
        "It was recalled that the forecasts in the September Monetary Policy Report assumed that GDP growth in the coming years would be significantly weaker than expected a year ago, placing activity close to 10% percent below the September 2019 projection.",
        "Moreover, this posed first-order challenges to the evolution of the labor market, particularly for employment growth.",
        "It also posed challenges regarding the credit quality of companies, households and the Government, associated with achieving a sustainable and credible public debt trajectory.",
        "In general, all this showed that the impacts of the various shocks that had affected the Chilean economy were going to linger on for quite some time.",
        "It was noted that the overall evolution of the macroeconomic scenario, along with a number of somewhat higher-than-expected inflation records, had helped improve the prospects inflation’s convergence to 3% and mitigate a considerable risk.",
        "It was pointed out that, all in all, the capacity gaps were certainly still present and therefore the challenge remained to stimulate the macroeconomic scenario by holding on to the highly expansionary monetary policy and maintaining the set of measures that were being implemented to support the economy.",
        "All five Board members agreed that, given the macroeconomic context caused by the pandemic, there was no other option than reinforcing the message that monetary policy would remain highly expansionary for a prolonged period of time.",
        "This implied that the monetary impulse should see no significant change with respect to the projections in the June MP Report and the July MP meeting, concluding that the MPR would remain at its technical minimum for several quarters and the unconventional measures would remain in force.",
        "Regarding the evaluation of the different programs that had been implemented, there was agreement in the Board that the behavior of the financial markets signaled that objectives were being achieved.",
        "In particular, those aimed at stabilizing the financial markets in the face of Pension Funds asset liquidation— the CC-VP and the purchase of bank bonds with a premium—seemed to have fulfilled their role, because together with the adequate portfolio management of the Pension Funds and the regulatory adjustments made, they had succeeded in keeping the calm of the markets, despite the enormous portfolio changes and flows.",
        "Meanwhile, the data suggested that the combination of low interest rates with measures to provide liquidity, especially phase 1 of the FCIC facility, had been a major driver of credit growth.",
        "With respect to the program of buying assets at market prices, it was suggested that it should be reactivated under conditions similar to those defined in June.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Naudon, and Costa voted for holding the MPR at 0.5%.",
        "They also agreed to keep in place the unconventional measures to lend support to liquidity and credit.",
        "In particular, they decided to maintain the asset purchase program established in June, by reactivating its bank-bond component at market prices, at a pace that would be announced briefly.",
        "The external scenario continued to evolve driven by the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and the sanitary control measures adopted by governments around the world.",
        "The first release of first-quarter GDP growth figures confirmed across-the-board contractions in the major economies, with downward surprises in several of them.",
        "By components, private consumption led these falls, consistently with the deterioration of the labor market that was emerging in most countries.",
        "Partial second quarter data, such as indicators of consumer and business expectations —in services and manufacturing—, among others, suggested still weak prospects, amidst perspectives that pointed to prolonged sanitary containment practices.",
        "In this context, the set of projections by public and private organizations anticipated a global recession for this year, with downturns in activity exceeding estimates in the March Monetary Policy Report.",
        "In the developed world, the poor performance of the US in the first quarter (-4.8% q/q annualized) stood out, as it had been far below the markets' expectations.",
        "This denoted the initial effects of the containment measures imposed since mid-March.",
        "The main Eurozone members had reported their worst results ever.",
        "Others, such as Japan and the UK, had not yet published their quarterly figures at the time of the Meeting, but data such as retail sales and manufacturing output suggested that GDP would fall sharply at the start of the year.",
        "In the emerging bloc, activity in China had fallen by 6.8% annually in the first quarter, a result that showed its first quarterly decline in recorded history, most notably the deterioration of the secondary sector (construction and manufacturing).",
        "In Latin America, the picture was very complex, amidst doubts about the management of the sanitary emergency in some countries and the prevalence of a series of socio-political hot spots.",
        "The monetary and fiscal authorities had continued to strengthen their stimulus plans to deal with this scenario, efforts which in the aggregate would go beyond their responses to the 2008-2009 financial crisis.",
        "The aim was to limit the negative impact on the situation of firms, households and financial institutions and to underpin the recovery in the second half of the year.",
        "From the monetary standpoint, several central banks had made further cuts in their benchmark rates and incorporated/extended non-conventional measures, which included different provisions for credit support to firms, asset purchase programs, among others.",
        "Governments, meanwhile, continued to implement substantial spending packages, often focusing on protecting the workers and sectors most affected by the current contingency.",
        "Nevertheless, concerns had been raised about the effectiveness of the macroeconomic policies in place, in particular about the insufficient flow of credit to smaller firms or to the consumer credit segment, which had led to new announcements by entities such as the Federal Reserve (United States) or the Bank of England.",
        "All these measures had helped to contain the worsening of global financial conditions during March —although a high degree uncertainty remained around health and economic matters.",
        "Thus, the world markets were reporting better stock markets, falling risk premiums, some currency appreciations against the dollar and declines in long-term interest rates in a significant group of economies.",
        "Commodity prices also showed some upturn, especially for metals.",
        "In the case of copper, its value was being supported by, among other factors, production cuts, accumulating a rise in the order of 7% with respect to the March Meeting.",
        "By contrast, the price of oil, although with major ups and downs, had fallen in the last month, severely affected by falling global demand and storage difficulties.",
        "Locally, the fall in the March Imacec had confirmed the onset of the economic contraction caused by the health emergency, ratifying the scenario set out in the last MP Report.",
        "A negative impact was observed in many economic sectors, particularly retail, education, transportation, restaurants and hotels.",
        "The fall in capacity utilization reported in the Industrial sector stood out.",
        "Nominal exports of goods also continued to be affected, mainly industrial shipments.",
        "On the domestic spending side, different indicators showed significant deterioration.",
        "Consumer expectations (IPEC) had declined sharply, consumption of nonessential goods (INE, ANAC) and imports of consumer goods —both durable and non-durable— had contracted dramatically.",
        "As for investment, the data at hand also pointed to a significant drop.",
        "Regarding the construction and other works component, business expectations (IMCE) had deteriorated, especially in construction.",
        "The CBC's investment project census for the first quarter of 2020 reported a rescheduling of projects towards the next few years.",
        "In the machinery and equipment component, capital goods imports continued to show a steep, widespread decline.",
        "In this context, expected annual growth for this year from the April Economic Expectations Survey (EES) pointed to a contraction of 2.2%, and an important rebound in 2021 (3%).",
        "About the labor market, various sources of information saw significant deterioration.",
        "The employment survey of the moving quarter ended in March (INE) reported an increase in the national unemployment rate and other expanded indicators/.",
        "In addition, annual employment growth continued to be almost entirely accounted for by informal wage earners.",
        "Administrative data showed a significant increase in termination notices and unemployment insurance claims, which was being partially cushioned by the measures announced by the Government.",
        "This was compounded with a sharp drop in the demand for labor in April and low hiring prospects (IMCE).",
        "In terms of qualitative information, the May Business Perceptions Report (IPN) ratified many of the above-mentioned trends.",
        "In particular, the respondents reported a transversal deterioration of their business results, as well as high uncertainty about their future performance.",
        "The sectors most affected were those related to service activities (i.e.",
        "hotels, restaurants and tourism) and retail.",
        "Construction and real estate were also among the worst hit.",
        "This had paralyzed most investments and led to adjustments in the labor market —for example, by invoking the Employment Protection Law, agreeing to reductions in wages and/or working hours with their workers, or by terminating some of their staff.",
        "Since the last meeting, domestic financial markets had replicated the positive trends in international markets, although several indicators continued to worsen compared to conditions prior to the escalating health emergency in Chile.",
        "Thus, the stock market had risen, rates for long-term instruments had fallen, money markets —especially in pesos— had become more liquid, bank spreads had fallen and the peso had appreciated against the dollar.",
        "In the credit market, there was a significant acceleration in commercial lending during March and —according to partial data— April.",
        "Meanwhile, the annual change in the stock of consumer loans continued to shrink in March, while mortgage loans continued to grow at around 8%.",
        "Consumer and commercial interest rates had fallen, while housing rates continued to rise.",
        "As for the measures adopted by the Central Bank, commercial banks had requested around US$12 billion —close to 50% of the available funds— under the Conditional Credit Facility for Increasing Placements (FCIC), supported by the expansion of collateral.",
        "In turn, the bank bond purchase program had accumulated $3.3 billion of the up to $8 billion available, while the Central Bank’s debt repurchase had reached just over $5.6 billion.",
        "Qualitative information showed a more restrictive credit market.",
        "On one hand, the May IPN indicated an increase in the financing needs of companies.",
        "While respondents saw no major obstacles in refinancing or deferring existing loans, access to new loans was more difficult, particularly due to risk policies.",
        "On the other hand, the Bank Lending Survey (ECB) for the first quarter showed tighter credit supply conditions for firms and individuals and a perceived weaker credit demand, except for the large company segment.",
        "In any case, both large companies and SMEs perceived an increase in their need for working capital.",
        "In personal banking, weaker demand was linked to deteriorating customers' income and/or employment conditions.",
        "Since the previous Meeting, annual inflation had fallen to 3.7% and the core measure had remained at around 2.5%.",
        "This figure had been somewhat lower than the March estimate, while the weakening of the lines most closely linked to services, stood out, which was linked to the demand that was being affected by Covid-19 containment measures.",
        "Looking ahead, medium-term inflationary pressures were still expected to be contained, in line with a greater widening of activity gaps as a result of the sanitary emergency, in addition to the fall in oil prices observed since the beginning of the year.",
        "According to some of the interviewees for the May IPN, although cost pressures linked to the pandemic and the exchange rate depreciation had increased, the transmission to prices had generally not occurred, with some exceptions.",
        "As for inflation expectations, the various indicators one-year-ahead had been adjusted downwards, most markedly those reflected in the prices of financial assets (inflation insurance and the FBS), while at two-year horizons they remained at around 3.0%.",
        "In this context, expectations for the monetary policy rate (MPR) implicit in financial asset prices and contained in the surveys to specialists available at the Meeting (i.e.",
        "the Financial Brokers Survey, FBS, and the Economic Expectations Survey, EES) anticipated that it would stay at 0.5% for an extended period.",
        "Both the FBS and the EES estimated that the MPR would not be raised any sooner than May 2021, while asset prices saw it rising by December that year.",
        "Two years ahead, asset prices predicted an MPR at 0.75%, while the FBS and the EES saw it at 1.25%.",
        "In discussing the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario, the conclusion was that a deterioration was perceived with respect to forecasts in the March MP Report.",
        "On one hand, beyond the effective evolution of activity and its possible differences with projections, there were growing doubts as to how fast the economy would recover in the second half of the year, both locally and externally.",
        "In this area, not only was the evolution of the pandemic becoming a particularly relevant factor, but also the fact that in various sectors the return to previous levels of activity was complex, due to both voluntary actions of the population and behaviors induced by the authority, which would undoubtedly hold back the recovery of activity beyond earlier estimates.",
        "On the other hand, news about inflation was not encouraging either.",
        "While both short-term projections and expectations were being significantly revised downwards, largely influenced by the oil price, the foreseen weaker performance of the economy posed significant challenges to inflation convergence to the target.",
        "The reversal of financial stress that had been observed globally in the second half of March was pointed out.",
        "The response of the economic authorities in various countries had been of great importance in this regard, underscoring an unprecedented opportunity and magnitude.",
        "The Chilean market also showed a more favorable performance than in March, with rising stock prices, lower long rates, increased liquidity in money markets —especially in pesos—, reduced bank spreads and an appreciation of the peso.",
        "It was recalled that, beyond the evolution of financial markets overall, the assessment made in the March Report placed the increase in credit to businesses as a key factor in averting permanent damage to the economy.",
        "The data available at the moment were not conclusive.",
        "On one hand, the increase in commercial credit from mid-March to date was worth noting.",
        "On the other, doubts remained as to whether this increase was consistent with the significant rise in the cash needs of the corporate sector in the face of falling sales, especially for smaller companies, where preliminary information on loans showed a lower growth rate than for large-scale companies.",
        "The complexity of assessing the extent of demand for credit was stressed, as the information available was inconclusive.",
        "On one hand, the Bank Lending Survey —which interviewed bank credit supply agents— suggested that, in several segments, there was no big difference between the evolution of credit demand and supply.",
        "On the other hand, the respondents to both the Business Perceptions Report and the special survey pointed to a much greater problem of resource availability.",
        "Finally, the use of the FCIC showed encouraging figures that went hand in hand with the increase in commercial credit; however, it was difficult to draw conclusions about its effectiveness without being clear whether it was providing access to liquidity to all sectors and whether there were disruptions that impeded an adequate fluency to all segments.",
        "In particular, it was striking that external and domestic bond issues had eased off considerably since March, considering they had experienced high dynamism in the first few months of the year.",
        "Thus, it was mentioned that reactivating this market was vital not only to provide resources to large companies, but also to make room for smaller companies in the bank credit market.",
        "It was noted that for the expected credit increase to materialize, it was not only necessary to provide more liquidity to the financial system —which was being achieved according to all the available information— but it was also necessary to encourage credit providers to assume greater risks.",
        "In this regard, it would be particularly relevant to review the impact that the Covid-related credit lines with State guarantees would have, which at the time of the Meeting -—-early May— had just begun operations, so information was yet to come to light.",
        "In any case, it was recalled that the comparative experience of other economies showed the difficulties in successfully implementing these measures, which raised an alert because good timing in the operation of these mechanisms was especially valuable.",
        "All the Board members agreed that given the macroeconomic context caused by the pandemic, and with the MPR at its technical minimum of 0.5%, there was no other option but to keep it there and reinforce the message that it would remain there for an extended period of time.",
        "All the Board members reiterated that in the current circumstances, monetary policy and financial stability decisions were closely linked, and that a significant increase in credit was still essential to mitigate the costs from the massive bankruptcy of companies which, although solvent, could not face this shock because of the great need for cash that had been generated in many of them.",
        "If this increase in credit were to occur, it would limit the destruction of jobs, resulting in a smoother reactivation of the economy that would allow inflationary convergence and would prevent some adverse effects on the financial system that could aggravate the costs of the pandemic.",
        "All the Board members agreed that, compared to the March Report assessment, they saw a worsening global economic outlook, as there was greater uncertainty about the form, speed and outcome of the withdrawal of the sanitary control measures in Chile and abroad.",
        "At the same time, there was downward pressure on inflation in the short term, a sharp deterioration in business and consumer expectations, and a significant expansion in commercial credit since the announcement of the stimulus measures.",
        "However, it was also apparent that there were areas of the economy that had not yet been reached by credit or economic stimuli that matched the scale of their needs.",
        "In the Board's opinion, all of the above could be summarized in that some risks had been materializing and others had become more likely, which would impose additional challenges on public policies and the institutions responsible for their implementation.",
        "In particular, only considering a more negative external scenario could anticipate a further widening of the activity gap which could jeopardize the convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "In this context, all the Board members agreed that it was necessary to review the effectiveness of the measures adopted, and its possible changes, that could enhance the conditions to improve.",
        "Thus, despite the credit increase since midMarch to date and how much the FCIC had been utilized, it was necessary to look closely at whether resources were reaching all sectors, especially smaller businesses.",
        "One Board member recalled that the objective of the FCIC was to provide a liquidity facility to banks on the condition that they would in turn grant such loans, but that under high risk conditions, the evaluation of credits was easier for bigger operations and/or with known companies.",
        "For this reason, the operation of the Covid lines would compensate with guarantees part of the risk, helping the credit to flow to the smaller firms.",
        "For the same reason, several Board members agreed that it was necessary to wait to see the results of these operations in order to have clarity as to whether further action was needed.",
        "One Board member drew attention to the fact that the ceiling of the FCIC line was being reached much faster than originally thought.",
        "In his view, this was not only the response to the increase in the overall flow of credit, but also to the fact that credit had increasingly focused on smaller companies —which was still a small fraction of total credit— since the beginning of April.",
        "Some Board members noted that given the success of the FCIC, that its limit was being reached much faster than expected, and that it was likely that the demand for credit would continue to be high, it was possible to revise upwards the overall limit of the FCIC, weighing, as at present, the overall growth and the composition of banking credit.",
        "Some Board members noted that, while the conditions for credit growth allowed banks access the maximum amount of the FCIC, which they had done rapidly, the use of the facility was lagging significantly behind which, coupled with data showing that there was a high degree of liquidity in the money market, suggested that no immediate changes to the Facility were necessary.",
        "They also noted that the information at hand did not guarantee that an increase in the facility would be available to those who needed it, in particular SMEs.",
        "Thus, any decision to expand the FCIC required a prior assessment of its functioning in conjunction with the Covid-related guarantee line, something that was not possible as yet.",
        "One Board member stressed that despite the FCIC being a good instrument, it should be used with caution because, by setting the interest rate at its minimum for four years for a significant fraction of the banks' loan portfolios, it had major implications for future monetary policy decisions.",
        "Therefore, first it was necessary to investigate whether the increased liquidity delivered via the FCIC was reaching the desired targets, in order to maximize its economic impact.",
        "For this, it was important to analyze the credit markets separately, to figure out how the liquidity injected in one place ended up flowing to another.",
        "In that sense, he expressed his concern about the corporate bond market, because although interest rates on risk-free bonds had fallen, there was some evidence that it was not being so easy for companies to borrow funds in that market.",
        "Thus, he believed it was necessary to see what kind of actions could be undertaken to enable the functioning of that market, which would also help to free up credit for smaller firms.",
        "All the Board members agreed that, given the changed economic outlook, it might be necessary to boost the monetary impulse going forward, paying special attention to its impact on the flow of credit into the economy.",
        "Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Naudon and Costa voted for holding the MPR at 0.5%.",
        "All the Board members agreed that the macroeconomic scenario could require further monetary stimulus.",
        "With the MPR at its technical minimum and the commitment to keep it there for an extended period, the additional efforts should focus on a broader and more systematic use of non-conventional policies.",
        "Therefore, intensive work needed to be undertaken to identify non-traditional measures to enhance the monetary impulse and support for financial stability.",
        "All the Board members agreed that beyond the necessary evaluations, the urgency of the actions was vital for their success and if changes were deemed urgent they would have to be made as quickly as possible."

    "2018": [
        "The information presented to the Board and its analysis are contained in the December Monetary Policy Report.",
        "It mainly shows that, after being under 2% almost the entire second half of 2017, annual inflation rose throughout this year, and has been around 3% during the past few months.",
        "Although part of this increase is explained by the more volatile CPI items and the depreciation of the peso, inflation of those components of the basket that are most sensitive to the activity gap (i.e.",
        "services and non-tradables) has grown steadily over the course of 2018, in line with the recovery of the growth rate that began more than a year ago.",
        "Despite taking a pause in the third quarter, due to particular mining- and manufacturing-specific factors, growth was expected to resume in the fourth quarter.",
        "Thus, estimates were that the economy would grow 4% this year and between 3.25 and 4.25% in 2019, and that headline and core inflation would converge to 3% before the end of the policy horizon.",
        "Critical factors in this outlook were the observed dynamism of investment and a vision of the labor market which, once all the available information was factored in, together with the impact of the significant immigration flow of recent years, showed a dynamic consistent with the improved performance of activity.",
        "In this context, the evolution of macroeconomic conditions made it necessary to reduce the monetary stimulus, a process that the Board estimated it would continue to undertake gradually and cautiously, while the uncertainties coming from the external scenario were still high.",
        "Regarding the information at hand at the Meeting, it was mentioned that, generally speaking, the evaluation of the macroeconomic scenario showed a continuation of what had been assessed in the September Report.",
        "This was reflected in minor changes in the Board’s view on growth, with downward corrections to inflation, but linked to the more volatile elements, excluded from core inflation.",
        "This, with a scenario that was not very different at the start, considering the analysis of the particular factors that had explained the economy’s performance of the third quarter, which was confirmed by fourthquarter data already available.",
        "All this occurred in a context where the message of monetary policy normalization conveyed in September had been, largely, correctly internalized by the market, as could be inferred from the evolution of market rates more closely related to monetary policy, especially at terms shorter than two years.",
        "About the external scenario, it was mentioned that risks remained that were important for the Chilean economy, especially of an abrupt tightening of financial conditions for emerging economies, the evolution of the US economy and its implications for the US monetary policy, plus various risks of a geopolitical nature.",
        "What was new, was the fall in the oil price, where it seemed that supply-side factors prevailed.",
        "Still, this diagnosis called for some caution, particularly because of the possibility that demand-side factors could have a greater impact on the recent evolution of this price.",
        "In any case, incoming news suggested that the risks had not worsened, because the markets had interpreted that the Fed had signaled some moderation in its future course of action while the fall in the oil price, with copper relatively stable, gave way to a terms-of-trade improvement.",
        "On the domestic front, it was noted that one element that had weighed significantly in recent analyses was the evaluation that the labor market behaved according to the rest of the economy, having succeeded in absorbing a significant increase in the labor supply causing no big rise in the unemployment rate and only a moderate slowdown in wage growth.",
        "Furthermore, the latest data pointed to a tendency of private salaried employment to consolidate a gradual recovery accompanied by a reduction in self-employment.",
        "All five Board members agreed that the macroeconomic scenario in which the monetary policy decision was based was virtually a continuation of that in the September Report, meaning that the economy had regained its ability to grow and its capacity gaps were narrowing.",
        "Hand in hand with the reduction of these gaps, inflation of services and nontradables had accelerated steadily since the beginning of the year.",
        "Core inflation, as measured by the CPIEFE, had been more subdued, but it was expected to accelerate over the months.",
        "All this meant that it had become less necessary to hold on to the monetary impulse established when the economic cycle was at its lowest, so now the appropriate thing to do was to continue withdrawing it in order for inflation to converge to the policy target within its medium-term horizon.",
        "In this scenario, it was agreed that it was logical to follow a monetary policy path similar to the one proposed in September.",
        "This meant leaving no doubt about the need for a normalization of monetary policy, but, in turn, ensuring that this normalization would be done gradually and with caution.",
        "“Gradually” should be understood as gradual and predictable adjustments to the MPR, which would give economic agents the necessary time to adjust; “with caution” referred to the need to opportunely analyze changes in the macroeconomic scenario that could warrant a change of trajectory.",
        "These changes were especially important given the risks characteristic of today’s world economy and the hypotheses that had been incorporated into the projections of the domestic scenario.",
        "In the external environment in particular, although the baseline scenario assumed a mild worsening, with a slowdown in Chile’s trading partners’ growth, tighter financial conditions and a deterioration in commodity prices, the possibility of more dramatic changes remained latent in the perceptions of risk, in the trajectories of monetary policy in the developed world, and an escalation of the trade conflict.",
        "The Board agreed that there was no doubt about the need to go ahead with the process of monetary withdrawal.",
        "The baseline scenario of the December Report assumed that the MPR would reach its neutral level during the first half of 2020.",
        "Being more precise than in September was necessary as time passed and the evolution of macroeconomic conditions confirmed the contours that the Report’s baseline scenario had maintained during the year.",
        "For some Board members, specifying that the arrival at the neutral level would occur in the first half of 2020 was not intended to modify market expectations —which assumed it would do so in late 2020— but only to be transparent about what the baseline scenario of the Monetary Policy Report looked like and to be able to maintain consistency in the Board’s statement.",
        "Board members commented on the rationality of the assumption for the MPR’s trajectory as a reference for the Board’s discussion.",
        "It was agreed that this should not be considered as a commitment, since depending on the evolution of risks and, in particular, the costs of these risks scenarios, the Board could decide on a trajectory of the MPR different from the one of the baseline scenario.",
        "In the opinion of one Board member, it was possible, for example, to think of a path of MPR increases slower than indicated by the working assumption of the Monetary Policy Report, as considered by market expectations.",
        "However, the validity of one or another path would only be solved in the light of the evolution of the economy.",
        "The Board agreed that the main reason for not changing the MPR at this Meeting was the consistency between the Bank’s actions and their communication, especially in that the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus would be done gradually and with caution.",
        "At the same time, they agreed that the upward bias that accompanied this decision reaffirmed that this process would continue in the months ahead.",
        "One Board member noted that holding the MPR this time, with an upward bias, could lessen the flexibility for the next Meeting’s decision, since it could be seen as a commitment to raise it in January, even if incoming data were less favorable than now.",
        "However, he added, there was also the opposite possibility —of better data than today’s— and, in that case, considering the option of raising the rate by 25 or 50 basis points would be inevitable at the next Meeting.",
        "The option of raising the MPR at this Meeting could be based on the idea that, given the wide gap between the current MPR and its neutral level, the risk of erring was low and would permit to pace future increases.",
        "However, its main caveat was that it could give a signal of urgency in the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus that was not consistent with the gradualism and caution committed by the Board.",
        "The Board decided, with the votes of Governor Marcel, Vice–Governor Vial and Board members García, Costa and Naudon, to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75%.",
        "The background information presented to the Board and the analysis thereof are contained in June’s Monetary Policy Report.",
        "Broadly, these showed that the evolution of the macroeconomy had reduced the risks facing the convergence of inflation to 3% in the policy horizon.",
        "The economic recovery was consolidating, inflation expectations at two years remained at 3%, while at shorter terms had risen due to the direct impact of the oil price hike on the more volatile elements of the CPI basket.",
        "In the baseline scenario, the trajectory of core inflation had not changed much and would reach 3% by the end of 2019, although headline inflation would do so sooner than expected.",
        "This, in a context where activity had been a little above expectations in the first quarter of the year, due to (probably transitory) surprises in supply sectors and stronger dynamism in areas relating to investment and durable consumption.",
        "However, beyond some narrowing, capacity gaps still persisted, as suggested by the evolution of labor market, core inflation and capacity utilization indicators.",
        "In the baseline scenario, the closing of these gaps would consolidate at a speed not very different from that expected in March.",
        "This also considered that the impulse that the Chilean economy would receive from abroad would be slightly milder than assumed in the previous Report, because of somewhat less favorable financial conditions and some decline in the terms of trade due to the higher oil price.",
        "In this context, the Board had held the MPR at 2.5%, and reaffirmed that it would begin to withdraw the monetary impulse insofar as macroeconomic conditions continued to drive inflation to converge to 3%.",
        "In discussing this background, all the participants agreed that the risks to inflation’s convergence had decreased, as could be observed in the Report’s baseline scenario projections and conjunctural analysis.",
        "In this regard, it was mentioned that in recent months the process of economic rebound that had begun in mid-2017, with activity levels that had advanced somewhat faster than expected, had been established.",
        "In this context, it was noted that the gradual closing of the capacity gaps caused by this acceleration, as had the reversal of the trajectory of the nominal exchange rate —which, with fluctuations, had been seen since the closing of the past Report— and the oil price increase, had significantly reduced the risks that the low current inflation would hinder the convergence of inflation to the target within the policy horizon.",
        "About the evolution of activity, there was consensus among the participants that its recent evolution reduced the risks of insufficient traction to ensure the convergence of inflation to 3% within the policy horizon.",
        "However, several participants acknowledged their concern about how consolidated and selfsustainable this improved economic performance was.",
        "It was mentioned, for example, that some high-frequency data pointed to a good performance of investment and consumption, such as imports, but at the same time other data, more closely associated with construction, had a rather mixed nature.",
        "It was also noted that the evolution of the labor market and of core inflation, especially in its non-tradable component, were rather consistent with a scenario where significant capacity gaps remained, which was endorsed in one way or another by more qualitative evidence in the Business Perceptions Report and by largerscale investment plans that had not varied much in recent months.",
        "There was debate around how much certainty there was about the lower risks for the convergence of inflation, considering that there were still doubts about the sustainability of the economic recovery.",
        "About this, it was mentioned that although the process of closing gaps was far from over, it had been settling with increasing clarity, coupled with the fact that the vision of inflationary weakness that permeated part of the market was clearly retreating, as could be inferred from the surveys and the different asset prices.",
        "It was noted that the effect of the higher oil price on the short-term inflation projections, without being negligible, was not a big factor in this risk assessment.",
        "It was mentioned that the reduction of risks could also lean on the inflation acceleration observed lately.",
        "All five Board members agreed that, given the current economic conditions (as detailed in the Report’s baseline scenario), the convergence of inflation to 3% in the usual policy horizon was consistent with a monetary stimulus remaining near its present levels at least for the rest of the year, as indicated in the latest Financial Brokers Survey, and that would begin to be reduced towards its neutral levels as macroeconomic conditions continued to drive the convergence of inflation towards 3%.",
        "All the Board members thought that the option of increasing the monetary impulse had become less relevant.",
        "In previous meetings, this option had been justified mainly under a risk management argument to lower inflation that could affect its convergence to the goal in the policy horizon.",
        "In line with the Monetary Policy Report, as these risks had decreased significantly, it was only logical for the option’s importance to follow suit.",
        "However, some Board members considered that the option to lower the rate could still be relevant to the extent that the risks associated with the external scenario materialized.",
        "One Board member pointed out that the option to lower the MPR should be included because CPI and CPIEFE inflation were on the edge of or outside the tolerance range.",
        "At the same time, the option to raise it had to be included if an important increase was anticipated in either, the CPI or the CPIEFE, even if it responded to movements in the most volatile components of the basket.",
        "The main arguments in favor and against of each of these options were the following: are herein referred to as males, including female member Ms. Rosanna Costa.",
        "All the Board members agreed that this option was fully consistent with the baseline scenario in the June Monetary Policy Report and, in particular, with the monetary policy strategy outlined in it.",
        "A further argument was the tight anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations to the policy target and agents’ expectations for the monetary policy decision on this occasion.",
        "In addition, it provided room for a timely reaction in case some of the risk scenarios came true.",
        "In any case, the risks for inflation were perceived as unbiased, as the costs of inflation deviating above or below its convergence trajectory were assumed to be symmetrical.",
        "Several Board members noted that choosing an option like this one depended on whether it was considered necessary to start the process of normalizing the monetary stimulus sooner.",
        "In this regard, it was mentioned that it seemed premature, considering that the Report’s baseline scenario assumed that investment, while growing more than expected in March, had begun strengthening only recently, with some mixed signs from construction and waiting for the process to be consolidated at the level of large-scale projects.",
        "Because of the direct impact on demand and activity, it was necessary to wait and see the evolution of the cycle before deciding on a monetary policy option such as this one.",
        "It was also pointed out that such an option would be justified if there was certainty that the economic recovery was to be clearly faster, longer lasting, more persistent, plus it was pushing inflation upwards.",
        "But now it was still too early to be certain about the form this recovery would take in the coming quarters, so deciding on how and when to withdraw the monetary stimulus required one or two more quarters’ worth of information.",
        "It was mentioned that although it was true that the economy was outperforming estimates, it should also be kept in mind that this occurred in a context where no greater cost-push or price-pull pressures were discernible, which could be consistent with greater than estimated gaps in the economy.",
        "This, in addition, coincided with the labor market showing no improvement and with some capacity use indicators at low levels.",
        "Finally, it was also mentioned that a movement in this direction would be completely unexpected and would give an unwarranted sign of urgency regarding the concern about upward deviations of inflation, much less now that CPIEFE inflation had not even reached 2%.",
        "It was said that this option was losing strength in a scenario in which, since the last Meeting, there had been only positive surprises on the activity side, tinged in part by its transitory components, and a positive price shock in the shortest term due to the oil price increase.",
        "It was said too that this option was easy to rule out because the recovery was perceived to be more solid, and although the creation of salaried jobs was yet to pick up, this did not seem to be an impediment to the recovery.",
        "It was pointed out that if the MPR had not been reduced two or three quarters ago, lowering it now would be inexplicable, since the risks that justified it had diminished significantly.",
        "It was mentioned that this option could continue to be valid if it was thought that the risks came from the effects of the external scenario on activity and inflation.",
        "For example, if the international scenario deteriorated further, as had happened in the past, an additional monetary push could be required, due to its medium-term disinflationary impact.",
        "However, taking an insurance based on such justification would also be difficult to explain.",
        "The Board decided, with the votes of Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Costa and Naudon, to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%.",
        "The international scenario was still characterized by the volatility and risk aversion of financial markets, coinciding with the markets' perception that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would speed up its monetary normalization process more than expected, in a context where the divergence between the cyclical state of the US economy and the rest of the developed world had deepened.",
        "Regarding the unfolding of the trade conflict, tensions had tended to focus on the US-China exchange, while there had been a favorable evolution of those among other countries within the framework of new trade agreements.",
        "Worth noting was the reduction of import tariffs by China to other trading partners, and the new agreement signed by the US, Canada and Mexico.",
        "The negotiations around Brexit and the fixing of Italy's fiscal budget had generated uncertainty in the markets.",
        "In this scenario, long-term interest rates had risen in most countries, especially in the US.",
        "This had triggered episodes of risk aversion with the consequent reshuffling of investment portfolios.",
        "Thus, the more risky assets, including stock markets, had had significant reversions, while capital continued to flow out of the emerging economies.",
        "The widening of the divergence between the cyclical position of the US economy and the rest of the developed countries could be seen in various indicators.",
        "On the one hand, while GDP growth figures remained dynamic in the US, they had adjusted slightly downwards in the Eurozone, with a widespread moderation in all the bloc's economies.",
        "On the other hand, the more conjunctural activity figures showed that this divergence continued, especially in short-term expectations.",
        "The surveys to purchasing managers (PMI) pointed to significant disparity in manufacturing and services that anticipated a favorable performance in the US and some moderation in the Eurozone, but with activity growth still above potential.",
        "In Japan, the manufacturing and services outlook had also moderated, although it remained above the pivot of expansion.",
        "All this was consistent with the inflationary pressures affecting each one.",
        "Thus, annual core inflation in the US continued to stand at or above 2%, depending on how the measurement, while in the Eurozone it had dropped to somewhat less than 1% and near 0% annually in Japan.",
        "In this scenario, the Fed had once again raised the benchmark rate at its September meeting with prospects that, without new developments, it would continue to advance in the monetary normalization.",
        "However, the authority's statement had put on the table the possibility that monetary policy could become contractionary in the policy horizon.",
        "Thus, the market internalized that the Fed could go faster than previously expected, which pushed the long-term rates up.",
        "Monetary policy and its outlook in the rest of the developed world had seen no major changes.",
        "In this environment, current Chinese activity indicators continued to show some slowdown.",
        "Authorities had taken further measures to boost activity, such as reducing the bank's reserve requirement.",
        "In Latin America, Argentina had reached a new agreement with the IMF that had helped to calm the markets, while in Brazil there was a better mood in the markets especially after the outcome of the first presidential round.",
        "In Mexico, the aforementioned trade agreement with its northern neighbors had toned down the uncertainty of previous months.",
        "The price of most commodities, although with significant fluctuations, had risen since the September meeting.",
        "The copper price had risen about 5% since then, driven by Chinese imports that showed more dynamism in September while inventories continued to show some depletion in the margin.",
        "The price of Brent and WTI oil had risen by around 4% and 1%, respectively, mainly due to supply disruptions in important producer countries.",
        "In the local financial system, the high volatility of the trajectory of the Chilean peso stood out, ranging between CLP 655 and 700 per dollar, to settle at CLP 670 at the time of the meeting, fairly unchanged from the previous instance.",
        "The multilateral measures had shown a similar evolution, with an MER appreciation of 0.5%.",
        "Thus, the real exchange rate (RER, index 1986 = 100) had reached 93.4 in September and it was estimated that, considering the information available, it had approached 91.8 so far in October.",
        "The stock market (IPSA) measured in pesos had also seen significant fluctuations in recent weeks, dropping around 2% since the previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "In the local fixed-income market, interest rates had risen across the board, although the increase in shorter-term rates stood out, in line with the increase in MPR expectations since the last meeting: close to 55 and 40 bp for BCP2 and BCU2, respectively.",
        "Meanwhile, the longer-term rates had risen less than their external counterparts, in a context in which the local risk indicators remained contained.",
        "Domestic credit continued to be characterized by low interest rates and limited real growth in loans, except for the commercial portfolio that showed greater dynamism.",
        "The Bank Credit Survey for the third quarter of 2018 indicated supply conditions with some minor restrictions in lending to households (consumer and housing) and big companies.",
        "Meanwhile, demand was perceived to be stronger in the different segments, especially in households, big companies and real estate.",
        "The market's expectations about the trajectory of the monetary policy rate (MPR) —from surveys to specialists and prices of financial assets— suggested that the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus would begin some time during the fourth quarter of the year, although with some divergence on the exact moment it would happen.",
        "During the policy horizon, the different measures had revised upwards the expected MPR level.",
        "For this meeting they placed it between 3.25% and 3.75% at twelve months (between 3.0% and 3.25% in September), while two years ahead they placed it between 4.0% and 4.25% (between 3.5 and 4% in September).",
        "About domestic activity, figures known after the latest Monetary Policy Report depicted an economy that was expanding at a somewhat slower pace than anticipated.",
        "In the July-August period, the mining Imacec had shown a decline in annual terms (-3.6% average), associated with specific elements in some works, although the evolution of the other sectors (3.9% annual average) was consistent with the baseline scenario of September as well as with the average of private expectations (as per the Economic Expectations Survey, EES) for that period.",
        "As in previous months, the performance of several investment-related lines continued to stand out, such as business services and wholesale trade.",
        "In this context, the outlook for GDP growth (EES) for this year had not changed since the close of the September Report (4%).",
        "For the 2019-2020 period they had some changes, but all consistent with the projections in the current baseline scenario.",
        "Regarding domestic demand, investment in machinery and equipment continued to lead the increase in spending, with imports of capital goods showing new highs.",
        "In the construction and works component, some indicators showed a certain acceleration in the margin, especially in the production of building materials.",
        "Business expectations (IMCE) remained in positive terrain, with improvements in all areas.",
        "Private consumption of durable goods continued to stand out for its high dynamism.",
        "As had been the trend previously, this was based especially on the behavior of the automotive segment, whose sales growth was still among its highest in recent years.",
        "In the labor market, the review of the group of information sources —including not only surveys, but also administrative records and qualitative information compiled for the Business Perceptions Report, among others— pointed to a bounded dynamism of employment and salaries, but stronger than suggested by the traditional surveys.",
        "Consumer confidence (IPEC) showed some decline in the second half of the year so far and was slightly below the neutral threshold.",
        "All in all, expectations about the economic situation of households one year ahead are still positive.",
        "The opinions gathered in the framework of the Business Perceptions Report (IPN) confirmed a rebound of the economy, whose performance in many cases surpassed that of the previous year.",
        "In any case, most of the respondents revealed that their total results were worse than expected, mainly blaming the difficulty to adjust prices in the face of strong competition, and in certain areas and/or regions a persistent reluctance in the customers' spending decisions.",
        "Investment plans were somewhat more dynamic in a greater number of economic sectors.",
        "Regarding the labor market, again those surveyed did not intend to make changes in their staff in the near future, with wage pressures that were still generally contained, backed by increased migratory inflows for certain types of jobs according to the respondents' visions.",
        "In terms of costs, without being a matter of great concern, the mention of the higher fuel prices appeared as a novelty in the conversations.",
        "And there was no great concern about the recent exchange rate movements in the opinion of many respondents.",
        "In the financial area, several banks surveyed reported less stringent lending conditions, reiterating also the low interest rate levels in place.",
        "They added that the operations aimed at restructuring the financial burden of customers continued to dominate.",
        "September's inflation had been 0.3% monthly, slightly below the forecast in the last Report and market expectations.",
        "In annual terms, headline inflation had risen to 3.1%.",
        "By components, the annual change in energy prices had risen to 11%, in particular because of higher fuel prices in pesos, a price increase at the global level and the depreciation of the peso.",
        "The price of fruits and vegetables had posted an annual variation of 12%, mainly explained by a low base of comparison because of an unusual seasonal behavior in September 2017.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation —CPIEFE— had also risen, to 2.1% annually.",
        "By components, the CPIEFE for services had risen to 3.4% annually, while for goods it had remained unchanged.",
        "The outlook for inflation remained similar to that in the baseline scenario in the September Report, because although inflation had been slightly below the forecast, it had been partly affected by one-off occurrences, such as lower food inflation.",
        "In this context, private expectations for inflation had remained around 3% one and two years ahead.",
        "As of December of this year, the prospects derived from inflation insurance had dropped to 2.9% (3.1% at the September meeting), while those derived from the EES were at 3.0% (2.9% at the previous meeting).",
        "There was agreement among the participants that the incoming figures since the publication of the September Monetary Policy Report were consistent with the baseline scenario in it and with the monetary policy orientation communicated at the time.",
        "On the external front, it was noted that the main piece of news was related to the reinforcement of a scenario where the United States diverged from other developed economies, and market expectations now indicated a faster adjustment of monetary policy in the US.",
        "It was also pointed out that the risks around the trade tensions were being circumscribed to the United States and China, and that since the last meeting, market prospects seemed to improve in this sense, as reflected in the higher commodity prices.",
        "Meanwhile, concerns about Europe had resurfaced, both because of Brexit-related difficulties and because of greater political uncertainty in the region.",
        "It was pointed out that in recent weeks the external scenario seemed less adverse for the emerging world.",
        "The latest developments had been more about volatilities in specific countries dealing with idiosyncratic issues rather than a negative shock on the emerging economies as a bloc.",
        "This did not prevent the persistence of high degrees of uncertainty, which would also remain for a long time.",
        "For this reason, there was coincidence that, rather than postponing monetary policy decisions pending the eventual dissipation of threats, the wise thing to do was to remain alert to the unfolding of events and be prepared to respond to the materialization of risks, especially those that involved a contractionary shock on the Chilean economy.",
        "About the local economy, it was noted that the evolution of non-mining GDP had been in line with the projections in the last Report.",
        "That had not been the case with mining GDP, which had been unexpectedly low, but this had to do with specific, non-cyclical factors.",
        "Moreover, it was said, the deceleration of GDP growth, total and non-mining, and its velocity was part of the projections, not only since September, but since several Monetary Policy Reports.",
        "On the demand side, investment was still dynamic, which was consistent with growth in imports in machinery and equipment and, furthermore, was corroborated by the change of tone in the preliminary interviews for the Business Perceptions Report.",
        "It was added that, although this greater investment was offset by slightly lower consumption growth, it allowed to have more confidence on the growth trajectory projected for 2019 and 2020.",
        "Regarding inflation, it was noted that it had evolved as foreseen.",
        "This included the fact that the annual increase in some inflation measures was still low, but that, at the same time, its evolution reflected that the process of inflation recovery was proceeding according to plan, something that was particularly evident in those products that historically had been more closely associated with the evolution of activity.",
        "In the area of fiscal policy, it was mentioned that the proposed budget of the public sector for 2019, currently being discussed by the Congress, was consistent with the fiscal consolidation plan announced at the beginning of this Administration.",
        "For the same reason, the fiscal impulse that was deducted from the proposed budget was consistent with the assumptions in the September Report’s baseline scenario.",
        "Mention was made of the fact that both the assessment of the current state of the economy and its outlook continued to point to narrowing capacity gaps in recent quarters.",
        "Overall, the projections continued to indicate that the most reasonable thing was to assume an economy growing in line with the baseline scenario in the September Report, with headline and core inflation hovering around 3% in a few months' time.",
        "In addition, these projections were shared by the vast majority of market agents, as was visible, for example, in the Economic Expectations Survey (EES).",
        "It was pointed out that one of the factors that brought most uncertainty to the evaluation of the state of capacity gaps was the state of the labor market.",
        "In this regard, it was noted that in recent months a thorough review of all available information on the behavior of the labor market had been carried out, concluding that, in terms of both employment and compensations, it had performed somewhat better than suggested by the traditional surveys.",
        "In particular, the data from administrative records, the analysis of the magnitude and impact of immigration, the qualitative information of the Business Perceptions Report and the review of data collection methodologies and expansion of the sample results, shaped a scenario where the labor market had been able to absorb a supply shock from immigration, in which wage growth could have been partially contained by a greater labor supply and in which the wage bill had grown as expected.",
        "All this was consistent with the expansion of private consumption and with capacity gaps that would allow inflation to adjust gradually.",
        "All the Board members agreed that the analysis of the new information made available since the last monetary policy meeting —and the publication of the Monetary Policy Report— were consistent with the projections in the baseline scenario and supported the orientation of the monetary policy that had been communicated in September.",
        "Therefore, the need to start the gradual process of monetary stimulus withdrawal was ratified.",
        "It was said that the economy already accumulated four quarters of growth above potential, which, beyond the doubts about its exact magnitude, had been consolidating a process of reducing the activity gap.",
        "This was reflected in the behavior of the CPIEFE for services, which had accelerated visibly since the beginning of the year.",
        "In addition, the prospects for greater dynamism of investment and a strong expansion of private consumption suggested that this process would continue in the coming months.",
        "In turn, the analysis of a broad set of information on the labor market, reduced the doubts about the evaluation of the state of the gaps in the labor market.",
        "All the above meant that a timely start of the monetary normalization process was an expression of the progress made by the Chilean economy in the last year and not the response to an imminent inflationary problem.",
        "All five Board members agreed that, in the absence of reasons to modify the diagnosis contained in the September Report on the prospects for inflation and its medium-term fundamentals, tactical elements could be considered to help define the precise moment to begin the monetary normalization process.",
        "On this, it was noted that, beyond the reservations that part of the market or analysts might have about the decision to normalize the MPR, the available data, plus the analysis and the published statement, led to the conclusion that starting normalizing the monetary policy was absolutely consistent with the current macroeconomic scenario and inflation perspectives.",
        "In any case, it was added, the growth prospects synthesized in the EES were fairly aligned with the baseline scenario in the Report, which was of the first order for the achievement of the inflation target.",
        "For this reason, they said, it was not strange that the focus was placed rather at the most appropriate time to start the process of withdrawal of the monetary stimulus and the differences were concentrated in periods very close to each other.",
        "The main argument in favor of this option was its total consistency with the evaluation made after the publication of the Monetary Policy Report and with the fact that the baseline scenario in it was still fully valid.",
        "In this sense, initiating the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus at this meeting favored a more gradual convergence to the neutral rate, which bought more time to consider the necessary pauses and flexibility that might be required later on.",
        "Also, that the current expansionary stance of monetary policy —between 150 and 200 basis points below the neutral rate— was high considering that the economy had been growing for several quarters above potential and inflation was heading towards 3%.",
        "It was also essential to bear in mind the importance of consistency between the actions of central banks and their narrative as a fundamental element to enhance the credibility of monetary policy.",
        "At the previous Meeting, the decision to hold the MPR constant had been based essentially on tactical elements —in particular, not to take the market by surprise— rather than on macroeconomic elements associated with the baseline scenario.",
        "Likewise, on that occasion it was reported that if there were no significant variations in the macro scenario, it would be appropriate to start the process of monetary normalization relatively quickly, which was understood as doing it at this meeting or, at the most, at the next.",
        "Raising the MPR at this meeting was consistent with the previous statement, since the current analysis did not point to mayor deviations from the macroeconomic scenario, to which it was added that an important fraction of the market had internalized the message that the MPR would be raised sooner than had been expected until early September.",
        "Opposing this option, it could be argued that an increase in the MPR at this meeting could be over-interpreted by the market and cause an excessive steepening of the curve, causing a monetary policy bias markedly more contractionary than the Board considered reasonable.",
        "Although this risk was always present, especially after a long period with a flat rate, it was important to draw a line between the decision to start the normalization process and its subsequent velocity.",
        "For this reason it had to be communicated that the future process of moving the MPR would probably include pauses and would have a gradual pace that, as always, would be calibrated according to the evolution of the macro cycle and inflation.",
        "The main argument for this option was the persistence of the risks and the need to collect more information on their evolution before proceeding with the MPR normalization process.",
        "However, especially abroad, its materialization remained diffuse and it seemed unlikely that waiting a little longer would bring greater clarity in this regard.",
        "Rather it seemed that these risk scenarios would accompany monetary policy decisions for a long time.",
        "Moreover, should a change in the orientation of monetary policy be required, the Board would have the usual flexibility to communicate a different situation effectively and opportunely.",
        "The Board decided, with the votes of Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial and Board members García, Costa and Naudon, to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 2.75%.",
        "The international scenario relevant for the Chilean economy remained favorable, with downward-biased risks on domestic activity, consistently with projections in the March Monetary Policy Report.",
        "Some risks, such as protectionist measures, geopolitical conflicts and potential changes in the interest rate trajectories in the developed world, had gained some visibility, causing some disruptions in the financial markets.",
        "The outlook for activity had stabilized above the values of the previous year, beyond the fact that, with some nuances, optimism had moderated during the first months of the year, especially in the developed economies.",
        "However, in the US, first-quarter GDP growth had exceeded expectations and slowed down compared to the quarter before.",
        "The positive performance of investment and the deceleration of consumption stood out.",
        "Expenditure fundamentals remained strong with high levels of confidence and a robust labor market.",
        "First-quarter GDP growth in the Eurozone also slowed down from the quarter before, in line with market forecasts and activity indicators that had lately been unexpectedly low in general.",
        "Similar developments were seen in the United Kingdom, although in this case they had been partly due to weather conditions.",
        "In the emerging world, China’s first-quarter GDP had remained as strong as the previous quarter and the mixed marginal numbers had continued to support the deceleration and rebalancing of activity foreseen for the next quarters.",
        "In Latin America, activity indicators were still mixed.",
        "Regarding inflation, in the developed economies the gradual increase in the US headline and core inflation indicators—near or above the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) target—contrasted with the more moderate and below central bank target figures of the Eurozone and Japan.",
        "In the Eurozone and the United Kingdom, recent inflation rates had fallen short of market forecasts.",
        "The Central Bank of Japan, in its latest statement, had ceased to mention that inflation would reach the target in 2019.",
        "Thus, the market outlook pointed to a larger divergence with respect to the future path that monetary policy in the US would follow compared with other developed economies.",
        "In any case, these central banks continued to signal a gradual withdrawal of their expansionary monetary policy stances.",
        "In the emerging economies, China had given mixed signals of monetary conduct by marginally raising its repo rate while reducing the banking reserve requirement.",
        "In Latin America, low inflation in most countries and price pressures that led to additional moderation provided some leeway for additional monetary easing.",
        "In fact, the Central Bank of Colombia had reduced its benchmark rate by 25 basis points (bp).",
        "Conversely, the Argentinean authority had decided to raise the monetary policy rate in two exceptional meetings by 300 bp each time.",
        "Global financial conditions were still good by historic standards in most economies, because despite the aforementioned tensions coming from geopolitical frictions and additional protectionist measures, volatility had returned to its levels of the last Meeting, while risk premiums remained contained.",
        "In this context, stock market indexes rose slightly further in most countries.",
        "Long-term interest rates posted mixed movements across economies.",
        "Parities showed an appreciated US dollar around the world in the few days before this Meeting.",
        "Capital inflows to emerging economies had moderated in recent weeks.",
        "Commodity prices moved primarily up.",
        "The Brent–WTI average oil price had risen by 10% since the March Meeting, owing mainly to the geopolitical conflicts.",
        "Still, futures continued to show the transitory nature of the rise, because the easy entry of oil producers in the US shaped a downsloping trajectory going forward.",
        "The copper price, with ups and downs, remained near its levels of the last Meeting, coinciding with positive news of Chinese imports and increased inventories in the reference markets.",
        "In the local financial market, long-term interest rates were near those prevailing at the time of the previous meeting, both in pesos and in UFs.",
        "The stock indices had risen, favored by companies’ better results, in the midst of risk premiums that continued to be low historically.",
        "In the two weeks prior to the Meeting, the Chilean peso had depreciated against the US dollar by close to 4%, following the trends of global markets.",
        "In any case, since the previous Meeting, the Chilean peso had shown a slight depreciation with respect to the dollar, contrasting with the appreciations of similar magnitude exhibited by other multilateral measures in the period.",
        "The real exchange rate (RER), using the 1986=100 base measurement, was estimated to have approached 89 in April and in the first days of May, a level similar to those of the previous Meeting.",
        "About domestic credit, the Bank Credit Survey of the first quarter 2018 had reported a strengthened demand in various segments—especially for consumer loans and commercial credit to big and real-estate companies—, together with marginal improvements in the supply of consumer and commercial loans for large companies.",
        "The cost of credit was still low, with declines in the interest rates on consumer and commercial loans that responded largely to seasonal and composition effects of these portfolios, while mortgage credit had been virtually unchanged.",
        "Credit growth was still bounded, with a mortgage segment that, aside from a slight decline recently, had continued to outperform the other portfolios.",
        "The increase in the commercial segment reflected a one-off operation.",
        "The different measures of expectations for the monetary policy rate (MPR) i.e.",
        "surveys and financial asset prices, anticipated no change at this Meeting.",
        "Furthermore, they foresaw that the first 25 bp upward adjustment would take place between the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first of 2019, which for the prices of financial assets and the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) meant a one-quarter deferral of said movement compared to estimates at the previous Meeting.",
        "All in all, the different expectations indicators still considered that the MPR would reach 3.5% at the end of the policy horizon.",
        "The activity and demand data received after the publication of the March Report was consistent with the baseline scenario described therein.",
        "The Imacec had grown by 4% annually in February (3.5% in January), somewhat less than reflected in the March EES and the expectations contained in the Bloomberg survey—between 0.2 and 0.5 percentage points (pp).",
        "First-quarter GDP growth stemmed to a large extent from mining, influenced by a low annual comparison base.",
        "All the other sectors maintained the better performance achieved in the latter months of 2017, where the increased contribution of several investmentrelated lines stood out, such as entrepreneurial services or some wholesale trade categories.",
        "In this scenario, the April EES showed no substantive changes in the activity growth expected for this year and next, the two somewhat above 3.5%.",
        "There were no major developments regarding the evolution of domestic demand components or most of its fundamentals.",
        "On the consumer side, the sale of durable goods, again led by automobile sales, kept performing more favorably than non-durables, whose imports were dynamic nonetheless.",
        "This, amidst levels of consumer confidence (IPEC) in optimistic territory.",
        "However, the labor market outlook deserved attention, due to the limited momentum that private salaried employment continued to show together with slow wage growth, which in both nominal and real terms remained below historical averages at February (spliced with base 2016=100).",
        "This could affect both the increase in the wage bill, which in the first quarter of the year had been somewhat above 3% in real annual terms (4% annual average in the second half of 2017), and consumption.",
        "Indicators of investment in construction and other works continued to point to a bounded recovery in the immediate future, such as various building and real estate indexes.",
        "The March survey of the Capital Goods Corporation reported a cut in the investment forecast for this year, mainly due to the postponement of projects (energy and public works), where everything in the 2018-2021 period adjusted upwards.",
        "About machinery and equipment, imports of capital goods excluding uncommon transport vehicles, maintained the improved performance of earlier months, which had begun to be reflected in some related branches of trade.",
        "The expectations of companies (IMCE) of April remained in optimistic ground on aggregate.",
        "The Business Perceptions Report continued to show positive expectations for this year according to the bulk of opinions, especially towards the second half, beyond the disparity of businesses’ actual results.",
        "Investment prospects had also improved.",
        "About the labor market, respondents generally mentioned no major immediate changes in their staff, and they shared their perception of low wage-related pressures.",
        "This latter factor was attributed to the weak performance of the last few years, which had decelerated wage growth and often led to freeze compensations during some quarters.",
        "The presence of immigrants had also helped to contain wage pressures according to some respondents.",
        "As for local credit, it was worth noting the low levels of interest rates, the favorable lending standards for lower-risk borrowers and the increase in applications for new credits.",
        "March inflation had been 0.2%, slightly below market expectations (by around one tenth of a point).",
        "This result was mainly explained by the positive impact of core inflation—CPIEFE—for services, which had contributed 0.34 pp to headline inflation.",
        "The CPIEFE for goods continued to reflect the peso appreciation of recent months.",
        "Thus, in March it had fallen again, with a negative impact of 0.1 pp.",
        "As for the most volatile components, fresh fruits and vegetables had had a total impact on headline inflation, as did energy, while fuels contributed negatively (–0.07pp).",
        "In annual terms, inflation had fallen to 1.8% and the core index had remained at 1.6%.",
        "Its evolution, as had been the trend of recent quarters, was still driven by the aforementioned appreciation of the peso, the current capacity gaps and the indexation to lower inflation rates.",
        "In this context, inflation expectations showed no big change.",
        "If anything, they had increased slightly one year ahead, between one and two tenths of a point.",
        "Thus, one year ahead, inflation insurances and the April EES had adjusted up to 2.6% and 2.7%, respectively, while the latest Financial Brokers Survey before the May Meeting continued to forecast a 2%.",
        "Inflation expectations two years ahead remained between 2.8% and 3%.",
        "For April, the market estimated that inflation would stand between 0.1% and 0.2%.",
        "All the participants in the Meeting agreed that the economy, both externally and internally, had behaved within the framework depicted in the baseline scenario of the last Monetary Policy Report, although risks remained and had even varied on some fronts.",
        "On the external scenario, the discussion centered on the implications of recent developments, concluding that it was ever more evident that the risks in this area had a clearly negative bias on domestic activity.",
        "For example, the inflationary outlook in the United States was discussed, together with how an increase could lead to faster interest rate hikes in the US, affecting global financial conditions.",
        "In this regard, there were comments on the appreciation of the dollar in international markets, arguing that this movement might have to do with the mentioned expectations that the Federal Reserve could accelerate the process of rate hikes.",
        "One participant added that he believed that the main risk continued to be that of a lack of coordination between monetary and fiscal policy in the United States that could be resolved in a disorderly manner, culminating in an overheated economy with excessive credit expansion.",
        "He added that this had been known to happen in the past and its consequences were not positive for either the developed or the emerging economies.",
        "There was also a discussion on how the stronger dollar had affected more intensively the currencies of emerging economies with some particular vulnerabilities.",
        "The case of Turkey was noted due to its high current-account deficit; the case of Brazil due to the difficulties it has endured in regaining higher growth rates; and that of Argentina and its problems with high inflation.",
        "One participant commented that Chile was clearly not in any of those categories.",
        "Other participants also said that the Bank had always considered the risk that an increase in interest rates in developed economies could have disruptive effects on financial conditions facing emerging economies; therefore, the current events should come as no surprise.",
        "It was pointed out that the important thing was not the origin of the disruptions in the financial markets, but to analyze the way in which it could affect financing conditions in Chile.",
        "On this matter, one participant noted that, in principle, the effect in Chile was quite evident: a depreciation of the peso, but a negative effect on activity.",
        "He recalled that in the past, shocks of this kind had generated a response of more—not less—expansionary monetary policy, despite the higher short-term inflation.",
        "This, because in the end the effects of lower activity on mediumterm inflation dominated and that was what determined the monetary policy decision.",
        "Therefore, if this risk had intensified somewhat in the recent past, the probability of a scenario where monetary policy was a little more expansionary than previously thought might have increased.",
        "Also noted was the surge of new geopolitical risks, more difficult to evaluate or anticipate.",
        "Trade issues between the United States and several of its major trading partners were mentioned, where tensions increased and decreased; the increases in oil prices due to conflicts in the Middle East, be it in Syria, Iran or any other state, also with agents that tended to be the same in each of these risks and interacted with each other.",
        "In the opinion of one participant, each and every one of these elements could trigger a scenario of global stress or unrest among the economic agents that would cause greater volatility or some discreet adjustment in market prices.",
        "One participant noted the risks posed by the oil price rise to an economy such as Chile, which is a net importer.",
        "Finally, the discussion turned to developments in Europe, a region that had shown some economic vigor, even more than expected, and whose latest results reflected some rather weak and less optimistic data, a situation that should be observed carefully to figure out how persistent this trend could be.",
        "On the domestic front, participants agreed that the figures for activity and inflation were not very different from expectations.",
        "The scenario in which the recovery of the economy would be more visible towards the second half of this year, leading to a gradual closing of the activity gap and sustaining the return of inflation to the target within the policy horizon was still valid.",
        "In this regard, one participant mentioned that it was important to note that, despite the good twelvemonth figures and the difficulty to interpret seasonally adjusted figures, activity remained weak, which was consistent with the meager creation of private salaried employment, low cost-side inflationary pressures and general information that had been collected for the Business Perceptions Report.",
        "Anyway, he added, the closing of gaps outlined in the last Report remained perfectly possible, because the conditions leading to it had not changed.",
        "Still, it was convenient to properly balance current data showing weak activity and a still negative output gap with a projected recovery, which showed that at the moment there was no need for a near-neutral policy rate, but rather for sustaining a monetary impulse at least as significant as the one projected in the Report.",
        "The discussion turned to the labor market, especially regarding the origin of the slowdown in wage growth and its consequences for activity and inflation.",
        "It was mentioned that there were several elements to be clarified on the matter, in particular how much of the deceleration in nominal wages could be blamed on supply-side factors and how much on demand-side ones.",
        "About supply, at least two events that were gaining importance were brought up, namely the increase in female participation—which in recent quarters had risen significantly, and faster than in the past—and immigration which, despite official figures, seemed to be having a greater weight in the work force.",
        "As for demand, attention was drawn to the technological adjustments and changes in productivity of recent years and how this would affect hiring once the economy more clearly recovered its near-potential growth rates.",
        "Several participants agreed that it was difficult to determine whether supply or demand factors were determining the evolution of the labor market, but the fact was that private salaried employment growth had been stagnant for some time, which made it difficult to attribute it only to immigration or female participation.",
        "They added that the sectors where one could assume greater participation of these groups were not those that showed the greatest changes in wage expansion.",
        "Moreover, the economy performing below potential was clearly consistent with a still weak labor demand.",
        "Therefore, it was possible that the deceleration of nominal wages was reflecting a labor market with greater gaps, signaling disinflationary forces somewhat more intense than expected, a situation that was complex considering that inflation was already low.",
        "It was said that it was important to try to figure out which factors were affecting the evolution of wages, because its effects on inflation looked different under the assumption that the biggest impact would be on costs or the wage mass.",
        "Even more so, when in the latter case the effect of a change in labor supply was the opposite of that of a change in labor demand.",
        "Therefore, it was complex to move the current dynamic of the labor market to the typical interpretation of the Phillips curve, which further complicated a good analysis of its implications on the evolution of inflation.",
        "It was agreed that the lower wage growth was a relevant issue at the current juncture, but the scope of the information should be clear, because what the National Statistics Institute (INE) data showed was a dramatic change in a very short time.",
        "Also, that other sources of information, delivered with lags, had still not shown such behavior, so it was necessary to wait for more data to become available.",
        "Several participants analyzed the fiscal situation.",
        "It was said that the announcements on fiscal policy and its implications on the structural balance that the Administration had to make within the first 90 days of its mandate were key to analyze the matter.",
        "The fact that the increasing participation of non-residents in the ownership of local bonds during the past year could end up having effects on the evolution of interest rates if the fiscal situation changed was also discussed.",
        "Based on this diagnosis, all the Board members considered that the monetary policy options analyzed in the previous Meeting were still valid.",
        "Consistent with this, they agreed that the relevant options were to either (1) keep the MPR at 2.5%, but communicating that the Bank was still concerned about the effect of downward deviations of inflation, or (2) lower the MPR by 25 bp to 2.25%, with a possible downward bias.",
        "The entire Board agreed that in a context where the baseline scenario of the March Report was coming true, this option allowed for an adequate monetary are herein referred to as males, including female member Ms. Rosanna Costa.",
        "impulse to assure convergence of inflation to the target within the policy horizon.",
        "Some Board members added that the news rather suggested that the policy rate would probably remain unchanged for longer than previously thought.",
        "Finally, participants agreed that given market expectations and recent actions of the Central Bank, this option had no communicational risks, something that would strengthen monetary policy predictability, helping the effectiveness and efficiency of decisions in this matter.",
        "All the Board members noted that in favor of this option was the fact that it limited the risks about the convergence of inflation described in the last Monetary Policy Report, which were still fully present.",
        "In particular, in a context where inflation was low —and was expected to linger for a while— and activity remained weak—as the negative output gap reflected—, the risks in the convergence of inflation were still present and, therefore, preventive actions should be analyzed.",
        "According to one Board member, on this occasion the option had more weight and validity because the news of lower short-term inflation came despite the fact that the economy had been growing more strongly for some quarters.",
        "Some members added that doubts about the evolution of wages were also an antecedent that enhanced the validity of this option.",
        "Again they all agreed that the main element against this option was the difficulty of communicating it.",
        "Particularly, this option implied a change of criterion compared to the latest decisions of the Board, which in similar situations had decided that it was not necessary to take preventive actions to mitigate risks to inflation convergence and had signaled that the current monetary impulse was adequate.",
        "In line with this, almost any market agent anticipated a rate cut.",
        "One Board member added that in the time elapsed between the Monetary Policy Report and the March Meeting there had been no accumulation of elements that significantly changed the baseline scenario outlined therein, so that mediumterm projections continued to point to a convergence of inflation to the target within the policy horizon.",
        "It was added that just as there were factors that pulled inflation down, such as the wage deceleration, there were others that could raise it, such as a faster closing of the gaps, with a greater dynamism of investment and the recent rise in the exchange rate.",
        "The Board decided, with the votes of Governor Marcel, and Board members Vial, García, Costa and Naudon, to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%.",
        "The information presented to the Board and analysis thereof was that contained in the March Monetary Policy Report.",
        "Primarily, it showed that growth in activity had increased in recent months, particularly in the non-mining sectors.",
        "The revision of National Accounts data showed that growth in the non-mining sectors had recovered its dynamism in the second half of 2017, after a slow start of the year.",
        "With this, 2017’s growth had been —on average— fairly as expected, but with a composition that provided a better starting point for 2018, which was relevant in the revision of the growth forecast for the current year.",
        "On the external front, the momentum driving the Chilean economy had consolidated above expectations, with favorable financial conditions, world growth that would outpace earlier years and commodity prices that had persisted above year-ago levels.",
        "Early February figures had revealed a period of greater volatility, with decreases in the prices of risky assets and higher global uncertainty.",
        "However, this period had been of short duration and its effects had not been very persistent.",
        "Domestically, during the last few months inflation had behaved in line with expectations, remaining near 2%.",
        "Still, in the projections of the new baseline scenario, the convergence of inflation to 3% would take longer than had been thought in December, given the additional appreciation of the peso in recent months.",
        "Toward 2019 and 2020, these projections assumed that inflation would accelerate, largely because the economy would close the activity gap gradually and steadily.",
        "This considered that, on average, the economy would grow above potential during the period 2018-2020.",
        "Regarding monetary policy, the Board had kept the monetary policy rate (MPR) at 2.5% for several months and, in the baseline scenario, estimated that it would keep the monetary stimulus near its current levels and would begin to reduce it conditional on macroeconomic conditions consolidating the convergence of inflation toward 3%.",
        "During the discussion of these antecedents, several participants referred to the external economy, pointing out that the observed price adjustments associated with better perspectives in the developed world did not alter the scenario relevant for Chile.",
        "Some participants stressed that the better than expected global figures were drawing more attention to some downside risks, especially in the financial markets.",
        "One participant underscored the risks derived from a more expansionary fiscal policy in the US, when there were already symptoms of the gaps closing which, together with augmenting the external deficit, could add inflationary pressures.",
        "He also highlighted, due to their medium- and long-term implications, the risks associated with protectionist measures adopted by the US.",
        "About the evolution of inflation and its fundamentals, the participants noted that inflation had remained on the expected trajectory for several months and soon it would be on a lower trajectory driven by the effects of the recent appreciation of the peso.",
        "All the participants emphasized that headline inflation was still low, as was core inflation, so there was a risk that inflation could stay low for longer than expected.",
        "Some participants added that while there was some degree of surprise about the pace of the economic recovery, the estimates of the current size of the gap and the evaluation of its implications for inflationary pressures were not very different from December’s scenario.",
        "If this was coupled with a still relatively appreciated real exchange rate, it became clear that the risks for inflation were still present.",
        "One participant stressed that, in any case, the incorporation of higher growth into economic expectations had been undermining the arguments for an additional appreciation of the peso.",
        "In fact, in the weeks leading up to this Meeting it had rather experienced a depreciation.",
        "All the participants noted that the recent and expected economic performance and its effects on the closing of the activity gap reduced the risks for inflation.",
        "Thus, they pointed out that after two years, the growth forecasts indicated that there the gap would close, helping inflation’s convergence to the target with the current MPR.",
        "It was said that, actually, the inflation expectations reflected in longer-term market prices had changed very little in response to the peso’s most recent appreciation.",
        "It was also noted that these perspectives for activity relied on a consolidated recovery of investment, more dynamic exports and consumption remaining strong, all of it supported by favorable financial conditions.",
        "One participant drew attention to the risks coming from the labor market.",
        "He mentioned that although the employment figures had tended to improve in the margin beyond the sectoral composition, nominal wages had continued, to some extent, growing at pretty low rates, which reduced the upward pressure on prices and was a factor to take into consideration in future decisions.",
        "All the Board members agreed that, given the current economic conditions (depicted in the baseline scenario of the March Monetary Policy Report), the convergence of inflation to 3% in the usual horizon was consistent with keeping an expansionary monetary policy, in line with what several expectations surveys indicated.",
        "This was, keeping the MPR at its current level during this year and a gradual normalization towards neutral levels thereafter.",
        "Some Board members considered that the option to increase the monetary stimulus was still valid, in a context where inflation was expected to remain below the target for a long time and where the activity gap remained negative.",
        "Especially because even though the risk for inflation’s convergence was clearly smaller, it had not disappeared.",
        "The main arguments in favor and against each of these options were: All the Board members agreed that this option was consistent with the March Report’s baseline scenario, particularly with the monetary policy strategy described therein.",
        "For this reason, and because of its alignment with market expectations for the macroeconomic outlook of the coming months, it was an option that ensured credibility and effectiveness.",
        "Furthermore, it provided space for a timely reaction if faced with some of the most likely risk scenarios.",
        "Some Board members noted that this option would be justified from a risk management perspective, especially as long as core inflation remained below the tolerance range and low inflation rates were expected for a significant period of time.",
        "However, they agreed that it was very complex to explain this are herein referred to as males, including female member Ms. Rosanna Costa.",
        "kind of decision considering the developments in the macroeconomic scenario.",
        "In particular, because inflation had not experienced additional downside shocks, such as new appreciations of the peso.",
        "Also because the medium-term projections pointed clearly to inflation converging to the target within the policy horizon, with smaller downside risks.",
        "In addition, considering developments of the macroeconomic scenario, it was highly probable that the decision to cut the MPR would have to be reversed in the short term, thus eroding its effectiveness and making it even more difficult and confusing to justify.",
        "The Board decided, with the votes of Governor Marcel and Board members Vial, García and Costa, to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%.",
        "The information submitted to the Board and analysis thereof make up the content of the September Monetary Policy Report.",
        "Overall, indicators received over the year reflected more-than-expected economic growth and showed that inflation had consolidated its prospects of converging to the target.",
        "This, in a context of positive surprises in several economic sectors, an upward revision to potential growth and a faster closing of the activity gap.",
        "Regarding inflation, the annual CPI variation had risen to 2.7%, but its CPIEFE —CPI excluding food and energy prices— counterpart was still below 2%, both in line with expectations.",
        "The risks of the external scenario had become more present.",
        "The US-China trade conflict had intensified, which, coupled with the cyclical state of the US economy and its difference from that of other developed economies, had caused a global appreciation of the dollar and a fall in commodity prices.",
        "All this was having a stronger impact on those emerging economies seen as more vulnerable.",
        "However, for the moment, global growth projections had had limited changes.",
        "About the domestic scenario, there was agreement that for several months there had been a number of positive surprises in activity, which were already occurring in more sectors and expenditure components, reflecting a stronger economy.",
        "Also, the increase in potential GDP showed that the higher growth was not only the effect of a cyclical upturn, but also represented a more structural behavior.",
        "It was also noted that although July's activity data has seen a slowdown, it was fully consistent with the baseline scenario of the September Report, which assumed that, in line with the exhaustion of capacity gaps, growth rates would begin to moderate in the second half of the year.",
        "Moreover, y-o-y variation figures would decrease as the low basis of comparison of last year faded out.",
        "There was debate about the evolution of the labor market, noting that the better understanding of some key variables had allowed dissipating many doubts about its strength.",
        "Although it had always been argued that the recovery of employment should follow activity growth with some lag, only recently had there been incipient increases in private salaried employment that had been spreading to various sectors, while self-employment decelerated at the same time.",
        "Meanwhile, a more in-depth review of the impact of immigration on the labor market showed that, in principle, in the last two to three years many more jobs had been created than was indicated by the surveys, whose designs did not allow to properly capture demographic changes of such magnitude.",
        "In addition, although compensation indicators pointed to an unusual deceleration of wages, the Social Security administrative records did not support that vision.",
        "About the evolution of inflation, there was agreement that there had been no significant surprises, and that the increase in CPI inflation was an anticipated development that owed mainly to the evolution of the more volatile prices, since the CPIEFE was still below or near 2%.",
        "It was noted that the evolution of inflation was consistent with the gradual closing of gaps in the economy and that going forward the gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus needed restructuring in proper balance with the closing of these capacities.",
        "It was also pointed out that beyond the variations of the CPI in the short term or the temporary boost that the exchange rate could cause, the focus was rather on the outlook for inflation within the policy horizon, its relationship with the activity gaps and the necessary reaction of monetary policy.",
        "In this sense, the projections pointed to a faster convergence of inflation, both headline and core, to the policy target, which came from a point where core inflation was still below 2%.",
        "On the international economy, although the baseline scenario contained limited downward revisions to growth in the world economy and our trading partners, it was agreed that the risks associated with the external situation had increased significantly, becoming the main source of uncertainty.",
        "It was pointed out that the worsening of the economic outlook was more pronounced for emerging economies, particularly because the perception of risk had increased and those countries perceived as most vulnerable had suffered massive capital outflows.",
        "In this context, the peso had depreciated, albeit less than the average of emerging countries, despite a sharp adjustment in the copper price.",
        "The importance not to downplay the magnitude of external risks was also stressed, especially in the case of emerging countries.",
        "Today they were more significant, concrete and complementary than they seemed a few months back.",
        "All five Board members agreed that both the analysis contained in the September Report and incoming data after its statistical cutoff date indicated that the evolution of macroeconomic conditions, and the convergence of inflation to 3% in the usual horizon, made it less necessary to maintain the current monetary stimulus.",
        "Given the medium-term implications of this scenario, the Board opined that the monetary stimulus should begin to be reduced in the coming months and that by 2020 it would stand around its neutral level, which was estimated between 4% and 4.5%.",
        "The monetary policy decision was taken in a context where the accumulation of new data, its analysis and medium-term implications advised starting the process of monetary normalization as soon as possible.",
        "In fact, in the context of a strengthened economy, as time passed it was becoming more costly to delay starting said process.",
        "On the other hand, although the evolution of the external scenario caused some concern, it was important to draw a line between the baseline scenario and its implications for monetary policy decisions and the risk factors.",
        "These were two elements that unfortunately tended to be often confused in the public discussion and that affected the perceptions of the situation and economic perspectives.",
        "In short, in the presence of a recovering economy that was growing above trend, with gaps that tended to close, and inflation that would converge to 3% earlier than expected, it was logical to communicate that the MPR had to begin an upward path.",
        "are herein referred to as males, including female member Ms. Rosanna Costa.",
        "The main argument for this option was that the evolution of macroeconomic conditions and their immediate prospects were sufficient to push inflation to 3%, which warranted beginning the monetary policy rate normalization shortly.",
        "Moreover, delaying it for too long would force to compress the adjustment process into a shorter time span, leaving less space for taking pauses in the process, which could be helpful in decanting information.",
        "In addition, the current scenario —of above trend growth and inflation nearing the target— was a quite different picture than last year's, when the economy was growing below the trend and inflation was clearly below 3%.",
        "Therefore, the MPR, in one and the other circumstance, obviously had to be different.",
        "The main argument against this option was that raising the MPR at this Meeting would be unexpected and, consequently, confusing, opposing the desirable practices of a duly informed and anticipated policy.",
        "Although the market could always be surprised, this entailed some costs and, therefore, doing so required good reasons.",
        "At the same time, for the adjustment to be effective, it was important that its foundation and opportunity be clear to the market.",
        "In that sense, there were elements that interfered in that understanding.",
        "First, an important gap between the diagnosis contained in the Report that would be disclosed the next day and the current market perceptions, which take some time to be assimilated.",
        "Second, a recent exchange rate escalation that could blur the meaning of an MPR increase and inflation fundamentals to which the Board assigned greater importance to make its decisions.",
        "Third, core inflation still below 2% that could raise doubts about the immediate need for an adjustment.",
        "Upon the release of the Monetary Policy Report, all the economic agents would be in a better position to assess the situation and understand the adjustments that were required in the monetary impulse.",
        "The main argument in favor was that holding the MPR and communicating that the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus would begin in the coming months avoided upsetting the market, which could convey a sense of haste or delay in the normalization process that was not consistent with the analysis presented in the Report.",
        "Instead, it was said that the evolution of macroeconomic conditions pointed clearly to the need for a gradual withdrawal of the monetary stimulus.",
        "This would indicate that, as long as conditions didn’t change, there was increasing probability that the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus would begin sooner.",
        "It could also be argued that the option to keep the MPR unchanged would allow collecting additional high-frequency information prior to taking this first step.",
        "However, this argument seemed weaker, beyond certain recent news that the market had read in an adverse way.",
        "The option would always be present to pause and wait for more background data to enhance the diagnosis.",
        "However, domestic risks were limited today while external risks would remain there for a longer period of time.",
        "The Board decided, with the votes of Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial, and Board members García, Costa and Naudon, to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%.",
        "After the publication of the Monetary Policy Report in June, the main developments had concentrated on the international scene.",
        "The materialization of US tariff increases on Chinese imports, the consequent reprisals of China and statements about this situation, had intensified the risks associated with a commercial conflict, triggering some movements in the global financial markets.",
        "This has also been fueled by the more noticeable discrepancy in performance across developed countries.",
        "Although the world growth outlook had not changed substantially, the strengthening of the United States stood out, to the detriment of the cyclical position of the other developed economies.",
        "The US showed narrowing gaps, with investment and consumption fundamentals that remained solid, especially because of a seemingly tighter labor market.",
        "Meanwhile, some short-term indicators continued to perform below expectations in the Eurozone—although levels were consistent with a recovery of the economy’s growth pace—, while in Japan they pointed to weaker activity.",
        "In emerging economies, China’s GDP growth had slowed marginally in the second quarter, while other conjunctural data suggested a somewhat sharper slowdown, although in line with the rebalancing proposed by its authorities.",
        "In Latin America, the deterioration of Brazil’s growth outlook, where monthly activity had surprised to the downside — influenced in part by a truckers’ strike— stood out and business confidence continued to worsen.",
        "In Mexico, at the statistical cutoff date, the proposals announced by the newly-elected government generated uncertainty at the fiscal level, while the expansion projections for Argentina had been cut due to the narrowing of monetary conditions, beyond the positive surprise from first-quarter GDP.",
        "Inflation in the developed world showed advances, largely associated with the higher energy prices.",
        "Nonetheless, US figures differed from those of other developed countries, in line with discrepancies in terms of activity, with increases in both headline and core measures.",
        "In the rest of these economies, the total figures had shown mixed movements, although core inflation remained contained or exhibited some moderation in the margin.",
        "Accordingly, monetary policies continued to increase their divergence from the US, reinforcing the worldwide appreciation of the US dollar.",
        "In its June policy meeting, the Federal Reserve had widened the range for the fed funds rate to 1.75-2% and adjusted upward its forecasts for 2018 and 2019.",
        "The European Central Bank announced the end of the asset purchase program and confirmed that it would hold the rates unchanged until at least mid-2019.",
        "The Bank of England was using a more contractionary tone, while Japan confirmed it would maintain the stimulus measures.",
        "In the emerging world, various indicators suggested that the Chinese authority could further relax monetary conditions.",
        "In Latin America, with some exceptions, several countries showed increased inflation, although no big changes in monetary policy in the margin.",
        "The global financial markets had been affected in part by intensified trade tensions in the weeks leading up to the Meeting.",
        "The currencies of emerging and commodity- exporting economies showed depreciations against the US dollar, with a significant weakening of the Yuan.",
        "In this context, long-term interest rates in developed economies had fallen across the board, risk premiums remained contained and volatility indexes, after a temporary rise, were back to mid-June levels.",
        "The stock markets exhibited mixed returns, where the fall in certain emerging economies was worth noting, in the midst of continuous capital outflows from some of these countries.",
        "Since the previous Meeting, the price of most commodities had decreased, especially copper with a near 15% drop.",
        "This responded largely to trade tensions and the appreciation of the dollar, in a context in which China’s activity figures had been weaker at the margin.",
        "Regarding the price of a barrel of oil, WTI and Brent showed opposite movements (of the order of +5.8 and -3.4%, respectively), significantly reducing the spread between the two.",
        "The movements of the former coincided with inventory reductions in the US, while in the latter they were mainly due to supply-side factors, including the markets’ reaction to OPEC announcements.",
        "In local financial markets, the depreciation of the peso stood out, close to 4.5% since the June Meeting, standing at around $ 660 per dollar, in line with the fall in the copper price and the global appreciation of the dollar.",
        "Among the multilateral measures, the MER-5 showed a slightly lower rise than the exchange rate, while the MER and MER-X showed more limited movements.",
        "The real exchange rate (RER) base 1986 = 100, had stood at 90.4 in June and, with the information at hand, estimates placed it near 91.6 in July.",
        "The stock market (IPSA) was coupled with the international trend and had declined in both peso and dollar terms.",
        "The interest rates of the fixed income market had remained relatively stable, especially the ten-year peso rates, contrasting with the decreases recorded in most economies.",
        "The local risk premiums had changed little from the previous Meeting and remained low from a historical perspective.",
        "Regarding domestic credit, market interest rates were still low and real credit growth remained limited, with a rise in the commercial segment in recent months, due to greater loans in installments.",
        "On the other hand, housing loans continued to show a downward trend.",
        "The Bank Lending Survey for the second quarter of 2018 had reported a somewhat stronger demand in the consumer segments and for large companies, SMEs and real-estate firms, as well as slightly less restrictive supply conditions for mortgage loans and big-size companies.",
        "Expectations for the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) taken from the surveys —of Economic Expectations (EES) and Financial Brokers (FBS)— and implicit in the prices of financial assets, projected that the rate would not be changed at this Meeting.",
        "The first MPR increase was expected to occur towards the end of 2018, which in the case of the July EES meant it would be sooner than thought at the previous Meeting.",
        "One year ahead, the different measures showed no big changes.",
        "At two years, the EES continued to place the MPR at 3.5%.",
        "For its part, the FBS placed the rate at 25bp higher than in the previous meeting, at 3.75%, while the prices of financial assets placed it somewhat below 4%.",
        "About local activity, the data known since the release of the June Monetary Policy Report were somewhat higher than implicit in the Report’s baseline scenario.",
        "The Imacec had risen 4.9% annually in May, more than a substantial fraction of the market was expecting (4.2% and 4% per year according to the June EES and the median of the Bloomberg survey, respectively).",
        "In any case, the sectoral panorama was not very different from the one discussed at the previous meeting, and the better performance of several investment-related lines stood out, both in the goods trade —especially wholesale— entrepreneurial services and manufacturing industry.",
        "Some data suggested that the greater dynamism of these items seemed to be mainly concentrated in mining.",
        "In this context, the outlook for growth (EES) for this year continued to be revised upwards (4% in July, 3.8% in June), while for the next two years they had changed little and stood at 3.8%.",
        "On the domestic demand side, investment was still driven mainly by the machinery and equipment component, as reflected in the persistently high levels of capital goods imports.",
        "In construction and other works, various indicators for both housing and non-housing building, showed limited dynamism at the margin.",
        "Also, business expectations in the construction sector (IMCE) at June had become more pessimistic, but other sectors remained optimistic.",
        "About consumption, durables maintained a better performance than nondurables, despite some moderation in recent data, including automobile sales —which in any case were still growing at double-digit annual rates.",
        "The fundamentals of consumption, in general, showed a similar behavior to that of previous months.",
        "The labor market continued to lag behind output development.",
        "The creation of private salaried employment continued to be quite weak, while the public component showed some moderation at the margin.",
        "Salaries (INE), nominal and real, continued to grow below their historical averages.",
        "At the same time, consumer confidence (IPEC) at June was still in optimistic territory.",
        "The information collected in the framework of the Business Perceptions Report continued to show positive prospects going forward, although with effective results that, according to the majority of respondents, were somewhat lower than was expected in recent months.",
        "There was growing concern about the economic effects of the trade war between the US and its trading partners.",
        "The mining and salmon sectors stood out among the most dynamic according to respondents’ opinions, in contrast to the weakness that was noted in the trade sector.",
        "About private investment, the generality had mentioned that its plans were oriented to the replacement of depreciated capital, as well as to the improvement and / or automation of processes, but there were no large projects in the pipeline.",
        "On public investment, the views were not optimistic.",
        "The perception of the labor market pointed to a stagnation of employment and wage pressures that remained contained.",
        "In several regions, the substantial supply of labor was worth noting, supported by the presence of foreign labor.",
        "In terms of costs and prices there were no major changes.",
        "In the financial sector, some improvements in supply and demand conditions were reported.",
        "Monthly inflation had been 0.1% in June, in line with market expectations.",
        "In annual terms, it had risen to 2.5%, explained largely by price increases in the most volatile items in the basket.",
        "In particular, the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables had risen 9.6% in June, explained largely by a low base of comparison and unusual seasonal behavior in June of 2017.",
        "The price of energy had risen 6.1% annually, due to the increase in fuel prices in pesos.",
        "Core inflation excluding foods and energy —CPIEFE— had increased, standing at 1.9% in June.",
        "By components, annual Inflation of goods had gone from -0.6% in May to -0.3% in June, while the annual services inflation EFE had increased from 3.0% to 3.2 in the same period.",
        "In this context, inflation expectations showed no big changes.",
        "At December of this year they had remained between 2.8% and 2.9% per year.",
        "At one year, expectations had increased slightly and were between 3.0% and 3.1%.",
        "At two years, they remained around 3.0%.",
        "There was debate around the evolution of the international scenario and its risks, which in the opinion of several participants were not only present, but also seemed to have accentuated.",
        "It was noted that the scenario was still favorable in terms of global growth and financial conditions, however significant changes had been observed in commodity prices and exchange rates.",
        "Although this latter risk was nothing new, it presented different dimensions that were not necessarily independent of each other.",
        "On the one hand, there was a dissociation between the evolution of the US economy —which remained more dynamic than other developed countries— and that of the Eurozone —which showed some marginal normalization of its growth rates.",
        "This ensured that the conditions for a strengthened dollar remained.",
        "On the other hand, there were still risks associated with an inherently complex monetary normalization process.",
        "These had increased considering that the markets were more sensitive to changes in the perception of how monetary policy would be calibrated over time and also because of the vulnerability of some economies and/or their exposure to some degree of contagion.",
        "This was more important as complexities and new tensions were added, such as a pro-cyclical fiscal policy in the United States.",
        "In that already complex environment, there was also the threat of a more far-reaching trade war that affected the United States and China the most.",
        "This had resulted in a devaluation of the Chinese currency, of other emerging and commodity exporting countries, and a fall in commodity prices.",
        "Although effective advances in this area were limited, the risk of persistent stress had effects on financial channels, as well as on expectations, that altered investment decisions.",
        "Of course, a tighter restrictions on trade had effects on productivity too.",
        "Several participants commented on the slope of the US yield curve, whose levels compared with 2007.",
        "This because this phenomenon is usually seen as a signal anticipating a recession in that economy.",
        "However, it was pointed out that given the quantitative stimulus policies still present, it was perhaps more indicative to analyze the spreads in the shortest part of the curve, even more so considering that the investment of the yield curve contrasted with other sources of information, such as the stock market.",
        "It was also pointed out that probably the US economy was already at a turning point in its cycle and it was difficult for it to continue to see such positive figures going forward.",
        "However, this did not imply that, in case of a sharper increase in inflation, the Federal Reserve would abstain from advancing its monetary normalization process.",
        "Regarding the local economy, the state of capacity gaps was discussed, in particular the different signals that could be seen by observing the evolution of activity, the different components of demand and the evolution of cost and price pressures.",
        "On the one hand, there was agreement among participants that the latest data confirmed greater than projected growth in 2018.",
        "This stronger dynamism was seen particularly in sectors related to investment in machinery and equipment, including trade and financial and entrepreneurial services, and in durable consumption.",
        "However, it was stressed that there were doubts about what were the implications of this greater activity in terms of inflationary pressures.",
        "Based on complementary information, it was estimated that the increase in investment responded rather to a demand for replacing outdated machinery than to new and/or projects that increased production capacity.",
        "In fact, construction activity was on a path with no big surprises.",
        "Thus, one challenge was to see whether the surprise in activity and demand —mainly investment— was focused on some tradable sectors, particularly mining.",
        "If so, the expected impact on the rest of the economy would be more limited.",
        "It was also said that the revisions that were being made to the growth forecasts could be pointing rather to the economic cycle process occurring sooner and not necessarily deepening or accelerating.",
        "Therefore, it was possible that the economy could grow above trend and potential growth for a while, followed by a smoothing of the cycle.",
        "Plus, despite a rise in projected inflation, this was mainly due to the evolution of the exchange rate —not activity—, which was desirable in order to accommodate the changes in the macroeconomic environment.",
        "It was mentioned that, in any case, it should be clear that the analysis continued to indicate that the economy would grow at a pace consistent with trend growth and the gradual closure of the existing gaps, after several years of slow growth, but that for now it was not possible to infer from the better indicators observed that this process could differ significantly from the estimates in the most recent Reports.",
        "In addition, local confidence levels gave grounds for thinking that the private sector would continue pushing a normalization of demand and investment towards levels more aligned with their potential.",
        "Meanwhile, the behavior of the labor market suggested that there were still gaps in the economy, in particular because employment seemed to lag behind the business cycle.",
        "And there was little pressure from wages, while the Business Perceptions Report did not report any prospects of greater dynamism in hiring, and instead efforts to automate functions was cited.",
        "It was added that this evidence or feeling of capacity gaps in the labor market could be related, on the demand side, with a labor hoarding behavior on the part of companies, while, on the supply side, to the evolution of the labor supply and the participation of different components had been more dynamic than estimated, because, for example, of the strong contribution of immigrant workers.",
        "For the same reason, it was said that possibly wages had moderated growth beyond what the usual indexation patterns suggested.",
        "In any case, there was discussion about the difficulty of evaluating the current state of the labor market from sources of information that led to different interpretations.",
        "It was commented that some of them could have greater difficulties to capture the potential effects of immigration, stressing the importance of complementing the information of surveys with administrative data.",
        "All five Board members agreed that the macroeconomic scenario was well aligned with the baseline scenario of the June Report.",
        "This scenario considered that the MPR would begin to return to a more neutral stance between the end of this are herein referred to as males, including female member Ms. Rosanna Costa.",
        "year and the turn of the next, so the dynamic of this normalization process had to be outlined.",
        "They all agreed that the option to boost the monetary stimulus was no longer relevant, since the downside risks to the convergence of inflation —which had been a topic of concern in recent quarters— had lost strength.",
        "It was added that the option to lower the rate could not be warranted by the changes in the external scenario, because although it was undeniable that it had become more risky, the current conditions were still favorable.",
        "Thus, all the Board members agreed that the relevant options were to (i) keep the MPR at 2.5%; and (ii) start at this Meeting the process normalizing the MPR.",
        "All the Board members agreed that this option was totally consistent with the baseline scenario in the June Monetary Policy Report and, in particular, with the monetary policy strategy outlined there.",
        "In favor of this option, it was mentioned that although short-term inflation was higher than expected, it was mainly due to exchange rate depreciation and higher fuel prices, which in turn —particularly for the depreciation— could be related to the worsened outlook for the external scenario, in a context of a greater risk of a trade war and overheating of the US economy, in circumstances that the Chinese economy had shown signs of further weakening.",
        "In this framework, it was said that the greater local activity was associated more with transitory factors, which would have little impact on medium-term inflation, a diagnosis that was compatible with the evolution of prices, since there were no deviations or unexpected or unexplained inflationary pressures.",
        "In addition, the labor market continued to show slack.",
        "With this, it was mentioned that it would not be surprising to observe, during the second half of the year, lower-than-expected effective growth rates, reducing the probability of a more systematic acceleration of growth driven by investment.",
        "It was also noted that the external risks had implications for inflation and monetary policy in Chile that could differ in both the short and the long term.",
        "In particular, a worsening of trade conflicts and imbalances in the developed world, although they could put pressure on inflation through the exchange rate, on the other hand they could be contractionary for activity and inflationary pressures in the medium term.",
        "All the Board members noted that taking this option would be right only if it was considered necessary to anticipate the normalization process of the monetary stimulus with respect to forecasts in the last Report.",
        "The main argument was that the greater dynamism of activity and domestic demand could translate into a faster closing of the activity gap, causing additional inflationary pressures.",
        "This scenario could find support in the upward revisions to the growth and inflation forecasts.",
        "However, there was conflicting evidence about the size and evolution of capacity gaps.",
        "In that sense, the background data rather indicated that the economy was moving away from the period of cyclical weakness — characterized by slow growth and low inflationary pressures —and was moving towards one in which growth was more of a self-sustained nature and the risks of persistently low inflation were cleared.",
        "Finally, it was also mentioned that, although the decision to not change the MPR was the most appropriate at this Meeting, the risk of a more vigorous recovery of investment had been gaining strength, which, if materialized, could alter the way the process of MPR normalization would unfould.",
        "The Board decided, with the votes of Governor Marcel, Vice-Governor Vial, and Board members García, Costa and Naudon, to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%."
